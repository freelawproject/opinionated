Moulton, appeals from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of breach of the peace in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (3) and harassment in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (3). On appeal, the defendant claims that her conviction for harassment should be reversed because it was based on speech that did not constitute a true threat or intolerably invade a substantial privacy interest. In addition, she claims that her conviction of both crimes should be reversed because (1) the court improperly instructed the jury and (2) the evidence was insufficient to support her conviction. We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On February 4, 2006, the defendant placed a telephone call to the Salem Turnpike post office in Norwich. The defendant, a letter carrier, working out of the Salem Turnpike branch, was on leave from her job at that time. Deborah Magnant, the branch\u2019s supervisor of customer service, answered the telephone. Magnant recognized the caller\u2019s voice, and the caller identified herself as the defendant. Magnant testified that she had spoken with the caller over the telephone at least two other times over the previous four to five weeks and recognized the voice to be that of the defendant but had never met her. The defendant asked to speak to David Ravenelle, the postmaster, but Magnant told her that he was not working that day. The defendant then asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>to whom she was speaking, and Magnant identified herself. The defendant said: \u201cOh, I know you. I have talked to you before.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">At that point, the defendant started talking about when she would be returning to work, \u201c[a]nd then she said something about the shootings.\u201d Specifically, she said: \u201c[T]he shootings, you know, the shootings in California. I know why she did that. They are doing the same thing to me that they did to her, and I could do that, too.\u201d The defendant was referring to an incident that took place approximately five days prior when a postal employee in California shot and killed several postal workers inside the postal facility where she worked.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Magnant testified that the defendant\u2019s tone of voice was angry and agitated and that the statement about the shootings caused her alarm, so she began taking notes of the conversation. Magnant stated that the defendant continued to talk, \u201cjust sharing whatever was on her mind.\u201d She discussed her post-traumatic stress disorder and when she would be returning to work. She also asked for her union steward. The defendant seemed to be upset that she was out of work and talked about how her direct supervisor and the prior postmaster harassed and bullied her and how her supervisor was incompetent. The defendant also mentioned other postal employees by name. The call ended after the defendant told Magnant that she would be calling back on Monday, when she could speak to Ravenelle, and Magnant assured her that she would make sure that Ravenelle knew she would be calling.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">Magnant notified Ravenelle about the telephone call as soon as he arrived at work Monday morning, at approximately 6 a.m. Ravenelle contacted his supervisors and the postal inspection service, which acts as an internal police force for the postal service. Magnant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>spoke with postal inspectors that morning, who asked for her notes of the conversation and instructed her to call the local police. She contacted the police and filed an official report at that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The defendant was arrested and charged with breach of the peace in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (3)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and harassment in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>Atrial was held onDecem-ber 5, 2007, and the jury returned a verdict of guilty on both counts on that date. On January 29, 2008, the defendant was sentenced to six months incarceration, execution suspended, and two years probation on the breach of the peace charge; ninety days incarceration, execution suspended, and one year probation on the harassment charge, to be served consecutively. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">The defendant first claims that her conviction for harassment must be reversed because the application of the harassment statute, \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (3), to her telephone conversation implicated her first amendment rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She asserts that her conviction was an infringement of her freedom of speech because her words were constitutionally protected. According to the defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>the jury instructions allowed the jury to find her guilty based on speech that was not given first amendment scrutiny. We agree. We conclude that the statute on its face does not infringe on the defendant\u2019s freedom of speech. In the present case, however, the state concedes that it prosecuted the defendant for her speech alone and not for her conduct in making the telephone call. This is a misapplication of the statute, \u00a7 53-183 (a) (3), and we find nothing in the jury instructions that corrects this improper construction. Because the defendant was punished for the verbal content of her telephone call, the statute, \u00a7 53-183 (a) (3), was unconstitutional as applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">The defendant\u2019s claim is unpreserved, and she seeks review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The record is adequate for review, and the claim, asserting a violation of the defendant\u2019s right to freedom of speech, is of constitutional magnitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">\u201cIf an improper jury instruction is of constitutional magnitude, the burden is on the state to prove harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . When reviewing [a] challenged jury instruction . . . we must adhere to the well settled rule that a charge to the jury is to be considered in its entirety . . . and judged by its total effect rather than by its individual component parts. . . . [T]he test of a court\u2019s charge is . . . whether it fairly presents the case to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party. ... In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>this inquiry we focus on the substance of the charge rather than the form of what was said not only in light of the entire charge, but also within the context of the entire trial. . . . Moreover, as to unpreserved claims of constitutional error in jury instructions, we have stated that under the third prong of <em>Golding, </em>[a] defendant may prevail . . . only if ... it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>111 Conn. App. 337, 353-54, 958 A.2d 1271 (2008), cert. denied, 290 Conn. 903, 962 A.2d 794 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">The harassment statute was enacted for the purpose of thwarting the growing practice of using the telephone as a device to intrude upon others\u2019 privacy in a tormenting manner. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous (1978-4), </em>34 Conn. Sup. 689, 696, 389 A.2d 1270 (1978); <em>Gormley </em>v. <em>Director, Connecticut State Dept. of Probation, </em>632 F.2d 938, 940, 941-42 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1023, 101 S. Ct. 591, 66 L. Ed. 2d 485 (1980). The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has declared that \u201cby its express terms the statute may be violated where no conversation at all occurs.\u201d <em>Gormley </em>v. <em>Director, Connecticut State Dept. of Probation, </em>supra, 942. \u201cWhat is proscribed is the making of a telephone call, with the requisite intent and in the specified manner.\u201d Id., 941-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>55 Conn. App. 475, 481, 739 A.2d 714, cert. denied, 252 Conn. 908, 743 A.2d 619 (1999), this court unequivocally distinguished \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (3) as a statute that regulates conduct, not speech. This court upheld the conviction of the defendant in <em>Bell </em>for harassment in the second degree where the defendant had called employees of a social services program approximately forty-five times. Id., 476-77. After examining the language of \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (3), this court found that it prohibits the conduct of using the telephone as a device to \u201charass, annoy or alarm another person\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>but that the statute does not facially proscribe speech communicated via telephone. Id., 480-81. Any speech that may accompany such telephone calls is considered to be circumstantial evidence of the defendant\u2019s intent. <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewtan, </em>5 Conn. App. 79, 83, 497 A.2d 60 (1985). For example, a telephone call made at what would otherwise be an innocuous time, to someone the caller might normally call, may be harassing if what the caller said during the telephone call evinced his intention to harass through the actual ringing of the telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Therefore, it is the physical act of placing the call and causing a ringing at the receiving end, that constitutes the actus reus of the crime. This act is what the statute punishes under \u00a7 53-183 (a) (3) and not the language that may ensue in the subsequent telephone conversation. For those reasons, we agree with the court in <em>Bell </em>that \u00a7 53-183 (a) (3) is not unconstitutionally overbroad on its face. In the present case, however, the state prosecuted the defendant on the basis of her speech, not her conduct in making the telephone call, and, therefore, her conviction was based on an impermissible construction of \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (3), which implicated her first amendment rights. Accordingly, we conclude that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">During a telephone call to the post office, the defendant made the comment that she understood how a postal worker could become enraged and that she could \u201cdo that, too,\u201d in reference to recent killings by a postal worker in California. The state admits that it was this comment that was the basis for the charge of harassment. The state concedes, therefore, that the defendant was convicted on the basis of the verbal content of her telephone call and not the physical act of making the telephone call.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">The court instructed the jury that the defendant could be convicted on the harassment count only if the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>established beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant \u201cintended to annoy, alarm another person by <em>making a telephone call\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) This instruction, in conjunction with the state\u2019s theory of the case, effectively signified to the jury that it was permitted to construe the words the defendant used during the telephone call, as the \u201cmaking\u201d of the telephone call. This is not the correct interpretation of the statute. Rather, the making of the telephone call refers only to the ringing of the telephone and the frequency with which the defendant makes the call. This instruction, therefore, permitted the jury to find the defendant guilty of harassment on the basis of speech that was not given first amendment scrutiny, rather than on the basis of her conduct in making the call.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The state argues that it was \u201cuncontested and supported by overwhelming evidence\u201d; <em>Neder </em>v. <em>United States, </em>527 U.S. 1, 17, 119 S. Ct. 1827, 144 L. Ed. 2d 35 (1999); that the speech on which the defendant\u2019s conviction was based was a true threat,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that, therefore, the omission in the jury instructions was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the speech was obviously not protected by the first amendment. It was not the lack of \u201ctrue threat\u201d instructions to the jury, however, that caused the error. Rather, it was the construction of the statute by the state as one that punishes speech and the failure of the court to clarify the correct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>interpretation of \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (3) in the jury instructions. Without the proper clarification, the jury improperly was permitted to base its guilty verdict on the defendant\u2019s speech without giving it first amendment scrutiny. The jury should have been instructed to examine only whether the act of calling and causing the ringing of the telephone was harassing, and to look to the speech only for the intent in physically making the telephone call.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">After considering the actual act of calling, we find that the evidence does not support the jury\u2019s finding that the defendant intended her telephone call to the post office to be harassing. The defendant called the post office during business hours; she did not seek to contact Magnant personally. Further, the call was to the defendant\u2019s place of employment, rather than to Magnant\u2019s personal residence. The defendant\u2019s call, up to that point, was dissimilar to those normally serving as a foundation for a harassment charge.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> During the telephone conversation, in addition to the comment about the shootings in California, the defendant complained to Magnant about returning to work as a letter carrier and being bullied by postal supervisors. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>evidence does not fall so heavily in support of the argument that the telephone call itself was intended to be harassing that the improper jury instructions were harmless. We conclude that the court\u2019s improper instruction as to the statute with which the defendant was charged was harmful and that it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s conviction of harassment in the second degree cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly instructed the jury. Specifically, she claims that the court\u2019s instructions on both charges were incomplete and did not instruct the jury that in order to find her guilty, it had to find that the state had proven that her statements constituted a constitutionally punishable true threat. She also argues, in regard to the breach of the peace charge, that the instructions were defective because they included definitions of the terms annoy, alarm and inconvenience that were not in accordance with the judicial gloss previously given by this court and our Supreme Court to narrowly tailor the application of both the breach of the peace and harassment statutes. We agree with respect to the breach of the peace charge but disagree with respect to the harassment charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">The defendant did not submit a request to charge or take an exception to the charge given and again seeks review underrate v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. It \u201cis . . . constitutionally axiomatic that the jury be instructed on the essential elements of a crime charged.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Crudup, </em>81 Conn. App. 248, 256, 838 A.2d 1053, cert. denied, 268 Conn. 913, 845 A.2d 415 (2004). We will review this claim under the <em>Golding </em>doctrine because the record is adequate for review, and the claim that the jury was not instructed on an essential element of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>an offense is of constitutional magnitude. Furthermore, we agree that a constitutional violation clearly exists and deprived the defendant of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">As we explained previously, \u201c[w]here . . . the challenged jury instructions involve a constitutional right, the applicable standard of review is whether there is a reasonable possibility that the jury was misled in reaching its verdict.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Akande, </em>111 Conn. App. 596, 606, 960 A.2d 1045 (2008), cert. granted on other grounds, 290 Conn. 918, 966 A.2d 237 (2009). We examine the charges separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">We begin our analysis by setting forth the court\u2019s jury instructions with respect to the charge of breach of the peace. The court instructed the jury in relevant part: \u201cThe defendant is charged with breach of [the] peace in violation of \u00a7 53a-181 ... (a) (3) of the Penal Code, which provides as follows: A person is guilty of breach of [the] peace, when with intent to cause inconvenience, annoyance or alarm or recklessly creating] a risk thereof, she threatens to commit any crime against another person or his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">\u201cFor you to find the defendant guilty of this charge, the state must prove the defendant acted with the intent to cause inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm. Intent relates to a condition of the mind of the person who commits the act and his purpose in\u2014or her purpose in doing so. As defined by our statute, a person acts intentionally, quote, with respect to a result or conduct when their conscious objective is to cause such result or to engage in such conduct. What a person\u2019s puipose, intention or knowledge has been is usually a matter to be determined by inference. No person is able to testify that they looked into another\u2019s mind and saw therein a certain purpose or intention or certain knowledge to do harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>\u201cThe only way in which a jury can ordinarily determine what a person\u2019s purpose, intention or knowledge was at any given time, aside from that person\u2019s own statements or testimony, is by determining what that person\u2019s conduct was and what the circumstances were surrounding that conduct and from that infer what their purpose, intention or knowledge was. The predominant intent must be to cause what a reasonable person operating under contemporary circumstances would consider a disturbance or to a\u2014or an impediment of lawful society, a deep feeling of vexation or provocation or a feeling of anxiety prompted by the threat\u2014threatened danger or harm recklessly created a risk of causing inconvenience, annoyance and alarm.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">\u201cA person acts recklessly with respect to a result or to circumstances described by statute defining an offense when the defendant is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such result will occur or such circumstances exist. . . . The words inconvenience, annoyance, alarm refer to what a reasonable person operating under the contemporary community [standard] would consider to be a disturbance or to the impediment or of a lawful activity, a deep feeling of vexation or feeling of anxiety prompted by a\u2014threatened by a danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">\u201cThat might have been repeated, but I was rushing today. The next element the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that the defendant threatened to commit a crime against another person or their property. The state claims that the defendant threatened to commit the same crimes as in California against the Norwich post office. Threatened means declaring an intention or determination to injure another person or their property by the commission or of a threatened crime. A threatened\u2014a threat imparts the expectation of bodily harm to one\u2019s person or harm to one\u2019s property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>by the crime threatened, thereby inducing fear or apprehension.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">This court and our Supreme Court have recognized that judicial gloss is necessary in the context of a jury charge on the crime of breach of the peace in order to elucidate the concept of a true threat. \u201cTrue threats encompass those statements [when] the speaker means to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals. . . . The speaker need not actually intend to carry out the threat. Rather, a prohibition on true threats protects] individuals from the fear of violence and from the disruption that fear engenders, in addition to protecting people from the possibility that the threatened violence will occur. . . . <em>Virginia </em>v. <em>Black, </em>[538 U.S. 343, 358-60, 123 S. Ct. 1536, 155 L. Ed. 2d 535 (2003)].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>287 Conn. 237, 247-48, 947 A.2d 307, cert. denied, 555 U.S. 970, 129 S. Ct. 464, 172 L. Ed. 2d 328 (2008). \u201cIn the context of a threat of physical violence, [w]hether a particular statement may properly be considered to be a threat is governed by an objective standard\u2014whether a reasonable person would foresee that the statement would be interpreted by those to whom the maker communicates the statement as a serious expression of intent to harm or assault.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 249. \u201cAs a general matter, moreover, whether such expressive conduct represents a true threat is to be decided by the jury.\u201d Id., 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>DeLoreto, </em>265 Conn. 145, 166, 827 A.2d 671 (2003), the court explained that in the absence of judicial gloss interpreting the breach of the peace statute, \u00a7 53a-181, as applying only to true threats, there was a danger that the provision could be construed as overbroad, and, therefore, \u201csuch a gloss was necessary to save the statute from constitutional infirmity.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>supra, 287 Conn. 249. Likewise, this court, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Skidd, </em>104 Conn. App. 46, 932 A.2d 416 (2007), noted that <em>DeLoreto </em>\u201cacknowledged that in order for a threat to be prohibited by statute in Connecticut, that threat must rise to the level of a true threat . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Under the court\u2019s decision in <em>DeLoreto, </em>the defendant was entitled to an instruction that she could be convicted of the charge of breach of the peace only if her statements constituted a true threat, that is, a threat that would be viewed by a reasonable person as one that would be understood by the person against whom it was directed as a serious expression of an intent to harm or assault, and not as mere puffery, bluster, jest or hyperbole. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>supra, 287 Conn. 250. \u201cBecause the circumstances surrounding the alleged threat are critical to the determination of whether the threat is a true threat, the trial court also should have instructed the jury to consider the particular factual context in which the allegedly threatening conduct occurred . . . .\u201d Id. Considering the instructions as a whole, we conclude that there is a reasonable possibility that the jury was misled. Although the state contends that the omissions from the instructions were harmless, the court\u2019s instruction did not include the judicial gloss on the charges that is required by <em>DeLoreto, </em>and, as a result, the jury could have found the defendant guilty on the basis of conduct that did not rise to the level of a true threat. Had the jury been instructed properly, it is reasonably possible that it would have found that a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position would not have foreseen that her statements would be interpreted as a serious expression of an intent to harm but, rather, as mere banter, jest or exaggeration. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s conviction on the charge of breach of the peace cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">The defendant also claims that the court improperly instructed the jury as to the crime of harassment in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>second degree under \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (3). She specifically claims that the true thr eat judicial gloss described previously was constitutionally required to accompany the jury instructions because she was charged on the basis of the content of her speech, not on her act of making the telephone call, and the omission created a reasonable possibility that the jury was misled. We disagree. Although we agreed in part I of this opinion that \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (3) is unconstitutional as applied to the defendant, our reasoning is founded on the fact that the court improperly allowed the defendant\u2019s conviction to be based on her speech, rather than on her conduct. Therefore, we do not agree that the statute required the judicial gloss describing true threats because the speech should not have been the foundation of the conviction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">We next address the appropriate remedy to deal with the reversal of the defendant\u2019s breach of the peace and harassment conviction. We must determine whether the defendant is entitled to a new trial on the charges of breach of the peace and harassment or whether a judgment of acquittal should be entered. The defendant claims that the evidence was insufficient to support her conviction of both charges, and, therefore, a judgment of acquittal should be entered on both charges. We agree with respect to the harassment charge only and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>conclude that the defendant is, instead, entitled to a new trial on the breach of the peace charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">\u201cIt is well established that instructional impropriety constitutes trial error for which the appropriate remedy is a new trial, rather than a judgment of acquittal. As the United States Supreme Court observed in <em>Burks </em>v. <em>United States, </em>437 U.S. 1, 15, 98 S. Ct. 2141, 57 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1978), reversal for trial error, as distinguished from evidentiary insufficiency, does not constitute a decision to the effect that the government has failed to prove its case. As such, it implies nothing with respect to the guilt or innocence of the defendant. Rather, it is a determination that a defendant has been convicted through a judicial process which is defective in some fundamental respect, e.g., incorrect receipt or rejection of evidence, incorrect instructions, or prosecutorial misconduct. When this occurs, the accused has a strong interest in obtaining a fair readjudication of his guilt free from error, just as society maintains a valid concern for insuring that the guilty are punished.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>288 Conn. 418, 434-35, 953 A.2d 45 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Where the defendant\u2019s conviction is overturned because the evidence at trial was insufficient to support it, however, \u201c[t]he same cannot be said . . .

App. 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">In its prosecution of the case, the state focused on the defendant\u2019s use of the words, \u201cI could do that, too,\u201d referring to the California shootings. The state maintains that her use of these words was a comment made by a disgruntled and angry employee who harbored an intent to cause a feeling of anxiety prompted by threatening harm that \u201cequat[ed] herself with a murderous postal employee in California . . . .\u201d The defendant argues that she was simply angry about her treatment at work and that a reasonable person could not have foreseen that her statements would be interpreted by Magnant as a serious expression of an intent to harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">We conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position would have foreseen that the defendant\u2019s statements and actions would be interpreted by Magnant as a serious expression of an intent to harm. The defendant not only made reference to the incident in California where a disgruntled postal employee murdered several coworkers, but also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>expressed, in no uncertain terms, that she, too, could inflict such harm herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Neither party disputes that the defendant told Mag-nant, a fellow postal employee, \u201cI could do that, too.\u201d Magnant testified that the defendant\u2019s mention of the shootings prompted her to begin taking notes on the conversation \u201cbecause that was kind of a strange thing to say,\u201d and \u201cit alarmed [her] enough that [she] felt that [she] needed to document what was being said . . . .\u201d Magnant asked her to repeat what she had just said, and the defendant replied: \u201c[Y]es, the shootings in California. ... I know why [the postal employee] did that. They are doing the same thing to me that they did to her, and I could do that, too.\u201d Although the defendant contends that her words were ambiguous, there cannot be any dispute that in the course of venting her frustration about her employment with the United States Postal Service, she told Magnant that she understood how that employee felt and that she was equally capable of expressing her frustration by shooting, and possibly killing, her coworkers.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Magnant explicitly testified that the defendant\u2019s statement caused her alarm and that her tone of voice was both angry and agitated. The defendant had never worked with Magnant, although Magnant had spoken with her on the telephone often enough to recognize her voice, so Magnant did not know her well enough to be able to discern, in those few minutes, whether the defendant was joking or potentially was capable of carrying out this threat. Postal employees are understandably sensitive at being the target of such threats, serious or otherwise. A reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position should have foreseen that any potential threat against a fellow postal employee, particularly one who was not well acquainted with her, would have caused her to feel anxious. The fact that the defendant chose to air her grievances to, in effect, an anonymous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>postal employee instead of the persons about whom her complaints were directed is further proof of the depth of the potential instability of the defendant and further reason for there to be cause for alarm.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">We do not agree with the defendant\u2019s contention that if Magnant had concerns about the defendant, she immediately would have contacted the police. Such a requirement would set a higher bar than the statute mandates. We conclude that the jury reasonably could have concluded that the defendant had the predominant intent to cause a feeling of anxiety prompted by threatened danger or harm. Because we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to sustain her conviction on the breach of the peace charge, if a jury so finds, the defendant is entitled to a new trial on this charge based on the improper jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">The defendant also contends that the evidence was insufficient to convict her of the crime of harassment in the second degree under \u00a7 53a-183 (a).

We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">To prove the crime of harassment in the second degree, the state must show that the defendant, with the intent to harass, annoy or alarm another person, made a telephone call in a manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm. \u201cAlarm is defined as to strike with fear: fill with anxiety as to threatening danger or harm . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cummings, </em>46 Conn.

We distinguished the defendant\u2019s telephone call from those that normally support a conviction for harassment under \u00a7 53a-183 (a) in that it was a singular telephone call made generally to a place of business, dining business hours.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This alone does not carve the telephone call out of the activity proscribed by \u00a7 53a-183 (a). The jury could have used the defendant\u2019s speech to infer that she intended for the single telephone call to be harassing. Neither the defendant\u2019s complaints nor her reference to the California shootings, however, show that she thought that the ringing of her telephone call would disrupt the person responsible for answering telephones at the post office. She did not admit that she knew something that would make this otherwise innocuous call harassing; for example, that she knew that she was calling a private line at the post office and that the person on the other end would be significantly disrupted by the ringing. Nothing the defendant said shed light on how she thought the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>ringing of her telephone call would affect the recipient. This conclusion does not mean that we consider the defendant\u2019s words referencing the shooting in California to be insignificant but, rather, that these words do not support a finding that the defendant intended for her telephone call and the ringing it caused to be harassing. Accordingly, we conclude that the jury could not have reasonably found that the evidence was sufficient to prove that the defendant intended to harass or to annoy the victim when she made the telephone call.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial on the charge of breach of the peace in the second degree and with direction to render judgment of not guilty of the charge of harassment in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">In this opinion BEACH, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b356-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of breach of the peace in the second degree when, with intent to cause inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, such person ...

In part I of this opinion, we concluded that the court allowed the state to impermissibly apply the statute, \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (3), in a way that made its application unconstitutional because it punished speech. Therefore, rather than applying a judicial gloss to the statute, the court should clarify in its instructions that in regard to a violation of \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (3), the jury is only to determine whether the actual act of making the telephone call and causing it to ring was harassing, and to consider the defendant\u2019s subsequent speech only to infer her intent in making the call.

Section 53a-183 (a) (3), proscribes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>not speech but, rather, the conduct of making a telephone call.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is the physical act of placing the call that constitutes the actus reus of the crime; it is not the threatening or otherwise abusive language that is criminalized. The case law clearly states that the narrow construction regarding the proscribed conduct eliminates unconstitutional overbreadth because speech, protected or otherwise, is not proscribed. \u201cThe asserted overbreadth of the Connecticut statute is circumscribed by the elements of the offense it proscribes. To run afoul of the statute, a telephone call must be made not merely to communicate, but \u2018with intent to harass, annoy or alarm\u2019 and \u2018in a manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm.\u2019 Whether speech actually occurs is irrelevant, since the statute proscribes conduct, whether or not a conversation actually ensues.\u201d <em>Gormley </em>v. <em>Director, Connecticut State Dept. of Probation, </em>632 F.2d 938, 942 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1023, 101 S.

A narrowing instruction is constitutionally required in situations in which words themselves are subject to punishment; as the majority notes in part II B, there is no such requirement when it is the intrusive telephone call itself that is the subject of prosecution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In this instance, however, words are not punished, though they may provide circumstantial evidence of intent. There is not, then, an overbreadth problem that would allow, absent judicial narrowing, application to constitutionally protected activity.

This is one type of call where the statute may be violated. By its terms, the statute can also be violated when a conversation or speech ensues and that call is made in a manner likely to cause alarm. Section 53a-183 (a) (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>provides that one violates the statute when one with \u201cintent to harass, annoy or alarm another person . . . makes a telephone call, <em>whether or not a conversation ensues, </em>in a manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm.\u201d (Emphasis added.)

As our Supreme Court stated, \u201cin a prosecution seeking a conviction under \u00a7 53a-183, the fact finder may consider the language used in the communication in determining whether the state has proven the elements of the offense, namely, that the defendant intended to harass, annoy, or alarm and that he did so in a manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm.\u201d Id., 569.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>While I agree that without the threatening speech there could be no rational basis to consider this single telephone call to the postal office during business hours as harassment causing alarm, our law provides that threatening speech can be considered as to the alarming manner in which the call was made. Despite the threatening speech, the majority opinion concludes that the defendant\u2019s conviction for harassment cannot stand. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The majority opinion also concludes that there was insufficient evidence to find that the defendant intended to harass or to annoy the recipient of her telephone call. The record indicates, however, that the information charged the defendant with intending \u201cto harass, annoy, or <em>alarm </em>another person\u201d by making \u201ca telephone call ... in a manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">As the majority recognizes, with respect to the breach of the peace count, the defendant\u2019s intent may be inferred from her conduct. There was evidence that the call was answered by a coworker of the defendant at the Norwich post office. There also was evidence that five days before, a disgruntled postal worker entered her California post office and shot and killed a number of coworkers. I would conclude that a jury could reasonably find that the defendant did intend to alarm her listener when she stated, in an angry and agitated tone during the telephone call, that the defendant could \u201cdo that, too,\u201d because of her similar mistreatment by postal supervisors.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">The majority opinion also states that no judicial gloss defining the defendant\u2019s speech as a true threat is required because the harassment statute does not punish one for the contents of a telephone call but only for making a telephone call. In this case, the contents of the defendant\u2019s call could be viewed as a threat of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>violent and lethal harm to postal office coworkers. As such, if it is a true threat, the speech is not protected by the first amendment, and it could be punished. <em>State </em>v. Murphy, supra, 254 Conn. 568 n.13, citing <em>Mozzochi </em>v. Borden, 959 F.2d 1174, 1178 (2d Cir. 1992). I would hold that the defendant\u2019s statement must be a true threat or it could not constitutionally be punished without violating the first amendment to the United States constitution. As the majority implicitly recognizes as to the breach of the peace count, citing <em>State </em>v. <em>DeLoreto, </em>265 Conn. 145, 827 A.2d 671 (2003), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>287 Conn. 237, 249, 947 A.2d 307, cert. denied, 555 U.S. 970, 129 S. Ct. 464, 172 L. Ed. 2d 328 (2008), the right to complain about harassment and bullying by postal supervisors is protected by the first amendment. Also, as the majority points out, with respect to the breach of the peace count, the defendant\u2019s statement in this case could be construed as not being a true threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Judge Mansfield, in his concurring opinion in <em>Gormley v. Director, Connecticut State Dept. of Probation, </em>supra, 632 F.2d 943, found that the Connecticut harassment statute was not facially overbroad, if the Connecticut Supreme Court were to apply the statute only to speechless calls or to obscene or threatening calls to avoid penalizing anyone exercising first amendment free speech rights. His concurrence observed that if it were not so construed, the statute would clearly be void for overbreadth. Id., 943-44. I conclude that the conviction based on the jury\u2019s verdict, after the charge to the jury that did not require the defendant\u2019s statement to be a true threat, would be an overbroad application of the harassment statute. I would, therefore, conclude that the court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury that the defendant\u2019s statement must be a true threat would require a new trial as to the harassment count.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Because I do not agree with the majority that the evidence would not support a conviction for harassment in the second degree, I would order a new trial on that count.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">For the reasons given, I respectfully dissent from the order to enter a judgment of not guilty as to the harassment count.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
