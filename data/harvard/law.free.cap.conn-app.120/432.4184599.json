The plaintiff claims that the court improperly concluded that there was no genuine issue of material fact, thus entitling the defendant to judgment as a matter of law. We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-12\">Viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the pleadings, affidavits and other proof submitted set forth the following facts. At all relevant times, the defendant possessed and controlled the premises located at 89 Bridgeport Avenue in Shelton (premises). He routinely invited employees of Housatonic Security Services, Inc., including the plaintiff, to enter the premises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>to obtain weekly paychecks. On the morning of December 9, 2005, the plaintiff entered the premises to pick up his paycheck. While traversing the driveway therein, the plaintiff slipped and fell on an accumulation of ice, causing him to suffer physical injury, pain and anguish. Litigation followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">In his complaint, the plaintiff averred that the defendant had \u201cfailed to clear from the driveway ice and/or snow which was upon said driveway from precipitation which had fallen prior to December 9, 2005,\u201d which allegedly caused the plaintiffs injuries. The defendant thereafter filed a motion for summary judgment on January 16, 2008, alleging that there was no genuine issue of material fact and that he was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Specifically, the defendant claimed that (1) there was a snowstorm in progress at the time of the plaintiffs fall; (2) no unusual circumstances existed requiring the defendant to remove the snow prior to the plaintiffs fall; and (3) the driveway was clear of any ice when the snowstorm began. The plaintiff filed an opposition to the motion for summary judgment, and the court heard argument on the matter on March 17, 2008. In its April 28, 2008 memorandum of decision, the court rendered summary judgment in favor of the defendant, concluding that no genuine issue of material fact existed. The plaintiff subsequently moved to set aside that judgment and requested reargument, which the court denied. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The issue in this appeal is whether the court properly determined that no genuine issue of material fact existed. The plaintiffs primary contention is that a genuine issue of material fact exists on whether, as he terms it, he \u201cslipped on old ice.\u201d Our review of the documentary evidence submitted to the court leads us to agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthe pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 17-49; <em>Miller v. United Technologies Corp., </em>233 Conn. 732, 744-45, 660 A.2d 810 (1995). \u201cA material fact is a fact that will make a difference in the result of the case. . . . [T]he burden of showing the nonexistence of any material fact is on the party seeking summary judgment .... It is not enough for the moving party merely to assert the absence of any disputed factual issue; the moving party is required to bring forward . . . evidentiary facts, or substantial evidence outside the pleadings to show the absence of any material dispute.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Barasso </em>v. <em>Rear Still Hill Road, LLC, </em>81 Conn. App. 798, 803, 842 A.2d 1134 (2004). Once met, the burden shifts to \u201cthe party opposing such a motion [to] provide an evidentiary foundation to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bednarz </em>v. <em>Eye Physicians of Central Connecticut, P.C., </em>287 Conn. 158, 169, 947 A.2d 291 (2008). When deciding a motion for summary judgment, \u201cthe trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bellemare </em>v. <em>Wachovia Mortgage Corp., </em>284 Conn. 193, 198, 931 A.2d 916 (2007). Because the court\u2019s decision on a motion for summary judgment is a legal determination, our review on appeal is plenary. Id., 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">In the present case, the plaintiffs complaint alleged that the defendant had \u201cfailed to clear from the driveway ice and/or snow which was upon said driveway from precipitation which had fallen prior to December 9, 2005.\u201d In moving for summary judgment, the defendant claimed, inter alia, that \u201c[t]he driveway was clear of any ice when the snowstorm began.\u201d In support of that allegation, the defendant offered the deposition testimony of Joseph Frolish, the owner of Housatonic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>Security Services, Inc. Frolish stated under oath that he could not recall any snow or ice on the driveway the day prior to December 9, 2005.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant also presented a portion of the plaintiffs deposition testimony in which he stated that he could not recall the last time a snowstorm occurred prior to December 9, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">In opposing the motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff offered his May 11, 2006 affidavit, in which he attested that \u201c[o]n the morning of December 9, 2005,1 believe that there was ice on the driveway at the premises where I fell, which ice has been on the ground from prior precipitation\u201d and that \u201c[t]o the best of my recollection, there had been precipitation in the Shelton/Ansonia area within the two days before I fell at the premises and I do not believe that the temperature ever got as high as 35 degrees during that two day period.\u201d The plaintiff also submitted portions of his deposition testimony, in which he stated that he had observed isolated patches of ice on the driveway on the Friday prior to his December 9, 2005 fall. The plaintiff further described his December 9, 2005 fall as follows: \u201c[I] started walking down the driveway, got maybe halfway down, my left foot hit a patch of ice and slid maybe a foot and a half, and down on my rear end I went.\u201d In that deposition testimony, the plaintiff also detailed his observations of the patch of ice on which he fell.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>The documentation submitted by the defendant and the plaintiff in their pleadings seeking and opposing summary judgment contain conflicting assessments as to whether the driveway contained an icy accumulation prior to the morning of December 9, 2005. As such, a genuine issue of material fact exists. It thus was not for the court to find, as it did in its memorandum of decision, that \u201c[t]he day before the [December 9, 2005] snowstorm there was no snow or ice on the property.\u201d Rather, that factual determination belonged exclusively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>to the jury. As our Supreme Court has observed, \u201c[litigants have a constitutional right to have factual issues resolved by the jury.\u201d <em>Mather </em>v. <em>Griffin Hospital, </em>207 Conn. 125, 138, 540 A.2d 666 (1988). Accordingly, \u201cthe credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be accorded their testimony is a matter for the jury to decide.\u201d <em>Dacey </em>v. <em>Connecticut Bar Assn., </em>170 Conn. 520, 540, 368 A.2d 125 (1976); see also <em>Engram </em>v. <em>Kraft, </em>83 Conn. App. 782, 789, 851 A.2d 363 (2004) (in deciding motion for summary judgment, trial court \u201cimproperly drew its own conclusion as to the credibility of the defendant\u2019s testimony rather than submitting the issue to the jury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">We conclude that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether, as the plaintiffs complaint alleges, the defendant \u201cfailed to clear from the driveway ice and/or snow which was upon said driveway from precipitation which had fallen prior to December 9, 2005.\u201d As such, the court improperly rendered summary judgment in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with law.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b457-6\"> The pertinent part of Frolish\u2019s deposition testimony is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-7\">\u201cQ. [D]uring that week that led to December 9, 2005, had you been [at the premises] every day that week?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-8\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-9\">\u201cQ. The driveway and parking areas on that property on the Thursday, the day before\u2014this would be December 8, 2005\u2014was there any snow or ice accumulation on them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-10\">\u201cA. No, not to my knowledge. Not to my recollection, let\u2019s put it that way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-11\">\u201cQ. So, the driveway and the parking areas were clear of any ice or snow on December 8, 2005?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-12\">\u201cA. As far as I remember, yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b457-13\"> The plaintiffs deposition testimony included the following colloquy from his direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-14\">\u201cQ. How do you know your foot hit a patch of ice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>\u201cA. Because I slid. I\u2019m not going to slide unless you hit ice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-6\">\u201cQ. Did you see a patch of ice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-7\">\u201cA. After I was down I did, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-8\">\u201cQ. What did it appear to be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-9\">\u201cA. Looked like just a glaze right on the driveway.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-10\">The transcript of the plaintiffs deposition also included the following testimony elicited on cross-examination:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-11\">\u201cQ. The ice on which you fell, when did you first see the ice on the driveway?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-12\">\u201cA. When did I first see it? I didn\u2019t see it until I slipped on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-13\">\u201cQ. And then when did you see it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-14\">\u201cA. After I was sitting on my rear end on the ground.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-15\">\u201cQ. Did you look at it and see it there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-16\">\u201cA. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-17\">\u201cQ. Why were you able to see it then but not before you fell?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-18\">\u201cA. Because there was a slight precipitation covering that whole driveway. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-19\">\u201cQ. You indicated that after you fell, you noticed . . . approximately a foot and a half of snow had been removed where your left foot slid; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-20\">\u201cA. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-21\">\u201cQ. And where that snow had been removed for that foot and a half, approximately, was it at that point that you saw the ice after you were sitting there and saw the cleared area?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-22\">\u201cA. Right, correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-23\">\u201cQ. The ice that you saw, I think you indicated that it looked like a glaze along the top of the surface of the driveway; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-24\">\u201cA. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-25\">\u201cQ. And that ice that was on the surface of the driveway, was it under the snow, level with the top of the snow or on top of the snow?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-26\">\u201cA. It was under the snow.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-27\">\u201cQ. Okay. So, it would be true to say then that the snow was on top of the ice that was on the driveway?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-28\">\u201cA. Correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
