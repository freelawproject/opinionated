Those two findings are that (1) he failed to achieve such a degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, considering the ages and needs of the children, he could assume a responsible position in their lives, and (2) the termination of his parental rights was in the children\u2019s best interests. See General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (2) and (3) (B). We affirm the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-11\">Our scope of review of such findings is well settled. Such findings must stand unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>In re Shaun B., </em>97 Conn. App. 203, 209-10, 903 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>A.2d 246 (2006) (finding of lack of rehabilitation); <em>In re Tyscheicka H., </em>61 Conn. App. 19, 26-27, 762 A.2d 916 (2000) (finding that termination in best interest of child). The court found that the petitioner, the commissioner of children and families, had established both factors by clear and convincing evidence. We have considered the thorough and well reasoned decision of the court in light of the claims of the respondent, as well as the entire record, and conclude that there was abundant evidence to support the critical factual determinations of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b473-12\"> The court also terminated the parental rights of the children\u2019s mother. Because she has not appealed, we refer in this opinion to the respondent father as the respondent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
