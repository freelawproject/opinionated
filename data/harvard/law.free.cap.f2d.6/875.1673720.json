Plaintiff asks that the word \u201cVogue\u201d be entirely forbidden upon the hat linings or labels, unless it is sterilized by the warning, \u201cnot connected with Vogue Magazine.\u201d Defendant Hat Company thinks that at most only the \u201cV girl\u201d should be banned.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-21\">We are without the aid of specific precedent. We find a helpful principle in the one which we applied, perhaps somewhat obscurely, in Coca-Cola Co. v. Gay-ola Co., 200 F. 720, 723, 119 C. C. A. 164. Plaintiff in its drink used caramel for producing a peculiar reddish color. Defendant had the abstract right to use caramel as an ingredient, and so to get the same color. We held in effect that he had forfeited this abstract right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>by having used it as a part of his expressly fraudulent scheme, and so he must get his color some other way; he must not use caramel, though other makers might. So here we solve a difficult problem by concluding that this defendant\u2019s otherwise clear enough right to use its complete label \u201cVogue Hats,\u201d or \u201cVogue Hats, Fifth Avenue, New York\u201d (without the plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark), is tainted by its intentional fraud in the original adoption of the label with the trade-mark. This fraud permeates the whole label and plan under which it built its present business, and it cannot retain and carry on that business, and become immune by merely dropping the V girl and the dominant V.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">We think it would be going too far to forbid entirely the name or label \u201cVogue Hats\u201d unless accompanied by the disclaimer. That name is substantially descriptive, and has no secondary meaning appurtenant to plaintiff\u2019s business. A majority of the court think, that the words \u201cFifth Avenue, New York,\u201d or \u201cNew York,\u201d though they are abstractly lawful members of a proper label and business combination, yet by their suggestion of plaintiff\u2019s location so emphasize the original and long-continued attempt to mislead that they are poisoned by the permeating fraud, and they must be discontinued, unless modified by a proper manufacturing name. This manufacturing defendant may sell any hats not called or marked as \u201cVogue Hats.\u201d It may use the name and label \u201cVogue Hats\u201d in connection with or without \u201cNew York,\u201d or \u201cFifth Avenue, New York,\u201d if accompanied by any prominently displayed manufacturing name it may select (not including the word \u201cVogue\u201d). It may not use the name unless so accompanied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
