W. Pitch Company, a corporation, of Des Moines, to recover dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>ages for a breach of contract for the alleged purchase of 1,800 barrels of denatured alcohol. The trial was begun before Hon. Martin J. Wade, and at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence the court directed a verdict for the defendant, and the ease comes here upon alleged error in that respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">The controlling question in the case is that of the proper construction of the contract. The plaintiff sues upon the theory that it is a contract for the sale of 1,800 barrels of 3 B formula alcohol, and that defendant breached the contract after receiving 568 barrels by refusing to order out more, excusing itself for so doing because the government had withdrawn its permit for the use of this alcohol. The defendant\u2019s contention is that the contract, properly construed, calls'for the purchase of alcohol from the plaintiff to the extent of its manufacturing requirements, estimated at the time of the making of the contract to be approximately 1,800 barrels; that, such being the ease, when its permit to use the alcohol was withdrawn, it had no further requirements within the time limits of the contract, and the contract thereby automatically became canceled.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">The trial court adopted the defendant\u2019s contention, ruling that the contract was a requirement contract, and not an absolute contract of sale for a certain specific number of barrels. In this connection we are of opinion that the trial court concluded correctly. The language of the contract is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-6\">\u201cCragin Products Co.,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-7\">\u201cDistillers of Alcohol for Industrial Purposes,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-8\">\u201c432 Postal Telegraph Building.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-9\">\u201cChicago, April 18, 1918. \u201cF.

W. Fitch Co., by freight at a price of <em>$1.75 </em>each, if in good condition, f. o. b. Des Moines on cars.

Fitch Co.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-30\">, \u201cPer F. <em>W. </em>Fitch.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-31\">Now, if plaintiff was selling and defendant buying, absolutely, 1,800 barrels of alcohol, why at the outset did they say approximately 1,800 barrels? Again, why follow that up with the language: \u201cBeing your estimated consumption of this formula during one year from date.\u201d .This latter provision of the contract is .carefully and specifically worded, and not only embodies the estimated consumption, but the period of time during which it is to be consumed, and all appears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>to relate back to the expression, \u201capproximately 1,800 barrels.\u201d Then the following sentence is to be considered: \u201cAll of your supplies of this formula to be furnished by Cragin Products Co.\u201d That provision was calculated to protect the seller as,against the then present estimate. Again, the provision for delivery: \u201cAs directed by you in about equal quantities, monthly or as needed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Now defendant only took out 568 barrels during the year specified. I think in such ease, assuming an absolute sale to have been made, the natural thing for the seller to do would be to demand the price promptly, but this was not done. A number of letters passed between the parties,' the language of one of which, dated March 21, 1919, is significant :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-7\">\u201cWe assumed, of course, that from what we knew of your policy that you would want to dispose of your made-up stock before you commenced ordering very much of any alcohol forward. We, however, will arrange to extend your contract in 1919, viz. throughout this year, to suit the requirements of your business.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">Now the estimated amount of alcohol had not been taken out during the year specified in the contract, but an unusual circumstance had intervened. The government had prohibited the defendant using the alcohol, at least for a time. In these circumstances the plaintiff comes forward with the proposition to \u201cextend your contract in 1919, viz. throughout this year, to suit the requirements of your business,\u201d thus seeming to imply that the plaintiff had in mind an effort to extend the time of requirements because of the past interruption. While the contract is not as clear as it might be, we are inclined to the interpretation adopted by the trial court, and therefore are of the opinion that the ease should be and is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
