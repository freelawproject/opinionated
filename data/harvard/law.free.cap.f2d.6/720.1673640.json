Thus \u201cLuzon,\u201d being the name of an island in the Philippine group, is open to common use. But appellant is not seeking registration of that word. \u201cLuzona\u201d is no more than suggestive of \u201cLuzon,\u201d and its registration would prevent no one from using the geographical term.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-24\">The ease cited by the Patent Office, namely, Standard Paint Co. v. Trinidad Asphalt Co., 220 U. S. 446, 31 S. Ct. 456, 55 L. Ed. 536, is not apposite. The word there involved was \u201cRubberoid,\u201d which was clearly descriptive of the character or quality of the roofing product to which it was applied. Here the adopted word is' not Luzon misspelled, but a coined and different word, and hence registrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-25\">The decision is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-26\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
