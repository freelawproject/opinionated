This suit is brought to recover upon two marine certificates of insurance issued by defendant to libelant. The respondent therein agreed to pay to the assured, the libelant, if it became liable to pay and did pay, by way of damages, if the vessel insured or her tow came into \u201ccollision.\u201d The aggregate- amount of the damages demanded is $49,389.79. The court below dismissed the libel after hearing the testimony taken in open court and considering the depositions taken out of court. The respondent offered no testimony, although it cross-examined the witnesses of the libelant.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-14\">All the causes of action, except the fifth, related to injuries which occurred in the Cape Cod Canal. They are the seednd, third, fourth, and sixth causes of action. In the second, third, fourth, and fifth causes of action the barges injured belonged to the libel-ant, and were being towed by a tug which also belonged to the libelant, but by express provision in the policy sued upon in the above causes of action this fact was immaterial, as the policy expressly stated that it was understood and agreed that some of the vessels were the property of the libelant and that all losses were to be settled \u201con the same basis as if there was separate ownership.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b761-15\">The policies insured the tugs named therein, and which are the tugs herein involved-The first of these policies provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-16\">\u201c * * * It is further agreed that, if the vessel hereby insured or her tow shall come into collision with any other vessel, craft, or structure, floating or otherwise, or shall strand such other vessel or craft, and the assured, as owner of the vessel, shall in consequence thereof become liable to pay and shall pay by way of damages to any other person or persons any sum or sums, not exceeding in respect to any one such casualty the value of the vessel hereby insured, we, the assurers, wifi pay the assured such proportion of such sum or sums so paid as our subscriptions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>hereto bear to the value of the vessel hereby insured.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">It further provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-5\">\u201c * * *' That this policy shall also extend to and cover the said vessel\u2019s [the tug\u2019s] legal liability for any collision and/or stranding which may occur to any vessel or vessels or craft while in tow of said vessel, subject to all the terms and conditions of this clause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">The first of the above provisions insures the libelant in ease it is obliged to pay to any other person damages for injuries done by the tug or her tow to the owner of some other \u201cvessel, craft, or structure,\u2019 and no such damages have been paid by the libelant or are involved in the allegations contained in the causes of action brought upon this policy. It will be observed, however, that under the first of these provisions \u201ccollision,\u201d while not defined, is explained as \u201ccollision with any other vessel, craft, or structure, floating or otherwise,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">The fifth cause of action originally was based on a mame policy of insurance, described as No. IN-2927 effective from noon of December 31, 1918, until noon of December 31, 1919. It insured the same tugs as were insured m the first policy, each being insured in the sum of $50,000. It provided that \u201cthis insurance eovers all marine casualties,\u201d including damage by ice, but excluding fire. It also included damage to other vessels for which the assured might be legally liable. But an order of the court was made on January 24, 1922, which amended the libel by striking therefrom the allegation as to policy IN-2927, and substituting .in place thereof policy No. IN \u2014 2957, effective for one year from January 30, 1919, which was issued by the respondent and insured the libelant\u2019s three tugs named in the first policy heretofore mentioned and for the same amount, $10,000, on each of the tugs. This policy also contained the following provision :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-9\">\u201c* * * And it. is further agreed that this policy shall also extend to and cover the said vessel\u2019s legal liability for any collision and/or stranding which may occur to any vessel or vessels or craft while in tow of said vessel, subject to all the terms and conditions of this clause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-11\">The above clause is identical with that contained in the first policy. While the libel asserts five distinct causes of action, they are based on policies of insurance which are identical so far as the clause is concerned upon which the libelant bases his right of recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-12\">The evidence disclosed that the country through which the canal runs is sandy, and that the canal had artificial sides constructed with stones and rocks, known as riprap. In taking the tow through the canal, the tug, as was the usual practice, was in charge of a pilot, under government regulations, who took the wheel and steered the tow. At the time these injuries occurred the United States was at war, and the canal was under government control, and government pilots took charge of vessels going through the canal. The Cape Cod Canal is a narrow body of water, and does not run in a straight line, but has bends and curves in it. When a tug and tow go around these bends, the barges necessarily swing more or less. The canal is so narrow that boats never pass each other; it being described as a \u201cone-way street.\u201d The boats had been taken over by the Shipping Board and were being operated by the United States government. The tows were made up under the direction of government officials. When the tows herein involved got pretty weE through the canal, they were obliged to make a turn, and in doing so they swung over and caught on the side of the bank, and dragged alongside of the riprap. The tow did not stop, but continued right on; In the fifth cause of action the evidence indicates that the tow hit the steep rocks along the shore.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-13\">All questions of stranding were properly disregarded by the court below, inasmuch as the <em>term </em>\u201cstranding\u201d implies a stoppage of the vessel\u2019s progress and a resting for a longer or shorter period. London Assurance Co. v. Companhia De Moagens, 167 U. S. 149, 17 S. Ct. 785, 42 L. Ed. 113; Parsons on Marine Insurance, 632. And there was no such stoppage shown in any of the causes of action under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-14\">The collision clause raises a more serious question. It eovers any damage by \u201ccollision\u201d to the vessels while in tow. The libelant\u2019s right to r\u00e9eover under this clause depends upon whether it amounted to a \u201ccollision,\u201d within the meaning of the policy, that the barges, wh\u00fce being towed, sheered over and struck the bank of the .canal, or the rock abutments or projections thereof, and, in one of the causes of action, the shore or steep rocks along the shore.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-15\">If the term \u201ccollision,\u201d when used in maritime law and in a marine policy of insurance, has an established meaning, a departure from that meaning would work injustice, and should be avoided. The importance of uniformity in the maritime law on this subject cannot be doubted. It is certainly im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>portant that on such a subject as this the courts of this country should be in agreement, and it is also desirable, if possible, that the courts .of England and of the United States in-like manner should be in accord. The Liscard (D. C.) 56 F. 44, 46. As was said in Thames &amp; Mersey Ins. Co. v. Hamilton, Fraser Co., L. R. 12 A. C. 484 (1887), by Lord Hersehell in the House of Lords:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-4\">\u201cI think it will be found, upon examination of the authorities, that the general words in a marine policy have received from the courts, for a long series of years, a construction to which your Lordships would do well to adhere. The instrument is one in daily use, and, if your Lordships were to put a new construction upon it, you would be likely to defeat, and not to give effect to,' the intention of the parties. Nothing would be more dangerous, in my opinion, than to depart from a construction which the authorities have put upon words in common use in a mercantile instrument, even if the propriety of the decision might originally have been open to question.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">\u2022 And in the same case Lord Maenaghten said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-6\">\u201cI see no reason for departing from this settled rule. In marine insurance it is above all things necessary to abide by settled rules and to avoid anything like novel refinements or a new departure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">This court recently, in The Turret Crown, 297 F. 766, 776, 777, in considering the maritime law respecting deviation, commented upon the desirability that the law of the United States and that of England should be in conformity upon matters of commercial law, in the absence of some rule of public policy which would forbid. And see a similar opinion this court expressed in The William J. Quillan, 180 F. 681, 103 C. C. A. 647.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">In ordinary language a \u201ccollision\u201d means a striking together of two bodies. The Century Dictionary defines the term as \u201cthe meeting and iqutual striking or clashing of two or more moving bodies, or of a moving body with a stationary one.\u201d The striking of the barges against the riprap of the canal, or the \u201crock abutments or projections thereof,\u201d no doubt was' a collision within the terms of the above definition. But it is another matter whether or not it constitutes a collision within the meaning of a maritime policy of insurance. Words or terms which have acquired a technical signification in the law are interpreted according to such meaning. It is true ordinarily that the language of a contract is to be construed according to the primary and natural meaning of the language which the parties have chosen to use. But it seems to be an exception to that rule, where the ordinary meaning of a word is not the same with its legal sense.. In such cases the parties are presumed, as was said by Lord Watson, in the House of Lords, in The Niobe (1891) L. R. 16 A. C. 401, to know the law and to have contracted on the faith of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">In Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary the word \u201ccollision\u201d is defined in maritime law as \u201cthe act of ships or vessels striking together, or of one vessel running against or afoul of another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">In Benedict\u2019s Admiralty (4th Ed.). \u00a7 243, it is said: \u201cThe word \u2018collision,\u2019 in its ordinary admiralty significance, means the striking together of two vessels.\u201d He adds that the word is used in a looser sense of the striking together of a vessel and some other object, and that \u201cthe admiralty will in some eases take jurisdiction of such accidents.\u201d No attempt is made by the author to explain when he thinks that admiralty will take jurisdiction of such eases.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-12\">In 11 C. J. 1011, it is said that, \u201cin its strict nautical and legal acceptation, the term \u2018collision\u2019 means the impinging of vessels together while being navigated; two navigable things coming into contact; the act of ships or vessels striking together; the striking or running afoul of one ship by another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-13\">In Amould\u2019s Marine Insurance (10th Ed.) vol. 2, \u00a7 793, the rule is stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-14\">\u201cIt will be noticed that, in order to bring the\u2019 collision clause into operation, there must be a collision between the ship insured and some other ship and vessel, and that the only damages insured against are (in the ordinary forms of the clause) sums payable to the owners of \"the latter vessel in consequence thereof. The shipowner is therefore not protected against liability due to his vessel running into a dockwall, breakwater, pontoon, or anything that is not another ship. <em>e </em>\u00ab <em>J)</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-16\">The same writer, in section 826, in discussing \u201cPerils of the Sea,\u201d after saying that loss by collision is, generally speaking, a loss by the perils of the sea, and stating that it is not uncommon at the present day to find the loss by collision expressly insured against, adds the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-17\">\u201cSometimes the insurance is against \u2018collision\u2019 merely, which term probably implies the coming into contact of two things, both of which are navigable. Sometimes, however, the clause is wider, so as to include the risk of striking against, not merely floating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>or navigable objects, but also structures such as harbors, wharves, &gt;piers, and the like, or obstructions, such as ice or wreck.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Spencer on Marine Collisions, in section 10, defines collision, saying that in the strict nautical and legal acceptation of the term it means the \u201cimpinging of vessels together.\u201d He adds that: \u201cCommon usage, however, has extended the application of the term, so as to include the impact of a vessel with other <em>\u00f1oating </em>objects. The <em>term </em>in its strict legal sense does not include the contact of vessels with rocks, sunken obstructions, or other fixed structure; losses arising from such mishaps are more properly embraced within the meaning of the term stranding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AOT\">In Chandler v. Blogg (1898) L. R. 1 Q. B. 32, the court stated its agreement with the contention of counsel \u201cthat \u2018collision,\u2019 when used alone) without other words means two navigable things coming into contact.\u201d And in Everard v. Kendall (1869-70) L. R. 5 C. C. P. 428, Montague Smith, J., declared that \u201cin common understanding, and as understood in the Court of Admiralty,, damage by collision is damage sustained by a ship from another ship coming in contact with it.\u201d In Richardson v. Burrows, a case decided in 1880 and not reported, but cited in Lowndes on Marine Insurance, \u00a7 196, and in Spencer on Collisions, 14, Lord Coleridge ruled that the word \u201ccollision\u201d meant collision with another ship, and did not mean either a rock, or a sand bank, or floating wreck.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">In 1896 the Supreme Court, in London Assurance Co. v. Companhia De Moagens, supra, had before it the meaning of the word \u201ccollision\u201d as used in a policy of marine insurance. In that case a vessel at her dock in New York had east off her lines and was about to proceed on her voyage, but was delayed in actually proceeding by* some derangement to her machinery. While so delayed she was run into by- a lighter being towed out of the dock, and injured. The question was whether this was a \u201ccollision\u201d within the meaning of the marine certificate of insurance. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-7\">\u201c * <em>* </em>* We think that the vessel was \u2018in collision,\u2019 within the meaning of the language used in the certificate, which represented and took the place of the policy. It was not necessary that the vessel should itself be in motion at the time of collision. If, while anchored in the harbor, a vessel is run into by another vessel, it would certainly be said that the two vessels had been in collision, although one was at anchor- and the other was in motion. We seen no distinction, so far as this question is concerned, between a vessel at anchor and one at the wharf fully loaded and in entire readiness to proceed upon her voyage, with steam up and simply awaiting the regulation of some insignificant matter about the machinery before moving out. If, while so stationary (at anchor or at wharf), the vessel is run into by another, we should certainly, in the ordinary use of language, say that she had been in collision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">The court then went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-10\">\u201cIt is impossible, as we think, to give a certain and definite meaning to the words \u2018in collision,\u2019 or to so limit their meaning as to plainly describe in advance that which shall and that which shall not amount to a collision, within the\u2019 meaning of this policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-11\">In Burnham v. China Mut. Ins. Co., 189 Mass. 100, 75 N. E. 74, 109 Am. St. Rep. 627, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-12\">\u201cSome of the policies in these cases cover \u2018the risk of collision sustained,\u2019 and others are against \u2018loss sustained by collision with another vessel.\u2019 We are of opinion that the two forms mean the same thing, namely, collision with' another vessel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-13\">In the eases, before the Massachusetts court the plaintiff\u2019s vessel had struck a wreck, sunk several hours before, and which was never raised, and the court in a unanimous opinion held that the vessel had not come into collision with another vessel, within the meaning of the policies. In its opinion the court quoted the ruling of Lord Coleridge in Richardson v. Burrows, supra, saying that, while it was a nisi prius decision, \u201cit is of some weight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b764-14\">In Cline v. Western Assur. Co., 101 Va. 496, 44 S. E. 700, the action was upon a marine policy insuring a ship against loss caused, among other things, by \u201ccollision.\u201d It was charged that the ship had collided with some sunken or floating obstruction in a river. It was held that striking a \u201csunken or floating obstruction\u201d was not a \u201ccollision,\u201d within the meaning of the policy. The authorities were quite fully reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-15\">Some of the courts of the state of New York have given to the term \u201ccollision\u201d a somewhat broader significance than the courts of England or of the United States. In a recent case, Steam Tug John O. Carroll v. \u00c6tna Ins. Co., 203 App. Div. 430, 196 N. Y. S. 698, the court had before it the question whether accidental contact between a vessel and a floating, but nonnavigable, object constituted a \u201ccollision,\u201d within the meaning of that word as used in a policy of marine insurance. The court decided that it did, and said that there was no hardship in giving to\u2019the word \u201cits ordinary and gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>erally accepted meaning.\u201d The court in its opinion did not review the English decisions, nor refer to any except two New York eases and the decision in the Southern district of New York, in which Judge Hough (then a District Judge) said: \u201cNeither is it denied that the word \u2018collision,\u2019 as used in marine insurance, can no longer be limited to that fortuitously injurious contact of navigating vessels which is its obvious and natural signification.\u201d Western Transit Co., v. Brown, 152 F. 476.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">The suit in that ease was brought on a running down clause in a marine policy, which was intended to protect the owner against loss because of his liability for damage caused by his own ship to another ship. That is quite a different matter from the insurance of a ship from collision. In the latter ease the owner is insured against loss arising from damage to his own ship caused by a collision. The collision in the case arose between a tug and a schooner in tow while navigating, which was met by a steamer which suddenly sheered to port, causing the Martha to sink. Under the circumstances of the case the lower court held there was no right of recovery under the policy. On appeal to this court we affirmed the decision below, which denied any right of recovery, as the vessel assured had not herself come in contact with the vessel which sank. 161 F. 869, 88 C. C. A. 617. We fail to see that that decision, either in the court below or in this court, departed from the established decisions of the maritime law. And we do not find in the Carroll Case that that decision particularly helps the contention of the appellant herein, inasmuch as the \u201ccollision\u201d there was between a vessel and a floating, although a nonnavigable, object. In the instant case the so-called collision was not with a floating object.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">In 1897, in Newtown Creek Towing Co. v. \u00c6tna Ins. Co., 23 App. Div. 152, 48 N. Y. S. 927, the New York Appellate Division of the Second Department held that the word \u201ccollision\u201d in a policy of insurance covered an injury to a boat, which, while it was being towed, came in contact with a floating cake of ice. Judge Cullen (afterwards Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals) and Judge Willard Bartlett dissented. The court, in the majority opinion, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-6\">\u201cThe contract is, on its face, designated as insurance of \u2018tower\u2019s liability.\u2019 In its common acceptation the word \u2018collision\u2019 imports the act of colliding; a striking together; violent contact. It is, however, in the admiralty sense that it is to be considered here, and it has been seen that in such sense, for the-purposes of relief by libelants, it is not confined to vessels coming in contact with vessels, but includes that of vessels coming in collision with any moving or stationary objects, such, for instance, as collision with a pile, driven piles, sunken hull of a vessel, drawbridge, a dredge at anchor, floating derrick, and other objects on or beneath the surface of the water. When we get away from the strict nautical and legal definition of the term \u2018collision,\u2019 where is the limit of the application of it within the cases which,' as collisions in the broader sense, are the subject of admiralty jurisdiction, and in which claims are supported by adjudicated liability in that jurisdiction?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">The New York Court of Appeals (163 N. Y. 114, 57 N. E. 302) reversed the ease in an opinion written by Chief Judge Parker. The reversal was based upon the fact that the policy of insurance was against \u201cany accident\u201d caused by collision, and the Court of Appeals did not think that injury could properly be regarded as \u201caccidental\u201d within the meaning of the policy. It thought that the right to recover was restricted to a collision by mere chance or accident, and did not extend to a ease where there had been a deliberate attempt to force the boat through a floe or field of ice.- The authorities are not reviewed, but the court, in its opinion, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9so\">\u201cCollision, in its strict nautical and legal acceptation, originally meant the impinging upon one another of vessels while being navigated, but in course of time and by common usage the application of the term has been so far extended, in this country, at least, as to.include the impact of a vessel with other floating objects. * * * However, whether the term be treated by the courts as so fixed in character as to be restricted in its meaning to the coming together of two vessels, as is the rule in Erance, or so flexible as to include a variety of floating objects other than vessels, the idea of accident, so far as the insured is concerned, underlies it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">But, when these New York cases are carefully considered, it will be seen that no one of them affords support for what is contended for in the ease which is-now before the court. We think that'no error was committed by the court below in dismissing the libel. The risk covered by the policies was that of \u201ccollision,\u201d and we are satisfied that, under the circumstances disclosed respecting the injuries which happened to the barges, no collision occurred within the meaning of the maritime law. In none of the causes of ae<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>tion involved did the boat insured come in eontact with another boat, or, while being navigated, with a floating object.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
