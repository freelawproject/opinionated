St. \u00a7 9644) against plaintiff in error (hereinafter called the bank), and in favor of the trustee in bankruptcy, by way of recovery of alleged preferential payments made by the bankrupt, which was engaged during 1920 and 1921 at Toledo, Ohio, in the business of selling Hudson and Essex automobiles. On November 18,1921, the bankrupt owed the bank more than $14,000 for money loaned from time to time, beginning about August, 1921, represented by bankrupt\u2019s notes, and secured, as between the parties, by bills of sale conveying to the bank the title to new automobiles purchased by the bankrupt. These automobiles were never in fact delivered to the bank, but were retained in the possession .of the. bankrupt at its place of business, the latter giving the former so-called trust receipts, whereby the bank agreed \u201cto take and hold said automobiles as the purchase of said bank for the purpose of storing the same,\u201d and not \u201cto sell, loan, rent, deliver, mortgage, pledg\u00e9, or otherwise dispose of\u201d the automobiles except upon written order from the bank \u201cfor release from trust,\u201d upon payment to the bank of the amount required by such order, etc. The bankrupt was also liable to the bank on account of notes given by bankrupt\u2019s customers for automobiles purchased, secured by chattel mortgages for the purchase price, which customers\u2019 notes and mortgages had been sold to the bank. By some date in October, 1921, the bankrupt had sold, in the course of its business, and without the bank\u2019s then knowledge, all of the automobiles pledged to the bank, accounting to the latter for none of the proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-19\">The alleged preferential payments were made November 18 and November 30, 1921, and thus within four months before the filing of petition for adjudication of bankruptcy, viz. January 6, 1922. Adjudication was had January 22, 1922.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-20\">There was express testimony tending to show the bankrupt\u2019s insolvency at the time the payments in question were made to the bank, for example: The bankrupt\u2019s book-' keeper testified that on November 18 and November 30 the bankrupt\u2019s assets were approximately $12,000 and its liabilities approximately $25,000. True, this estimate was on the basis of a liquidated business, but there was substantial testimony tending to show that the business was rapidly nearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>liquidation, if indeed that result was not then inevitable. There was additional evidence tending to show insolvency. There was also substantial evidence that, when the alleged preferential payments were made, the bank had reasonable cause to believe that the payments in question would effect a preference. In October, 1921, the bank\u2019s secretary,' having learned at the bankrupt\u2019s place of business that the pledged automobiles had all been sold, had an interview with the bankrupt\u2019s president. A few days later the bankrupt returned to the agency from which it had obtained its own agency contract the great bulk of bankrupt\u2019s stock of replacement parts; the proceeds of those retained by the manufacturer\u2019s agency (amounting to about $5,800) being paid to the bank, together with $500 of the deposit which had been made by the bankrupt with that agency as security for the bankrupt\u2019s contract herewith. These sums, aggregating about $6,300, constituted the alleged preferential payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\"> We see no merit in the suggestion that the bank got no greater percentage on its own claim (about 48 per cent.) than creditors generally would have had, if we accept the estimate of 50 per cent, made by the bankrupt\u2019s bookkeeper. The bank actually received 100 per cent, on $6,300 of its claim, and, if the preferences were upheld, would be entitled to receive upon the balance of its claim the same percentage as other creditors of the same class. Nor did the fact that the bankrupt had, as against the bank, wrongfully sold its pledged assets, give the latter a lien as against the rights of general creditors in the proceeds of the replacement parts. The bank\u2019s liens, by the way of bills of sale, trust receipts, or otherwise, were never recorded or filed, as provided by the Ohio statutes, and so were void as against creditors of the mortgagor, -both by the statutes of that state and under the Bankruptcy Act. Ohio Gen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 8560, 8561, 8568; Bankruptcy Act, \u00a7\u00a7 47, 60, and 70 (Comp. St. \u00a7\u00a7 9631, 9644, 9654). After the pledged automobiles were sold the bank was merely an unsecured creditor as respects the debts attempted to be secured thereby. The bank had no lien upon the replacement parts. Cases such as Smith v. Township of Au Gres (C. C. A. 6) 150 F. 257, 80 C. C. A. 145, 9 L. R. A. (N. S.) 876, and Erie R. Co. v. Dial (C. C. A. 6) 140 F. 689, 72 C. C. A. 183, are not pertinent. In each of those eases a trust relation was involved. In the instant case the relation was merely that of debtor and creditor, notwithstanding the form of \u201ctrust receipt\u201d adopted. We do not understand plaintiff in error to contend otherwise, with respect to the alleged preference, and, where no lien or trust is involved, the trustee in bankruptcy does not stand merely \u201cin the shoes of the bankrupt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">The trial court thus properly refused to instruct verdict for defendant, and committed no error in its instruction to the effect that the bank came ultimately into the same class with the other general creditors of the bankrupt.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">The only remaining question requiring consideration is whether there was reversible error in excluding the testimony of three witnesses offered by the bank as bearing on the question of bankrupt\u2019s solvency as a \u201cgoing concern.\u201d One of the witnesses testified, in substance, that in October, November, or December, 1921, he was shown by the bankrupt\u2019s president a certain financial statement of its business. In advance of the formal proffer of testimony of a proposal by the witness to purchase the bankrupt\u2019s business, or an interest in it, the court asked whether the proposal \u201cwas made on this statement or his actual investigation.\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel replied: \u201cI think on this statement.\u201d The court said: \u201cUnless this man actually went up there and appraised this property and examined their books, this would only be hearsay, so far as he is concerned.\u201d There was no showing that the witness actually examined the books and appraised the property. He said: \u201cI did not make any careful appraisal or any inventory or look over the stoek carefully or anything like that. I just walked \u2022 through the building and took sort of a bird\u2019s-eye view of the conditions, etc.\u201d The court excluded proffer of testimony that the -witness offered for the bankrupt\u2019s assets and business $10,-000 plus the amount of the liabilities, and that its president offered to take that amount, provided he were retained as general manager at an annual salary of $6,000, and that in the opinion of the witness the assets and business were worth $10,000 more than the liabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">The testimony of the second witness differed principally in the fact that, while he negotiated with the bankrupt\u2019s president, he made no offer, but received one. His opinion of the value of -the business at the time was excluded, apparently for the same reason as -that of the other witness. While he says he \u201cmade an examination of the property at the office and place of business and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>salesroom of the bankrupt,\u201d and that he \u201cformed an opinion as to the reasonable value of the business and property of the bankrupt as it was at that time (November, 1921) as a going- concern,\u201d he does not say in terms that his opinion was based on his own examination. He too was given a copy of the financial statement referred to.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We are not persuaded that the refusal to receive the opinions was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">But if there was technical error in that regard, we think the judgment should not be reversed for that reason. The statement in question, made as for the year ending November 30, 1921, showed nominal assets of $64,891.28, and liabilities of $29,350.72. The assets were apparently greatly overvalued. The great hulk of the \u201cparts and accessories,\u201d valued at something more than $16,000, sold, as already stated, for $5,800. There, was also included in that statement $10,000 , as the value of the agency contract, which, unless renewed, would apparently expire November 30,1921. During that year, as shown by the statement, there had been a net loss of more than $26,000. It had already appeared in the case that three ears listed in the statement at $6,426 had been turned over to the bank and credit of $1,500 given the bankrupt therefor. It had also appeared that in December a) receivership over the bankrupt\u2019s property was created in a state court. It would be a not unnatural inference that the offer in the ease of the one witness, and of opinion value of the other two,.were largely speculative, and not improbably based, in large part at least, upon the advantage likely to result to the purchaser in the matter of obtaining a renewal of the agency contract. The evidence strongly preponderated in favor of a conclusion of insolvency, and it seems improbable that the opinion evidence so rejected so far affected the substantial rights of the bank as to call for reversal, in the face of the statutory provision that \u201cthe court shall give judgment after an examination of the entire record before the court, without regard to technical errors, defects, or exceptions which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties.\u201d Judicial Code, \u00a7 269 (Comp. St. \u00a7 1246); West v. United States (C. C. A. 6) 258 F. 413, 415, 169 C. C. A. 429.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Being of opinion that no reversibl\u00e9 error was committed upon the trial, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AtjW\"> The proposed testimony of the third witness and its competency were no more favorable to the bank than that of the second witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
