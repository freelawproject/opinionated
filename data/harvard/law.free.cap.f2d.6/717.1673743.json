The Standard Dictionary defines \u201copaline\u201d as \u201cpertaining to or possessing the qualities of the opal; * * * possessing the milky iridescence of the opal; opalescent.\u201d The following illustrative quotation is then given: \u201cSea and sky and meadow were taking a hundred opaline tints from the reflection of the sunset. Prudence Palfrey Aldrich, p. 212\u201d (1874).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-22\">Under section 5 of the Trade-Mark Act of 1905 (33 Stat. 724 [Comp. St. \u00a7 9490]), no mark is registerable, consisting \u201cmerely in words or devices which are descriptive of the goods with which they are used, <em>or of the character or quality of such goods.\u201d </em>As we many times have ruled, the obvious purpose of this provision is to prevent a monopoly of words either aptly descriptive or aptly suggestive of the character or quality of the goods to which they are to be applied. Here there can be no doubt that, to the general public, the use of the word \u201cOpaline,\u201d as applied to \u201cvarnishes and finishes in the nature of a paint,\u201d would signify the character or quality of such goods, and hence that the word is not registerable.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-23\">The decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-24\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
