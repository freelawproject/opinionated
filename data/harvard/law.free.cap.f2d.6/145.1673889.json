St. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>Ann. Supp. 1923, \u00a7 10138%aa]), August 12, 1922; that on March 5, 1923, he had a further information filed against him \u201cas a second offense\u201d for possession of intoxicating liquor, and was convicted on March 12, 1923; and charges that the third offense for which this indictment was brought was committed on January 4, 1924. We regard this indictment as sufficient to support a conviction fot a third offense. Dolan v. U. S. (C. C. A. 6) 4 F.(2d) 251, filed March 16, 1925.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">The indictment charges possession of \u201cintoxicating liquor for beverage purposes.\u201d It is criticized because it does not say that the liquor was \u201cfit\u201d for beverage purposes. We know of no rule or principle which requires such further allegation.. Fitness is only evidence of purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
