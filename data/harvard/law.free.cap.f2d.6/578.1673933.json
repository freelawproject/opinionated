Belle, etc., Co. (C. C. A.) 280 F. 277, and the court below has enjoined as an infringement a hat lining, consisting of a erown piece and a side piece sewed together, but between the meeting edges of these two pieces is inserted what plaintiff calls a \u201csingle uncovered exposed piece of material,\u201d and the sewing unites the crown, side, and \u201cexposed piece\u201d into a unitary structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">The appeal requires some consideration of our decision just cited, which has, we think, been misapplied below. The Kurtz patent, 1,216,140 (the claims of which may be found in 280 F. 277), covers the combination in a hat lining of a side piece, crown piece, and an \u201cuncovered cord\u201d exposed between erown and side, with means (i. e., sewing) for so uniting crown, side, and cord as to form a unitary structure, showing the cord as an \u201cornate seam.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-11\">The patent was upheld over Rawak (1,-191,996) solely because the \u201cexposed cord\u201d, was a different element from Rawak\u2019s \u201cannular pocket\u201d with a core (often a cord) inserted therein, and both patents were differentiated from \u201cpiping,\u201d which is of unknown antiquity. The function of Rawak\u2019s annular pocket, with core, and of Kurtz\u2019s uncovered cord, was to stiffen the unitary lining to an extent which mere piping could not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-12\">Validity in Kurtz over Rawak lay solely in the \u201cuncovered cord,\u201d and validity in Ra&lt;wak lay in his stiffened piping. This defendant uses no uncovered cord, and has not stiffened its piping by any inserted core or cord. What must be called the equivalent of a cord in defendant\u2019s structure, if infringement be found, is merely the piping of the prior and very ancient art. It is neither Kurtz\u2019s nor Rawak\u2019s device.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-13\">What would be the scope of Kurtz or Rawak, if some one devised a stiffened piping that was neither an uncovered cord nor a cored annular pocket, is not before us. It is enough that defendant is doing no more than utilizing an old device of the needle art. That he seems to find a market for soft unstiffened hat linings may annoy Kurtz, and possibly Rawak, but is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-15\">Order reversed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
