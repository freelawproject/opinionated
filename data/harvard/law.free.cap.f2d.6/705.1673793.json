This pan is supplied with oil heated to the proper temperature. The raw doughnut is placed in the center'of the pan, quickly comes to the surface, and is carried by the current through the spiral channel to the outside of the pan. At a predetermined point it is turned, that it may be fried on the other side. The operation is so tuned that the doughnut is supposed' to be completely cooked when it reaches the outside of the pan, at which point there is .an ejector device. As long, therefore, as uncooked doughnuts are supplied at the center and the machine properly functions, the \u2018 process will be continuous.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">It appears from the testimony that it was the intent of each party to develop a window display machine. The issue is expressed in three counts, of which the first, here reproduced, is sufficiently illustrative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-9\">\u201c1, In apparatus for cooking free articles in hot fluid the combination of. a receptacle for the fluid, and means for circulating the fluid and for progressing the articles over a gyratory course in the receptacle, under propulsion by the fluid, including a guide extending spirally outward from the center of the receptacle to its periphery.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">Bergner\u2019s application was filed July 10, 1919, and Lindsey\u2019s on October 7, 1919. Bergner is a draftsman and specification writer in a patent law office, and, so far as this record discloses, has no practical knowledge of the art. He conceived the invention May 6, 1919, and soon thereafter prepared drawings and filed his application. The record does not disclose that he ever marketed a machine. '</p>\n<p id=\"b730-11\">Lindsey was thoroughly \u25a0 skilled in this field, having been engaged in the manufacture and sale of window display devices in the bakery art. We will here briefly review the evidence introduced in support of his ease:</p>\n<p id=\"b730-13\">A Mr. Patrick J. Shortt, an expert haker, testified that shortly before Christmas of 1918, in a conversation he had with him, Mr. Lindsey told him \u201che had an idea of an automatic doughnut machine, and he asked me questions * * * pertaining to the manufacture of doughnuts. After he elicited the information, he said the reason he asked the information was because he had an idea of a doughnut machine, where the doughnuts were carried in a current of fat; around through the grease, and were carried automatically to the delivery,\u201d In cross-examination this witness was asked what he knew about doughnuts, and replied: \u201cWhat did I know about cooking doughnuts? I spent 25 years' \u2014 or 20 years or 23 years at that time \u2014 in the manufacturing of doughnuts and all lines of bakery goods.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b730-15\">Mr, Daniel Beck, a graduate of Cornell with an A. M. E. degree, had known Mr., Lindsey since the fall of 1914. He was shown a drawing of the Lindsey application, and asked whether he ever discussed such a machine with Lindsey.. He replied that he had in the early part of April, 1919. He had been told that Lindsey was at work on such a machine, and said to him, \u201cI hear you have a doughnut machine in mind,\u201d and Lindsey \u201csaid, Wes,\u2019 and he immediately began to tell me some of the details.\u201d The , witness was then asked to describe the details, and replied: \u201cAs near as I remember, he said that the doughnuts were to be formed in a hopper or depositor of some sort, and were to be deposited in a hot stream of oil. This oil was to be maintained in a channel, the oil to be, of course, started at the source, and was to be returned to the source; he did not say by a pump, but I imagine there was to be a pumping proposition, and some time during the course of the stream of oil the doughnut was to be automatically turned, so It would fry on the other side; as to the exact details he did not go into those. * * * At the end of the channel the doughnut was to he taken from the oil by some kind of a conveyor.\u201d When asked how he fixed the date of the discussion, witness said: \u201cI went to Chicago about the latter part of April, I think it was tlie 26th of April, and it was before I left for Chicago; if I remember distinctly, it was several weeks before I left.\u201d The cross-examination of this witness strengthened rather than weakened his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-19\">Mr. C. F. Switzer, who at the time of'the occurrences about which he testified was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>\u25a0sales manager for the J ohns-Manville Company, located across the street from the shop in which the Lindsey experiments were being conducted, testified that he had access to this shop, as he sold materials to Mr. Lindsey\u2019s company, and in April of 1919 saw \u201cthis spiral pan arrangement,\u201d and later \u201csaw one of the gem machines in there [the shop]. And from time to time I used to try some of the Bake-Rite doughnuts that had been made in there.\u201d It may be noted here that Mr. Lindsey was president of the Bake-Rite Oven Manufacturing Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Mr. J. Sank had been intimately acquainted with Mr. Lindsey since 1915, through association with him in various projects, but when he testified was not connected with Mr. Lindsey or his company in any way. This witness testified that he served in the Army and was located at Angel Island from the 3d of October to the 11th of December, 1918, and during that time, while on leave, he visited Mr. Lindsey at his place of business. He was shown a copy of the Lindsey drawing, and asked whether he recognized what it indicated. Answering in the affirmative, he then was asked, \u201cWhat is <em>itf\u2019 </em>He replied, \u201cThat is a cooker; this is his doughnut machine.\u201d He then was asked whether he had discussed it with Mr. Lindsey, and answered, \u201cYes; lots of times;\u201d that the first time was while he was in the Army, and that the conversation occurred in Lindsey\u2019s office. Asked to state the circumstances of the conversation, witness said: \u201cWell, he drew on the back of an envelope a spiral, and told me that that was a cooker for his doughnut machine, and the doughnuts were to be dropped in the center of it, and at some point they were to be turned over and removed from the \u25a0oil.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Witness further \u2022 stated that he was employed by the Bake-Rite Company from about March 1,1919, until Christmas of that year, with the exception of a few weeks in August, and that he did shop work on Lindsey\u2019s doughnut machine. On cross-examination he was asked what he meant by \u201cdoughnut machine,\u201d and replied: \u201cWhy, Mr. Lindsey\u2019s doughnut machine, this machine \u2014 \u25a0 this one \u2014 that this is a part of a drawing of.\u201d In answer to the question, \u201cWhen you say \u2018this one, that this is a part of a drawing of,\u2019 what do you refer to ?\u201d witness answered, \u201cI mean \u2014 there is still a cutter that belongs to that machine that is not shown in the drawing.\u201d (The \u201ccutter\u201d is not one of the elements of the counts here.) Asked how long he worked on this machine at the Bake-Rite shop, witness replied that sometimes he worked on it for three or four days at a time, and then again for one day or less. In response to a question as to whether he recalled any date when he saw the machine cook doughnuts, witness stated, \u201cWell, in the summer of 1919 \u2014 maybe it was before August or after August, I cannot say;\u201d that the cooking was done in the shop of the Bake-Rite factory.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">Mr. S. A. Kitchener, an officer of the Bake-Rite Company, testified in considerable detail as to disclosures of the invention made to him by Lindsey in December of 1918, and as to the subsequent development of the invention. Mr. Lindsey, in his testimony, stated in detail his activities in developing this invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">All this testimony is reasonable and consistent, and bears all the earmarks of verity. As we perceive no ground for discrediting either Mr. Lindsey or his witnesses, we must find, as did the Examiner of Interferences and the Board of Examiners in Chief, that Lindsey had conceived this invention long before Bergner\u2019s entry into the field, and that Lindsey was reasonably diligent early in May of 1919, when Bergner\u2019s activities commenced. Lindsey undoubtedly had practically perfected a machine embodying the counts of this issue prior to Bergner\u2019s entry into the field, and therefore might have applied for a patent thereon; but such a machine was not considered practical by either party. What each desired was a complete machine, including a depositor. As soon as this was constructed, and the efficiency of the machine demonstrated, the application was filed. Indeed, instructions to file were given some time in advance of the actual filing date, which, as we have seen, was less than three months later than the filing date of Bergner.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-11\">Lindsey\u2019s witnesses were practical men, and their testimony leaves no room for doubt that they not only understood the disclosures made to them, but' that they were familiar with the development of Lindsey\u2019s early conception. In such a. situation, the prior inventor should not be deprived of the fruits of his invention, unless chargeable with unreasonable delay in perfecting it, which is not the case here. That the Assistant Commissioner entertained some doubt as to the equity of his decision is apparent, for he says: \u201cIt is regrettable that one who first began to produce a valuable invention should fail to secure the benefits of his labor, but it is impossible to make a clear case for Lindsey without reading between the lines to an unwarranted extent.\u201d We are unable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>follow the Assistant Commissioner in his suggestion that it is necessary to read between the lines in order to find for Lindsey, since it seems clear to us that the testimony we have reviewed demonstrates beyond a doubt that Lindsey was the prior inventor. On the question of diligence, see Courson v. O\u2019Connor, 38 App. D. C. 484; Id., 227 F. 890, 142 C. C. A. 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">The decision is reversed, and priority awarded to the party Lindsey.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">' Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
