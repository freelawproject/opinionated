The machine then1 marks its canceling stamp impressions on the mail matter and keeps a record of the number of such impressions. After the impressions corresponding to the amount previously paid for and indicated by the setting of the machine have been exhausted, the machine is automatically locked against further use. The mail matter passing through the machine. is thereby stamped, - face-canceled, and postmarked. This mail is known as \u201cmetered mail,\u201d just as mail bearing a special delivery stamp is known as \u201cspecial delivery mail,\u201d and that bearing a registration stamp as \u201cregistered mail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">It is the position of the Patent Office that the machine by which mail is \u201cmetered\u201d is aptly described as the \u201cmetered mail machine.\u201d In this view we concur. Appellant has the right to adopt and register a trademark under which to sell its machine, regardless of the fact that a patent has been obtained on it, but he has no right to register a mark that aptly describes it. See Application of Toledo Scale Co., 281 F. 607, 52 App. D. C. 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">The decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
