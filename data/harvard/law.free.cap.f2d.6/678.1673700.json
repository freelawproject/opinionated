Craighead v. Alexander, 38 App. D. C. 229, 234. In the absence of a bill of exceptions, this court must assume that the evidence adduced at the trial was sufficient to justify the order from which the appeal is taken. Fletcher v. Fletcher, 43 App. D. C. 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">There is no bill of exceptions in the present ease, nor does the record contain or purport to contain the substance of the testimony in the ease. We have before us, on the contrary, merely the final account of the executors and the ruling of the court thereon. In this account the aggregate value of 'the estate is shown to be almost $5,000,000, and the executors, in addition to the claim for commission on income collected since the preceding account, \u201calso claim and hereby retain for their services a commission of 5 per cent, upon profits realized on proceeds of inventoried items, and the par or face value of stocks received as dividend, viz. $1,571,929.32,\u201d or $78,596.47. The court below, evidently after a hearing in which all pertinent facts and circumstances were considered, reached the conclusion that the executors were entitled to $50,000 commission on increase in principal, and made that allowance. The facts and circumstances upon which this allowance was based are not before us, and, there being nothing on the face of the record to indicate error, it is apparent that the judgment must be affirmed, with costs; and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
