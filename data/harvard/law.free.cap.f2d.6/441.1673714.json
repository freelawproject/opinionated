No shipping instructions were ever given. McCreary Tire &amp; Rubber Company, in June and July, 1920, wrote to the manufacturer requesting no further shipments. On February 11, 1921, the manufacturer wrote that at the tire company\u2019s request they had postponed shipments, and requesting that they be given adequate notice of shipment when desired.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The ease was tried before a jury, who returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $70,692.70, with interest from September 1, 1921. This date was somewhat later than the actual breach; hence there was no error in accepting September 1st as the \u25a0date from which interest was to run. At the time of the breach of contract part of the goods had been manufactured. As to these the measure of damages was properly charged by the trial judge to be the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time of breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">As to the goods- not manufactured, the jury found that at the time of the signing of the contract in suit the plaintiff had entered into cover contracts for yarn in order that it might be in position to perform the contract. The cover contracts covered, not only yarn for manufacture for the defendant, but also for others. Some of these contracts were canceled and adjusted. The judge\u2019s charge and the verdict of the jury thereon were, if anything, too favorable to the defendant. The assignments of error are voluminous and without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">The tire company tried to introduce in evidence three letters, obviously dealing with another contract between the same parties. The trial judge properly excluded these letters. Other assignments relate to the refusal of the trial judge to receive in evidence statements of officers of the tire company, subsequent to the making of the contract in suit, that they did not regard the contract in suit as in existence. Other assignments relate to instructions as to the measure of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">The contract of sale imposed upon the defendant the duty to notify the manufacturer of the time for delivery. For the manufacturer to maintain his action, it was sufficient for him, under section 42 of the Sales of Goods Act (Pa. St. 1920, \u00a7 19690), to express his readiness and willingness to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">The tire company never, before suit was brought, refused to perform the contract for any other reason than that it was void and never went into effect, and hence the defense at the trial, under the rule laid down in Railway Co. v. McCarthy, 96 U. S. 258, 24 L. Ed. 693, and Second National Bank v. Lash Corporation (C. C. A.) 299 F. 371, was limited to the grounds stated before action was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-12\">The judgment below will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
