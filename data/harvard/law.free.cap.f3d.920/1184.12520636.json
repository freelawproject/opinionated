He also brought \u00a7 1983 claims against several District administrators, school principals, and teachers (the District Defendants) in their official capacities for constitutional violations. The district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   entered default judgment\n   against Hansen in his individual capacity, and summary judgment for the District Defendants.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Doe v.

The District sponsors an overnight outdoor camp for fifth graders that is staffed by District employees. It assigned one teacher to each cabin. It also assigned a teenage student \"camp counselor\" to each cabin in order to assist the teacher and report improper behavior. Hansen staffed the camp as a teacher, assigned to a cabin. In 2013, he pled guilty to child pornography-related charges. He admitted using a hidden camera to videotape fifth-grade students in the nude inside the cabins from 2007 to 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During this time, the District's policies addressed Hansen's conduct. They prohibited teachers from \"[e]ngaging in any conduct that violates Board policies ... [or] constitutes criminal behavior.\" They required teachers to \"[m]aintain courteous and professional relationships with pupils\" and prohibited them from \"mak[ing] advances toward, or engag[ing] in any sexual relationship with a district student.\" In 2008, the District adopted an \"Audio and Visual Recording\" policy explicitly prohibiting the use of recording equipment \"where the occupants would have a reasonable expectation of privacy.\" The District also conducted criminal background checks on employees, including Hansen. It did not have knowledge of Hansen's conduct until his arrest in 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2016, Doe sued on behalf of a class of current and former students whom Hansen videotaped. The class asserted claims against Hansen and the District under the Child Abuse Victims Rights Act of 1986 (CAVRA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The District filed an answer. Hansen did not. The district court entered default judgment against Hansen for liability under CAVRA. Doe then filed two amended complaints. The Second Amended Complaint asserts claims against Hansen in his individual and official capacities under \u00a7 1983 for violations of CAVRA and the constitutional right of privacy. It also includes \u00a7 1983 claims for failure to supervise and train against seven current and former District employees (and unnamed John and Jane Doe defendants) responsible for camp supervision (the District Defendants) in their official capacities. The District filed an answer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Doe dismissed the claims against Hansen in his individual capacity. Doe then moved to enforce against the District the default judgment against Hansen under CAVRA for statutory damages. The district court denied the motion, clarifying that the default judgment against Hansen was in his individual capacity and is not enforceable against the District (which responded to the claims against Hansen in his official capacity).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The District moved for summary judgment on all counts. Doe renewed his motion to enforce the default judgment against the District and, in the alternative, moved for summary judgment on the CAVRA count against Hansen. The district court denied Doe's motions and granted summary judgment to the District. Doe appeals the grant of summary judgment only for the failure to train and supervise under \u00a7 1983. He also appeals the denial of his motion for default judgment against the District.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This court reviews de novo a grant of summary judgment, viewing the evidence most favorably to the nonmoving party.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Torgerson v.

Instead, he contends that a 2004 Department of Education report-estimating that at least 4.5 million K-12 students experienced sexual misconduct by a school employee-provided notice. The report addresses sexual misconduct generally, not child pornography. It is insufficient to give the District notice of Hansen's particular misconduct or of the risk he would videotape students in the nude. Doe also argues the District had \"actual notice\" because it relied on teenage camp counselors to report inappropriate behavior. In 2006, for instance, a camp counselor observed Hansen in a bunk with a fifth grader. Seeing the counselor, Hansen jumped out of the bunk. The counselor did not, however, report this incident until after Hansen's arrest. There is no evidence the District was aware counselors were not reporting inappropriate behavior. Nor is there evidence the District had any warning of Hansen's misconduct before his arrest in 2012.

Doe claims the District created an \"obvious risk\" by assigning only one teacher to each cabin and allowing teachers to bring recording equipment into the cabin. However, the District's policies prohibited Hansen's conduct. Teachers could not use recording equipment where students had an expectation of privacy. Teachers were to maintain professional relationships and could not engage in any kind of sexual relationship with students. The District relied on camp counselors to report any inappropriate behavior. In light of these policies, Doe cannot prove that the risk that a teacher would engage in this kind of conduct was so obvious that it required additional training or supervision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Contrary to Doe's claims,\n   <em>\n    S.M. v.
