Admitted to the United States around 1994, he became a lawful permanent resident. For most of his life, he lived in Omaha, Nebraska with his parents and five younger siblings. His father is wheelchair-bound, and his mother, the family's sole provider, works in a factory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2014, Dat was indicted on two counts of Hobbs Act robbery, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201951\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 2, and one count of brandishing a firearm during a robbery, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) and 2. He pled guilty to one robbery count. The other charges were dismissed. The district court sentenced him to 78 months' imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In an affidavit, Dat asserts: Before pleading guilty, he asked his counsel about the possibility of deportation. His counsel spoke to an immigration specialist, then advised he would not be deported because he was a long-tenured lawful permanent resident, not an \"illegal immigrant.\" After rejecting two plea agreements with strong deportation language, he accepted a plea acknowledging \"there are or may be collateral consequences to any conviction to include but not limited to immigration.\" His acceptance was based on counsel's assurance his immigration status would be unaffected. He learned, after his conviction, this immigration advice was incorrect, when his mother's attempt to renew his green card was denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Dat moved to vacate his conviction under \u00a7 2255, claiming his counsel misadvised him about the immigration consequences of pleading guilty. The district court denied his motion without an evidentiary hearing. In a brief order, the court found he was advised of the immigration consequences by his plea agreement, Petition to Enter a Plea of Guilty, and colloquy with the court at his change-of-plea hearing. Dat appeals, arguing the district court erred in denying his motion and abused its discretion by not holding a hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This court reviews \u00a7 2255-ineffective-assistance claims de novo, and the underlying factual findings for clear error.\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Hyles v.

As the district court noted, he acknowledged in his plea agreement that \"there are or may be collateral consequences to any conviction to include but not limited to immigration.\" In his Petition to Enter a Plea of Guilty, he acknowledged that a guilty plea in \"most federal felony cases\" results in permanent removal. And at his change-of-plea hearing, he affirmed he was aware his conviction \"could affect\" his immigration status and had discussed the matter with his attorney. However, his counsel's alleged misadvice specifically undermined these equivocal warnings. They informed Dat of a general possibility of immigration consequences. They do not necessarily contradict or correct his counsel's alleged misadvice he would not suffer those consequences in his case.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Doe\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520112\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/915/905/#p912\">\n    915 F.3d at 913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (counsel's misadvice-that deportation was not a mandatory result of the guilty plea-not remedied where judge asked if defendant understood he \"may be deported\" and did not inform him of the \"mandatory consequences\" of his plea to an aggravated felony),\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     United States v.

Here, Dat asserts counsel misadvised he would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be deported. The PSR does not necessarily remedy this affirmative misadvice.

Dat, however, was not in ICE custody during this case. The scope of his immigration attorney's representation is not in the record, let alone the advice, if any.
