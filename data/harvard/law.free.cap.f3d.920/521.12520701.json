One is the speech at issue. In\n   <em>\n    Nord\n   </em>\n   , the speech focused on the sheriff, including comments that his health was poor, his wife did not want him to run, and he planned to resign.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Nord\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4125118\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/757/734/#p738\">\n    757 F.3d at 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

During the campaign, Morgan said: (1) the county communications center had not been completed; (2) rural fire departments lacked adequate radio systems; (3) the county needed more deputies on the road; (4) the office budget did not consider the public's needs; (5) department morale was poor; (6) the department was not doing well; and (7) people were leaving the office because they did not feel respected. The parties dispute whether all of Morgan's statements were true; but they agree some involved matters of public concern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Morgan argues this difference \"render[s]\n   <em>\n    Nord\n   </em>\n   irrelevant for purposes of determining whether the law was clearly established in this case.\" Specifically, he contends\n   <em>\n    Nord\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable because the speech there was untruthful, not a matter of public concern, and undeserving of First Amendment protection. This argument has no merit. Although the speech here arguably is entitled to greater protection-an issue this court need not decide-the speech does not necessarily override the sheriff's interest in maintaining the \"discipline and harmony\" of the office.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4125118\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/757/734/#p738\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4125118\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/757/734/#p738\">\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4125118\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/757/734/#p738\">\n    at 743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Nord\n   </em>\n   court said that \"even if\" the deputy's speech \"was fully protected by the Constitution,\" the sheriff \"could have reasonably believed that the speech would be at least potentially damaging ... and disruptive\" and thus the sheriff \"could have logically and rationally believed that his decision to terminate Nord was well within the breathing room accorded him as a public official in making a reasonable ... judgment under the circumstances.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4125118\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/757/734/#p738\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Another difference is the impact of the speech. In\n   <em>\n    Nord\n   </em>\n   , apparently there was no evidence of disruption or potential disruption. The sheriff there \"testified that, during the campaign period, there were no complaints about how the office was run nor were there any communication problems between the employees.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4125118\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/757/734/#p738\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4125118\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/757/734/#p738\">\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4125118\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/757/734/#p738\">\n    at 748\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Shepherd, J., dissenting). Here, Robinson testified he believed Morgan's statements were detrimental to the office, harmful to morale, and adversely impacted the public's trust of the office. Deputies expressed similar concerns. They said Morgan's statements bred \"uneasiness,\" made some employees feel uncomfortable, contributed to lack of morale, and created turmoil. Five of these deputies-the entire command staff-recommended his termination. The termination letter said Morgan had \"violated the trust\" of the administration and his fellow officers and created \"disharmony in the office.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Morgan argues that Robinson \"has not proven any disruption\" and thus should have known that firing him would violate a clearly established right. The dissent also advances this argument, claiming that Robinson provides \"no evidence\" of \"actual\n   disruption,\" \"actual impact,\" \"demonstrated impact,\" or \"indicators of poor morale\" created by Morgan's speech. This argument misstates the record. The termination letter and the deposition testimony of Robinson and the command staff about the effect of Morgan's statements are evidence of \"actual disruption\" and \"demonstrated impact.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Even without this evidence, however, Robinson could claim qualified immunity.

When viewed through the proper lens of a summary judgment appeal, the record does not support the majority's holding. Rather, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Deputy Morgan, as we must, Sheriff Robinson terminated Morgan's employment solely because of his personal objections to the\n   content of Morgan's campaign speech without the reasonable belief that the statements would have a disruptive effect on the operation of the Sheriff's Department. I would therefore affirm the district court's denial of qualified immunity to Robinson and I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Robinson is the elected Sheriff of Washington County, Nebraska, who has held the position since 2000. He stood for reelection in 2014. Morgan, a deputy in the Washington County Sheriff's Department, ran against Robinson in the 2014 primary election. During the campaign, Morgan made public statements about the operations of the Sheriff's Department and his proposed improvements should he be elected. Robinson won the primary election and six days later terminated Morgan's employment on the grounds that Morgan's campaign statements were untruthful. In the Termination Notice, Robinson cited the following statements made by Morgan during the campaign as the reasons for the termination: the communications system was not completed after ten years of construction; the Fire and Rescue agencies could not communicate and someone would be hurt or killed if it was not fixed; morale at the Sheriff's Department was bad and several deputies were actively looking for employment; Morgan's K-9 had been taken from him in an act of retribution; and portable radio coverage was poor. Dist. Ct. Dkt. 93-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Morgan initially filed a grievance under a labor contract that applied to his position, which he lost. He then filed this suit in district court asserting claims of retaliation and deprivation of due process, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and breach of the labor contract. The district court compelled arbitration on the breach of the labor contract claim. The arbitrator ruled in Morgan's favor and reinstated his employment with the Sheriff's Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   After returning to district court, Robinson filed a motion for summary judgment asserting qualified immunity with respect to Morgan's retaliation claim. The district court denied the motion, ruling that Robinson was not entitled to qualified immunity because there were genuine disputes of material fact concerning the public value of Morgan's statements and whether the statements caused disruption in the operation of the Sheriff's Department. Robinson appeals this decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We review de novo the decision of the district court denying qualified immunity.\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

I conclude, however, that viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Morgan, it was not reasonable for Robinson to so conclude nor was that the reason behind his decision to discharge Morgan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Undercutting Sheriff Robinson's purported rationale for terminating Morgan is the record evidence-which we must view in the light most favorable to Morgan-demonstrating that Morgan's termination was not actually tied to potential office disruption. Morgan's Termination Notice explained the reasons for his firing as violating the Sheriff's Department's Rules of Conduct by slandering or speaking detrimentally about the office. This charge, which an arbitrator later determined to be unfounded based on the truthfulness of Morgan's statements, is centered more on the disdain that Robinson and others had for Morgan's campaign speech than on any potential disruption that they feared might occur due to Morgan's candidacy. Captain Bellamy, Robinson's campaign manager and member of the \"command staff\" that recommended Morgan's discharge, openly admitted that he objected to Morgan's\n   campaign because \"you don't bite the hand that feeds you\" by running against the sitting sheriff, while several others who were involved in the recommendation to terminate Morgan also stated that the recommendation for dismissal was based on Morgan's purported violation of the Code of Conduct by speaking out against the sitting sheriff. Dist. Ct. Dkt. 89-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   A passing reference to \"office disharmony\" in a notice of termination and generalized statements about the natural consequences of political elections, in my view, do not overcome the significant evidence showing that Morgan was terminated solely for the content of his campaign speech challenging Robinson's record and calling attention to his view of the status of Sheriff Department operations. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Morgan-which we are bound to do at this juncture-Sheriff Robinson's termination of Morgan was motivated solely by the critical content of Morgan's campaign speech and not by a concern for potential disruption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Further, no evidence is before the Court of any actual disruption or indicators of poor morale within the Department of any kind or occurring at any time, much less issues created by Morgan's campaign speech. The district court fairly noted that \"the evidence presented on this motion establishes that a significant amount of time has passed between at least some of Morgan's statements and his termination. ... Yet, Robinson has not alleged Morgan's statements caused any disruption in that time.\" Dist. Ct. Dkt. 103, 8-9.

Here, Robinson terminated Morgan weeks after Robinson's campaign speech had occurred, after the election campaign had concluded and Morgan's campaign speech had come to an end, and in the absence of any examples of deteriorating morale or office disruption. Under the facts before us, Robinson did wait, and unfolding events revealed to Robinson no \"disruption of the office and the destruction of working relationships.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Proceeding to the balancing of the \"interests of [Morgan], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer,\n   in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees,\"\n   <em>\n    Pickering v.

Accordingly, because a rational jury could find that Morgan was terminated solely because Robinson was personally offended by Morgan's campaign speech, the\n   <em>\n    Pickering\n   </em>\n   balance falls sharply and overwhelmingly in favor of Morgan's right to comment on matters of public concern. Thus the statements are afforded First Amendment protection and I believe Morgan has sufficiently shown a violation of a protected constitutional right in the form of his termination for engaging in campaign speech. Thus, I easily conclude that Deputy Morgan satisfies the first part of the qualified immunity analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   I also disagree with the majority's analysis and would conclude that it is clearly established that Sheriff Robinson could not terminate Deputy Morgan for exercising his First Amendment rights during the campaign. The majority, despite our directive to view the evidence in the light most favorable to Morgan, frames this inquiry as asking whether Sheriff Robinson could terminate Deputy Morgan for Morgan's campaign statements when Robinson believed the statements were potentially damaging and disruptive. The evidence, particularly when viewed with the applicable summary judgment standard, does not support the majority's formulation of the question as including Sheriff Robinson's belief that Morgan's statements would cause potential disruption. I believe this incorrect framing of the question leads to the majority's erroneous conclusion that the right was not clearly established; I address what I believe the proper inquiry to be: \"Could [Robinson] reasonably have believed, at the time he fired [Morgan], that a government employer could fire an employee on account of\" the employee exercising his First Amendment right to free speech during a run for political office where that speech had no disruptive impact on office functioning?\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=573%20U.S.%20228\">\n    573 U.S. at 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581603\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2369/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Walsh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4125118\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/757/734/#p738\">\n    757 F.3d 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir. 2014). But the majority diminishes critical distinctions in\n   <em>\n    Nord\n   </em>\n   , namely that the nature and contents of the statements in\n   <em>\n    Nord\n   </em>\n   challenged the personal fitness of the sheriff. That the sheriff's departments in\n   <em>\n    Nord\n   </em>\n   and in this case function similarly does nothing to address the fact I find dispositive: Morgan spoke out about issues related to department operations as a whole, while the deputy in\n   <em>\n    Nord\n   </em>\n   attacked the sheriff's personal attributes and fitness for office. Further distinguishing\n   <em>\n    Nord\n   </em>\n   is that the sheriff relied on advice of human resources and legal counsel, which factored into the reasonableness of his belief that he could terminate the deputy for speech during the political campaign. Finally, to bolster its view that it is not clearly established that Robinson could not terminate Morgan for his political speech during the campaign, the majority offers several cases discussing the permissibility of limiting the speech of department employees for the purposes of managing the department. But those cases do not involve the context of political elections, where \"the First Amendment has its fullest and most urgent application.\"\n   <em>\n    Burson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11728538\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/191/#p196\">\n    504 U.S. at 196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11728538\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/191/#p196\">\n    112 S.Ct. 1846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Eu\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031909\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/214/#p223\">\n    489 U.S. at 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031909\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/214/#p223\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1013\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Supreme Court has repeatedly expressed the importance of protecting First Amendment activity, especially in the context of elections. The majority's conclusion, which relies on a factually distinguishable case, sidesteps this precedent. I would conclude that it is clearly established that Sheriff Robinson could not terminate Deputy Morgan for speech made during a political campaign that related to the department operations and caused no disruption or other negative impact on the department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In closing, I note the reality of small-county politics that the majority is so willing to cast aside. Although I dissent because I believe Deputy Morgan has shown a violation of a clearly established constitutional right, I believe discussion of the practical implications of today's majority opinion is warranted. Washington County is a rural Nebraska county with a population of approximately 20,000 people and a Sheriff's Department of 13 road deputies. Washington County is not a major metropolitan area or population center; it is small and rural. And small-county politics differ from politics in major metropolitan areas like Kansas City, St. Louis, or Minneapolis. The population and workforce in less-populated areas do not provide the same pool of candidates with vast differences in background and experience. Office holders are often entrenched incumbents; indeed, Sheriff Robinson has held the position of Washington County Sheriff since 2000. Typically, the deepest pool for political challengers comes from within a department or organization itself. This necessarily involves department- or organization-born challengers to incumbents. After today's majority opinion, in-office challengers to incumbents must appreciate the risk that comes with critical campaign speech: the incumbent can terminate them for the critical speech without the reasonable belief that the speech would be potentially damaging or disruptive to the office. Viewing the record under our summary judgment standard, Sheriff Robinson terminated Deputy Morgan because he did not like the critical content of Deputy Morgan's speech; Sheriff Robinson had no reasonable basis to believe that the speech would be potentially damaging or disruptive to the functions of the Sheriff's Department. Because I cannot sanction shielding Robinson from suit for such an act, I dissent. I would affirm the judgment of the district court.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Morgan cites no applicable precedent that puts the constitutional question beyond debate or shows that a reasonable person would have known the termination was a violation of a clearly established right.
