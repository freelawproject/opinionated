Riley appeals, arguing that the use of his statements violated the Fifth Amendment and that, absent corroboration, the court erred by finding his statements sufficient to establish the violations. We find no reversible error and therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Riley was convicted on federal drug-related charges in 2013. He was released from prison in 2016 and began serving a five-year term of supervised release. Although Riley tested positive for methamphetamine several times between March 2017 and February 2018, his probation officer did not seek revocation of his supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 16, 2018, Riley was stopped for a traffic infraction by local law enforcement officers, who found methamphetamine while searching Riley's car. He was charged by the state with possession of a controlled substance. Riley's federal probation officer thereafter petitioned the district court for an arrest warrant, alleging that Riley violated the terms of his supervised release by being arrested and by possessing a controlled substance. Riley was subsequently arrested for the supervised-release violation and taken into custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Riley's probation officer interviewed Riley while he was being held at the county jail. The officer did not inform Riley of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   rights before questioning him. Riley admitted to the officer that he had been using methamphetamine on a daily basis for several months and that, during the last month, he had been distributing an ounce of methamphetamine per week. Riley signed a written statement confirming his statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the revocation hearing, Riley objected to the use of his statements to the probation officer. He contended that because he was in custody when interviewed by the probation officer, the failure to give him\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings required suppression of his oral and written statements. The district court rejected that argument, relying on\n   <em>\n    United States v. Armstrong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11581770\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/187/392/\">\n    187 F.3d 392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 1999), which held that the exclusionary rule does not apply in supervised-release revocation proceedings and that evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment is admissible in\n   those proceedings. The district court also rejected Riley's argument that the government was required to present independent corroboration of his confession in order to establish that he distributed methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Relying on Riley's admissions, the court determined that Riley had violated the conditions of his supervised release by distributing a controlled substance. Drug distribution qualifies as a Grade A violation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.1(a)(1) &amp; cmt. n.3; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b), which in this case carried a Guidelines-recommended sentence of 24-30 months' imprisonment,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a). The court sentenced Riley to 20 months' imprisonment. If the court had instead found that Riley had only\n   <em>\n    possessed\n   </em>\n   a controlled substance, that would have qualified as a Grade B violation with a recommended sentence of 4-10 months.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 7B1.1(a)(2), 7B1.4(a). Riley appeals, pressing the same issues he raised before the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We turn first to Riley's claim that his Fifth Amendment rights were violated. The Fifth Amendment's Self-Incrimination Clause provides that \"[n]o person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\" U.S. Const., amend. V. The Clause speaks in terms of compelled testimony, and thus the protections it grants generally are not \"self-executing.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Lara\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277538\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/850/686/#p692\">\n    850 F.3d 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 692 (4th Cir. 2017). That is, a person seeking to invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination generally \"must assert the privilege rather than answer.\"\n   <em>\n    Minnesota v. Murphy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11336129\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/420/#p429\">\n    465 U.S. 420\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 429,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11336129\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/420/#p429\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11336129\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/420/#p429\">\n    79 L.Ed.2d 409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984). If the person voluntarily answers, the answer is not privileged.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11336129\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/420/#p429\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Exceptions to this general rule arise in certain situations that are viewed as inherently coercive. One exception involves custodial police interrogations, a setting that contains \"inherently compelling pressures which work to undermine the individual's will to resist and to compel him to speak where he would not otherwise do so freely.\"\n   <em>\n    Miranda v. Arizona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/#p467\">\n    384 U.S. 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 467,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/#p467\">\n    86 S.Ct. 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/#p467\">\n    16 L.Ed.2d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1966). In order to dissipate these coercive pressures, \"the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   Court required the exclusion of incriminating statements obtained during custodial interrogation unless the suspect fails to claim the Fifth Amendment privilege after being suitably warned of his right to remain silent and of the consequences of his failure to assert it.\"\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11336129\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/420/#p429\">\n    465 U.S. at 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11336129\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/420/#p429\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Another exception arises in \"penalty\" cases, where the assertion of the privilege results in the imposition of a penalty substantial enough to effectively \"foreclose a free choice to remain silent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11336129\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/420/#p429\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11336129\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/420/#p429\">\n    at 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11336129\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/420/#p429\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Although Riley answered the questions put to him by the probation officer rather than asserting his Fifth Amendment privilege, he contends that because he was in custody at the time of the interview,\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings were required.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   And because no warnings were given, Riley contends the district court erred by refusing to apply the exclusionary rule and suppressing his oral and written statements. In Riley's view,\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   's refusal to apply the exclusionary rule in revocation proceedings applies only to violations of the\n   <em>\n    Fourth\n   </em>\n   Amendment and does not preclude application of the exclusionary rule in the context of the\n   <em>\n    Fifth\n   </em>\n   Amendment. Riley contends that there are different interests at stake in cases involving a Fifth Amendment violation and that application of the exclusionary rule is required to vindicate those interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In our view, Riley's exclusionary-rule argument puts the cart before the horse. The exclusionary rule is a \"judicially created remedy\" applied in cases where certain constitutional violations have been committed.\n   <em>\n    Davis v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5928256,12450488\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/229/\">\n    564 U.S. 229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 238,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450488,5928256\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2419/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450488,5928256\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2419/\">\n    180 L.Ed.2d 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, before considering whether it would be proper to apply the exclusionary rule, we must first determine whether there has been a constitutional violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Because the Self-Incrimination Clause focuses on the use of compelled evidence in a criminal case, the clause creates \"a fundamental\n   <em>\n    trial right\n   </em>\n   of criminal defendants.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5121\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/259/#p264\">\n    494 U.S. 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 264,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5121\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/259/#p264\">\n    110 S.Ct. 1056\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5121\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/259/#p264\">\n    108 L.Ed.2d 222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990) (emphasis added).

The confessions at issue in\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   were used against the defendant in\n   <em>\n    a criminal prosecution\n   </em>\n   for the offenses to which he confessed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11336129\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/420/#p429\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11336129\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/420/#p429\">\n    at 424-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11336129\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/420/#p429\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the statements were\n   used against the defendant in a criminal proceeding, the Fifth Amendment inquiry therefore depended on whether the statements were compelled. The Supreme Court held that the statements were not compelled because the defendant voluntarily answered without asserting the privilege, and none of the circumstances that make the privilege self-executing were present -- the defendant was not in custody when questioned,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11336129\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/420/#p429\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11336129\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/420/#p429\">\n    at 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11336129\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/420/#p429\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and he was not subject to a substantial penalty for invoking his right against self-incrimination,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11336129\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/420/#p429\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11336129\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/420/#p429\">\n    at 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11336129\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/420/#p429\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, as the Court indicated in footnote 5, it would have indeed been a \"different question\" if the defendant had been in custody because, as previously discussed, the privilege against self-incrimination is self-executing in cases involving unwarned statements obtained through custodial interrogation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In this case, however, whether Riley was in custody is not relevant because his statements were not used against him in a criminal proceeding.

Because there was no independent corroboration of his admissions, Riley argues that the evidence was insufficient to show that he committed the Grade A offense of distribution.

As we have already discussed, supervised release revocation proceedings are not criminal proceedings, and a determination that a person violated the terms of supervised release does not amount to a conviction for a criminal offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Thus, the very description of the corroboration rule - an uncorroborated extrajudicial confession cannot alone support a criminal conviction - demonstrates that the rule has no application to supervised release revocation proceedings, where courts are permitted \"to consider evidence including letters, affidavits, and other material that would not be admissible in an adversary criminal trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Morrissey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782797\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/471/#p480\">\n    408 U.S. at 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782797\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/471/#p480\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
