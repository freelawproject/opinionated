Here, by contrast, Codrea has raised as a plaintiff an independent, pre-enforcement challenge to an agency rule in an attempt to avert a present duty to comply, and he filed suit at a time when the allegedly improperly appointed official was still in office and enforcing his own challenged decision. For that reason, the effect of Attorney General Barr's intervening ratification must be guided not by a merits analysis, but rather by mootness.

Codrea Br. 20-21 (adopting Coalition Reply Br. 22) (\"Plaintiff assumes that the ratification was not tainted by Mr. Whitaker's actions in promulgating the Rule in the first place.\"). That \"cessation\" of the legal challenge was outside the hands of the named defendants-then-Acting Attorney General Whitaker, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Acting Bureau Director Thomas Brandon, and Attorney General William Barr.

The Bump-Stock Rule amends three sections of the Code, modifying the regulatory definition of \"machine gun\" and \"adding a sentence to clarify that a 'machine gun' includes * * * a bump-stock-type device.\" 83 Fed. Reg. at 66,519 (amending\n   <extracted-citation index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20447.11\">\n    27 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 447.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 478.11, 479.11 ). Those sorts of amendments would be highly unusual for a mere interpretive rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   In short, the Rule confirms throughout, in numerous ways, that it intends to speak with the force of law. It contained all of those indicia uniformly conveying its intended legislative character when Acting Attorney General Whitaker issued it. And it still contained those indicia when Attorney General Barr subsequently ratified it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Notwithstanding all of that, the government's litigating position in this case seeks to reimagine the Rule as merely interpretive. The government's briefing says that the Rule is \"not an act of legislative rulemaking,\" and that the Rule instead only \"sets forth the agency's interpretation of the best reading of the statutory definition of 'machinegun.' \" Gov't Br. 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The government's position to that effect has highly significant implications for owners of bump-stock devices. Whereas a legislative rule, as an exercise of delegated lawmaking authority, can establish a new legal rule going forward, an interpretive rule by nature simply communicates the agency's interpretation of what a statute has always meant. So here, if the Bump-Stock Rule is merely interpretive, it conveys the government's understanding that bump-stock devices have always been machine guns under the statute. The government says exactly that in its brief, observing that, per the interpretation set out in the Rule, \"any bump stock made after 1986 has\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   been a machinegun.\" Gov't Br. 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   That in turn would mean that bump-stock owners have been committing a felony for the entire time they have possessed the devices. Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (o)(1), it is \"unlawful for any person to transfer or possess a machinegun,\" and violators \"shall be fined [or] imprisoned not more\n   than 10 years, or both,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 924(a)(2). As the government acknowledges, under the view it espouses in its brief that the Rule is interpretive, the possession of bump stocks \"has\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   been banned.\" Gov't Br. 38. And that would be so notwithstanding a number of prior contrary interpretations by the agency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   83 Fed. Reg. at 13,444-13,446.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The government's account of the Rule in its brief-including its position that bump-stock owners have always been felons-is incompatible with the Rule's terms. The Rule gives no indication that bump stocks have always been machine guns or that bump-stock owners have been committing a felony for the entire time they have possessed the device. The Rule in fact says the opposite. After all, it establishes an effective date,\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   which (and only after which) bump-stock possession will be prohibited. 83 Fed. Reg. at 66,523. A future effective date of that kind cannot be reconciled with a supposed intent to convey that bump-stock possession \"has\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   been banned.\" Gov't Br. 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The government now characterizes the Rule's effective date as merely marking the end of a period of discretionary withholding of enforcement, in that the Rule informs the public that the Department will \"not pursue enforcement action against individuals who sold or possessed bump stocks prior to the effective date.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38-39. Once again, that is not what the Rule says. The government engages in enforcement discretion when it voluntarily refrains from prosecuting a person\n   <em>\n    even though he is acting unlawfully\n   </em>\n   . The Rule, by contrast, announces that a person \"in possession of a bumpstock type device\n   <em>\n    is not acting unlawfully\n   </em>\n   unless they fail to relinquish or destroy their device\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the effective date of this regulation.\" 83 Fed. Reg. at 66,523 (emphases added). That is the language of a legislative rule establishing when bump-stock possession will become unlawful, not an interpretive rule indicating it has always been unlawful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   In short, the government cannot now, in litigation, reconceive the Bump-Stock Rule as an interpretive rule. The character of a rule depends on the agency's intent when issuing it, not on counsel's description of the rule during subsequent litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Encino Motorcars\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597950\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2117/#p2122\">\n    136 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2122 ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SEC v.

Agency litigants then could effectively amend or withdraw the legal force of a rule without undergoing a new notice-and-comment rulemaking. That result would enable agencies to circumvent the Administrative Procedure Act's requirement \"that agencies use the same procedures when they amend or repeal a rule as they used to issue the rule in the first instance.\"\n   <em>\n    Perez v.

Still, the Bureau's invocation of\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   here is powerful evidence of its intent to engage in an exercise of interpretive authority warranting\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The Bureau, in rejecting objections that the agency's interpretation \"would not be entitled to deference under\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   ,\" 83 Fed.

The second interpretation would tend to include bump-stock devices: the shooter engages in a single pull of the trigger with her trigger finger, and that action, via the operation of the bump stock, yields a continuous stream of fire as long she keeps her finger stationary and does not release it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   83 Fed.

From that perspective, a \"single function of the trigger\" yields a single round of fire when a bump-stock device moves the trigger back and forth. By contrast, from the perspective of the shooter's action, the function of pulling the trigger a single time results in repeated shots when a bump-stock device is engaged. From that perspective, then, a \"single function of the trigger\" yields multiple rounds of fire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   In light of those competing, available interpretations, the statute contains a \"gap for the agency to fill.\"\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"366\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/\">\n    467 U.S. at 843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"367\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Guedes argues that the phrase \"single function of the trigger\" unambiguously compels a focus on the trigger's mechanical operation.

Guedes Br. 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   The Rule explains why the plaintiff's understanding is incorrect, and the Rule's explanation in that regard is reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   83 Fed. Reg. at 66,532-66,534. The Bureau acknowledges that bump firing-a technique using a stable point like a belt loop to approximate the function of a bump stock-is possible with semiautomatic weapons.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 66,533. But even when a semiautomatic weapon is bump fired using an object like a belt loop or a rubber band, the Bureau explained, the weapon does not fire \"automatically\" because there is no \"self-acting or self-regulating mechanism.\" Rubber bands and their ilk do not \"capture and direct the recoil energy\" to \"harness[ ] [it] as part of a continuous back-and-forth cycle.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 66,533. Rather, \"the shooter must do so\" herself.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Bump firing without the aid of a bump-stock-type device is therefore \"more difficult\" because it relies solely on the shooter \"to control the distance that the firearm recoils and the movement along the plane on which the firearm recoils.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Bump stocks, on the other hand, are specifically designed to \"direct[ ] the recoil energy of the discharged rounds * * * in constrained linear rearward and forward paths.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 66,532.

Agency action is arbitrary or capricious if \"the agency has relied on factors which Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.\"\n   <em>\n    Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Here, the plaintiffs claim that, for various reasons, the Rule is arbitrary in applying the statutory definition of \"machinegun\" to\n   bump stocks. None of their claims is likely to succeed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs argue that the Rule fundamentally mischaracterizes the operation of bump-stock devices. In their view, the Rule disregards that, for each shot, \"the shooter must manually and volitionally\n   <em>\n    push\n   </em>\n   the trigger into [a] stationary finger.\" Guedes Br. 24. It is true that, for a bump-stock-equipped device to repeatedly fire, the shooter must keep the bumpstock engaged by maintaining constant forward pressure on the gun. But in the Rule, the Bureau correctly describes the operation of bump-stock-equipped devices: the shooter must \"maintain[ ] constant forward pressure [on the gun] with the non-trigger hand\" in order to maintain continuous fire. 83 Fed. Reg. at 66,532. The bump stock takes advantage of the gun's recoil, channeled into a linear back-and-forth cycle, to permit the shooter to fire continuously by maintaining steady forward pressure on the gun. There is thus no disagreement about the basic mechanics of bump-stock devices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   Guedes takes particular issue with the Rule's characterization of recoil. He argues that bump-stock-equipped devices cannot \"harness[ ] the recoil energy of the firearm\" because they do not use \"a device such as a spring or hydraulics * * * [to] automatically absorb the recoil and use this energy to activate itself.\" Guedes Br. 16-17. But the Rule does not adopt such an impoverished definition of \"automatically.\" The Rule requires only that the recoil be used in service of a \"self-acting or self-regulating mechanism.\" A bump stock \"direct[s] the recoil energy of the discharged rounds * * * in constrained linear rearward and forward paths,\" 83 Fed. Reg. at 66,518 (quoting 83 Fed. Reg. at 13,443 ), which qualifies as a \"self-regulating mechanism.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs assert that the Rule is arbitrary because its definition encompasses all semiautomatic weapons. That argument is largely redundant of the plaintiffs'\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   step two argument to the same effect, which we have already addressed. We dispose of this iteration of the same argument on the same grounds: Bump stocks, unlike commonplace household objects, are specifically designed to \"direct[ ] the recoil energy of the discharged rounds * * * in constrained linear rearward and forward paths.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Bump stocks, unlike household objects, are machine guns because they alone involve a \"self-acting or self-regulating mechanism.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs submit that the Rule arbitrarily excludes binary-trigger guns from its definition of \"machinegun.\" Binary-trigger guns shoot one round when the trigger is pulled and another round when the trigger is released. 83 Fed. Reg. at 66,534. The Rule concludes that such devices are not machine guns because the second shot is \"the result of a separate function of the trigger.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The plaintiffs argue that if the release of the trigger is a separate function, the operation of a bump stock-which requires the shooter to keep the trigger finger stationary while steadily pushing the gun forward into the finger-must also involve multiple functions of the trigger. But the Rule reasonably distinguishes binary-trigger guns on the ground that they require a second act of volition\n   <em>\n    with the trigger finger\n   </em>\n   . The release of a trigger is a volitional motion. But merely holding the trigger finger stationary-which is what operation of a bump stock entails-is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   <em>\n    Fourth\n   </em>\n   , Guedes contends that the Rule is arbitrary because its definition of \"automatically\" is ambiguous. The Rule's definition, Guedes notes, does not specify how much manual input is too much. But\n   the existence of latent ambiguity does not render an interpretation arbitrary or capricious.

History of Bump Stock Regulation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   Firearms manufacturers have created various devices that allow a lawful semiautomatic rifle to perform more rapidly. A bump stock is one such device. It replaces the standard stock of a rifle-the part that rests against the shooter's shoulder. A bump stock \"free[s] the weapon to slide back and forth rapidly.\"\n   <em>\n    Bump-Stock-Type Devices\n   </em>\n   , 83 Fed. Reg. at 66,516. The sliding motion allows a shooter to increase his rate of fire. A rifle produces recoil energy upon firing. The bump stock helps direct the firearm's recoil and convert the recoil energy into rapidly firing rounds. It works like this: the shooter pulls the trigger; the recoil causes the firearm to slide backward; the shooter maintains backward pressure on the trigger with the index finger of his shooting hand and forward pressure on the barrel with his other hand.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This process causes the firearm to slide back and forth rapidly, bumping the shooter's stationary trigger finger and thereby firing additional rounds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   Some bump stock devices use only the shooter's physical pressure to channel the recoil energy and do not include springs or mechanical parts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For these devices, a single pull of the trigger alone-without the shooter's additional forward pressure-does not cause the firearm to shoot more than one round. Video evidence in\n   the record makes this clear.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the video, the shooter fires a rifle equipped with a non-mechanical bump stock. The shooter holds the rifle with one hand, the trigger hand. He then pulls the trigger and the rifle fires a single shot. Without his other hand's forward pressure on the barrel, the rifle equipped with a non-mechanical bump stock fires only a single round with each pull of the trigger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   The ATF first classified a bump stock type device in 2002, concluding that it was not a \"machinegun.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 66,517. The classification involved a product called the Akins Accelerator, a bump stock that used internal springs. \"To operate the device, the shooter initiated an automatic firing sequence by pulling the trigger one time, which in turn caused the rifle to recoil within the stock, permitting the trigger to lose contact with the finger and manually reset.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"Springs in the Akins Accelerator then forced the rifle forward, forcing the trigger against the finger, which caused the weapon to discharge the ammunition.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The ATF interpreted the statutory language \"single function of the trigger\" to mean a \"single movement of the trigger.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A semi-automatic rifle fires only a single round each time the trigger is pulled and reset. According to the ATF, because the Akins Accelerator did not modify how a semiautomatic rifle's trigger \"moves\" with each shot, it was not a \"machinegun.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   In 2006, the ATF reclassified the Akins Accelerator as a \"machinegun.\" It reinterpreted the phrase \"single function of the trigger\" from \"single movement of the trigger\" to \"single pull of the trigger.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The reinterpretation made all the difference. Once a shooter pulls and maintains pressure on the trigger, the internal springs of the Akins Accelerator start an automatic sequence that keeps the rifle firing until the shooter removes his finger or depletes the ammunition. The firing of multiple rounds based on a single continuous pull of the trigger made the device a \"machinegun\" under the ATF's reinterpretation. The Akins Accelerator inventor challenged the ATF's changed reading in federal district court (M.D. Fla.), arguing that the Agency misinterpreted the statutory definition of \"machinegun.\" The district court upheld the ATF's determination and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.\n   <em>\n    Akins v.

Their primary challenge is that the Rule misinterprets the statutory definition of \"machinegun\" and mistakenly extends that definition to cover bump stock type devices. They also attack the Rule for alleged procedural gaps in the rulemaking process and for taking property without just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process\n   Clause.

The original definition of \"machinegun\" in the 1934 Act included a firearm that shoots more than one round \"automatically or semiautomatically.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"533\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202733\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (1940). At the time, an \"automatic gun\" was understood to be \"[a] firearm which, after the first round is exploded, by gas pressure or force of recoil automatically extracts and ejects the empty case, loads another round into the chamber, fires, and repeats the above cycle, until the ammunition in the feeding mechanism is exhausted, or pressure on the trigger is released.\" Webster's New International Dictionary 187 (2d ed. 1934). A \"semiautomatic gun\" was (and is) \"[a] firearm in which part, but not all, of the operations involved in loading and firing are performed automatically, as when the recoil is used to open the breech and thus prepare for reloading by hand.\" Webster's New International Dictionary 187 (2d ed. 1934). At the time of the 1934 Act's enactment, then, the difference between an \"automatic\" and a \"semiautomatic\" gun depended on whether the shooter played a manual role in the loading and firing process. My interpretation fits the historical context by limiting \"automatic[ ]\" to a firearm that shoots more than one round by a single trigger pull with no additional action by the shooter. By contrast, the Bump Stock Rule reinterprets \"automatically\" to mean what \"semiautomatically\" did in 1934-a pull of the trigger\n   <em>\n    plus\n   </em>\n   . The Congress deleted \"semiautomatically\" from the statute in 1968 and the ATF is without authority to resurrect it by regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   The ATF insists that my interpretation renders \"automatically\" superfluous-a result inconsistent with the well-established principle that \" '[a] statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous, void or insignificant.' \"\n   <em>\n    Corley v.

Not even close. \"[A]utomatically\" means that the firearm shoots more than one shot as the result of a self-acting mechanism effected by a single pull of the trigger. Thus, the combination of \"automatically\" and \"by a single pull\" explains\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   the shooter accomplishes the firing sequence of a \"machinegun.\" Under my reading, \"automatically\"\n   <em>\n    excludes\n   </em>\n   a \"machinegun\" that uses a self-acting firing sequence effected by action in addition to a single pull of the trigger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   Finally, the ATF, as well as the district court, posits that the Bump Stock Rule meets one ordinary meaning of \"automatically\"-that is, \"perform[s] parts of the work formerly or usually done by hand.\" Webster's New International Dictionary 187 (2d ed. 1934). Both believe that a bump stock \"makes it easier to bump fire because it controls the distance the firearm recoils and ensures that the firearm moves linearly-two tasks the shooter would ordinarily have to perform manually.\"\n   <em>\n    Guedes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529265\" index=\"540\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/356/109/\">\n    356 F.Supp.3d at 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Maybe so. But the Rule does not use the \"formerly done by hand\" meaning of \"automatically.\"\n   <em>\n    Bump-Stock-Type Devices\n   </em>\n   , 83 Fed. Reg. at 66,519. It defines \"automatically\" to mean \"as the result of a self-acting or self-regulating mechanism.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Whether\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   definition is consistent with section 5845(b)'s definition is the question before us.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Is a Bump Stock a \"Machinegun?\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   Having interpreted \"automatically\" and \"single function of the trigger,\" the Rule declares that a \" 'machinegun' includes a bump-stock-type device, i.e., a device that allows a semiautomatic firearm to shoot more than one shot with a single pull of the trigger by harnessing the recoil energy of the semiautomatic firearm to which it is affixed so that the trigger resets and continues firing without additional physical manipulation of the trigger by the shooter.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 66,553 -54. There are at least two defects in this classification. It ignores the fact that a non-mechanical bump stock-a type of bump stock device covered by the Rule-does not allow the firearm to shoot more rapidly with a single pull of the trigger because the shooter must provide \"constant forward pressure with the non-trigger hand\" for the device to function.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 66,532. It also erroneously determines that a bump stock allows a semiautomatic rifle to fire more than one round with a single pull of the trigger. For these reasons, I agree with the plaintiffs that a bump stock is not a \"machinegun.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , a firearm equipped with a non-mechanical bump stock does not fire \"automatically\" because the shooter must also provide constant forward pressure with his non-shooting hand. The Rule's very description of a non-mechanical bump stock manifests that its proscription is\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-241\">\n   [Bump stock] devices replace a rifle's standard stock and free the weapon to slide back and forth rapidly, harnessing the energy from the firearm's recoil either through a mechanism like an internal spring or\n   <em>\n    in conjunction with the shooter's maintenance of pressure\n   </em>\n   (typically constant forward pressure with the non-trigger hand on the barrel-shroud or fore-grip of the rifle,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   constant rearward pressure on the device's extension ledge with the shooter's trigger finger).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 66,516 (emphases added). This description covers two types of bump stocks, one that includes a mechanism like an internal spring and the other that requires the shooter to maintain pressure with his non-trigger hand.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The first type, including the original Akins Accelerator, has been classified as a \"machinegun\" and hence illegal since 2006.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 66,517. The Rule must-and does-aim at the second type-the non-mechanical bump stock-which operates only in conjunction with the shooter's added physical pressure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   But that added physical pressure is inconsistent with the statutory definition of a \"machinegun,\" which fires multiple rounds with a self-acting mechanism effected through a single pull of the trigger\n   <em>\n    simpliciter\n   </em>\n   . In short, the statute uses \"pull\" and the Rule-invalidly-uses \"pull\n   <em>\n    plus\n   </em>\n   .\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   Other parts of the Rule expose the ATF's error. In discussing its interpretation of \"automatically,\" the ATF gave the following explanation: \"[s]o long as the firearm is capable of producing multiple rounds with a single pull of the trigger until [1] the trigger finger is removed, [2] the ammunition supply is exhausted, or [3] the firearm malfunctions, the firearm shoots 'automatically' irrespective of why\n   the firing sequence ultimately ends.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 66,519. Yet elsewhere the ATF describes the firing process of a firearm with a bump stock as follows: \"the shooter 'pulls' the trigger once and allows the firearm and attached bump-stock-type device to operate until the shooter releases the trigger finger\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   the constant forward pressure with the non-trigger hand.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 66,532 (emphasis added). In my view, this assertion is an explicit recognition that a bump stock device\n   <em>\n    does not\n   </em>\n   continue shooting rounds with a single trigger pull if the shooter does not maintain \"constant forward pressure with the non-trigger hand.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 66,532.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   Moreover, I find it difficult to ignore the ATF's repeated earlier determinations that non-mechanical bump stocks do not initiate an automatic firing sequence. Three ATF determination letters from 2010 to 2013 explained why non-mechanical bump stocks are not \"machineguns\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-245\">\n   [Our] evaluation confirmed that the submitted stock (see enclosed photos) does attach to the rear of an AR-15 type rifle which has been fitted with a sliding shoulder-stock type buffer-tube assembly. The stock has no automatically functioning mechanical parts or springs and performs no automatic mechanical function when installed. In order to use the installed device, the shooter must apply constant forward pressure with the non-shooting hand and constant rearward pressure with the shooting hand.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   Determination Letter signed by John R.

The Rule does not fairly treat the ATF's repeated determinations that a non-mechanical bump stock \"performs no automatic mechanical function when installed.\" J.A. 278. Instead, it rejects its previous reading as based on an incomplete\n   <em>\n    legal\n   </em>\n   definition of \"automatically.\"\n   <em>\n    Bump-Stock-Type Devices\n   </em>\n   , 83 Fed.

And those factual findings dictate that a non-mechanical bump stock is not a \"machinegun\" under section 5845(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , a semiautomatic rifle equipped with a bump stock\n   <em>\n    cannot\n   </em>\n   fire more than one round with a\n   <em>\n    single\n   </em>\n   function of the trigger. The plaintiffs argue-and the ATF does not dispute-that the trigger of a semiautomatic rifle must release the hammer for each individual discharge. Nor is there any dispute that a semiautomatic rifle cannot fire again until the trigger is released, which causes the hammer to reset. The Rule refers to the release of the trigger as a \"separate\" function.\n   <em>\n    Bump-Stock-Type Devices\n   </em>\n   , 83 Fed. Reg. at 66,534\n   (\"While semiautomatic firearms [equipped with certain devices] may shoot one round when the trigger is pulled, the shooter must release the trigger before another round is fired. Even if this release results in a second shot being fired, it is as the result of a separate function of the trigger.\"). Once the trigger shoots, it must be released to reset the hammer and the trigger must be pulled again for each subsequent shot. Verified Declaration of Richard (Rick) Vasquez, former Acting Chief of the Firearms Tech. Branch of ATF, at 4 (with bump stock, \"after the first shot is discharged, the trigger must be released, reset, and pulled completely rearward, before the subsequent round is discharged\"),\n   <em>\n    reprinted at\n   </em>\n   J.A. 275. Thus, a semiautomatic rifle equipped with a bump stock cannot shoot more than one round with a single pull of the trigger.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   Still, the ATF insists that a bump stock allows a firearm to shoot multiple shots with a single pull.\n   <em>\n    Bump-Stock-Type Devices\n   </em>\n   , 83 Fed. Reg. at 66,553 -54. The ATF focuses on whether the shooter must pull his index finger more than once to fire multiple shots. Because a bump stock allows the firearm to fire more than once with a single pull of the index finger, the ATF concludes that a bump stock is a \"machinegun.\" Remember, however, section 5845(b) uses \"single function of the trigger,\" not single function of the shooter's trigger finger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   If the focus is-as it must be-on the trigger, a bump stock does not qualify as a \"machinegun.\" A semiautomatic rifle shoots a single round per pull of the trigger and the bump stock changes only\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   the pull is accomplished. Without a bump stock, the shooter pulls the trigger with his finger for each shot. With a bump stock, however, the shooter-after the initial pull-maintains backward pressure on the trigger and puts forward pressure on the barrel with his non-shooting hand; these manual inputs cause the rifle to slide and result in the shooter's\n   <em>\n    stationary\n   </em>\n   finger pulling the trigger.\n   <em>\n    Bump-Stock-Type Devices\n   </em>\n   , 83 Fed. Reg. at 66,533 (\"The constant forward pressure with the non-trigger hand pushes the firearm forward, again pulling the firearm forward, engaging the trigger, and firing a second round.\"). The bump stock therefore affects whether the shooter\n   <em>\n    pulls\n   </em>\n   his trigger finger or keeps it\n   <em>\n    stationary\n   </em>\n   . It does not change the movement of the trigger itself, which \"must be released, reset, and fully pulled rearward before [a] subsequent round can be fired.\" Verified Declaration of Richard (Rick) Vasquez, former Acting Chief of the Firearms Tech.

As discussed earlier, the record includes a video of a shooter firing a rifle equipped with a bump stock. The video is in slow motion and focuses on the trigger. For each shot the rifle fires, the trigger is pulled by the shooter's stationary trigger finger. The trigger is then released between each shot. And the trigger is pulled again for the next shot. This trigger movement confirms that a bump stock does not allow a rifle to shoot more than one round with\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    a single pull of the trigger. Attached as an appendix are photographs, taken from the video, that illustrate the trigger's movement during the bump stock's firing sequence.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
