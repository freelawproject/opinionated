Government Integrity, LLC, a Delaware limited liability corporation, was formed in September 2012 for the purpose of making political contributions. [redacted] On or about October 31, 2012, the trust, presumably at the direction of its trustee, wired $2.5 million to Government Integrity. Minutes after receipt, Government Integrity wired $1.8 million to the American Conservation Union, which then wired the $1.71 million contribution to the political action committee, the Now or Never PAC.

Thomas, III served as the lawyer for Government\n   Integrity and, at the same time, as the treasurer of the Now or Never PAC. Thomas filed a report with the Commission, on behalf of the PAC, listing the American Conservative Union (ACU) as the source of the $1.71 million even though ACU considered itself merely a \"pass through\" for the contribution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The General Counsel, in recommending that the Commission take enforcement action, concluded that this nearly simultaneous three-step transaction - from the trust to Government Integrity, from Government Integrity to ACU, and from ACU to the PAC - \"suggests that the parties went through significant lengths to disguise the true source of the funds.\" Third General Counsel's Report at 11, Am.

These respondents to CREW's complaint agreed not to contest the Commission's determination that each of them violated \u00a7 30122 because the source of the $1.71 million contribution had been disguised.
