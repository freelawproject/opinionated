Mutee argued that movable or unfixed structures, like the mobile home, categorically fall outside the scope of generic burglary's \"building or structure\" element.

Mutee contends that North Carolina's definition of \"building\" is overbroad because it encompasses what he calls \"movable structures\" that are not intended for overnight accommodation.
