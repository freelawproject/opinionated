The Secretary of Labor (the Secretary) brought this action against Timberline and its director, Jim Payne, alleging violations of the overtime and recordkeeping provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the Secretary, and awarded $ 439,437.42 in unpaid overtime and an equal amount in liquidated damages. The district court reasoned that Timberline was a covered enterprise under the FLSA because it \"has employees handling, selling, or otherwise working on goods or materials that have been moved in or produced for commerce by any person,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20203\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (s)(1)(A)(i), i.e., the logging and harvesting equipment manufactured outside of Michigan. Part of the damages award included time employees spent commuting from home to work or for meal periods, which the district court included in the overtime calculation after finding that Timberline had an established custom or practice of compensating its employees for such time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Defendants appeal, arguing that the district court erred in finding liability and awarding unpaid overtime and liquidated damages. We affirm the district court's liability determination. However, because the district court erred in finding that ordinary commute time and bona fide meal periods qualify as compensable hours subject to the FLSA's overtime requirements, we vacate the award of damages and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Timberline was formed in 2010 as a Michigan limited liability company. Payne is an officer of Timberline and directs all of its operations. Timberline removes raw timber from forests, cuts the timber, and transports the timber to mills for processing into paper and other products. Timberline maintains two to four worksites, each with approximately four equipment operators who cut down trees, cut the timber into lengths, and transport the timber to a landing site. Timberline also employs six to eight truck drivers, who load the timber at the landing site and transport it to the mills, as well as mechanics and an office manager. Timberline's equipment operators use heavy, specialized machinery, including harvesters and hydroaxes to cut down trees and cut the trees into lengths, and forwarders and skidders to transport the timber to the landing site or to load trucks. All of Timberline's business activities occur in Michigan: it harvests timber in Michigan; it transports timber to mills located only in Michigan; it entered into contracts for cutting timber in Michigan; and it purchased its trucks and heavy equipment from Michigan sellers. Although purchased and used only in Michigan, Timberline's trucks and heavy equipment were manufactured outside of Michigan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Payne established Timberline's compensation and recordkeeping practices. Timberline paid its employees using a daily rate, an hourly rate, or a cord\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   rate. Timberline recorded hours worked for hourly employees but did not do so for most non-hourly employees, and did not pay its employees an overtime rate for hours worked over 40 in a week.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Timberline was founded after a previous company, Timberline Logging, Inc. (Timberline Logging), went out of business. In\n   February 2011, Payne instructed his office manager to email Matthew Rooyakker, Timberline Logging's accountant, regarding whether Timberline Logging was exempt from paying overtime \"under FLSA in Tennessee.\" (R. 18-12, PID 1674.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Payne also testified that he discussed FLSA coverage with his accountant on \"a couple different occasions\" \"awhile back,\" \"before the investigation\" that led to this lawsuit. (R. 19-12, PID 2273.) According to Payne, Rooyakker told him that \"we were exempt under agriculture\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at PID 2274), although Rooyakker had not held himself out as knowledgeable about the FLSA, and Payne did not believe that his truck drivers or office workers were agricultural employees. Payne did not consult with an attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendants took the position in this lawsuit that the Motor Carrier Act exemption,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20213\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1), exempts some of Timberline's employees from FLSA coverage. In response to the Secretary's interrogatories about this exemption, Defendants stated that they relied upon the \"FLSA and publications prepared by Plaintiff\" in determining that that the Motor Carrier Act exemption applied, but Payne did not recall which publications he relied on and was not able to explain why his drivers and their helpers were exempt if the drivers only drove intrastate routes. (R. 18-4, PID 271-81.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Rooyakker testified that the only time he provided advice regarding the FLSA was at a meeting with Payne on February 17, 2011. At that meeting, in response to Timberline Logging's inquiry, Rooyakker told Payne that it appeared that \"you're exempt\" under the agricultural exemption. (R. 18-13, PID 1702.) Rooyakker testified that he did not advise which of Timberline Logging's or Timberline's employees were subject to the FLSA's agricultural exemption and never opined whether either entity's employees in Michigan may also be exempt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Wage and Hour Investigator Jeffrey Wrona of the Department of Labor (DOL) investigated Timberline for wage and recordkeeping violations for the time period of August 25, 2013 through August 20, 2015, later extended through March 20, 2017. After assessing unpaid overtime wages, the Secretary of Labor filed a complaint alleging that Defendants had violated the overtime and recordkeeping provisions of the FLSA, and sought an injunction, back wages, and liquidated damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The district court granted the Secretary's motion for summary judgment in part and denied Defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment, granted the Secretary's motion to amend the complaint to include additional employees and FLSA violations that had occurred during 2016 and 2017, awarded liquidated damages, and ordered further briefing by the parties on the amount of backpay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After two rounds of supplemental briefing, the district court issued a final summary judgment decision awarding $ 439,437.42 in backpay damages and an equal amount in liquidated damages. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   This court reviews de novo a grant of summary judgment, viewing all evidence and drawing all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\n   <em>\n    Pearce v.

Nor did the Secretary argue that Timberline was a covered enterprise because it had \"employees engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce.\" \u00a7 203(s)(1)(A)(i).

That concept\n   was added in 1961.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pub. L.

Included in the 1961 amendment was the addition of the handling clause. In 1974, Congress clarified that the handling clause was an independent basis for enterprise coverage\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and added \"or materials\" to that clause.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 1220-21. \"Materials\" is not defined in the statute. \"Goods\" is, however, and contains what is often called the \"ultimate-consumer exception,\" excluding from the definition \"goods after their delivery into the actual physical possession of the ultimate consumer thereof other than a producer, manufacturer, or processor thereof.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20203\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i). The district court held that Timberline is a covered enterprise under the handling clause because Timberline's employees' use of logging and harvesting equipment manufactured outside of Michigan constitutes \"handling, selling, or otherwise working on goods or materials that have been moved in or produced for commerce by any person.\" \u00a7 203(s)(1)(A)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendants argue that Timberline is not a covered enterprise because the only thing Timberline's employees \"handle\" is timber, which never crosses state lines; and that even if they \"handled\" the logging and harvesting equipment, that equipment does not qualify as \"materials,\" but rather qualifies as \"goods,\" and that Timberline is the ultimate consumer of those goods such that the FLSA does not apply. (Appellants' Br. at 11-14, 16-18.) Further, Defendants argue that finding enterprise coverage in this case \"would effectively erase the commerce requirement necessary for FLSA jurisdiction\" because \"[e]very business uses computers made overseas, or pencils and pens made out of state, or copiers, paper, or telephones made in other jurisdictions.\" (Appellants' Br. at 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We begin our analysis of the \"handling clause\" with the language of the statute.\n   <em>\n    Brilliance Audio, Inc. v. Haights Cross Commc'ns, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5713499\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/474/365/#p371\">\n    474 F.3d 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 371 (6th Cir. 2007). \"If the language of the statute is clear, then the inquiry is complete, and the court should look no further. Only if the statute is `inescapably ambiguous' should a court look to other persuasive authority in an attempt to discern legislative meaning.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5713499\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/474/365/#p371\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The plain language of the statute contradicts Defendants' arguments that Timberline is not a covered enterprise because \"[t]he only good or material that Timberline handles, sells, or otherwise works on within the meaning of the FLSA, is the timber itself,\" and because Timberline's employees \"did not place th[e logging and harvesting] equipment in commerce themselves.\" (Appellants' Br. at 12.) We find no merit to these arguments because it is not relevant under the statute that Timberline employees did not place the logging and harvesting equipment in commerce themselves; the plain language of the statute provides coverage where employees handle, sell, or otherwise work on \"goods or materials that\n   <em>\n    have been moved in or produced\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    for commerce by any person.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20203\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (s)(1)(A)(i) (emphasis added). \"The tense is in the past.

Further, the statute makes clear that it applies when\n   <em>\n    any person\n   </em>\n   -not just the employees of the enterprise-has moved or produced the handled goods or materials in commerce. Because the logging and harvesting equipment had previously been moved in and produced for commerce by others prior to being handled by Timberline employees, this part of the statute is satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Less clear is whether the logging and harvesting equipment constitute \"goods\" or \"materials\" and whether Timberline is the ultimate consumer of the logging and harvesting equipment such that if the logging and harvesting equipment qualify as goods and not materials, the ultimate-consumer exception operates to exclude Timberline from coverage. \"[P]recisely determining the correct ordinary meaning of `materials' for the FLSA is challenging because the FLSA's statutory definition of `goods' is so expansive, ostensibly including some items that could also fall under the ordinary meaning of `materials.'\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1223.

Further, even if the timber was used by the mills to make other products, such as paper, and then shipped across state lines, the fact that the timber was altered before crossing state lines weighs against finding the MCA exemption applicable.\n   <em>\n    See Mazzarella,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5917549\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/786/#p790\">\n    823 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   791-93 (citing\n   <em>\n    Collins v.

Briefing Before the District Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Three rounds of briefing occurred before the district court granted summary judgment on damages. In the Secretary's original summary judgment brief, Investigator Wrona estimated that Timberline owed unpaid overtime of $ 468,595.80 for 50 employees. Wrona explained that he primarily relied on Timberline's payroll records to calculate unpaid overtime. However, because Timberline lacked hours-worked records for some employees, Wrona had to use other methods to reconstruct the hours those employees worked. Defendants argued in part that in extrapolating hours worked from the employees' pay records, the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20254\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), required a reduction in the number of hours for the time employees spent on meals and in traveling to and from their homes to their workplaces- hours for which the employees were paid, but which do not count as work. After the original summary judgment briefing, the district court rejected Defendants' argument that the Portal-to-Portal Act required such a reduction, finding that Defendants had an established custom or practice of compensating for such time. The district court also ordered supplemental briefing to clarify inconsistencies in the record and to provide requested information in a specific format.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In the Secretary's first supplemental brief, he calculated revised unpaid overtime to be $ 454,684.73 for the 50 employees. The Secretary explained that 43 out of the 50 employees were paid an hourly rate for their entire employment, and because Defendants kept records of their hours worked, \"[c]omputing overtime for these employees is a simple case of arithmetic based upon Defendants' own records.\" (R. 38, PID 3725-26.) The Secretary explained that he computed back wages for the remaining seven employees without complete hours-worked records by: \"(1) averaging the number of hours similarly situated employees worked per week or (2) averaging the number of hours individual employees worked each workweek based upon time records previously kept for each employee prior to Defendants changing the employee compensation to non-hourly and ceas[ing] keeping the required records.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PID 3726.) The Secretary also presented voluminous data showing how he arrived at the calculated unpaid overtime. Defendants argued in response that the calculations performed by the Secretary for the non-hourly employees lacked credibility because the calculations guessed at hours worked and pay rate, contained errors, and led to absurd results because Defendants presented evidence that their employees were paid significantly more than the industry average.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The district court noted certain discrepancies that required additional briefing but also rejected many of Defendants' arguments that the data was inflated and that industry-aggregate data should be used instead. It reasoned that \"Defendants simply reassert their overarching argument that their compensation scheme resulted in compensation that far exceeded industry\n   averages and, therefore, that they should be excused from their obligations under the FLSA overtime provisions. They cite no authority for this proposition.\" (R. 43, PID 4187.) The district court also noted that Defendants were critiquing the Secretary's \"methodology largely by cherry picking particular workweeks with unusually high gross wages or unusually low gross wages\" and were essentially attacking \"the statistical concept of an average.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PID 4188.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In the Secretary's second supplemental brief regarding damages, the Secretary addressed the district court's identified concerns and recalculated unpaid overtime to $ 445,533.49, which reflected a change of unpaid overtime for three non-hourly employees and one hourly employee. Defendants responded by arguing that the Secretary's third attempt still contained errors, which they said evidenced a total lack of credibility in the Secretary's calculations, and thus the district court should award no damages or use the industry-aggregate data to determine unpaid overtime. They also reasserted their argument that the award should be reduced due to compensation for commute and meal time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The district court made reductions to the Secretary's claimed unpaid overtime to address errors identified by Defendants, but otherwise rejected Defendants' arguments. The district court awarded damages for unpaid overtime of $ 439,437.42, and an equal amount in liquidated damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Arguments on Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   On appeal, Defendants appear to make two legal arguments. First, Defendants argue that the district court erred in not applying the Portal-to-Portal Act to reduce overtime owed by the time the employees spent during meals and traveling to and from work. Second, Defendants argue that because each of the Secretary's calculations of overtime contained errors and inconsistences, the Secretary failed to meet his burden to prove damages, and the district court should have entered an award of no damages or ordered that industry-aggregate data be used to arrive at a just and reasonable damages amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

These affidavits stated that the employee \"was paid for driving to and from the worksite, but [he] did not have an agreement or understanding that this time would be included in any calculation of overtime.\" (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   R. 41-12, PID 4167.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The affidavits also stated that the employee \"took a half-hour lunch when [he] could fit it in\" and that the employee included \"drive time and lunch time in total hours.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Although the plain language of the Portal-to-Portal Act suggests that home-to-work commutes are deemed compensable if the employer has a custom or practice of compensating for such work,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20785.34\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 785.34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   explains that \"ordinary travel from home to work (see \u00a7 785.35) need not be counted as hours worked even if the employer agrees to pay for it.\" And,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20785.35\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 785.35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   says plainly that \"[n]ormal travel from home to work is not worktime.\" The reason is that the FLSA only requires overtime compensation for \"actual work or employment,\"\n   <em>\n    Tenn.

Defendants further argue that Timberline's pay structure resulting in higher-than-average compensation for its employees makes an award of liquidated damages particularly unjust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Defendants have not presented sufficient evidence to meet their substantial burden to prove both good faith and reasonable grounds for the incorrect classification. As to the drivers, shop workers, and office workers, Payne himself testified that he knew these employees were not agricultural workers. Although Payne attempted to justify exempting his drivers and shop workers under the MCA exemption, Payne never sought advice for this decision or took any other active steps to inform himself regarding this determination. Further, he acknowledged that his drivers never crossed state lines, and he was not able to explain any reasonable grounds he may have had for determining that the MCA exemption applied to purely intrastate drivers. Thus, Defendants have not met their substantial burden to prove both good faith and reasonable grounds for the incorrect classification of Timberline's drivers, shop workers, and office workers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Defendants' employees performing harvesting and logging duties present a closer question. Taking Payne's testimony as true, he talked to Rooyakker on several occasions about whether the agricultural exemption applied. Although caselaw usually cites discussions with attorneys or government officials as evidence of good faith,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g., Elwell,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9453257\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/276/832/#p840\">\n    276 F.3d at 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Nor has University suggested that it was relying on the expertise or opinion of any other person or entity with knowledge of the FLSA regulations, including its attorney or the Department of Labor.\");\n   <em>\n    Featsent v.

Fiskardo Estiatorio, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4176845\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/788/253/#p316\">\n    788 F.Supp.2d 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 316-17 (S.D.N.Y. 2011). However, several undisputed facts weigh against finding that Defendants could meet their burden here. First, Payne knew that Rooyakker's advice was flawed or incomplete, at least with respect to truck drivers and office workers. Second, Payne never discussed any of his employees' duties with Rooyakker such that Payne could reasonably believe that Rooyakker was advising that specific employees were exempt. And third, Rooyakker did not hold himself out as an expert in FLSA matters, and indeed\n   never provided anyone else with advice on such matters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Further, Defendants do not attempt to explain on appeal how a determination that any of their employees fell under the agricultural exemption was reasonable. The district court summarily rejected that the agricultural exemption applied; Defendants do not raise this issue on appeal; and Defendants' briefing regarding liquidated damages focuses primarily on the MCA exemption. Under these circumstances, Payne's general discussions with Rooyakker are insufficient as a matter of law for Defendants to meet their heavy burden to prove both good faith and reasonable grounds for the incorrect classification.\n   <em>\n    See Doty v. Elias,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"576183\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/733/720/#p726\">\n    733 F.2d 720\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 726 (10th Cir. 1984) (finding that advice of an accountant that compensation scheme was legal eight to ten years prior to trial was insufficient to meet employer's burden where the employer \"never sought an opinion from an attorney or the relevant government agency regarding the legality of\" the compensation scheme and did not read government literature regarding wage and hour laws).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Finally, as the district court explained, Defendants' argument that they compensated their employees above the industry average is irrelevant to whether they met their burden to establish good faith and reasonable grounds for the determination that Timberline's employees were exempt from overtime coverage. If they had established both of those prongs, the district court could consider the overall compensation in the exercise of its discretion in awarding liquidated damages. But having failed to meet their burden, this argument is misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Accordingly, the district court correctly held that it had no discretion to award liquidated damages in an amount less than the amount of unpaid overtime compensation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20216\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).
