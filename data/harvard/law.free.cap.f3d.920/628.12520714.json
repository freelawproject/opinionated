The district court assigned Johnson a base offense level of 20 based on a determination that Johnson had previously been convicted of a \"crime of violence\" as that term is used in \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A) of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\"USSG\" or the \"Guidelines\"), and sentenced Johnson to 30 months' imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On appeal, Johnson argues that the district court erred by applying a crime-of-violence enhancement to his offense level. We first consider whether Johnson's concessions in the district court foreclose his newly minted argument that his underlying conviction for violation of California Penal Code (\"CPC\") \u00a7 245(a)(1) was not actually a felony under California law. Reviewing de novo, we also examine Johnson's CPC \u00a7 245(a)(1) conviction to determine whether it truly was for a felony, and if so, whether, in light of\n   <em>\n    Moncrieffe v. Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697041\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/184/\">\n    569 U.S. 184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697041\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/184/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697041\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/184/\">\n    185 L.Ed.2d 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013), a felony conviction for violating CPC \u00a7 245(a)(1) can be a predicate offense for a crime-of-violence enhancement. Because the answer to all\n   three questions is yes, we affirm Johnson's sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A grand jury in the District of Nevada indicted Johnson for possession of a firearm after having been convicted of a felony, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1) and 924(a)(2). Johnson pleaded guilty without a plea agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The U.S. Probation Office assigned Johnson a base offense level of 20 pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A), because of Johnson's prior conviction for a felony crime of violence. The predicate crime was Johnson's 2014 California conviction for assault with a deadly weapon (not a firearm), in violation of CPC \u00a7 245(a)(1), for which Johnson served six months in county jail. Probation reduced the offense level by three for acceptance of responsibility, resulting in a total offense level of seventeen. Johnson's advisory Guidelines range was thirty-to-thirty-seven months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Johnson objected to Probation's classification of his assault-with-a-deadly-weapon conviction as a crime of violence on the basis that the state offense lacked the mens rea to qualify as a crime of violence under the categorical approach. Johnson did not, however, object to Probation's classification of his CPC \u00a7 245(a)(1) conviction as a felony, or otherwise assert that the conviction was not for an offense punishable by more than one year in prison. Rather, he conceded in his sentencing memorandum that \"[h]e has two prior felony convictions .... [He] received his second felony conviction for Assault with a Deadly Weapon-Not a Firearm, for which he received a suspended six-month jail sentence and three years of probation.\" The district judge asked whether Johnson or his attorney found any \"errors or discrepancies\" in the presentence investigation report (\"PSR\"); both answered that they had not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The district court held that a conviction under CPC \u00a7 245(a)(1) is a crime of violence, and overruled Johnson's objections to the PSR. The court sentenced Johnson to thirty months' imprisonment, the low end of his advisory Guidelines range. Johnson timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"We review 'de novo a district court's determination that a prior conviction qualifies as a \"crime of violence\" under the Guidelines ....\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Johnson argues that we should review this issue de novo because he has merely advanced a new argument in support of his preserved claim that the crime-of-violence enhancement was improper. The government urges us to review for plain error only because Johnson failed to make this argument in the district court and because our consideration of this argument would invite improper appellate fact-finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As we explain below, this dispute is immaterial to our analysis because Johnson's argument fails under plain error and de novo review. We believe, however, that resolution of this sub-issue is actually governed by Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure Rule 32(i)(3)(A), which permits a district court to find as facts, uncontroverted factual statements in the PSR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Guidelines assign a base offense level of twenty for the offense of unlawful firearms possession by a felon if \"the defendant committed any part of the instant offense subsequent to sustaining one felony conviction of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\" USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A).

Because under California law, a misdemeanor is not punishable by a prison term exceeding one year, Johnson asserts that the crime-of-violence enhancement should not apply. Ultimately, Johnson's concessions in the district court foreclose this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The relevant Commentary to the Guidelines defines \"felony conviction\" as \"a prior adult federal or state conviction for an offense punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, regardless of whether such offense is specifically designated as a felony and regardless of the actual sentence imposed.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   USSG \u00a7 2K2.1 cmt. n.1. The underlying statute of conviction here provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Any person who commits an assault upon the person of another with a deadly weapon or instrument other than a firearm shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for two, three, or four years, or in a county jail for not exceeding one year, or by a fine not exceeding ten thousand dollars ($ 10,000), or by both the fine and imprisonment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   CPC \u00a7 245(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The variety of punishments that a defendant can receive for being convicted under CPC \u00a7 245(a)(1) demonstrate that the statute is a wobbler. \"In the parlance of California law enforcement, a violation of the statute is a 'wobbler' that may be punished either as a felony or as a misdemeanor.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Bridgeforth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1037230\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/441/864/#p872\">\n    441 F.3d 864\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 872 (9th Cir. 2006).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   If not, the offense remains a felony. A conviction becomes a \"misdemeanor for all purposes\" when certain conditions are met, including, as relevant here: \"[a]fter a judgment imposing a punishment other than imprisonment in the state prison or\" \"[w]hen the court grants probation to a defendant\" without imposition of a sentence \"and at the time of granting probation ... declares the offense to be a misdemeanor.\" CPC \u00a7 17(b)(1) &amp; (3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Johnson argues that his sentence of six months in the county jail conclusively establishes that he received a \"punishment other than imprisonment in the state prison,\" thus converting his CPC \u00a7 245(a)(1) conviction into a \"misdemeanor for all purposes\" under CPC \u00a7 17(b)(1). In addition, Johnson asks us to take judicial notice of several documents related to sentencing in his underlying CPC \u00a7 245(a)(1) conviction that, in Johnson's view, establish that his sentence converted his wobbler conviction into a misdemeanor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We reject Johnson's belated attempts to characterize his underlying California conviction as a misdemeanor. Pursuant to Rule 32(i)(3)(A), the district court \"may accept any undisputed portion of the presentence report as a finding of fact.\" The PSR clearly characterized Johnson's assault-with-a-deadly-weapon conviction as a felony. As discussed above, not only did Johnson fail to challenge that description, his counsel affirmatively represented to the court that he had two prior felony convictions, including the CPC \u00a7 245(a)(1) conviction at issue here. Additionally, Johnson and his attorney confirmed, in open court, the factual accuracy of the PSR. Because Johnson did not dispute that he had a felony conviction, the district court was entitled, under Rule 32, to accept as a fact the PSR's characterization of his offense of conviction. Thus, pursuant to Rule 32, Johnson's concessions in the district court foreclose his argument that his conviction was not a felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Johnson nonetheless argues that the PSR's description of his CPC \u00a7 245(a) conviction is at least ambiguous because it also contained the notation that he was \"sentenced to six months in jail,\" which, according to Johnson, means that he received a qualifying misdemeanor sentence under CPC \u00a7 17(b)(1). We deem that notation irrelevant because Johnson conceded that the PSR accurately described the conviction as a felony. But even were this not so, the mere fact that Johnson received a\n   six-month jail sentence does not necessarily mean that his conviction was for a misdemeanor. The PSR does not indicate that the California sentencing court entered a judgment imposing a six-month sentence. Indeed, Johnson's six-month term could have been a condition of probation (which seems very likely, for the reasons discussed below), in which case, the \"six months in jail\" notation would not contradict the PSR's characterization of the offense as a felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We addressed a similar situation in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Grajeda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755018\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/581/1186/\">\n    581 F.3d 1186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2009), and our resolution of the issue in\n   <em>\n    Grajeda\n   </em>\n   is instructive here. Grajeda argued on appeal that the district court erred by failing to resolve a factual dispute surrounding the prior convictions described in the PSR.\n   <em>\n    Grajeda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755018\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/581/1186/\">\n    581 F.3d at 1188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We reviewed the objections that Grajeda made in the district court and concluded that, contrary to his assertions on appeal, \"his objections raised only\n   <em>\n    legal\n   </em>\n   arguments, not factual ones. Grajeda did not controvert the accuracy of the PSR or argue that he had not been convicted of the listed crimes.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755018\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/581/1186/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755018\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/581/1186/\">\n    at 1189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because Grajeda did not challenge the factual basis for his sentencing enhancement, Rule 32 permitted the district court to accept the PSR's factual findings regarding his underlying convictions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755018\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/581/1186/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755018\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/581/1186/\">\n    at 1188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   So too here. The record shows that Johnson did not challenge the factual accuracy of the PSR's description of his CPC \u00a7 245(a)(1) conviction as a felony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, like the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Grajeda\n   </em>\n   , Johnson's objections were purely legal: he argued that CPC \u00a7 245(a)(1) is overbroad under the categorical approach and thus cannot be considered a crime of violence. Because Johnson failed to controvert the PSR's felony classification of his \u00a7 245(a)(1) conviction, the district court was entitled to accept that aspect of the PSR as a finding of fact under Rule 32.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Romero-Rendon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11213417\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/220/1159/\">\n    220 F.3d 1159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1163 n.4 (9th Cir. 2000) (\"The government bears the burden of proving the facts underlying the enhancement. Where, as here, it submits the PSR as proof, and the defendant submits no contrary evidence, the only evidence before the sentencing judge is the uncontroverted PSR. In these cases, a judge may rely on it to establish the factual basis for the enhancement.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We also hold alternatively that Johnson has failed to establish that he received a misdemeanor sentence for his \u00a7 245(a)(1) conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Johnson asserts that the state court record supports his claim because the sentencing court asked, before commencing the proceeding, whether there existed \"any legal cause why judgment should not be pronounced.\" While we agree that the court's statement suggested it was about to enter a judgment, we do not agree with Johnson that the court actually did impose a judgment (none appears in the documents that Johnson submitted) or that even if it did so, any such judgment would convert his conviction into a misdemeanor by operation of CPC \u00a7 17(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Rather, the documents that Johnson submitted contain numerous indications that Johnson received a sentence that did not convert his conviction to a misdemeanor. First the document titled \"Felony Plea Form,\" suggests that Johnson pleaded guilty to a felony. Second, that Form shows Johnson's initials next to this statement: \"As a convicted felon, I will not\n   be able to own or possess any firearm.\" Third, the sentencing memorandum filed in the case, and signed by the defendant, the defense attorney, and the judicial officer, has two boxes at the top: \"Felony\" and \"Misdemeanor.\" \"Felony\" is checked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the documents make clear that Johnson received, in addition to a term in county jail, a term of 36 months' formal probation. The documents also show that Johnson's 180-day term in county jail was not a standalone sentence, but rather was a \"legal restriction apply[ing] to a decision to grant probation in this case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \"[A]n order granting probation is not a judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.
