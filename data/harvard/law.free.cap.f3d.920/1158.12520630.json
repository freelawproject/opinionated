We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Sioux City adopted an ordinance making it \"unlawful for any person to own, possess, keep, exercise control over, maintain, harbor, transport or sell within the City of Sioux City, Iowa, any pit bull.\" Sioux City, Ia., Code \u00a7 7.10.030 (2009). Myers resided in Sioux City in 2015 and 2016 when the city enforced the pit bull ban against her dogs Tink and Radar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Myers, Jennifer Frost, and \"Jane Doe\" filed suit alleging that the pit bull ban was unconstitutional. The parties stipulated to the dismissal of Frost and Doe when they moved outside Sioux City and therefore \"no longer reasonably anticipate[d] that they or their dogs [would] face enforcement under the challenged ordinance.\" Myers continued as the plaintiff, seeking a declaration that the pit bull ban was facially unconstitutional, an injunction against\n   enforcing the pit bull ban in the future, costs and attorneys' fees based on 42 U.S.C \u00a7 1988, and \"all such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In a deposition, Myers admitted that she does not currently own a dog because she and her fianc\u00e9 \"work full time\" and \"don't have time right now.\" Myers then stated in a declaration that she does not currently reside in Sioux City, Iowa, that she intends to adopt a dog \"in the near future,\" and that \"when [she] adopt[s] a dog, [she] will likely also take it to Sioux City\" to visit family, friends, and her veterinarian. Based on these facts, the district court,\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , dismissed all of Myers's claims due to lack of standing.

But Myers does not own a dog and does not live in Sioux City. And her intention to adopt a dog \"in the near future\" is uncertain as is her prediction that she will \"likely\" take it into Sioux City. In short, the threat of future injury to Myers from the pit bull ban is \"conjectural or hypothetical\" and therefore insufficient to confer standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of L.A. v.

Myers does not show how the past seizure of Tink and Radar creates a \"present right\" let alone how her requested facial invalidation of the pit bull ban would redress it. \"In a case of this sort, where the plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, past injuries alone are insufficient to establish standing.

Here, the record is clear. The district court did not question Myers's credibility, though it did conclude that her \"argument [was] unconvincing\" as to standing. Myers argues she should have had the opportunity to provide additional detail about her intention to obtain a pit bull. But additional details are not disputed facts.
