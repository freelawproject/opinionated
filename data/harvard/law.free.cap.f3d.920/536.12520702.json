Fenstermaker was tried and convicted in Minnesota state court in January 2013. A couple of months earlier, a jury had been impaneled in the prosecution of the same charge against him, but the state trial court declared a mistrial before the trial actually began. The court found that a mistrial was a manifest necessity because an injury sustained by the prosecutor litigating the case appeared certain to delay the trial beyond the empaneled jury's term of service. Following his convictions, Fenstermaker appealed, challenging the trial court's denial of his motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds. The Minnesota Court of Appeals recognized that Fenstermaker's double jeopardy issue presented a \"close case,\" but it ultimately concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by declaring a mistrial out of manifest necessity.\n   <em>\n    State v. Fenstermaker\n   </em>\n   , No. A13-1082,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204290318\">\n    2014 WL 4290318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (Minn. Ct. App. Sept. 2, 2014). Fenstermaker petitioned the district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   for a writ of habeas corpus. The district court denied the petition, concluding the state court did not unreasonably apply clearly established federal law. Fenstermaker now asks this court to reverse the judgment of the district court and grant the writ. We decline to do so and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The State of Minnesota charged Fenstermaker with first-degree and third-degree sexual assault. His trial was scheduled for Wednesday, November 14, 2012. On that day, a jury was selected and sworn in. Opening arguments were scheduled to start Friday, November 16. On Thursday, November 15, the State requested a continuance until Monday, November 19, because the assigned prosecutor had suffered a back injury and could not proceed with the trial as scheduled. The court granted the continuance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On Sunday, November 18, a supervising prosecutor notified the court that the assigned prosecutor was still at home, unable to walk, and on medication. The supervising attorney appeared in court on Monday. He reiterated the injured attorney's unavailability\n   and also stated that no other prosecutor in the office had time to prepare for the trial. He emphasized that the assigned prosecutor's relationship with the witnesses and jury were critical to the case proceeding fairly. The State then moved for a mistrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The State said it was willing to discuss other options, such as continuing the trial to the following week, as long as the assigned prosecutor could return by then. Fenstermaker's counsel opposed the motion for mistrial but said he was available the following week for a trial. The court then said it would make time for trial the following week, but only if a trial could be certain to begin. Upon reflection, however, the court granted the State's motion for mistrial. The court based its decision on the sudden and severe nature of the prosecutor's injury and the uncertainty of her availability the following week. The court also considered that the injury's occurrence on the eve of trial made it \"virtually impossible\" for another prosecutor to substitute. Resp. to Pet. for Writ of Habeas Corpus, Addendum Tr.

The trial court, noting it had been prepared to declare a mistrial sua sponte in light of the circumstances, expressed concern about the possible expiration of the jury's term of service before the case could finish.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Trial was rescheduled and held about two months later with the original prosecutor on January 22, 2013. At trial, Fenstermaker moved to dismiss, arguing that the trial would violate his constitutional right not to be subject to double jeopardy. The court denied the motion. The jury convicted Fenstermaker of the charged crime. On appeal before the Minnesota Court of Appeals, Fenstermaker argued that the trial court abused its discretion because there was no manifest necessity justifying the mistrial. The appeals court disagreed, but it noted that the double jeopardy issue presented a \"close case.\"\n   <em>\n    Fenstermaker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204290318\">\n    2014 WL 4290318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *6. Fenstermaker then sought and was denied review by the Minnesota Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After he exhausted his state court appellate opportunities, Fenstermaker filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus with the district court, arguing that the Minnesota Court of Appeals erred in rejecting his double jeopardy claim. The magistrate judge recommended that the district court deny Fenstermaker's petition. The district court adopted the magistrate judge's report and recommendation, concluding that the Minnesota courts did not unreasonably apply clearly established federal law. Specifically, the district court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [T]he magistrate judge was correct to find that it was not manifestly unreasonable to conclude that a continuance was an inviable option, given the short time remaining in the jury's term of service, and the complete uncertainty regarding when, if ever, the prosecutor would be available to return to the courtroom.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Fenstermaker v.

[The assigned prosecutor] is an experienced trial lawyer. She handles these types of cases.

The court first considered whether the\n   state could utilize a substitute prosecutor. Reviewing the record, it is clear the trial court weighed this possibility and determined that it was unreasonable. The trial court credited the State's assertion that no alternate prosecutor was sufficiently familiar with the case and that the assigned prosecutor had \"rapport with the victim, which ... is important in a criminal-sexual-conduct case.\"\n   <em>\n    Fenstermaker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204290318\">\n    2014 WL 4290318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5.

Additionally, the trial court commented that, were the roles reversed, it would grant a mistrial in favor of the defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The trial court considered granting a continuance, but it found that to be an unsatisfactory remedy. The length of the injured prosecutor's incapacity was unknown at the time the court decided the mistrial motion. Fenstermaker points out that she actually returned to the office only a week later, but the court's decision did not have the benefit of this hindsight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On this record, we conclude that the Minnesota Court of Appeals' decision upholding the trial court's exercise of discretion was not objectively unreasonable. Its conclusion that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by declaring that manifest necessity justified the mistrial grant did not violate Fenstermaker's Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights. Even where\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   reasonable jurists might disagree over the best remedy for a trial problem, the trial judge must have the power to declare a mistrial in appropriate cases, for the interest in orderly, impartial procedure would be impaired if he were deterred from exercising that power by a concern that any time a reviewing court disagreed with his assessment of the trial situation a retrial would automatically be barred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Wengler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3499705\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/589/976/#p981\">\n    589 F.3d at 984\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cleaned up).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We acknowledge, as the Minnesota Court of Appeals noted, that this case is closer than some, and \"[i]n a strict, literal sense, the mistrial was not 'necessary.' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185127\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/497/#p505\">\n    434 U.S. at 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185127\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/497/#p505\">\n    98 S.Ct. 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   [i]n this context, a 'less drastic alternative' does not mean any conceivable option available to the trial judge. It means a reasonable and satisfactory alternative-a solution to a trial problem which strikes a better balance between \"the defendant's interest in proceeding to the verdict\" and the \"competing and equally legitimate demand for public justice\" than would a mistrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wengler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3499705\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/589/976/#p981\">\n    589 F.3d at 983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Somerville\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11957586\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/410/458/#p462\">\n    410 U.S. at 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11957586\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/410/458/#p462\">\n    93 S.Ct. 1066\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).
