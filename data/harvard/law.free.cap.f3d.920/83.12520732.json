(\"3 Comm\"), through a rigged bidding process. He pleaded guilty and was ordered to pay mandatory restitution of $ 408,208.42 pursuant to the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (\"MVRA\"), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(a)(1), (c)(1)(A) &amp; (B). On appeal, he asks us to vacate the restitution order and remand for a new calculation of restitution. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Gonz\u00e1lez-Calder\u00f3n did not object to the restitution amount at sentencing; hence, we review for plain error.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Salas-Fern\u00e1ndez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3781313\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/620/45/#p48\">\n    620 F.3d 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 48 (1st Cir. 2010). He must therefore show \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected [his] substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Duarte\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11106104\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/246/56/#p60\">\n    246 F.3d 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 60 (1st Cir. 2001). His appeal fails at the first step because we discern no error in the district court's restitution calculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Generally, a restitution order pursuant to the MVRA is proper if it is \"record-based and constitutes a fair appraisal of [the victim's] actual losses.\"\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Naphaeng\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518875\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/906/173/#p182\">\n    906 F.3d 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 182 (1st Cir. 2018) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518875\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/906/173/#p182\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518875\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/906/173/#p182\">\n    at 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that restitution under the MVRA \"is designed to compensate the victim, not to punish the offender,\" and is thus calculated based on the victim's actual losses).

Although he does not dispute that \"the gross amount earned by the conspiracy\" as a result of the rigged bidding process -- that is, the total amount paid by the House for the installation and servicing of a new telecommunications system -- was $ 482,208.42, he argues that the payment amount is not equivalent to the victim's actual loss. To that end, he asserts that the rigged bidding system resulted in the delivery of\n   a telecommunications system that the House continues to use, at a lower price than that offered by other bidders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   It is true that \"restitution should not be ordered if the loss would have occurred regardless of the defendant's misconduct\"; there must be a but-for connection between the defendant's fraud and the victim's pecuniary harm.\n   <em>\n    Alphas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4182077\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/785/775/#p787\">\n    785 F.3d at 786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cutter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1024130,9313013\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/313/1/\">\n    313 F.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 7 (1st Cir. 2002) ). However, the record supports the conclusion that the House would not have initiated a bidding process for a telecommunications system if not for the conspiracy. The uncontested allegations underlying the charges to which Gonz\u00e1lez-Calder\u00f3n pleaded guilty suggest that the conspirators concocted the need for a new telecommunications system with the goal of steering contracts to 3 Comm. In other words, the record supports the conclusion that the conspiracy was the but-for cause of the House's telecommunications payments. Gonz\u00e1lez-Calder\u00f3n has not pointed to any authority or support for the proposition that the payments do not constitute a loss merely because the House continues to use the telecommunications system installed by 3 Comm. He also has failed to develop any alternative argument that certain amounts should have been deducted from the restitution calculation as \"legitimate\" payments notwithstanding the conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Zannino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10526539\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/895/1/#p17\">\n    895 F.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (holding that arguments not sufficiently developed on appeal are deemed waived).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Finally, we are unconvinced by Gonz\u00e1lez-Calder\u00f3n's contention that his position draws support from\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kilpatrick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4332009\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/798/365/\">\n    798 F.3d 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2015). In\n   <em>\n    Kilpatrick\n   </em>\n   , the Sixth Circuit reversed a restitution award because the sentencing court concededly used the defendant's gain as a proxy for the victim's actual loss where there was essentially no evidence concerning that loss.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4332009\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/798/365/\">\n    798 F.3d at 389-90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The appellate court, however, recognized that, in some cases, a \"defendant's gain can act as\n   <em>\n    a measure of\n   </em>\n   ... the victim's loss.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4332009\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/798/365/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4332009\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/798/365/\">\n    at 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). In this case, as we have explained, the record supports a determination that the dollar amount pocketed by the conspirators is a reasonably accurate measure of the victim's actual loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We therefore affirm the district court's award of $ 408,208.42 in restitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    So ordered\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    We assume without deciding, favorably to Gonz\u00e1lez-Calder\u00f3n, that his conceded failure to object to the district court's restitution award constituted forfeiture rather than waiver. We therefore do not opine on whether the government's waiver argument, which focuses on his failure to object to the restitution recommendation in the Presentence Investigation Report, is correct.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    We agree with Gonz\u00e1lez-Calder\u00f3n's assumption that the district court calculated the restitution award based on the amount of the payments made by the House of Representatives -- $ 482,208.42 -- but inadvertently ordered payment of $ 408,208.42. There is nothing in the record that would otherwise explain the $ 74,000 discrepancy. The government has not challenged this \"oversight,\" which benefits Gonz\u00e1lez-Calder\u00f3n. In any event, whether the district court intended to award $ 482,208.42, or simply meant to use that amount as a starting point before slightly reducing the award, our analysis remains unchanged. The record supports an award of $ 482,208.42, and there is no reason to conclude that a slightly reduced award constitutes plain error prejudicing Gonz\u00e1lez-Calder\u00f3n.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
