(\"Siny\") appeals a decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (\"Board\") affirming the examining attorney's refusal to register Siny's proposed mark. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Siny filed trademark application Serial No. 86754400 on September 11, 2015, seeking to register the mark CASALANA in standard characters for \"Knit pile fabric made with wool for use as a textile in the manufacture of outerwear, gloves, apparel, and accessories\" based on use in commerce under Section 1(a) of the Lanham Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201051\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Siny also submitted a specimen consisting of a webpage printout, which purported to show the mark in use in commerce for the goods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The examining attorney initially refused registration because the specimen \"appear[ed] to be mere advertising material\" and thus failed to show the requisite use in commerce for the goods. J.A. 74. The examining attorney noted in particular that the specimen did not include a means for ordering the goods. In response, Siny submitted a substitute specimen (the \"Webpage Specimen\"), which was the same webpage but with additional text showing. The Webpage Specimen is reproduced below:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   J.A. 61-62. Siny responded to the refusal by arguing that the Webpage Specimen included a means to purchase the goods-namely, the text \"For sales information:\" followed by a phone number and email address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The examining attorney rejected that argument in a final refusal. He found that the cited text alone was insufficient for consumers to make a purchase; rather, it only indicated how consumers could obtain more information necessary to make a purchase. The examining attorney noted the absence of what he considered necessary ordering information, such as minimum quantities, cost, payment options, or shipping information. He therefore maintained the refusal based on the submitted specimen's failure to show the requisite use in commerce for the goods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Siny appealed the refusal to the Board. In a split decision, the Board affirmed. The Board initially noted that for a mark to be in use in commerce on goods, it may be \"placed in any manner on the goods or their containers or the displays associated\n   therewith or on the tags or labels affixed thereto.\" J.A. 2 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201127\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The Board observed that the Webpage Specimen was not an example of the mark being placed on the goods or their containers, tags, or labels. Rather, Siny contended that the Webpage Specimen constituted a \"display associated with the goods.\" J.A. 2. The Board cited precedent as supporting a general requirement that for such a display to show the requisite use in commerce, it must be a \"point of sale\" display and not mere advertising. J.A. 2-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Board then considered the Webpage Specimen in detail. It found that the Webpage Specimen lacked much of the information the Board would consider essential to a purchasing decision-e.g., a price (or even a range of prices) for the goods, the minimum quantities one may order, accepted methods of payment, or how the goods would be shipped. J.A. 8. The Board appreciated Siny's contention that because the goods were industrial materials for use by customers in manufacture, the ultimate sales transaction may have to involve some assistance from Siny's sales personnel. J.A. 9;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   J.A. 3. Yet it found that, \"while some details must be worked out by telephone, if virtually all important aspects of the transaction must be determined from information extraneous to the web page, then the web page is not a point of sale.\" J.A. 9. The Board added that in cases where the goods are technical and specialized and the applicant and examining attorney disagree on the point-of-sale nature of a submitted webpage specimen, \"the applicant would be well advised to provide the examining attorney with additional evidence and information regarding the manner in which purchases are actually made through the webpage.\" J.A. 9 (noting further that \"[a]ttorney argument is not a substitute for reliable documentation of how sales actually are made ... and verified statements from knowledgeable personnel as to what happens and how\"). The Board ultimately affirmed the refusal because it found that the Webpage Specimen was not a display associated with the goods within the meaning of the Lanham Act. J.A. 10. The dissenter found that the Webpage Specimen was a valid \"point of sale\" display. J.A. 10-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Siny appeals.

J.A. 8. The Board also considered the \"For sales information:\" text and phone number contact.

J.A. 9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Siny's main argument on appeal is that the Board applied \"overly rigid requirements\" in determining that the Webpage Specimen did not qualify as a display associated with the goods. Siny's Br. 7;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.

But we disagree that the Board applied improperly rigid requirements here. Rather,\n   the Board carefully considered the Webpage Specimen's contents and determined, on the record before it, that the specimen did not cross the line from mere advertising to an acceptable display associated with the goods. We cannot say that the Board's determination lacked substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We have considered Siny's other arguments and find them unpersuasive.
