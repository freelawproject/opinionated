Our mandate shall issue forthwith.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    The government seemed to concede as much at oral argument when it noted that asking a child to perform a sex act \"doesn't necessarily\" cause pain or require force. To the extent that the government does not concede this point, we reject its argument that Lofton must identify an Illinois state court conviction under the statute wherein no force was used. The state law is facially overbroad. We need inquire no further.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.
