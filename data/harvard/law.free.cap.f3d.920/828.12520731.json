In 2008, the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire sentenced Gordon Reid to incarceration for a term of 220 months, followed by three years of supervised release, for the crime of Interference with Commerce by Threats of Violence. Reid began serving that sentence on May 6, 2008, when he was delivered to the U.S. Penitentiary McCreary in Kentucky.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9181520,3440557\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/402/1249/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Sometimes for disciplinary reasons, and other times for administrative ones, Reid was housed repeatedly in Special Housing Units (SHUs) at McCreary and the other Bureau of Prisons (BOP) facilities, where he has continued serving his sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Reid, proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , filed a Complaint in the District Court for the District of Columbia on March 16, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the time, Reid was incarcerated at the U.S. Penitentiary in Tucson, Arizona.

The Complaint asked for declaratory, injunctive, and mandamus relief to remedy these alleged violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In total, Reid appears to have been transferred in and out of a SHU over twenty times from August 1, 2007, to July 19, 2016, under either administrative detention or disciplinary segregation status. This amounted to at least 764 days in a SHU, and some of those confinement periods\n   postdated the filing of his Complaint in the District Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   BOP filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment, arguing that Reid's claims were moot. BOP argued that Reid was \"no longer confined at USP Tucson, his place of confinement when he filed this civil action,\" or at any of the other facilities where the alleged violations occurred. Mot. to Dismiss at 15-16, No. 1:15-cv-375 (RMC) (D.D.C. filed Sept. 28, 2015), ECF No. 14. BOP concluded that Reid's \"allegations concerning how staff at previous institutions handled the processing of inmates' incoming magazines, how SHU staff allocated outside recreation time, or Unit Team's protocol for conducting rounds in SHU no longer present[ed] a case or controversy,\" and argued that the mootness exceptions did not apply.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In response to BOP's motion, the District Court issued an order to \"advise the\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff of his obligations\" under the Rules, as well as the consequences for failing to follow them. Order at 1, 3, No. 1:15-cv-375 (RMC) (D.D.C. filed Oct. 1, 2015), ECF No. 15. The District Court informed Reid that he needed to file a response in opposition to the motion by November 30, 2015, and advised him of all relevant Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and local rules regarding opposition to motions to dismiss and for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After initially granting BOP's motions because of Reid's failure to timely respond, the District Court accommodated Reid's late filing of a response opposing BOP's motions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order at 1-2, No. 1:15-cv-375 (RMC) (D.D.C. filed June 2, 2016), ECF No. 21. In his brief opposing dismissal and supporting his cross-motion for summary judgment, Reid argued that the case was not moot because he was challenging ongoing practices of BOP. Mot. to Vacate Judgment at 106, No. 1:15-cv-375 (RMC) (D.D.C. filed May 6, 2016), ECF No. 20. He also argued that the case was an exception to the mootness doctrine: \"That these controversies are capable of repetition is a matter of historical fact rather than deduction for Plaintiff has, in fact, been repeatedly housed in SHU units across the country where, time and again,\" BOP had committed the same violations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 109.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The District Court ordered BOP to file an opposition to Reid's cross-motion for summary judgment, combined with BOP's opposition to Reid's motions to strike and reply in support of its motion to dismiss. In its filing, BOP stated that \"[n]ormally, a prisoner's transfer or release from a prison moots any claim he might have for equitable relief arising out of the conditions of his confinement in prison.\" Def.'s Opp'n to Pl's Cross Mot. for Summ.

BOP argued that \"with the exception of\n   <em>\n    one\n   </em>\n   night, [Reid] ha[d] not been confined in SHU at all since his transfer to USP Coleman.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8 (emphasis in original).

BOP also pointed out that Reid had not alleged continued violations since his (then) latest transfer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In support, BOP attached an affidavit stating that Reid was no longer housed in a SHU and had been in the general population at the Coleman\n   facility with the exception of one twelve-hour period.

On November 8, 2016 - over two months after the deadline for Reid's reply brief - the District Court issued an order granting BOP's motion to dismiss Reid's claims as moot and denying his cross motion for summary judgment. The District Court noted that Reid had \"asserted nothing\" to contradict BOP's argument that \"for the past straight year\" Reid had not been \"confined to the Special Housing Units that gave rise to his claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Reid v.

As Amicus points out, Reid demonstrated that BOP had placed him in the SHU \"in almost every facility that confined him for longer than twenty-eight days, including four instances of segregation\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   he filed his complaint.\" Amicus Br. 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On this point,\n   <em>\n    Olmstead v.

In\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court noted that a claim was not moot when the petitioners were \"currently receiving treatment in community-based programs\" because of \"the multiple institutional placements [the petitioners] ha[d] experienced,\" making the claims capable of repetition, yet avoiding review.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248146\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/581/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 594 n.6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248146\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/581/\">\n    119 S.Ct. 2176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, even though the petitioners were no longer in an institutional placement, their claims avoided mootness due in part to the multiple times that they had experienced institutional placements in the past. Reid's circumstance is similar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   BOP recognizes that \"[a] prisoner's transfer to another facility or unit will not moot a claim for equitable relief ... if the very same policy, practice, or condition continues to apply to the same prisoner's confinement following his or her transfer to another unit or facility.\" Appellee's Br. 25 (citing\n   <em>\n    Scott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3712913,11846647\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/139/940/\">\n    139 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   941 ).

In particular, Reid has alleged three key facts. First, he has been housed at eight different SHUs since 2008. Second, he has suffered a uniform set of deprivations at each SHU that contradict BOP's written regulations. Third, each time he has suffered a deprivation, he alleges that BOP officials justify the deprivations based on \"BOP policy.\" J.A. 7-8. Having been placed in a SHU in myriad different BOP institutions, subject each time to a restriction allegedly imposed under a purported BOP policy or practice contravening BOP regulations, Reid has proffered a logical theory that the challenged actions reasonably will recur despite his current transfer out of the SHU.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248146\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/581/\">\n    527 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   594 n.6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248146\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/581/\">\n    119 S.Ct. 2176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

My colleagues reserve the question whether Reid has adequately alleged such a policy.

We should reject Reid's conclusory allegation that BOP has implemented unlawful nationwide policies. And without such unifying policies, the specific disputes alleged here are not capable of repetition.

Jan. 15, 2008). Since then, while incarcerated at various BOP facilities, Reid has amassed a disciplinary record that includes assault with a dangerous weapon, fighting and threatening other prisoners, throwing liquids on prison guards, indecent exposure, disobeying orders, and insolence. J.A. 20-30. Reid has often been placed in the Special Housing Unit (SHU) of various prisons, for either disciplinary or administrative reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In March 2015, Reid filed a lawsuit arising from his treatment in the SHUs of prisons in Arizona, California, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Virginia. Reid alleged that he was denied magazines and exercise pursuant to informal BOP policy and that he was often denied prompt access to administrative complaint forms. Reid claimed that these various deprivations violated BOP regulations and a formal policy statement. He sought declaratory and injunctive relief, but not damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   After the complaint was filed, Reid was transferred to a prison in Florida and then to another prison in Pennsylvania.

Reid cross-moved for summary judgment. In these motions, both parties introduced documents and affidavits detailing Reid's past treatment at BOP prisons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The district court dismissed the case as moot. It invoked our precedents holding that an inmate's release or transfer from a prison normally moots prospective challenges to conditions at that prison.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Scott v.

One argument is that this case never became moot because Reid seeks to challenge not only specific past deprivations, but also an ongoing policy to inflict similar deprivations at all BOP prisons. Another argument is that this case falls within an exception to mootness because the past deprivations involve controversies that are capable of repetition yet evading review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   My colleagues credit the second argument, at least in the current procedural posture of this case, and they do not reach the first argument. I would reject both. I begin with the policy point because, as explained below, unless Reid can plead and prove that BOP has a nationwide policy to violate the regulations at issue in this case,\n   he cannot show that his specific past disputes are capable of repetition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The complaint frames a challenge to ongoing policies. Reid alleges a \"BOP policy\" that \"prisoners housed in SHU may not have magazines,\" in violation of a regulation providing that they may. J.A. 7. Likewise, Reid alleges a \"BOP policy\" to restrict inmates' exercise as punishment for minor infractions of prison rules, in violation of a written policy statement that \"[r]estriction or denial of exercise is not used as punishment.\" J.A. 8-9. Finally, Reid alleges that, \"[o]n many occasions,\" he was denied prompt access to forms for filing grievances. J.A. 9. Reid does not further describe these alleged policies. Yet his amicus contends that this case presents justiciable challenges to all of them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   If \"the specific conduct that gave rise to the case has ceased,\" a plaintiff nonetheless may seek prospective relief \"as to an ongoing policy\" authorizing the conduct.\n   <em>\n    Del Monte Fresh Produce Co. v.

To begin, it is not enough merely to assert that unlawful policies exist, just as it was not enough merely to assert the existence of a conspiracy in\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   or an illicit motive in\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   . Rather, the bare allegation of an unlawful policy is a legal conclusion or conclusory statement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    AE ex rel. Hernandez v.

Even two decades before\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   , this Court made clear that \"more than a nebulous assertion of the existence of a 'policy' is required to establish standing.\"\n   <em>\n    Haase v. Sessions\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4332453,10549974\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/835/902/\">\n    835 F.2d 902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 911 (D.C. Cir. 1987). Thus, the allegation that Reid was denied magazines and exercise \"per BOP policy,\" J.A. 7-8, is plainly insufficient. And the statement that Reid was denied prompt access to administrative forms \"[o]n many occasions,\" J.A. 9, is even less substantial, as it fails to allege a policy even in conclusory terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The complaint further alleges that prison officials \"invariably informed\" Reid that they were following BOP policies in denying him magazines and exercise. J.A. 7-8. Yet Reid says nothing more about who said so, when, where, how often, and under what circumstances. This too falls short, for\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   require enough \"specific facts\" to \"present a story that holds together.\"\n   <em>\n    McCauley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873290\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/671/611/#p616\">\n    671 F.3d at 616\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation marks omitted). These vague references to hearsay statements tell no such story. If pleading \"there is a policy\" is not enough, then neither is pleading \"I was invariably informed that there is a policy,\" which is all Reid has done here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Nor do Reid's allegations about specific incidents support any plausible inference of a policy. As for magazines, the complaint alleges only that, at eight facilities, \"prison officials refused to deliver magazines sent from the publisher to Petitioner.\" J.A. 7. Entirely unstated are the involved officials; the names, number, or types of the magazines; and the frequency or surrounding circumstances of any refusal to deliver. As for exercise, Reid alleges only denials for infractions \"such as having a string hanging from the shower, a piece of paper in the window, not having his bed made to the satisfaction of the prison guard, or any other matter of cell decorum, whether real or imagined.\" J.A. 8. On its face, this suggests not a nationwide policy, but individual decisions based on the facts and circumstances surrounding different prisoners in different prisons at different times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The relevant BOP regulations further undercut any inference of an illicit nationwide policy. They permit inmates to \"receive softcover publications\" such as magazines,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20540.71\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 540.71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), but this privilege is limited in several respects. For one, a warden may reject publications\n   deemed \"detrimental to the security, good order, or discipline\" of the prison, as well as publications that \"might facilitate criminal activity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20540.71\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 540.71(b). A warden also \"may set limits locally (for fire, sanitation or housekeeping reasons) on the number or volume of publications an inmate may receive or retain in his quarters.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20540.71\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 540.71(f). Finally, a warden may restrict an inmate's incoming correspondence \"based on misconduct or as a matter of classification.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20540.71\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 540.15(a). The regulations further provide that a SHU inmate may receive five hours of outdoor exercise per week,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20540.71\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 541.31(g), and a BOP policy document states that \"[r]estriction or denial of exercise is not used as punishment,\" BOP Program Statement 5270.11, at 12 (Nov. 23, 2016). But this privilege is also significantly limited, as the regulation further states that exercise may be denied \"if it is determined that [the inmate's] use of exercise privileges threatens safety, security, and orderly operation of a correctional facility, or public safety.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20541.31\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). Reid does not challenge any of these limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Given the narrow, qualified nature of these regulatory privileges, a large number of deprivations does not plausibly suggest illegal nationwide policies. Any such inference would ignore an obvious alternative explanation-that the deprivations resulted from individual applications of the regulations to the circumstances of different prisoners in different prisons at different times. The regulations themselves require such contextual judgments, and Reid's allegations provide no basis to suspect anything more sinister.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   3\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Reid's thin allegations of amorphous policies also fail to establish ripeness.

Here, Reid's complaint similarly alleges an unwritten policy that is uncertain in its scope and application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   On this point, the amicus invokes\n   <em>\n    Payne Enterprises v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1773026,4333453\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/837/486/\">\n    837 F.2d 486\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C.

But the policy there was written, its scope was undisputed, and its application in future cases did not depend on presently unknown facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1773026,4333453\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/837/486/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1773026,4333453\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/837/486/\">\n    at 491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . None of that is true here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   4\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The evidentiary submissions undercut Reid's policy claim even further. Both parties moved for summary judgment and, in so doing, introduced documents and affidavits detailing Reid's various disputes with BOP. Reid opposed the government's motion on the merits but did not argue that it was premature. Thus, pleadings aside, we could readily reject the alleged illegal policy on summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The evidentiary materials confirm that Reid's past disputes with BOP have been localized and fact-intensive. To pick a few\n   examples: Documents indicate that in September 2013, officials at the Jonesville, Virginia prison withheld magazines from Reid because of security concerns about \"inmates continuously covering their cell windows and light fixtures, which causes poor visibility into cells and interferes with staff duties.\"\n   <em>\n    Reid v. Samuels\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-CV-375 (D.D.C.), ECF Doc. 23, at 66. In January 2013, officials at the Atwater, California prison made a different, safety-related judgment-to withhold magazines from Reid because of concerns about sanitation and fire hazards.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18. By contrast, an official at the Tucson, Arizona prison where Reid was held from November 2013 to July 2015 testified that inmates there were \"not denied access to their mail,\" and Reid had neither bought nor been sent any magazines. J.A. 49. The disputes about exercise were similarly varied: Atwater officials revoked Reid's privileges after he obstructed the light fixture in his cell.\n   <em>\n    Reid\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-CV-375, ECF Doc. 23, at 32. According to Reid, officials at other prisons did the same after he put \"paper on the wall, light, sink, etc.\" J.A. 68. A Tucson official testified that Reid was not denied exercise but voluntarily refused it. J.A. 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   To be sure, Reid disputes much of this evidence.

Setting aside the deficient policy allegations, Reid does not challenge anything that could give rise to a discrete, predictably repeatable legal controversy. As explained above, he claims that BOP has violated regulations that require case-by-case inquiries into prison safety, security, order, discipline, sanitation, and housekeeping. Not surprisingly, the application of those regulations has spawned distinct, fact-intensive controversies. For example, the Jonesville dispute about the use of magazines as window covers is different from the Atwater dispute about sanitation and fire hazards, and both of those are different from the Tucson dispute about what magazines were mailed to Reid. Likewise, the Tucson dispute about whether Reid refused exercise is different from the Atwater dispute about which inmate obstructed the lights, and both of those are different from other disputes about whether Reid adequately maintained his cell. Because no discrete, identifiable legal controversy is capable of repetition, the mootness exception does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   My colleagues reverse on narrow grounds, so my disagreement with them is also narrow. They reserve the question whether Reid has adequately pleaded a policy under the plausibility standard articulated in\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 834-35. Likewise, they reserve the question whether Reid's policy allegations could survive a motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 835. I would have decided those questions, but they remain open on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The disagreement about how to apply the mootness exception for cases that are capable of repetition yet evading review is also narrow. My colleagues do not dispute two critical points: the legal controversy itself must be predictably repeatable, and Reid's claim to satisfy this requirement depends on his policy allegations. My colleagues invite the district court on remand to probe the facts relevant to mootness-including the policy allegations-either on a motion to dismiss or on summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 834-35. So, the mootness question also remains open.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Ultimately, my colleagues and I disagree over how to apply the mootness exception in the current procedural posture of this case, which they describe as one involving a \"motion to dismiss the Complaint at the pleadings stage.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 833. My colleagues recognize that the party opposing mootness bears the burden of proving that the exception applies.\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 832-33. But they note that a complaint, which is filed before the alleged mooting event, obviously cannot plead a mootness exception.\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 833. So, they conclude, we should consider only whether there is any \"logical deficiency\" in the plaintiff's argument for satisfying the exception.\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 833-35. They derive this forgiving standard from a statement in\n   <em>\n    Haase\n   </em>\n   that \"[a]ssuming the theory presented in the complaint is not itself inherently flawed, the standing inquiry is ordinarily now complete.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4332453,10549974\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/835/902/\">\n    835 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   907 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 832-33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   This analysis seems to me mistaken. For one thing,\n   <em>\n    Haase\n   </em>\n   was a case about initial standing, so it has nothing to say about how courts should assess intervening facts bearing on mootness. Its inquiry whether the plaintiff's theory is \"inherently flawed\" reflects not a distinction between standing and mootness, but a general premise that motions to dismiss do not test for pleading sufficiency. That premise was correct when\n   <em>\n    Haase\n   </em>\n   was decided in 1987,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Conley v. Gibson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6161830\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/355/41/\">\n    355 U.S. 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6161830\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/355/41/\">\n    78 S.Ct. 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6161830\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/355/41/\">\n    2 L.Ed.2d 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1957), but it did not survive\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In this case, the complaint alleges illicit policies that pre-date the mooting event of Reid's prison transfer, so there is nothing unfair about assessing whether those allegations were plausibly pleaded. And, if intervening factual developments had strengthened Reid's case, he could have sought leave to amend the complaint, which he did not. Finally, the record includes not only the government's motion to dismiss, but also the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment, which amply develop the facts relevant to mootness. As noted above, Reid has never claimed that the government's motion was premature. So, I can see no reason to apply only a minimal screen for \"logical deficiency\" at this juncture, thereby artificially prolonging the life of this moot case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Because nothing prevents us from resolving the question of mootness now, I would affirm the district court's order dismissing this case as moot.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    Reid has forfeited any argument based on the voluntary-cessation exception to mootness.\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at 833 n.4.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
