We hold that prior authority regarding a traditional trust's citizenship still controls, and conclude that the district court properly exercised subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Demarest filed the underlying complaint in this case in Los Angeles County Superior Court on May 27, 2016, naming as defendants HSBC Bank USA N.A. (HSBC), Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC (Ocwen), Western Progressive, LLC (Western Progressive), and Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS) (collectively, Defendants). The dispute concerned a loan Demarest had\n   taken out on her West Hills, California home in 2005; the loan's promissory note and deed of trust were purportedly \"pooled into a securitized trust labeled NORMA [sic] HOME EQUITY LOAN, INC., ASSET-BACKED CERTIFICATES, SERIES 2006-HE2 ...\" Demarest alleged that HSBC acted as trustee for this investment trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In fact, Demarest's loan had been securitized and the deed of trust assigned to HSBC, as trustee for the Registered Holders of Nomura Home Equity Loan, Inc., Asset-Backed Certificates, Series 2006-HE2 (the Trust). The Trust was governed by a contract entitled \"Pooling and Servicing Agreement Dated as of April 1, 2006\" (the Agreement), entered into between HSBC and various other parties. Among other things, the Agreement established the Trust, enumerated its assets, and appointed HSBC as trustee, and it described the Trust as a common law trust governed by New York law. Under the Agreement, all \"right, title and interest\" in the assets of the Trust were conveyed to the \"Trustee [HSBC] for the use and benefit of the Certificateholders,\" and the trustee was given the power to hold the Trust's assets, sue in its own name, transact the Trust's business, terminate servicers, and engage in other necessary activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In her complaint (which she filed following her default on the loan and multiple initial actions aimed at combatting the foreclosure of her property), Demarest asserted various causes of action under California law, including wrongful foreclosure. Defendants removed the case to the district court. The notice of removal specifically stated that it was filed on the behalf of, among others, \"HSBC Bank USA, N.A., as Trustee for the registered holders of Nomura Home Equity Loan, Inc., Asset-Backed Certificates, Series 2006-HE2 ... incorrectly sued herein as HSBC Bank USA N.A.\" Diversity jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   was the only basis for federal jurisdiction claimed in the notice. It asserted that Demarest was a citizen of California, Ocwen was a citizen of Florida and Georgia, MERS was a citizen of Delaware and Virginia, and Western Progressive was a nominal defendant and was therefore disregarded for diversity purposes. As for HSBC, the notice stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   HSBC is a national banking association organized under the laws of the United States with its main office in McLean, Virginia.... Since its main office is located in Virginia, HSBC is a citizen of Virginia for diversity purposes. At the present time and at the commencement of this action, HSBC is not a citizen of California.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (citation omitted). Given that no Defendant was, like Demarest, a citizen of California, the notice concluded that diversity jurisdiction was established, and that removal was proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After the district court dismissed MERS from the action through a motion for judgment on the pleadings, the remaining Defendants moved for summary judgment. The district court granted the motion and entered final judgment for Defendants.

Citizenship of a Trust\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Demarest contends that Defendants failed to establish diversity jurisdiction because, following the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Americold\n   </em>\n   , they were required to demonstrate the citizenship of the Trust's investors, and could not simply rely on the citizenship of HSBC as its trustee. To address this argument, we briefly consider the Court's treatment of trust citizenship in\n   <em>\n    Americold\n   </em>\n   and two other pertinent decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Decades ago, in\n   <em>\n    Navarro Savings Ass'n v.

There, the plaintiffs were eight trustees of a Massachusetts trust who sued in their own names, and the defendant disputed the existence of complete diversity on the ground that, because the trust beneficiaries rather than the trustees were the real parties in controversy, the citizenships of the former ought to have controlled.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184166\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/458/#p458\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184166\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/458/#p458\">\n    at 459-60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184166\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/458/#p458\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1779\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court reaffirmed the proposition that \"a trustee is a real party to the controversy for purposes of diversity jurisdiction when he possesses certain customary powers to hold, manage, and dispose of assets for the benefit of others,\" concluding, \"For more than 150 years, the law has permitted trustees who meet this standard to sue in their own\n   right, without regard to the citizenship of the trust beneficiaries.

Notably, the Court also determined that\n   <em>\n    Navarro\n   </em>\n   was consistent with this rule, because that case, unlike\n   <em>\n    Carden\n   </em>\n   , \"did not involve the question whether a party that is an artificial entity other than a corporation can be considered a 'citizen' of a State, but the quite separate question whether parties that were undoubted 'citizens' (viz., natural persons) were the real parties to the controversy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 191,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5551\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/185/#p186\">\n    110 S.Ct. 1015\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
