McKeever appeals an order of the district court denying his petition to release grand jury records from the 1957 indictment of a former agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which McKeever sought in the course of his research for a book he is writing. The district court, lacking positive authority, asserted it has inherent authority to disclose historically significant grand jury matters but denied McKeever's request as overbroad. On appeal, the Government argues the district court does not have the inherent authority it claims but rather is limited to the exceptions to grand jury secrecy listed in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We agree with the Government.

Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 1956 Columbia University Professor Jes\u00fas de Gal\u00edndez Su\u00e1rez disappeared from New York City. News media at the time believed Gal\u00edndez, a critic of the regime of Dominican Republic dictator Rafael Trujillo, was kidnapped and flown to the Dominican Republic and there murdered by Trujillo's agents.\n   <em>\n    Witness Tells of Galindez Pilot's Death\n   </em>\n   , N.Y.

To this day, the details of Gal\u00edndez's disappearance remain a mystery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Stuart McKeever has been researching and writing about the disappearance of Professor Gal\u00edndez since 1980. In 2013 McKeever petitioned the district court for the \"release of grand jury records in the Frank case,\" referring to the 1957 investigation and indictment of John Joseph Frank, a former FBI agent and CIA lawyer who later worked for Trujillo, and who McKeever believed was behind Gal\u00edndez's disappearance. The grand jury indicted\n   Frank for charges related to his failure to register as a foreign agent pursuant to the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 but never indicted him for any involvement in Gal\u00edndez's murder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Frank v.

Although several of the nine non-exhaustive factors favored disclosure, the district court read McKeever's petition as seeking release of all the grand jury \"testimony and records in the Frank case,\" which it held was overbroad.

Cir. 1981). The full text of Rule 6(e) is reproduced in the Appendix. Of particular relevance here, Rule 6(e)(2)(B) sets out the general rule of grand jury secrecy and provides a list of \"persons\" who \"must not disclose a matter occurring before the grand jury\" \"[u]nless these rules provide otherwise.\" Rule 6(e)(3) then sets forth a detailed list of \"exceptions\" to grand jury\n   secrecy, including in subparagraph (E) five circumstances in which a \"court may authorize disclosure ... of a grand-jury matter.\" As McKeever does not claim his request comes within any exception, the question before us is whether the list of exceptions is exhaustive, as the Government argues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We agree with the Government's understanding of the Rule. Rule 6(e)(2)(B) instructs that persons bound by grand jury secrecy must not make any disclosures about grand jury matters \"[u]nless these rules provide otherwise.\" The only rule to \"provide otherwise\" is Rule 6(e)(3). Rules 6(e)(2) and (3) together explicitly require secrecy in all other circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Andrus v. Glover Constr.

For example, the first of the five discretionary exceptions in Rule 6(e)(3)(E) permits the court to authorize disclosure of a grand jury matter \"preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding.\" Rule 6(e)(3)(E)(i). The second exception allows for disclosure \"at the request of a defendant who shows that a ground may exist to dismiss the indictment because of a matter that occurred before the grand jury.\" Rule 6(e)(3)(E)(ii). The other three exceptions provide that a court may authorize disclosure to certain non-federal officials \"at the request of the government\" to aid in the enforcement of a criminal law, Rule 6(e)(3)(E)(iii)-(v) ; those provisions implicitly bar the court from releasing materials to aid in enforcement of civil law. Each of the exceptions can clearly be seen, therefore, as the product of a carefully considered policy judgment by the Supreme Court in its rulemaking capacity, and by the Congress, which in 1977 directly enacted Rule 6(e) in substantially its present form.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fund for Constitutional Gov't\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3517993,1267838\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/656/856/\">\n    656 F.2d at 867\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In interpreting what is now Rule 6(e)(3)(E)(i), for example, the Supreme Court stressed that the exception \"reflects a judgment that not every beneficial purpose, or even every valid governmental purpose, is an appropriate reason for breaching grand jury secrecy.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Baggot\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6196298\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/476/#p480\">\n    463 U.S. 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 480,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6196298\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/476/#p480\">\n    103 S.Ct. 3164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6196298\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/476/#p480\">\n    77 L.Ed.2d 785\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As the Government emphasizes, McKeever points to nothing in Rule 6(e)(3) that suggests a district court has authority to order disclosure of grand jury matter outside the enumerated exceptions. The list of exceptions in Rule 6(e)(3) does not lead with the term \"including,\" nor does it have a residual exception.\n   <em>\n    Cf., e.g.\n   </em>\n   , FED. R. CIV.

That reasoning, however, ignores the likelihood that disclosures \"so different\" from the ones explicitly permitted by the rule are so far removed from permissible purposes of disclosure that the drafters saw no need even to mention them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Our understanding that deviations from the detailed list of exceptions in Rule 6(e) are not permitted is fully in keeping with Supreme Court precedent. Though the Court has not squarely addressed the present question, its Rule 6 opinions cast grave doubt upon the proposition that the district court has authority to craft new exceptions. McKeever does not cite any case - and we can find none - in which the Supreme Court upheld a disclosure pursuant to the district court's inherent authority after Rule 6 was enacted. The Supreme Court once suggested in a dictum that Rule 6\"is but declaratory\" of the principle that disclosure of a grand jury matter is \"committed to the discretion of the trial judge,\"\n   <em>\n    Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. v.

The first is that Rule 6(e) imposes no obligation of secrecy upon the district court itself because the district court is not on the list of \"persons\" to whom grand jury secrecy applies per Rule 6(e)(2).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 2(e)(2)(A) (\"No obligation of secrecy may be imposed on any person except in accordance with Rule 6(e)(2)(B)\"). Therefore, the argument goes, the two\n   <em>\n    Sealed Cases\n   </em>\n   discussed above are inapplicable here because they deal with disclosures by government attorneys, not by the court itself, and the court has authority to order disclosure of grand jury matters because these materials are \"judicial records\" over which the court has inherent authority. Amicus Br. 24-25 (citing, inter alia,\n   <em>\n    Carlson v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12131808\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/837/753/#p758\">\n    837 F.3d 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 758-59 (7th Cir. 2016) (concluding\n   grand jury records are \"records of the court\" over which the district court can exercise inherent authority because the grand jury is \"part of the judicial process\")).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We do not agree that the omission of the district court from the list of \"persons\" in Rule 6(e)(2) supports McKeever's claim. Rule 6 assumes the records are in the custody of the Government, not that of the court: When the court authorizes their disclosure, it does so by ordering \"an attorney for the government\" who holds the records to disclose the materials.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 6(e)(1) (\"Unless the court orders otherwise, an attorney for the government will retain control of the recording, the reporter's notes, and any transcript\" of the grand jury proceeding). Because an \"attorney for the government\" is one of the \"persons\" subject to grand jury secrecy in Rule 6(e)(2)(B), the Rule need not also list the district court as a \"person\" in order to make the court, as a practical matter, subject to the strictures of Rule 6. Indeed, as the Government explains, a district court is not ordinarily privy to grand jury matters unless called upon to respond to a request to disclose grand jury matter. As to whether records of a grand jury proceeding are \"judicial records\" - a term not found in Rule 6 - we note the teaching of the Supreme Court that although the grand jury may act \"under judicial auspices,\" its \"institutional relationship with the Judicial Branch has traditionally been, so to speak, at arm's length,\"\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11727752\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/36/\">\n    504 U.S. at 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11727752\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/36/\">\n    112 S.Ct. 1735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; it is therefore not at all clear that when Rule 6(e)(2)(B) mentions a \"matter appearing before the grand jury,\" it is referring to a \"judicial record.\" The Supreme Court has never said as much, and we, albeit in another context, have twice said the opposite: \"[T]he concept of a judicial record 'assumes a judicial decision,' and with no such decision, there is 'nothing judicial to record.\"\n   <em>\n    SEC v.

In this telling, because Rule 6 did not contain a \"clear expression\" that it displaced the district court's preexisting authority, the court remains free to craft new exceptions; the rulemakers simply furnished the list of detailed exceptions \"so that the court knows that no special hesitation is necessary in those circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169566\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/370/626/#p631\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169566\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/370/626/#p631\">\n    at 764-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   That account of Rule 6 is difficult to square with the text of the Rule, which we have examined above. The \"limiting language,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169566\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/370/626/#p631\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169566\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/370/626/#p631\">\n    at 763\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Seventh Circuit sought is plain: Rule 6(e)(2) prohibits disclosure of a grand jury matter \"unless these rules provide otherwise.\" Yet the Seventh Circuit dismisses this instruction because a limitation \"buried\" in Rule 6(e)(2) could not \"secretly appl[y]\" to \"an entirely different subpart,\"\n   <em>\n    Carlson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12131808\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/837/753/#p758\">\n    837 F.3d at 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , never mind that this subpart follows immediately after Rule 6(e)(2) as\n   Rule 6(e)(3). Because we believe it is necessary to read the exceptions in subpart (e)(3) in conjunction with the general rule in subpart (e)(2), we agree with Judge Sykes's dissent in\n   <em>\n    Carlson\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   As my colleagues interpret the rule, the limiting language in the secrecy provision has no bearing at all on the exceptions.... But the two provisions cannot be read in isolation. They appear together in subpart (e), sequentially, and govern the same subject matter. The exceptions plainly modify the general rule of nondisclosure. Treating the exceptions as merely exemplary puts the two provisions at cross-purposes: If the district court has inherent authority to disclose grand-jury materials to persons and in circumstances not listed in subsection (e)(3)(E), the limiting phrase \"unless these rules provide otherwise\" in the secrecy provision is ineffectual.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 769.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   McKeever's third contention is that the purposes of grand jury secrecy would not be served by denying disclosure in this case; the passage of time and likely death of all witnesses in Frank's grand jury proceeding have rendered continued secrecy pointless. Of course, these considerations are irrelevant if the district court lacks authority to create new exceptions to Rule 6(e). In any event, it is not clear that continued secrecy serves no purpose in this case. First, privacy interests can persist even after a person's death.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    New York Times Co. v. Nat'l Aeronautics &amp; Space Admin\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3486784,10546550\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/920/1002/\">\n    920 F.2d 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1009-1010 (D.C. Cir. 1990). Second, as the Supreme Court noted in\n   <em>\n    Douglas Oil\n   </em>\n   , there is likely to be a chilling effect on what a witness is willing to say to a grand jury if there is a risk the court will later make the witness's testimony public.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1779812\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/211/#p218\">\n    441 U.S. at 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1779812\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/211/#p218\">\n    99 S.Ct. 1667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The effect of an exception must be evaluated\n   <em>\n    ex\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , not\n   <em>\n    ex post\n   </em>\n   . For example, if a witness in Frank's grand jury proceedings had known that the public might learn about his testimony in the future - and that his words could be immortalized in a book - then his willingness to testify \"fully and frankly,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., could have been affected. Furthermore, the risk of a witness's testimony being disclosed would grow as district courts continue over time to create additional exceptions to grand jury secrecy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Our concern is not merely hypothetical; as the Government points out, there has been a steady stream of requests for disclosures since the district court first claimed inherent authority\n   <em>\n    In re Petition of Kutler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4154970\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/800/42/#p50\">\n    800 F.Supp.2d 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 50 (D.D.C. 2011) (granting request to disclose President Nixon's grand jury testimony about Watergate due to its historical importance).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Application to Unseal Dockets Related to the Independent Counsel's 1998 Investigation of President Clinton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525010\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/308/314/#p335\">\n    308 F.Supp.3d 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 335-36 (D.D.C. 2018) (ordering disclosure of grand jury materials related to the investigation of President Clinton's business dealings and his relationship with a White House intern);\n   <em>\n    Sennett v.

If not, grand jury materials falling outside Rule 6(e) 's exceptions cannot be released even if there is a strong public interest favoring disclosure and no enduring interest in secrecy. My colleagues read Rule 6 to compel that result. In my respectful view, however, our court's en banc decision in\n   <em>\n    Haldeman v. Sirica\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3683688,94303\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/501/714/\">\n    501 F.2d 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1974), allows for district court disclosures beyond Rule 6(e) 's exceptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Rule 6(e)\"codifies the traditional rule of grand jury secrecy.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Rule imposes an obligation of secrecy on certain persons, Rule 6(e)(2), but then sets out five exceptions to that obligation, Rule 6(e)(3)(A)-(E). The first four exceptions allow for disclosure without a need for district court authorization. The last exception describes five circumstances in which \"[t]he\n   <em>\n    court may\n   </em>\n   authorize disclosure ... of a grand-jury matter.\" Rule 6(e)(3)(E)(i)-(v) (emphasis added). None of those circumstances applies in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The crucial question for our purposes, then, is whether Rule 6(e)(3) 's exceptions identify the only circumstances in which a district court may authorize disclosure of grand jury materials. Or, alternatively, does a court retain inherent discretion to consider releasing grand jury materials in other circumstances-potentially including, as relevant here, for reasons of historical significance?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Haldeman\n   </em>\n   , this court, sitting en banc, faced the contention that a district court's authority to disclose grand jury materials is confined to the exceptions in Rule 6(e). The district court in that case had ordered the disclosure of materials from the Watergate grand jury to the House Judiciary Committee for its consideration in investigating the possible impeachment of President Nixon. Only one of the exceptions in Rule 6(e) even arguably applied: when disclosure occurs \"preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 6(e)(3)(E)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The petitioners in\n   <em>\n    Haldeman\n   </em>\n   asked our court to prohibit the district court from releasing the grand jury materials to the House Judiciary Committee. We declined to do so and instead sustained the district court's disclosure order.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3683688,94303\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/501/714/\">\n    501 F.2d at 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Our decision thus settled that a district court retains discretion to release grand jury matter to a House Committee in the specific context of an impeachment inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   But what are the implications of our decision in\n   <em>\n    Haldeman\n   </em>\n   for a district court's authority to release grand jury materials outside the impeachment context? And, in particular, does a district court possess inherent discretion to consider disclosure beyond the specific exceptions set out in Rule 6(e) -including, as relevant here, for reasons of historical significance?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The petitioners in\n   <em>\n    Haldeman\n   </em>\n   argued no. They believed the district court lacked discretion to disclose the grand jury materials to the House Judiciary Committee unless the circumstances fit within the Rule 6(e) exception for judicial proceedings. They \"asserted, both in the District Court and here, that the discretion ordinarily reposed in a trial court to make such disclosure of grand jury proceedings as he deems in the public interest is, by the terms of Rule 6(e)... limited to circumstances incidental to judicial proceedings and that impeachment does not fall into that category.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3683688,94303\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/501/714/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3683688,94303\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/501/714/\">\n    at 715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In rejecting the petitioners' argument, we said that the district judge, Chief\n   Judge Sirica, \"ha[d] dealt at length with this contention,\" that we were \"in general agreement with his handling of the[ ] matter[ ],\" and that \"we fe[lt] no necessity to expand his discussion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3683688,94303\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/501/714/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Our decision thereby subscribed to Chief Judge Sirica's rationale for his disclosure order. The question for our purposes, then, is whether he ordered the disclosure on an understanding that he had inherent discretion to release grand jury materials outside the Rule 6(e) exceptions, or whether he instead believed he was confined to those exceptions but that the disclosure to the House Judiciary Committee fit within the exception for judicial proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   I understand Chief Judge Sirica to have adopted-and thus our court to have ratified-the former understanding.

Those considerations led him to conclude \"that delivery to the Committee is eminently proper, and indeed, obligatory.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1206650\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/370/1219/#p1228\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Judge Sirica identified the \"only significant objection to disclosure\" to be \"the contention that release ... is absolutely prohibited by Rule 6(e).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1206650\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/370/1219/#p1228\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He emphasized, though, that the \"rule continues the traditional practice of secrecy on the part of members of the grand jury,\n   <em>\n    except when the court permits a disclosure.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1206650\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/370/1219/#p1228\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis in original). He reviewed decisions addressing the exception for judicial proceedings and concluded that the \"difficulty in application of Rule 6(e) to specific fact situations likely arises from the fact that its language regarding 'judicial proceedings' can imply limitations on disclosure much more extensive than were apparently intended.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1206650\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/370/1219/#p1228\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1206650\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/370/1219/#p1228\">\n    at 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Of particular salience, Judge Sirica favorably referenced a then-recent \"opinion written by Chief Judge Friendly\" in which \"the Second Circuit held that Rule 6(e) did not bar public disclosure of grand jury minutes[ ]\n   <em>\n    wholly apart from judicial proceedings\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1206650\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/370/1219/#p1228\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). The Second Circuit had found that the judicial-proceeding exception was \"inapplicable\" because the court had \"not been told of any judicial proceeding preliminary to or in connection with which the ... grand jury testimony may be relevant.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Biaggi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2270240\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/478/489/\">\n    478 F.2d 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 492 (2d Cir. 1973). But the court still allowed disclosure, even though no Rule 6(e) exception applied.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2270240\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/478/489/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 492-93 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2270240\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/478/489/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2270240\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/478/489/\">\n    at 493-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Hays, J., dissenting) (noting that the majority allowed disclosure even though it \"concede[d] that the present situation does not present a case for the application of any of the exceptions specified in the Rule\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Judge Sirica, in concluding that \"[p]rinciples of grand jury secrecy do not bar [the] disclosure\" at issue in\n   <em>\n    Haldeman\n   </em>\n   , explained that he was \"persuaded to follow the lead ... of Judges Friendly and Jameson\" in\n   <em>\n    Biaggi\n   </em>\n   .\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1206650\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/370/1219/#p1228\">\n    370 F.Supp. at 1230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He also listed additional decisions he was \"persuaded to follow\" in which disclosure had been authorized.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1206650\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/370/1219/#p1228\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Those decisions, like\n   <em>\n    Biaggi\n   </em>\n   , did not involve disclosures justified on the theory that they fell within any Rule 6(e) exception. I thus understand Judge Sirica to have ordered disclosure on the understanding that he retained inherent discretion to release grand jury materials outside of Rule 6(e) 's exceptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Granted, Judge Sirica at one point described the House Judiciary Committee as \"a body that in this setting acts simply as another grand jury.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1206650\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/370/1219/#p1228\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But, as his reliance\n   on\n   <em>\n    Biaggi\n   </em>\n   and the other decisions shows, he did not compare the Committee to \"another grand jury\" on any theory that the Committee's investigation implicated the judicial-proceedings exception. In fact, the Advisory Committee later added an exception allowing disclosures from one grand jury to another, reasoning that such a transfer fell outside the pre-existing judicial-proceedings exception.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 6(e)(3)(C) advisory committee's note to 1983 amendment. Rather, Judge Sirica compared the Committee to \"another grand jury\" to convey that the Committee likewise would \"insure against unnecessary and inappropriate disclosure.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1206650\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/370/1219/#p1228\">\n    370 F.Supp. at 1230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   For those reasons, when our court in\n   <em>\n    Haldeman\n   </em>\n   endorsed Judge Sirica's approach, we in my view affirmed his understanding that a district court retains discretion to release grand jury materials outside the Rule 6(e) exceptions. To be sure,\n   <em>\n    Haldeman\n   </em>\n   -unlike my colleagues' careful opinion in this case-contains no meaningful analysis of Rule 6(e) 's terms. But Rule 6(e) has not changed since\n   <em>\n    Haldeman\n   </em>\n   in any way material to the issue we address today. And my reading of\n   <em>\n    Haldeman\n   </em>\n   squares with the reading of the decision adopted by each of our sister circuits to have interpreted it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pitch v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520094\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/915/704/#p707\">\n    915 F.3d 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 710 n.5 (11th Cir. 2019) ;\n   <em>\n    Carlson v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12131808\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/837/753/#p758\">\n    837 F.3d 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 766 (7th Cir. 2016). It also squares with the Advisory Committee's evident reason for declining to add a Rule 6(e) exception for historically-significant materials-viz., that district courts already authorized such disclosures as a matter of their inherent authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pitch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520094\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/915/704/#p707\">\n    915 F.3d at 715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Jordan, J., concurring). It is also consistent with various decisions relied on by my colleagues,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 845-47 &amp; n.3, none of which dealt with whether courts can order disclosures outside of Rule 6(e) 's exceptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Because my colleagues conclude that district courts lack authority to release grand jury materials outside the Rule 6(e) exceptions, they have no occasion to decide whether, if district courts do have that authority, the district court in this case appropriately declined to exercise it. I therefore do not reach that issue either. But on the threshold question of whether district courts have discretion to consider disclosures beyond Rule 6(e), I respectfully dissent from my colleagues' view based on my different reading of our decision in\n   <em>\n    Haldeman\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
