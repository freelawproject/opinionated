Appellant was sentenced to life with parole when he was 17 years old. He first became eligible for parole on April 26, 2005. The Parole Board has considered his eligibility and denied him parole annually ever since. Appellant alleges that, because the Parole Board was not specifically required to consider age-related characteristics unique to juvenile offenders when it has processed his parole applications, the Parole Board's repeated denial of his applications violated his Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On that ground, Appellant initiated this action against the Director of the Virginia Department of Corrections (\"Appellee\"). Appellee moved to dismiss Appellant's complaint, and the district court granted Appellee's motion to dismiss. Regarding Appellant's Eighth Amendment claim, the district court held that juvenile-specific Eighth Amendment protections do not apply to Appellant because he was sentenced to life with parole. Regarding Appellant's Fourteenth Amendment claims, the district court held that the Parole Board procedures satisfy procedural due process requirements. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the decision of the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 1988, Appellant was convicted of capital murder, robbery, marijuana possession, and two counts of use of a firearm in connection with his role in a botched robbery that resulted in a homicide. He was sentenced to two life sentences, plus six years and thirty days, with the possibility of parole. He was 17 years old at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2005, Appellant became eligible for parole. Every year since 2005, the Parole\n   Board has considered Appellant's eligibility for parole. Each of those years, the Parole Board \"review[ed] and evaluat[ed] ... all available information pertaining to [Appellant's] case\" and decided \"not to grant [Appellant] parole.\" J.A. 83-103.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Over the years, the Parole Board noted its reasons for denying Appellant parole as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    2005-2007\n   </strong>\n   : \"Serious nature and circumstances of the crime.\" J.A. 37-39.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    2008-2009\n   </strong>\n   : \"Serious nature and circumstances of the crime,\" and \"Prior offense history indicates disregard for the law.\" J.A. 40-41.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    2010\n   </strong>\n   : \"Crimes committed,\" and \"Serious nature and circumstances of the offense.\" J.A. 42.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    2011\n   </strong>\n   : \"Serious nature and circumstances of the offense,\" \"Crimes committed,\" and \"Release at this time would diminish seriousness of crime.\" J.A. 43.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    2012\n   </strong>\n   : \"History of violence -- indicates serious risk to the community,\" \"Release at this time would diminish seriousness of crime,\" \"Serious nature and circumstances of offense,\" and \"Crimes committed.\" J.A. 44-45.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    May 2013\n   </strong>\n   : \"Release at this time would diminish seriousness of the crime,\" \"History of violence -- indicates serious risk to the community,\" \"Poor institutional adjustment and/or record of institutional infractions indicate that offender is not ready to conform to society,\" \"Extensive criminal record,\" and \"Serious nature and circumstances of offense.\" J.A. 47.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    July 2013\n   </strong>\n   : \"Serious nature and circumstances of your offense(s),\" and \"The Board concludes that you should serve more of your sentence prior to release.\" J.A. 48.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    2014\n   </strong>\n   : \"Release at this time would diminish seriousness of the crime,\" \"Serious nature and circumstances of your offense(s),\" and \"The Board concludes that you should serve more of your sentence prior to release on parole.\" J.A. 50.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    2015\n   </strong>\n   : \"Release at this time would diminish seriousness of crime,\" \"Serious nature and circumstances of your offense(s),\" and \"Crime committed.\" J.A. 52.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    2016\n   </strong>\n   : \"Release at this time would diminish seriousness of crime,\" \"Crimes committed,\" \"Serious nature and circumstance of your offense(s),\" and \"The Board concludes that you should serve more of your sentence prior to release on parole.\" J.A. 55.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Beginning in 2010, the Parole Board also noted that, in evaluating Appellant's eligibility for parole, it considered factors in addition to those it listed in its statement of reasons. Among other things, the Parole Board considered \"whether [Appellant's] release would be compatible with public safety and the mutual interests of society and [Appellant]\"; \"whether [Appellant's] character, conduct, vocational training and other developmental activities during incarceration reflect the probability that [he] will lead a law-abiding life in the community and live up to all the conditions of parole\"; \"[Appellant's] personal history\"; \"[Appellant's] institutional adjustment\"; \"[Appellant's] change in attitude toward [himself] and others\"; \"[Appellant's] release plans\"; \"[Appellant's] evaluations\"; \"impressions gained ... by the parole examiner\"; and \"any other information provided by [Appellant's] attorney, family, victims or other persons.\" J.A. 88-103.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On November 16, 2016, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%208.01-654\">\n    Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 8.01-654\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Appellant filed a\n   petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Supreme Court of Virginia. He alleged that the Parole Board violated his Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. On March 10, 2017, the Supreme Court of Virginia denied his claim. The court reasoned that a petition for a writ of habeas corpus is not the proper vehicle for challenging denials of discretionary parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On April 4, 2017, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , App ellant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Western District of Virginia. Three months later, the Commonwealth of Virginia (\"the Commonwealth\") moved to dismiss the petition, arguing that Appellant's claims were not cognizable as a habeas petition and, in any event, the Parole Board properly denied his requests for parole. On January 23, 2018, the district court granted the Commonwealth's motion. The district court first concluded that, because Appellant is serving a life sentence with the opportunity for parole, his sentence does not violate the Eighth Amendment. The district court then concluded that, because the Commonwealth's parole process satisfies the requirements of\n   <em>\n    Franklin v.

Over the past decade, the Supreme Court has found that the application of certain punitive measures to juvenile offenders violates that clause. In\n   <em>\n    Roper v.

Given this disagreement about the application of the protections announced in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and its lineage to sentences that are practically equivalent to life without parole, we are satisfied that those protections have not yet reached a juvenile offender who has and will continue to receive parole consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Further, to the extent that\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   require parole proceedings to provide juveniles a meaningful opportunity for release after sentencing, we are not persuaded that Appellant's parole proceedings fell below that standard. Here, the Parole Board has considered Appellant's eligibility for parole annually since 2005. In doing so, the Parole Board has considered \"whether [Appellant's] release would be compatible with public safety and the mutual interests of society and [Appellant],\" \"whether [Appellant's] character, conduct, vocational training and other developmental activities during incarceration reflect the probability that [he] will lead a law-abiding life in the community and live up to all the conditions of parole,\" \"[Appellant's] personal history,\" \"[Appellant's] institutional adjustment,\" \"[Appellant's] change in attitude toward [himself] and others,\" \"[Appellant's] release plans,\" \"[Appellant's] evaluations,\" \"impressions gained ... by the parole examiner,\" and \"any other information provided by [Appellant's] attorney, family, victims or other persons.\" J.A. 88-103. The existing factors, therefore, allowed the Parole Board to fully consider the inmate's age at the time of the offense, as well as any evidence submitted to demonstrate his maturation since then, and account for the concern at the heart of\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   : \"that children who commit even heinous crimes are capable of change.\"\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601432\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/718/#p732\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the bases of the Parole Board's denials have, so far, been linked to the severity of his crime, the record suggests that \"there is a possibility that in time, [Appellant's] conduct\n   and positive adjustment while in prison, when considered with all other factors, will outweigh the concerns that the Board has for the offense.\" J.A. 76.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Finally, the Supreme Court's reflection on the relief provided by\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and its lineage persuades us that the Eighth Amendment promises juvenile offenders no further protections than those that Appellant has already received. In\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court suggested that, to remedy\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   violations retroactively, states need not resentence every juvenile offender entitled to\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601432\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/718/#p732\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Yet, Appellant would have this court find that the constitutional right announced by\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and its lineage gives rise to a constitutionally protected liberty interest in juvenile-specific Eighth Amendment protections. However, because we find that juvenile-specific Eighth Amendment protections do not apply to Appellant's life with parole sentence, we need not decide whether the rights articulated by\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and its lineage trigger liberty interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Even where no liberty interest in parole arises from the Constitution, \"[i]f a prisoner's term of imprisonment can be shortened or modified by rights conveyed\n   to him under state law, those rights cannot be denied without due process.\"\n   <em>\n    Gaston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10521772\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/946/340/#p344\">\n    946 F.2d at 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For instance, in\n   <em>\n    Wolff\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court recognized that the state of Nebraska, through its prison regulations that systematically reduced minimum prison sentences as a result of good prisoner behavior, created a liberty interest in that reduction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173832\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/539/#p556\">\n    418 U.S. at 556-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173832\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/539/#p556\">\n    94 S.Ct. 2963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Because Virginia law gives rise to an expectation of parole proceedings, the Commonwealth has created a liberty interest in parole consideration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, to satisfy the due process requirements triggered by this liberty interest, a parole board need only provide an offender an opportunity to be heard and a \"statement of reasons indicating ... why parole has been denied.\"\n   <em>\n    Bloodgood v.
