We conclude that the trial judge committed prejudicial error with respect to three evidence rulings during trial. Therefore, we reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-12\">Defendant Sandra Wyatt was operating an automobile in which her children, Nicole Wyatt and Dylan Henson, and Barbara Cremean were passengers. The automobile went through a red light and collided with a truck being driven by codefendant Charles DeYoung. This suit was brought on behalf of the three passengers against Wyatt and DeYoung.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-13\">The only eyewitness testimony concerning the accident was by Cremean and Sandra Wyatt. Cremean said that she and Wyatt were talking. She first noticed that the light was red as they began to enter the intersection. She then said to Wyatt, \u201cwhat are you doing?\u201d Wyatt applied the brakes and her car fishtailed into DeYoung\u2019s truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-14\">On the other hand, Wyatt testified that she observed the light turn red when she was a substantial distance from the intersec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>tion and applied the brakes when she was still 60 to 70 feet away. However, the brakes failed to respond and she was unable to stop her car or to avoid DeYoung\u2019s truck. The verdict seems to indicate that the jury accepted Wyatt\u2019s version of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Over plaintiff\u2019s objection, the trial judge permitted Wyatt to testify that her automobile, including the brakes, was serviced by Firestone the day before the accident, that the total estimate of body damage to the automobile from the accident was $843, and that Firestone paid that full amount to Wyatt and her husband after the accident in exchange for a release from liability. However, the trial judge, in an inconsistent ruling, subsequently sustained an objection to the admission into evidence of the property damage estimate and release. And in his instructions to the jury the trial judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-7\">One other thing. There has been some testimony with respect to Mrs. Henson receiving a certain amount of money from Firestone who is not a party to this suit. The fact that she received payment from Firestone is not evidence per se that the brakes failed. So that you may not consider that as evidence with respect to the issue of whether her brakes failed. You may, of course, obviously consider Mrs. Henson\u2019s testimony that her brakes failed and she complained to Firestone and she said it was supposed to have been repaired the day before the accident. That is a question of credibility which you have to of course assess.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">Thus, while the trial judge instructed the jury that the testimony concerning Firestone\u2019s payment to. Wyatt and her husband was not \u201cevidence per se,\u201d this testimony was not stricken from the record and the jury may very well have understood that it could be considered in assessing the credibility of Wyatt\u2019s testimony concerning the alleged brake failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">Plaintiffs argue that evidence of the settlement with Firestone was inadmissible on three separate grounds: (1) it was hearsay and therefore inadmissible under Evidence Rule 63; (2) it was evidence of a settlement of litigation and therefore inadmissible under Evidence Rule 52 or (3) any marginal rele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>vancy of the evidence was substantially outweighed by the risk of undue prejudice and therefore it was inadmissible under Evidence Rule 4(b). We conclude that this evidence was not hearsay and that it was not inadmissible under Rule 52. However, we also conclude that this evidence had little or no probative value and that there is a substantial danger it was assigned undue weight by the jury. Therefore, the trial judge abused his discretion in not excluding it pursuant to Rule 4. Furthermore, we are convinced that the prejudice to plaintiffs from the admission of this evidence was not cured by the trial judge\u2019s subsequent ambiguous instructions to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Hearsay is defined by Rule 63 as \u201ca statement offered to prove the truth of the matter stated which is made other than by a witness while testifying at the hearing.\u201d A \u201cstatement,\u201d as that word is used in Rule 63, is \u201c... not only an oral or written expression but also nonverbal conduct of a person intended by him as the substitute for words in expressing the matter stated.\u201d <em>Evid.R. </em>62(1). Clearly, Firestone\u2019s payment to Wyatt was not \u201can oral or written expression.\u201d It was instead \u201cnonverbal conduct.\u201d However, this conduct was not \u201cintended by [Firestone] as the substitute for words.\u201d It was not like a person shaking his head up and down instead of saying \u201cyes,\u201d <em>see State v. Simmons, </em>52 <em>N.J. </em>538, 541 (1968), <em>cert. </em>den. 395 <em>U.S. </em>924, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>1779, 23 <em>L.Ed. 2d </em>241 (1969), or pointing to the person being identified in a lineup instead of saying, \u201cthat\u2019s the man,\u201d <em>U.S. v. Caro, </em>569 <em>F.</em>2d 411, 416 n. 9 (5th Cir.1978). Firestone\u2019s payment of money to Wyatt was not intended as a communication but rather was action designed to resolve any claim she might have. Therefore, that action was not a \u201cstatement\u201d within the meaning of Rule 62(1) and hence not excludable from evidence as hearsay pursuant to Rule 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Evidence Rule 52 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-7\">Evidence that a person has, in compromise or from humanitarian motives, furnished or offered or promised to furnish money, or any other thing, act or service to another who has sustained or claimed to have sustained loss or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>damage, is inadmissible to prove his liability for the loss or damage or any part of it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">There are two basic rationales for the exclusion of evidence of settlement discussions and settlements. One, advocated by Professor Wigmore, \u201c... is that offers of compromise are excluded because not factually relevant; that they do not imply a belief (and, consequently, an admission by implication) on the part of the offeror that the adversary\u2019s claim is well founded, but rather that the further prosecution of the claim is preferably avoided by a purchase of the offeror\u2019s peace.\u201d <em>Winfield Mutual Housing Corp. v. Middlesex Concrete Products &amp; Excavating Corp., </em>39 <em>N.J.Super. </em>92, 100 (App.Div.1956); <em>see </em>4 <em>Wigmore, Evidence </em>(Chadbourn rev. 1972), \u00a7 1061. The other, advocated by Professor McCormick, is \u201cthe social desirability of promoting settlements of controversies over disputed claims.\u201d <em>Winfield Mutual Housing, supra, </em>at 100; <em>see McCormick, Evidence </em>(3 ed. 1984), \u00a7 274; <em>see also Rynar v. Lincoln Transit Co., Inc., </em>129 <em>N.J.L. </em>525, 529 (E. &amp; A. 1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Evidence Rule 52 is taken from the <em>Uniform Rules of Evidence, </em>which adopt the McCormick view, that is, that evidence of settlements is excluded in order to promote settlements. <em>Winfield Mutual Housing, supra, </em>39 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 101. Consequently, Rule 52 did not bar evidence of the settlement between Firestone and Wyatt. The admission of this evidence could not undermine the policy of encouraging settlements, because it was not offered against one of the parties to the settlement. Rather, it was Wyatt herself, one of the parties to the settlement, who offered the evidence to show that Firestone was legally responsible for the accident and hence that Wyatt was not. Stated another way, since Firestone was not a party to the lawsuit and hence could not be held liable, evidence of the settlement was not offered \u201cto prove [Firestone\u2019s] liability for the loss\u201d within the intent of Rule 52. <em>See </em>McCormick, <em>supra, </em>at 813 <em>n. </em>23 (\u201cA settlement which is offered as proof of the liability of a third party, arising out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>the transaction in suit, is not within the privilege since the evidence will not harm the parties to the compromise.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Nonetheless, this evidence should have been excluded because it had little or no probative value with respect to Firestone\u2019s responsibility for the accident and yet had an inherent capacity to unduly influence the jury. Rule 4(b) provides that \u201c[t]he judge may in his discretion exclude evidence if he finds that its probative value is substantially outweighed by the risk that its admission will ... create substantial danger of undue prejudice or of confusing the issues or of misleading the jury.\u201d Firestone settled with Wyatt and her husband by paying them $843 for the property damage to their car. The record does not indicate the reason Firestone made this payment, although the release does contain the standard recitation that the payment by Firestone \u201cis not to be taken as an admission of liability.\u201d However, it is as logical to infer that Firestone simply desired to avoid litigation by the payment of a small sum of money as that it acknowledged any responsibility for the accident. <em>See </em>Wigmore, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1061 at 36 (\u201cthe offer implies merely a desire for peace, not a concession of wrong done\u201d). Although lack of relevancy is not the basis for the exclusion of evidence of a settlement under Rule 52, we conclude that the simple fact that Firestone paid a small sum of money to Wyatt had so limited probative value with respect to the condition of Wyatt\u2019s brakes at the time of the accident that it should have been excluded under Rule 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">This conclusion is squarely supported by the one decision which we have located dealing with the issue. In <em>Esser v. Brophey, </em>212 <em>Minn. </em>194, 3 <em>N</em>.W.2d 3 (Sup.Ct.1942), a defendant in an automobile case sought to introduce evidence that the driver of another car involved in the accident had paid for the damages to his car, thereby supporting an inference that the other driver and not defendant was responsible for the accident. In concluding that the admission of this evidence constituted reversible error, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>Where, as here, there was no admission, but a compromise and settlement of a disputed claim, an inference of admission of liability is not permissible. [3 <em>N. W. </em>2d at 5].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The court also observed that <em>\u201c... </em>such evidence is inherently prejudicial notwithstanding an instruction ... limiting its purpose and effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">We conclude that admission of evidence of the Firestone settlement with Wyatt had an unfairly prejudicial impact upon plaintiffs\u2019 case and requires a reversal. Although the trial judge ultimately instructed the jury that this settlement was not \u201cevidence per se,\u201d he did not tell them it could not be considered for any purpose. Indeed, the confusing and contradictory statements concerning the settlement made by the judge during trial and in his instructions likely served to emphasize it in the minds of the jury. Furthermore, defense counsel made the settlement one of the centerpieces of his summation, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-7\">... Firestone ought to be here in this courtroom. I don\u2019t control the lawsuit. I don\u2019t represent the plaintiffs and I don\u2019t decide who is going to get sued in this case. If Firestone is the one at fault\u2014you don\u2019t have to take my word for it. You heard the testimony, uncontradicted testimony that Firestone paid every penny of Mrs. Henson\u2019s damage to her car, every single penny. Now, what does that tell you?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Hence, there is a substantial likelihood the jury was seriously misled by the evidence concerning the Firestone settlement with Wyatt.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">Plaintiffs called Barbara Cremean in rebuttal. The following then occurred during her direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>MS. BUKALA: Was there any conversation between you and Mrs. Henson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-6\">MR. KUGLER: Judge, I\u2019m going to object. I don\u2019t think this is a proper rebuttal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-7\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t think this is a proper rebuttal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-8\">Ms. Bukala, is this a rebuttal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-9\">MS. BUKALA: Yes, your Honor. It\u2019s rebuttal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-10\">THE COURT: As to what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-11\">MS. BUKALA: To the testimony that was offered by Mrs. Henson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-12\">THE COURT: As to what happened after the accident? How is this going to rebuttal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-13\">MS. BUKALA: It is the whole incident with the brakes and Firestone. THE COURT: You got to be specific. That question is improper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-14\">MS. BUKALA: Do you want me to do a side bar?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-15\">THE COURT: No. Ms. Bukala, just ask your question. They have a right and I have a right to rule. Next question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-16\">MS. BUKALA: I want to offer testimony\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-17\">THE COURT: Next question. I sustained the objection to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-18\">MS. BUKALA: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-19\">BY MS. BUKALA:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-20\">Q. Following the accident, did you have any conversation with Sandy Wyatt concerning her concern over whether or not she was at fault for this accident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-21\">MR. KUGLER: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-22\">THE COURT: Sustained. It\u2019s not part of rebuttal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-23\">Next question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-24\">BY MS. BUKALA:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-25\">Q. Did you see her at any time following the accident the next couple of days? THE COURT: Sustained, no proper rebuttal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-26\">MS. BUKALA: Well, your Honor, it\u2019s leading to proper rebuttal. I\u2019m just trying to find\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-27\">THE COURT: Did I just rule? Did I just make a ruling?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-28\">MS. BUKALA: You didn\u2019t even hear any reason for the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-29\">THE COURT: I sustained it because I don\u2019t need your reason. It\u2019s sufficient. It\u2019s not proper rebuttal. You could have asked her this yesterday on the stand. MS. BUKALA: I didn\u2019t know what Mrs. Henson was going to testify to. THE COURT: That is not proper rebuttal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-30\">MS. BUKALA: That is why I am asking now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-31\">THE COURT: Sustained. Please proceed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-32\">Preliminarily, we note that the trial judge erred in not permitting plaintiff to describe the content of Gremean\u2019s anticipated rebuttal testimony. If the trial judge had permitted counsel to indicate what testimony she expected to elicit on rebuttal, he</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>could have made a better informed decision concerning its admissibility. In their appellate brief plaintiffs advise us that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaB\">... The purpose of calling [Barbara Cremean] was to rebutt [sic] the evidence concerning the defective brakes. Ms. Cremean was also called to testify concerning an admission made to her by Sandra Wyatt concerning the fact that Ms. Wyatt\u2019s husband removed the brake pads following the accident so that Firestone would be \u201cframed\u201d and held responsible for the accident. Ms. Cremean also proferred [sic] testimony as to certain other admissions Ms. Wyatt made concerning the cause of the accident. Ms. Cremean\u2019s testimony was critical and would have raised serious doubts in the jury\u2019s mind as to credibility of Sandra Wyatt\u2019s testimony. The purpose of the rebuttal testimony was to impeach Sandra Wyatt\u2019s credibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">It was an abuse of discretion for the trial judge not to admit such rebuttal testimony. The alleged brake failure was a defense to plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action. Plaintiffs were not required to anticipate this defense during their affirmative case and to present responsive evidence. <em>See State v. Provoid, </em>110 <em>N.J.Super. </em>547, 557 (App.Div.1970); <em>Motus v. Ward, </em>6 <em>N.J.Super. </em>166 (App.Div.1950). Nor were plaintiffs required to anticipate Wyatt\u2019s testimony and to present evidence attacking her credibility before she testified. The questions asked on rebuttal were directed at eliciting testimony concerning statements by Wyatt which were inconsistent with her trial testimony that her brakes had failed. This was clearly proper rebuttal testimony both to attack Wyatt\u2019s credibility and as substantive evidence that the accident resulted from Wyatt\u2019s negligence and not from brake failure. <em>See Evid.R. </em>20, 63(1)(a), 63(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">We recognize that Cremean was later permitted to answer the following questions asked in rebuttal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-7\">Q. Did Sandy mention anything to you at that time concerning the car or any repairs or any work that was going to be done on the car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-8\">THE COURT: Yes or no?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-9\">THE WITNESS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-10\">BY MS. BUKALA:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-11\">Q. Can you tell us what was said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-12\">A. Well, she was upset\u2014well, after the accident she was upset that Joe\u2014he was going to be mad, and I asked her if he was going to be mad and she said that no, because it was going to be taken care of so far as\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-13\">THE COURT: He would be mad so far as Firestone would take care of it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6a\">MS. BUKALA: No, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>THE WITNESS: It would be taken care of as far as Firestone would be at\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-5\">THE COURT: Pardon me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-6\">THE WITNESS: It will be taken care of so far as Firestone will be at fault.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AkS\">While this testimony covered part of the subject matter plaintiffs had unsuccessfully attempted to inquire about previously, it did not encompass all the rebuttal testimony which Cremean was allegedly prepared to give. Therefore, the prejudice to plaintiffs from the trial judge\u2019s improper limitation of Creme-an\u2019s rebuttal testimony was not cured.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">Over plaintiffs\u2019 objection, Wyatt\u2019s father-in-law, Marvel Henson, was permitted to testify that he saw her car a few days after the accident and that there was brake fluid near one of the front wheels. He also was permitted to testify that he saw the car again approximately a month after the accident and that at that time the brake pad was worn down to the metal. The obvious purpose of this testimony was to support Wyatt\u2019s defense that the cause of the accident was brake failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">We conclude that Henson\u2019s testimony was inadmissible in the absence of expert testimony that his observations would support an inference that the brakes were defective at the time of the accident. It is firmly established that if a subject is so esoteric that jurors of common judgment and experience cannot form a valid conclusion, a jury may not be permitted to draw a particular conclusion without the aid of an expert opinion. <em>Butler v. Acme Markets, Inc., </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>270, 283 (1982). Although the record indicates that Henson was qualified to recognize brake fluid and a worn brake pad, no attempt was made to qualify him to testify concerning the significance of his observations. However, expert testimony was required in order for the jury to infer from Henson\u2019s observations that Wyatt\u2019s brakes were defective at the time of the accident. Without expert testimony, the record does not disclose whether a leak of brake fluid or a worn brake pad could lead to sudden brake failure, or whether either of these conditions could have been caused by the accident itself or by operation of the vehicle after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>the accident. Therefore, by allowing Henson to testify concerning his observations of the car after the accident, the trial judge permitted the jury to draw inferences which it was not qualified to draw.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">\u25a0 IV</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">In view of the fact that a new trial is required based on the trial errors discussed above, there is no need to consider plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the trial judge abused his discretion in not declaring a mistrial when Wyatt\u2019s counsel indicated to the jury that his client had not received a summons. However, we note that this comment was made only after plaintiffs\u2019 counsel read an interrogatory answer to the jury which asserted that Wyatt had committed a traffic violation. If this interrogatory answer is read to the jury at the retrial, the reference to the commission of a traffic violation should be excised and thus the issue will not arise again.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of no cause of action is reversed and the matter is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b609-15\">Plaintiffs have not appealed from the jury\u2019s verdict of no cause of action in favor of DeYoung.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b614-11\">Wyatt filed a notice of cross appeal from \"... certain evidentiary rulings made during trial____\u201d However, appeals are taken solely from judgments. <em>Chimes v. Oritani Motor Hotel, Inc., </em>195 <em>N.J.Super. </em>435, 443 (App.Div.1984). Here, the verdict of no cause of action was wholly in favor of Wyatt. Therefore, there was no order or judgment adverse to Wyatt from which she could appeal. In any event, the only \u201cevidentiary ruling\u201d challenged in Wyatt\u2019s brief is the trial judge\u2019s instruction to the jury with respect to the Firestone settlement. On remand any evidence of that settlement will be excluded and hence there will be no need for a jury instruction on this subject.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
