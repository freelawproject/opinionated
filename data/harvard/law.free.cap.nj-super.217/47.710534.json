The facts are set forth in the trial judge\u2019s opinion denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, which is published at 202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>511 (Law Div.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">According to the jury verdict the theft by defendant was of property of Hahne\u2019s Department Store (Hahne\u2019s) in Westfield; Deborah Schlapak, a security guard employed by Hahne\u2019s was the victim of the robbery; and John DeBella, another Hahne\u2019s security guard, was the victim of the assault. Defendant had been stopped for questioning by the two security guards upon suspicion of shoplifting. He refused to accompany them to the security office. Breaking away, he punched DeBella, knocking him down, grabbed and pushed Schlapak and fled. Nothing was taken from the person of either security guard.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">On appeal defendant raises two issues: Error in the trial judge\u2019s charge submitting two counts of robbery to the jury \u201cwhere two persons were assaulted during the commission of a single theft;\u201d and error \u201cin permitting defendant to be seen dressed in prison garb by the jury without questioning defendant directly and not merely through his counsel as to the possible prejudice which may have attached.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">The second issue raised by defendant clearly lacks merit, <em>R. </em>2:11\u20143(e)(2). In defendant\u2019s presence outside the hearing of the jury his attorney several times confirmed that defendant understood that he had the right to appear before the jury in street clothes but, exercising his own judgment, had chosen to appear instead in prison garb. According to <em>Estelle v. Williams, </em>425 <em>U.S. </em>501, 507, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>1691, 1694-5, 48 L.Ed.2d 126, 133 (1976), \u201c[T]he particular evil proscribed is compelling a defendant, against his will, to be tried in jail attire.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>We likewise discern no merit to defendant\u2019s first issue. Clearly, the trial judge was obligated to submit to the jury both counts of robbery, one charging robbery of Schlapak and one charging robbery of DeBella, in the light of the risk, if he did not, that an acquittal on one count would bar a subsequent prosecution on the other count. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-8b provides that, unless separate trials are ordered pursuant\u2019 to the Rules of Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-6\">[A] defendant shall not be subject to separate trials for multiple criminal offenses based on the same conduct or arising from the same episode, if such offenses are known to the appropriate prosecuting officer at the time of the commencement of the first trial and are within the jurisdiction and venue of a single court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">In the event of two jury convictions of robbery, the trial judge would have had to determine whether the two convictions should be merged, as he noted in his published opinion, 202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 519. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-8a: \u201cA determination barring multiple convictions shall be made by the court after verdict or finding of guilt.\u201d This provision of the Code was adopted to preclude double jeopardy consequences by merger decisions prior to verdict, <em>State v. Berrios, </em>186 <em>N.J.Super. </em>198, 202, n. 2 (Law Div.1982). Thus submission to the jury of two criminal charges, convictions of both of which would be subject to mandatory merger, is not error, <em>State v. Moran, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>79, 82 (1977); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-8e.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">On appeal, defendant does not challenge his conviction of theft on the ground that theft was a necessarily included element of robbery, mandating merger. We are nevertheless constrained <em>sua sponte </em>to vacate his theft conviction on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">Defendant\u2019s robbery conviction was pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-la: \u201cA person is guilty of robbery, if in the course of committing a theft, he inflicts bodily injury or uses force upon another;\u201d and the further statutory definition: \u201cAn act shall be deemed to be included in the phrase \u2018in the course of committing a theft\u2019 if it occurs ... in immediate flight after the attempt or commission.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>Defendant committed theft of property of Hahne\u2019s. In immediate flight after its commission he inflicted bodily injury or used force on the security guard Schlapak. Robbery may be committed by assault upon one victim following a theft from another, <em>State v. Mirault, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>492, 497 fn. 4 (1983). Theft or attempted theft is a necessary element of any robbery, <em>State v. Carlos, </em>187 <em>N.J.Super. </em>406, 412 (App.Div.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The published opinion below states at 518: \u201cIt is ... clear under the rationale of <em>Mirault, </em>that two robberies were committed.\u201d We express our disagreement. \u201cTheft of Hahne\u2019s\u201d was charged to the jury as a lesser included offense, not theft from Schlapak or DeBella individually.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A robbery conviction must be premised upon a separate theft, whether from the robbery victim or another, <em>see Carlos </em>at 416. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-1a should not be extended by implication to sustain two robbery convictions for assaults upon two victims in immediate flight after a theft or attempted theft from a third victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">We vacate defendant\u2019s conviction of theft by merging it into his conviction of robbery. We otherwise affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b81-12\"> <em>Carlos </em>suggests in dictum at 417 that two robberies may be committed by taking property by threat or force from two persons who are in joint constructive possession of it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
