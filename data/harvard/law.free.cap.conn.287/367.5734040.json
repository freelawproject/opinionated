J.</author>\n<p id=\"AB\">The plaintiffs, John M. Zulick and Barbara Y. Zulick,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> brought this action against the defendant, Patrons Mutual Insurance Company, alleging that the defendant had breached the terms of an insurance policy providing for coverage for loss of the plaintiffs\u2019 personal property and had violated the Connecticut Unfair Insurance Practices Act (CUIPA), General Statutes \u00a7 38a-815 et seq., and the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq. The trial court rendered summary judgment in favor of the defendant on all of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, and the plaintiffs then filed this appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly determined that the loss of their property fell within a coverage limitation for \u201cpersonal property usually on [the] residential premises of an [i]nsured other than the [i]nsured premises . . . .\u201d We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">The trial court found the following undisputed facts. The plaintiffs owned and resided in a residence at 348 Lipps Road in Ashford. They also owned property at 296 Westford Hill Road in Ashford, which is adjacent to the property at 348 Lipps Road. They leased out a residence on the property at 296 Westford Hill Road and kept certain personal property in a bam and carriage shed located on the property. On August 27, 2002, a fire destroyed the bam and carriage shed, causing a loss of the plaintiffs\u2019 personal property in the amount of $39,084.43.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>The defendant had issued an insurance policy to the plaintiffs providing coverage for the loss or damage to the property at 348 Lipps Road, including related private structures and personal property. The policy provided: \u201cWe cover personal property owned by or in the care of an [i]nsured. Coverage for personal property usually on residential premises of an [i]nsured other than the [i]nsured premises is limited to 10 percent of the [c] overage C limit.\u201d The coverage C limit of the policy was $84,700. The plaintiffs filed a claim under the policy for the loss of their personal property in the bam and carriage shed. The defendant responded that the personal property had been located on \u201cresidential premises other than the insured premises\u201d and offered to pay the plaintiffs 10 percent of the coverage C limit, or $8470.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Thereafter, the plaintiffs brought this action alleging that the defendant had breached the insurance policy and had violated CUTPA and CUIPA. The plaintiffs claimed that, because the destroyed bam and carriage shed had been \u201clocated adjacent to the principal residence\u201d at 348 Lipps Road and were \u201cneither used for nor suitable for residential use,\u201d the coverage limitation for personal property kept on residential premises did not apply. The defendant raised as a special defense that, because the personal property had been located on the separately insured property at 296 Westford Hill Road, the personal property was on \u201cresidential premises other than the insured premises\u201d and the coverage limitation applied. Therefore, the defendant claimed, coverage was limited to 10 percent of the coverage C limit. The plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the defendant\u2019s special defense claiming that, because the policy language was ambiguous, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>must be construed in their favor. The defendant objected to the plaintiffs\u2019 motion and filed a cross motion for summary judgment on the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">After a hearing, the trial court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment and partially granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the defendant had breached the insurance policy. The court denied the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment with respect to the CUTPA and CUIPA claims on the ground that the motion was premature. The defendant later filed another motion for summary judgment on the plaintiffs\u2019 CUIPA and CUTPA claims, alleging that the plaintiffs had failed to present any evidence to support their claim that the defendant incorrectly had interpreted the coverage limitation as a general business practice. The trial court granted that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">This appeal followed. The plaintiffs contend that the trial court improperly: (1) determined that the property at 296 Westford Hill Road was a \u201cresidential premises of an [i]nsured other than the [i]nsured premises,\u201d thereby limiting coverage of their loss to 10 percent of the coverage C limit; and (2) rendered summary judgment in favor of the defendant on the plaintiffs\u2019 CUTPA and CUIPA claims. We disagree with both claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">We first address the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the trial court improperly determined that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether the property at 296 Westford Hill Road was a \u201cresidential premises of an [i]nsured other than the [i]nsured premises\u201d under the policy\u2019s coverage limitation. The plaintiffs claim that the phrase is ambiguous and reasonably can be interpreted to mean exclusively a premises at which <em>the insured </em>resides. The defendant counters that the trial court properly determined that the phrase unambiguously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>means any property that is used as a residential premises.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We conclude that the phrase unambiguously refers to a residential premises owned by an insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">As a preliminary matter, we set forth the applicable standard of review. \u201cPractice Book \u00a7 17-49 provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. . . . The party moving for summary judgment has the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue of material fact and that the party is, therefore, entitled to judgment as a matter of law. . . . On appeal, we must determine whether the legal conclusions reached by the trial court are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision of the trial court. . . . Our review of the trial court\u2019s decision to grant the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bellemare </em>v. <em>Wachovia Mortgage Corp., </em>284 Conn. 193, 198-99, 931 A.2d 916 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">\u201c[Construction of a contract of insurance presents a question of law for the court which this court reviews de novo. ... An insurance policy is to be interpreted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>by the same general rules that govern the construction of any written contract .... In accordance with those principles, [t]he determinative question is the intent of the parties, that is, what coverage the . . . [insured] expected to receive and what the [insurer] was to provide, as disclosed by the provisions of the policy. ... If the terms of the policy are clear and unambiguous, then the language, from which the intention of the parties is to be deduced, must be accorded its natural and ordinary meaning. . . . Under those circumstances, the policy is to be given effect according to its terms. . . . When interpreting [an insurance policy], we must look at the contract as a whole, consider all relevant portions together and, if possible, give operative effect to every provision in order to reach a reasonable overall result. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">\u201cIn determining whether the terms of an insurance policy are clear and unambiguous, [a] court will not torture words to import ambiguity where the ordinary meaning leaves no room for ambiguity .... Similarly, any ambiguity in a contract must emanate from the language used in the contract rather than from one party\u2019s subjective perception of the terms. ... As with contracts generally, a provision in an insurance policy is ambiguous when it is reasonably susceptible to more than one reading. . . . Under those circumstances, any ambiguity in the terms of an insurance policy must be construed in favor of the insured because the insurance company drafted the policy. . . . This rule of construction may not be applied, however, unless the policy terms are indeed ambiguous.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut Medical Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Kulikowski, </em>286 Conn. 1, 5-6, 942 A.2d 334 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">We begin our analysis with the language of the policy. The policy provides in relevant part: \u201cThis policy insures against direct physical loss to property covered under [c]overage C\u2014[p]ersonal [property, caused by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>. . . [f]ire . . . .\u201d As we have indicated, coverage C provides: \u201cWe cover personal property owned by or in the care of an [i]nsured. Coverage for personal property usually on residential premises of an [i]nsured other than the [ijnsured premises is limited to 10 percent of the [c]overage C limit.\u201d The policy defines \u201cresidence\u201d as \u201ca one-[family] to four-family house, a townhouse, a row house or a one-[family] or two-family mobile home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, nothing in this language suggests that the coverage limitation applies <em>exclusively </em>to premises that are <em>used by the insured </em>as a residence. Rather, we conclude that an insured of ordinary intelligence and experience reasonably would expect the phrase \u201cresidential premises <em>of an [ijnsured\u201d </em>to apply to all residential premises that are <em>owned by the insured, </em>regardless of whether the insured uses or occupies the premises.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, we conclude that the language of the coverage limitation is not ambiguous under these circumstances,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that the trial court properly concluded that the property at 296 Westford Hill Road was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>a residential premises of the insured other than the insured premises.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">This interpretation is supported by a leading property insurance treatise, which states: \u201cCoverage for personal property which is usually located at an \u2018insured\u2019s\u2019 residence, other than at the \u2018residence premises,\u2019 is limited to 10 [percent] of the limit of liability for [personal property] .... This limitation would limit the coverage for the insured\u2019s personal property at another residence <em>owned by an insured, </em>as for example, a beach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>house.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 1 R. Brennan &amp; P. Tompa, Insuring Real Property (2003) \u00a7 4.04A (3) (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Our conclusion also is consistent with the underlying purpose of the coverage limitation. The amount of an insurance policy premium is a function of the level of risk. If a policy issued for one residential premises fully covered personal property usually kept on other residential premises owned by the insured, the insurance company could not accurately calculate the level of risk and the risk could change dramatically depending on whether the insured used or leased out the other residential premises and as the insured acquired and disposed of such properties. It is reasonable to conclude, therefore, that the coverage limitation was intended to ensure that the insurance company is not liable for risks that were not included in the price of the premium.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This creates no undue hardship for an insured who owns multiple residential premises because the insured can purchase separate insurance policies for the personal property usually kept on each premises. We can conceive of no reason that an insurance company would limit coverage for personal property usually kept on residential premises owned by the insured other than the insured premises <em>only </em>if the insured used the premises as a residence. In fact, the risk to personal property usually kept at residential premises that the insured <em>does not </em>use as a residence would be <em>greater </em>than the risk to personal property usually kept at residential premises that the insured occupied.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">In support of their interpretation of the coverage limitation, the plaintiffs rely on a number of cases from this state and other jurisdictions that have held that the term \u201cresidence\u201d means a dwelling in which the insured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>lives or resides. Upon review of those cases, however, it is apparent that they all either involved the interpretation of policy provisions that differed from the one at issue here or did not involve property insurance policies at all.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Significantly, in all of the cases involving property insurance policies, the policies defined residential premises as a dwelling where the insured resides.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Accordingly, we do not find these cases to be persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>The plaintiffs also contend that their intent when they purchased the policy \u201cwas to fully cover the personal property used to maintain [the insured premises], including the area immediately surrounding the residence and beyond on a day-to-day basis.\u201d They argue that, because the bam and carriage shed were adjacent to the insured premises and were not used as a residence, and because the personal property that they kept there was used in connection with the insured premises, the bam and carriage shed were not \u201cresidential premises of an [i]nsured other than the [i]nsured premises . . . .\u201d Having concluded, however, that the coverage limitation unambiguously applied to the property at 296 Westford Hill Road, on which the bam and carriage shed were located, we must conclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 subjective intent based on the proximity of the bam and carriage shed to the insured property is irrelevant. See <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Ace American Reinsurance Co., </em>284 Conn. 744, 771, 936 A.2d 224 (2007) (\u201cextrinsic evidence may be considered in determining contractual intent only if a contract is ambiguous\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The foregoing analysis disposes of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the trial court improperly rendered summary judgment in favor of the defendant on the plaintiffs\u2019 CUTPA and CUIPA claims. Because we have concluded that the defendant\u2019s interpretation of the policy\u2019s coverage limitation was correct, there can be no genuine issue of material fact as to whether the application of that interpretation as a general business practice constituted oppressive, unethical or unscrupulous conduct in violation of the statutes.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b391-8\"> John M. Zulick died on November 3, 2004. Thereafter, the trial court granted a motion to substitute Barbara Y. Zulick, executrix of his estate, as the plaintiff. For convenience, we refer to John M. Zulick and Barbara Y. Zulick as the plaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b391-9\"> The plaintiffs appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b392-7\"> The trial court found that the defendant offered the plaintiffs $8470 on the loss. The plaintiffs claim that the defendant paid them $8893.50. The reason for this discrepancy is not clear from the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b394-8\"> The defendant states that \u201ccoverage is determined solely by whether the premises are \u2018residential\u2019 not whether the premises are an insured\u2019s \u2018residence.\u2019 \u201d It is not clear whether the defendant believes that the phrase \u201cresidential premises of an [i]nsured\u201d in the policy refers exclusively to residential premises <em>owned by </em>an insured, or whether the phrase also refers to residential premises that are occupied, but not owned, by an insured. Cf. <em>Mulledy </em>v. <em>West Virginia Ins. </em>Co., 201 W. Va. 195, 197, 495 S.E.2d 566 (1997) (interpreting \u201cresidential premises of an insured\u201d to include all residential premises, including those neither owned by nor occupied by insured). We find the latter interpretation to be questionable, but there is no need to decide the issue in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b396-5\"> In support of their argument to the contrary, the plaintiffs contend that the policy definition of \u201c \u2018residence\u2019 \u201d does not apply to the coverage limitation. Rather, they contend, \u201c[t]he word \u2018residential\u2019 reasonably refers to type of <em>use, </em>not type of <em>construction, </em>and thus [implies] the <em>use by the insureds </em>of the premises, not the use [by] uninsured third parties.\u201d (Emphasis added.) They further contend that applying the policy definition of residence to the residential premises language of the coverage limitation leads to the \u201caberrant result\u201d that there would be \u201c100 [percent] coverage of property in a five-unit apartment building actually occupied by the insured or in a business but only 10 [percent] coverage for property in a one to four family structure never occupied by the insured.\u201d We conclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 focus on the applicability of the policy definition of residence is misplaced. Because there is no dispute in the present case that the residence at 296 Westford Hill Road came within the policy definition of residence, there is no need to decide whether that definition applies to the coverage limitation. We note, however, that the defendant agrees with the plaintiffs that the policy definition of residence does <em>not </em>apply to residential premises. Rather, it contends, the phrase residential premises applies to <em>any </em>property that is used for residential purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b396-6\"> The phrase \u201cresidential premises of an [ijnsured\u201d may or may not be ambiguous as to whether it is limited by the policy definition of residence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>or whether it includes residential premises that are occupied, but not owned, by the insured. See footnote 5 of this opinion. Those questions are not before us in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">We recognize that we have held that \u201c[t]he existence of both a narrow and a broad definition of [an insurance policy term] imports an ambiguity into the meaning of the term . . . .\u201d <em>R.T. Vanderbilt Co. </em>v. <em>Continental Casualty Co., </em>273 Conn. 448, 464, 870 A.2d 1048 (2005). We held in <em>R.T. Vanderbilt Co. </em>that, \u201c[bjecausetwo equally reasonable definitions of the term . . . exist, the broad definition must, in preference, be adopted because it will sustain the claim and cover the loss.\u201d Id., 465. We have concluded in the present case that an insured of ordinary intelligence and experience reasonably would expect the phrase \u201cresidential premises of an [ijnsured\u201d to include all residential premises owned by the insured and that nothing in the policy language supports the plaintiffs\u2019 exclusive interpretation. Accordingly, the principle that, when a broad meaning and a narrow meaning are equally reasonable, we will adopt the meaning that favors the insured, does not apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b397-13\"> In reaching this conclusion, the trial court relied on <em>Mulledy </em>v. <em>West Virginia Ins. Co., </em>201 W. Va. 195, 495 S.E.2d 566 (1997). In <em>Mulledy, </em>the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia construed a limitation on coverage for personal property loss identical to the limitation at issue in the present case. Id., 196. The court concluded that personal property that the insured kept on a residential premises that she neither owned nor occupied was subject to the 10 percent coverage limit. Id., 197. Because the court in <em>Mulledy </em>entirely ignored the \u201cof an insured\u201d language in the policy limitation in reaching its conclusion, we do not find <em>Mulledy, </em>or the trial court\u2019s interpretation of that case, to be persuasive. Indeed, the defendant did not rely on <em>Mulledy </em>in support of its position in its brief to this court or in the memorandum of law in support of its cross motion for summary judgment in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-14\">We note, however, that the insured in <em>Mulledy </em>contended that the coverage limitation applied to personal property kept on residential premises <em>owned by </em>her. Id. This bolsters our conclusion that a reasonable person of ordinary intelligence and experience would interpret the limitation in this way.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b398-8\"> See 1R.
