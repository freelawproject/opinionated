The defendant, Handy and Harman, Inc., appeals<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court granting the application of the plaintiff, HH East Parcel, LLC, to confirm, and denying the defendant\u2019s application to vacate, an arbitration award rendered in favor of the plaintiff. On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court, in confirming the award, improperly deferred to the arbitrator\u2019s factual findings when the court concluded that a per diem provision in a contract for the sale and remediation of real estate was a valid liquidated damages clause, rather than a penalty clause, the enforcement of which would violate the public policy of Connecticut. We conclude that the trial court properly deferred to the arbitrator\u2019s factual findings in determining that the award did not violate public policy. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">The record reveals the following undisputed background facts and procedural history. On or about December 31, 2003, the defendant sold real property located in Fairfield to the plaintiff for $8 million. The purchase and sale agreement (purchase agreement) required the defendant to demolish all existing buildings and structures on the property, and to remediate all environmental contamination on the property by December 31, 2004. The purchase agreement also pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>vided that time was of the essence with regard to the remediation. Sections 14 and 15 of the purchase agreement contained a per diem clause that required the defendant to pay to the plaintiff $5000 for each day after December 31, 2004, that the defendant had failed to complete the demolition and remediation as specified therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Although the plaintiff paid the defendant $8 million and received title to the property, the defendant failed to complete the remediation by December 31, 2004, as agreed to by the parties. The defendant also failed to pay the necessary contractors and subcontractors for remediation services rendered by December 31, 2004, and they placed various mechanic\u2019s liens on the property. Thus, the parties then entered into an environmental indemnification agreement (indemnification agreement) that required the defendant to indemnify and hold harmless the plaintiff for the losses caused by the defendant\u2019s failure to complete the remediation.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Thereafter, on April 5, 2005, the plaintiff filed a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association (association) pursuant to \u00a7 6 of the indemnification agreement,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and served a copy of that demand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>on the defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Attorney Edward V. Lahey, Jr., was selected as the arbitrator, and he conducted a two day arbitration in Stamford. At the arbitration, the defendant did not dispute its liability for breach of the purchase agreement, but did dispute the validity of the $5000 per diem clause, which the defendant claimed was an unenforceable penalty. The plaintiff contended, however, that the per diem clause was a valid liquidated damage provision. The arbitrator issued an award in December, 2005, upon concluding that the $5000 per diem clause was a reasonable and valid liquidated damages provision that had been properly negotiated by the parties. The arbitrator ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff $5000 per day for all unpaid per diem charges occurring since January 1, 2005, through November 30, 2005, for a total of $1,670,000, and directed the defendant to begin making monthly payments on that sum starting January 1, 2006. The arbitrator also ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff 6 percent interest on all unpaid per diem charges, and to fund and complete the demolition and remediation of the property without delay.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Shortly thereafter, the plaintiff brought this application to confirm the arbitration award pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-417,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the defendant filed its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>application and cross motion to vacate the award pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (a),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> claiming, inter alia, that \u201cthe award violate[d] public policy by awarding a draconian, limitless penalty . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The trial court relied on our decision in <em>Schoonmaker </em>v. <em>Cummings &amp; Lockwood of Connecticut, P.C., </em>252 Conn. 416, 747 A.2d 1017 (2000), and noted that, although it was required to review the award de novo because the defendant claimed that it violated the well established public policy against the enforcement of penalty clauses in contracts, it nevertheless was obligated to defer to the arbitrator\u2019s factual findings and interpretation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>underlying contract. The trial court determined that the arbitrator properly applied Connecticut law to conclude that the purchase agreement contained a valid liquidated damages clause based on his findings that the damages resulting from the breach of the contract would be difficult to estimate or provide, that the parties had intended to liquidate any resulting damages, and that the amount agreed upon in the contract was not unreasonable. The trial court also conducted, however, an additional review of the record in detail to determine whether the arbitrator\u2019s findings were in fact supported by substantial evidence, and concluded that the findings were supported by: (1) the negotiated nature of the per diem charge and the date that it would begin; and (2) the difficulties of ascertaining economic loss because of the fluctuating liens on the property and determining how long the remediation would take. Accordingly, the trial court rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that the arbitration award violated public policy, and rendered judgment confirming the award. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly deferred to the arbitrator\u2019s factual findings, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>because the issue of whether the per diem clause was a penalty is a mixed question of fact and law subject to de novo review. The defendant also claims that the trial court improperly confined its review to the issue of whether the arbitrator\u2019s findings were supported by substantial evidence, and claims that, even under that more restrictive standard of review, the evidence in the record does not support the arbitrator\u2019s conclusion that the per diem clause was not an illegal penalty. In response, the plaintiff relies on our recent decision in <em>C. R. Klewin Northeast, LLC </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>282 Conn. 54, 919 A.2d 1002 (2007), and contends that, in conducting its public policy analysis, the trial court properly relied upon and deferred to the arbitrator\u2019s factual findings. The plaintiff further argues that, although the trial court did not need to conduct that level of review, that court nevertheless properly determined that the arbitrator\u2019s factual finding that the parties intended to liquidate their damages, rather than impose an illegal penalty, is supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">At the outset, we note that whether the trial court engaged in the correct level of review of the arbitrator\u2019s decision presents a question of law over which our review is plenary. See id., 93; see also <em>LaSalla v. Doctor\u2019s Associates, Inc., </em>278 Conn. 578, 586, 898 A.2d 803 (2006) (\u201cthe proper scope of review, in both the trial court and this court, for a colorable claim that an award violated public policy is plenary\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Most of the general principles at issue herein are undisputed, namely, that \u201carbitration is a creature of contract, whereby the parties themselves, by agreement, define the powers of the arbitrators. . . . Moreover, we have stated that when the parties have established the authority of the arbitrator, the extent of our judicial review of the award is delineated by the scope of the parties\u2019 agreement. . . . When the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>have not restricted the scope of the arbitrator\u2019s authority, the resulting award is not subject to de novo review even for errors of law so long as the award conforms to the submission. . . .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-5\">\u201cThe long-standing principles governing consensual arbitration are, however, subject to certain exceptions. Although we have traditionally afforded considerable deference to the decisions of arbitrators, we have also conducted a more searching review of arbitral awards in certain circumstances. In <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>McCaskey, </em>[223 Conn. 1, 6, 612 A.2d 742 (1992)], this court listed three recognized grounds for vacating an award: (1) the award rules on the constitutionality of a statute . . . (2) the award violates clear public policy ... or (3) the award contravenes one or more of the statutory proscriptions of \u00a7 52-418 (a). . . . The judicial recognition of these grounds for vacatur evinces a willingness, in limited circumstances, to employ a heightened standard of judicial review of arbitral conclusions, despite the traditional high level of deference afforded to arbitrators\u2019 decisions when made in accordance with their authority pursuant to an unrestricted submission.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Schoonmaker </em>v. <em>Cummings &amp; Lockwood of Connecti</em>cut, <em>P.C., </em>supra, 252 Conn. 426-28.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">\u201cA court\u2019s refusal to enforce an arbitrator\u2019s award . . . because it is contrary to public policy is a specific application of the more general doctrine, rooted in the common law, that a court may refuse to enforce contracts that violate law or public policy. . . . This rule is an exception to the general rule restricting judicial review of arbitral awards. . . . The exception, however, is narrowly construed and ... is limited to situations where the contract as interpreted would violate some explicit public policy that is well defined and dominant, and is to be ascertained by reference to the laws and legal precedents and not from general consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>erations of supposed public interests. ... To be vacated under the narrow public policy exception, the award must be clearly illegal or clearly violative of a strong public policy. . . . Furthermore, [t]he party challenging the award bears the burden of proving that illegality or conflict with public policy is clearly demonstrated.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>C. R. Klewin Northeast, LLC </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>supra, 282 Conn. 93-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The seminal case with respect to the nature of the judicial review given to a claim that an arbitration award violates public policy is <em>Schoonmaker </em>v. <em>Cummings &amp; Lockwood of Connecticut, P.C., </em>supra, 252 Conn. 416. In that case, which involved a public policy challenge under rule 5.6 of the Rules of Professional Conduct to a partnership agreement provision that had conditioned the receipt of retirement benefits on compliance with a noncompete clause, we concluded that, \u201cwhere a party challenges a consensual arbitral award on the ground that it violates public policy, and where that challenge has a legitimate, colorable basis, de novo review of the award is appropriate in order to determine whether the award does in fact violate public policy.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Id., 429; see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>also id., 428-29 (discussing expressions of public policy in statutes, case law or administrative regulations and stating \u201cwhether . . . there exists a public policy mandate with which an arbitral award must conform . . . indisputably involves an issue of law properly resolved by an exercise of this court\u2019s plenary authority\u201d [citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted]). We emphasized, however, our \u201cadhere[nce] to the longstanding principle that findings of fact are ordinarily left undisturbed upon judicial review,\u201d and \u201cdeferred] to the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the agreements regarding the scope of the forfeiture upon competition provision, as well as the terms upon which postemployment benefits are offered to former employees. We conclude only that as a reviewing court, we must determine, pursuant to our plenary authority and giving appropriate deference to the arbitrator\u2019s factual conclusions, whether the forfeiture provision in question violates those policies. \u201d Id., 432. Indeed, we noted that \u201cin undertaking de novo review of the plaintiffs public policy claim, <em>we defer to the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the agreements </em>.... We therefore do not substitute our own reading of the contract terms for that of the arbitrator, but intervene only to the extent that <em>those terms, as interpreted, </em>violate a clearly established public policy.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 432 n.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>Our case law following <em>Schoonmaker </em>has emphasized that a reviewing court is bound by the arbitrator\u2019s factual findings in reviewing a claim that an award rendered in a consensual arbitration violates this state\u2019s public policy. See <em>State </em>v. <em>AFSCME, AFL-CIO, Council 4, Local 2663, 257 </em>Conn. 80, 95, 777 A.2d 169 (2001) (\u201cTo the extent that the plaintiff claims that the award violated public policy because the arbitrator misapplied the [contract\u2019s] definition of salaried employee, we decline to undertake judicial review of the arbitrator\u2019s factual determinations in interpreting the terms of the contract. The arbitrator made a factual determination that commission staff attorneys are hourly, rather than salaried employees.\u201d); <em>Groton </em>v. <em>United Steelworkers of America, </em>254 Conn. 35, 52, 757 A.2d 501 (2000) (noting that \u201clegal system . . . ordinarily give[s] great deference ... to both the factual and legal determinations of the arbitrators,\u201d and that even in a de novo public policy challenge, \u201cwe give deference to the arbitrator\u2019s factual determinations\u201d [citation omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The arbitrator\u2019s factual findings are equally binding when the public policy claim has been raised before the arbitrator in the form of a defense that the underlying contract is illegal. In <em>C. R. Klewin Northeast, LLC </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>supra, 282 Conn. 95, we relied on <em>Schoonmaker, </em>and further explained the significance of the arbitrator\u2019s findings of fact. In that case, a city had claimed that the arbitration award was made pursuant to a construction contract that had been procured illegally, and that confirming it would violate the state\u2019s public policy against corruption in municipal contracting. Id., 92. We agreed with the contractor\u2019s argument that \u201cthe city\u2019s arguments conflate two issues: (1) whether enforcement of an arbitration award, which deals with the lawfulness of the award itself, violates public policy; and (2) whether the contract underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>the award violates public policy because of its terms or the manner in which it was procured.\u201d Id. We noted that, \u201c[\u00a1Judicial review of whether an arbitration award violates public policy is de novo, but not completely unfettered. The legal determination of whether a particular award violates public policy <em>necessarily depends on the facts found by the arbitrator </em>during those proceedings.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 94. Thus, we concluded that \u201cthe city\u2019s public policy claim [was] functionally indistinguishable from its contract illegality defense, and because the city waived its opportunity to present that claim before the panel, the trial court properly determined that the city had waived its public policy claim because there was no factual predicate under which it could be reviewed.\u201d Id., 93; see also <em>Bridgeport </em>v. <em>Kasper Group, Inc., </em>278 Conn. 466, 499, 899 A.2d 523 (2006) <em>(Vertefeuille, J., </em>dissenting) (deferring to arbitrator\u2019s factual findings in concluding that contract did not violate public policy against illegal procurement and stating that \u201cI would not review the correctness of the finding, implicit in the arbitrator\u2019s award, that the contract was not illegally procured\u201d). Thus, we defer to the arbitrator\u2019s factual findings, even when the public policy determination for the courts turns on a \u201csubsidiary factual determination\u201d that is \u201cfundamentally indistinguishable\u201d from, or inextricably linked to, a substantive contract defense argued before the arbitrator. <em>C. R. Klewin Northeast, LLC </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>supra, 96.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">We acknowledge that several Appellate Court decisions cited by the parties conclude that, in reviewing a claim that an arbitration award violates public policy, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>the trial court should review the arbitrator\u2019s findings of fact to determine that they are supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>Enfield </em>v. <em>AFSCME, Council 4, Local 1029, </em>100 Conn. App. 470, 477, 918 A.2d 934, cert. denied, 282 Conn. 924, 925 A.2d 1105 (2007); <em>Board of Police Commissioners </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>92 Conn. App. 723, 734-36, 887 A.2d 394 (2005); <em>Metropolitan District Commission </em>v. <em>AFSCME, Council 4, Local 184, </em>89 Conn. App. 680, 686, 874 A.2d 839, cert. denied, 275 Conn. 912, 882 A.2d 673 (2005). These cases present, however, an incorrect statement of the law in the context of consensual arbitrations, like that in the present case, because they are founded on the Appellate Court\u2019s reliance on <em>Burns </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>80 Conn. App. 146, 151-52, 833 A.2d 934, cert. denied, 267 Conn. 909, 840 A.2d 1170 (2003), which is a lemon law arbitration case. See <em>Metropolitan District Commission </em>v. <em>AFSCME, Council 4, Local 184, </em>supra, 686. The substantial evidence standard is inapposite in the context of consensual arbitration awards because the use of that standard is statutorily prescribed for lemon law cases by General Statutes (Sup. 2008) \u00a7 42-181 (c) (4).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number><em>General Motors Corp. </em>v. <em>Dohmann, </em>247 Conn. 274, 281-82, 722 A.2d 1205 (1998). Indeed, the use of the substantial evidence standard, which \u201cpermit[s] judicial review that is broader than that traditionally available for \u00a7 52-418 review of voluntary arbitration awards\u201d; <em>Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Assn, of the United States, Inc. </em>v. <em>O'Neill, </em>212 Conn. 83, 96, 561 A.2d 917 (1989); for the judicial review of awards that result from arbitration that is statutorily compelled, saves those statutes from constitutional jeopardy under clauses protecting rights to due process and access to the courts. Id., 94; accord <em>Chmielewski </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>218 Conn. 646, 660-63, 591 A.2d 101 (1991) (factual determinations in compulsory arbitration in uninsured motorist cases pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 38-175c to be reviewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>under substantial evidence standard applicable to factual determinations by administrative agencies); see also <em>O &amp; G/O\u2019Connell Joint Venture </em>v. <em>Chase Family Ltd.

See, <em>e.g., American Car Rental, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Consumer Protection, </em>273 Conn. 296, 306-307, 869 A.2d 1198 (2005); <em>Berger </em>v. <em>Shanahan, </em>142 Conn. 726, 731-32, 118 A.2d 311 (1955). A clause fixing damages for a contractual breach, however, may be a permissible liquidated damages clause, rather than an illegal penalty clause, \u201cif three conditions are satisfied: (1) The damage which was to be expected as a result of a breach of the contract was uncertain in amount or difficult to prove; (2) there was an intent on the part of the parties to liquidate damages in advance; and (3) the amount stipulated was reasonable in the sense that it was not greatly disproportionate to the amount of the damage which, as the parties looked forward, seemed to be the presumable loss which would be sustained by the contractee in the event of a breach of the contract.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>American Car Rental, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Consumer Protection, </em>supra, 307, quoting <em>Berger </em>v. <em>Shanahan, </em>supra, 731-32. Thus, in fashioning the award, the arbitrator considered the legality of the clause at issue, and ruled directly on the public policy concerns implicated by this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Accordingly, we engage in a de novo review of the arbitrator\u2019s application of these legal principles to his factual findings. The arbitrator credited the testimony of Paul Dixon, the defendant\u2019s negotiator, who, during negotiations, had proposed an initial liquidated damages figure of $1500, then $2500, and then finally increased that number to $5000, but commencing 180 days later than the parties originally had intended. The arbitrator then relied on the testimony of Michael Bradley, the plaintiffs negotiator, who testified that the plaintiff expected to earn $5000 per day from the property, which \u201cis a valid proxy for damage caused by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>inability to use the asset acquired . . . .\u201d Finally, the arbitrator concluded that liquidation of damages was appropriate because the party in breach retained the power to stop the damages by remediating the property. The arbitrator emphasized that the $5000 per diem figure was agreed upon by \u201crepresentatives of two sophisticated businesses . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Thus, we conclude, on the basis of the facts as found by the arbitrator, that the per diem clause was a valid liquidated damages provision. In particular, we note that it was actively negotiated by the parties in an attempt to reach an agreement on the sale of the property. See <em>Hendricks Property Management Corp. </em>v. <em>Birchwood Properties Ltd. Partnership, </em>741 N.W.2d 461, 470 (N.D. 2007) (\u201cwhere experienced parties and their attorneys had multiple opportunities to examine the contracts and discuss their terms, including the liquidated damages clauses, we conclude the evidence supports the district court\u2019s finding that the liquidated damages clauses were the result of reasonable endeavor by the parties to fix compensation\u201d). We also emphasize that the arbitrator found it to be reasonable in light of the anticipated damages to the plaintiff from its inability to use the property, as well as the anticipated rate of return.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Cf. <em>American Car Rental, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Consumer Protection, </em>supra, 273 Conn. 309 (concluding that $150 per occurrence \u201cspeeding\u201d fee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>was unreasonable when it \u201cwas more than 400 times the potential damage incurred\u201d by rental vehicle, as \u201cthe hearing officer calculated the damage incurred by the plaintiff as a result of the operation of a rental vehicle at eighty miles per hour for two minutes at thirty-seven cents\u201d); <em>Schoonmaker </em>v. <em>Cummings &amp; Lockwood of Connecticut, P.C., </em>supra, 252 Conn. 435 n.12 (reasonableness of attorney\u2019s fees, although implicating public policy set by rule 1.5 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, remains question of fact requiring deference to arbitrator\u2019s findings). Thus, we conclude that the trial court properly determined that the arbitrator\u2019s enforcement of the per diem clause, which was actively negotiated by two sophisticated commercial parties that had the ample assistance of counsel,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> does not offend the public policy of our state.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b213-8\"> The defendant appealed <em>from </em>the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b214-7\"> The arbitration clause, \u00a7 6, of the indemnification agreement, provides: \u201cAny disputes which the parties may have with respect to the parties\u2019 obligations under this Agreement shall be resolved by expedited, binding arbitration, conducted by a sole arbitrator, in Stamford, CT, in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association, then prevailing, or any successor organization thereto having jurisdiction and having offices in Connecticut.

Each party shall pay its own counsel fees and expenses, if any, in connection with any such arbitration proceeding, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>the non-prevailing party in such arbitration, shall pay all expenses and fees of the arbitrator.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b215-8\"> Prior to initiating arbitration proceedings, the plaintiff had served the defendant with a written \u201c \u2018notice of loss\u2019 \u201d and demanded indemnification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b215-9\"> The arbitrator also ordered the defendant to report to the plaintiff concerning all contractors and subcontractors who had worked on the demolition and remediation effort, to reconcile their accounts, and to cause the satisfaction, challenge and discharge of all liens on the property.

The trial court rejected these claims, and the defendant has not pursued them further in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b217-6\"> In reviewing the record, we, sua sponte, questioned the subject matter jurisdiction of the trial court over the defendant\u2019s claims in the present case in light of our recent decision in <em>Bloomfield </em>v. <em>United Electrical, Radio &amp; Machine Workers of America, Connecticut Independent Police Union, Local 14, </em>285 Conn. 278, 939 A.2d 561 (2008). In <em>Bloomfield, </em>we concluded that the thirty day filing period set forth by General Statutes \u00a7 52-420 (b), which is subject matter jurisdictional in nature, \u201capplies to an application to vacate an arbitration award on the ground that it violates public policy.\u201d Id., 292. It appeared from the multiple facsimile machine dates on the award included in the record, specifically December 23 and December 27, 2005, that the defendant\u2019s objections and cross motion to vacate, which was filed on January 26,2006, may have been filed more than thirty days from the issuance of the award. Accordingly, we directed the parties to file supplemental briefs addressing this question. They have advised us that the association originally issued the award to the parties by facsimile on December 27, 2005. Thus, the plaintiffs application and cross motion were filed within the thirty day time limitation of \u00a7 52-420 (b), and the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b220-6\"> In <em>Schoonmaker, </em>we reasoned that \u201cthe identification and application of the public policy of this state presents considerations regarding which courts have greater expertise and knowledge than arbitrators, who are often drawn from the ranks of various professions including, but not limited to, the law. Because in this respect arbitrators and a reviewing court do not stand on equal ground, it comports with logic for the court to review the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of an ethics rule de novo rather than to leave it to the arbitrators themselves to attempt to apply pertinent public policy. Moreover, given that it is the role of the reviewing court to articulate the actual policy objectives that emanate from a particular rule of conduct, so too is a reviewing court better suited to evaluate whether certain facts, as found by the arbitrator, comport with the specific public policy that is at issue.\u201d <em>Schoonmaker </em>v. <em>Cummings &amp; Lockwood of Connecticut, P.C., </em>supra, 252 Conn. 430. We also noted that \u201calthough in the course of rendering an award an arbitrator may consider whether the award sought would violate or comport with a clear public policy\u2014as the arbitrator did in this case\u2014 often the question of whether the award does so will not arise until after the award has been rendered.\u201d Id. Finally, we noted that \u201cthe public policy exception is one of three that we have identified as exceptions to the rale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>of deference.\u201d Id., 430-31.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b221-7\"> We rejected the defendants\u2019 argument that, \u201cby applying de novo review to an arbitrator\u2019s application of the ethics rules, we unwittingly open the floodgates of litigation to any party seeking to vacate an arbitration award that involves application of any one of the rules,\u201d including disputes over attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Sckoonmaker </em>v. <em>Cummings &amp; Lockwood of Connecticut, P.C., </em>supra, 252 Conn. 435 n.12. We concluded that, \u201c[t]he inquiry into the \u2018reasonableness\u2019 of attorney\u2019s fees under rule 1.5 [of the Rules of Professional Conduct] . . . although legal in nature, is intensely factual in application and as stated previously, we do not digress from the principle of deference to an arbitrator\u2019s findings of fact. . . . Therefore, in the context of a dispute involving rule 1.5, we would be bound to uphold an arbitrator\u2019s award if it was based upon reasonable factual findings.\u201d Id.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b223-6\"> To the extent that the defendant claims that factual determinations by the arbitrators must be reviewed anew by a trial court reviewing a public policy claim, we disagree, because we already have rejected that proposition as an \u201cinvitation to turn public policy challenges into the arbitration equivalent of a \u2018mulligan\u2019 by inviting de novo factual review of illegal contract issues.\u201d <em>C.R.

Upon filing such application the moving party shall mail a copy of the application to the Attorney General and, upon entry of any judgment or decree, shall mail a copy of such judgment or decree to the Attorney General. A review of such application shall be confined to the record of the proceedings before the arbitrator. The court shall conduct a de novo review of the questions of law raised in the application. In addition to the grounds set forth in sections 52-418 and 52-419, the court shall consider questions of fact raised in the application. <em>In reviewing questions of fact, the court shall uphold the award unless it determines that the factual findings of the arbitrator are no t supported by substantial evidence in the record </em>and that the substantial rights of the moving party have been prejudiced.

In that case, we concluded that \u201cthe public policy against embezzlement encompasses the policy that an employer should not be compelled to reinstate an employee who has been convicted of embezzling the employer\u2019s funds, irrespective of whether the conviction followed a trial, a guilty plea or a nolo contendere plea.\u201d Id., 48. <em>Groton </em>is inapposite because all of the facts of that case, including the meaning of the contract therein, were undisputed, and the public policy issue presented, therefore, a pure question of law. See id., 46. Indeed, we emphasized in <em>Groton </em>that, although public policy questions receive de novo review, we nevertheless \u201cgive deference to the arbitrator\u2019s factual determinations.\u201d Id., 52.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b226-6\"> The trial court, therefore, did not need to conduct, in effect, appellate review of the arbitrator\u2019s factual conclusions in the present case to determine whether they were supported by substantial evidence. This review, while commendably thorough, was unnecessary in the context of this consensual arbitration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b226-7\"> Parties to agreements remain, however, free to contract for expanded judicial review of an arbitrator\u2019s findings. See <em>Stutz </em>v. <em>Shepard, </em>279 Conn. 115, 124, 901 A.2d 33 (2006) (parties \u201cmutually, agreed upon\u201d application of \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d review).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b228-6\"> In support of its argument that the per diem clause is an illegal penalty clause, the defendant argues that the \u201cself-help\u201d provision of the purchase agreement permits the plaintiff to assume remediation responsibilities, at which point the per diem charges would stop accruing. The defendant does not, however, argue that the total liquidated damages amount itself violates public policy because the plaintiff had a duty, at some point, to mitigate those damages, rather than rely upon the per diem clause as a limitless annuity. Indeed, this decision, although concluding that the per diem clause at issue herein does not by itself violate public policy, should not be read to countenance such a practice, which would constitute an illegal penalty. See <em>Newington </em>v. <em>General Sanitation Service Co., </em>196 Conn. 81, 85, 491 A.2d 363 (1985) (liquidated damages clause in breached municipal sanitation service contract \u201cshould not be construed to excuse the plaintiff from a duty to use reasonable care to minimize its damages\u201d in selection of substitute sanitation provider); <em>Norwalk Door Closer Co. </em>v. <em>Eagle Lock &amp; Screw Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>153 Conn. 681, 688-89, 220 A.2d 263 (1966) (\u201cThis is not to say that any burden is placed on a plaintiff to prove actual damage in order to recover under a valid contract for liquidated damages. The proposition is only that equitable principles will be invoked to deny recovery when the facts make it apparent that no damage has been suffered.\u201d); see also id., 689-90 (\u201cConsequently, if the damage envisioned by the parties never occurs, the whole premise for their agreed estimate vanishes, and, even if the contract was to be construed as one for liquidated damages rather than one for a penalty, neither justice nor the intent of the parties is served by enforcement. To enforce it would amount in reality to the infliction of a penalty.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b229-8\"> The defendant, relying on the testimony of its counsel for the negotiation of the purchase agreement, claims that the per diem clause is an illegal penalty because the parties had characterized it throughout as a \u201c \u2018hammer\u2019 \u201d or \u201cpenalty.\u201d See, e.g., <em>American Car Rental, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Consumer Protection, </em>supra, 273 Conn. 306 (\u201c[a] contractual provision for a penalty is one the prime purpose of which is to prevent a breach of the contract by holding over the head of a contracting party the threat of punishment for a breach\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). It is, however, well settled that whether a clause is a valid liquidated damage provision, rather than an illegal penalty, is a matter of the parties\u2019 intent, and that the determination is \u201cnot controlled by the fact that the phrase liquidated damages or the word penalty is used.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Inasmuch as the arbitrator already has made comprehensive findings on this point, we defer to those findings and decline the defendant\u2019s invitation to retry these facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
