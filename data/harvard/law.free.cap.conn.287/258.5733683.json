The state claims that the trial court improperly denied its motion to vacate the arbitration award because the award violates public policy and is in manifest disregard of the law. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">The record reveals the following undisputed material facts and procedural history. At some time prior to January 1, 2005, Martin Reyes, a lieutenant employed by the department of correction (department), and stationed at the Brooklyn correctional institution, requested a transfer to the Corrigan-Radgwoski correctional institution (Corrigan). Soon thereafter, Danielle Locas, a correction officer stationed at Corrigan, learned of Reyes\u2019 request and became concerned about the prospects of working with him. Reyes and Locas previously had been involved in a romantic relationship, which had turned violent as a result of an incident that had occurred in December, 1994. After this incident, Locas had filed an application for a restraining order<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 46b-15.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On December 28, 1994, the trial court concluded that Locas\u2019 statement demonstrated that probable cause existed as to whether Locas was \u201csubjected to a continuous threat of present physical pain or physical injury . . . .\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 46b-15 (a). The trial court issued an ex parte restraining order preventing Reyes from contacting or stalking Locas. Pursuant to the terms of the order, it lapsed after ninety days because no hearing was conducted on the merits of Locas\u2019 underlying allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">Upon learning of Reyes\u2019 transfer request, Locas contacted Antonio Ponvert III, an attorney, concerning Reyes\u2019 transfer request. On or about January 5, 2005, Ponvert wrote to Margaret Chappie, an assistant attorney general, to inform Chappie of Locas\u2019 concerns regarding Reyes\u2019 transfer request. In the letter, Ponvert briefly described the incident that had occurred between Reyes and Locas in December, 1994. Ponvert requested that Chappie consult with the commissioner of the department in order to take appropriate action to protect Locas and to ensure her safety. Ponvert also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>informed Chappie that Locas was a named plaintiff in a sexual harassment action that had been filed in federal court by female employees of the department. On or about January 12, 2005, Locas wrote to Daniel Callahan, the director of human resources at the department, and informed him that a human resources employee had requested a copy of the police report of the December, 1994 incident. Locas indicated that she no longer had a copy of the police report, so she had sent the application for the restraining order that she had filed with the court instead. She also stated that she feared that Reyes would attempt to retaliate against her if he was transferred to Corrigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">On or about February 1,2005, the state notified Reyes of its decision to remove him from the Corrigan transfer list. The state informed Reyes that it had based its decision to remove his name on his past interactions with Locas. The state also indicated, during the hearing before the trial court on its motion to vacate the arbitration award, that the pending sexual harassment action played a role in its decision to remove Reyes from the transfer list, even though the allegations in the action did not implicate Reyes. On or about March 31, 2005, a vacancy occurred at Corrigan, which the state filled by transferring an employee who was junior to Reyes and who was on the transfer list.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The voluntary transfer of correction officers is governed by a collective bargaining agreement (agreement) executed between the state and the defendant, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 5-276a. Article five<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>agreement provides that except where otherwise limited by an express provision of the agreement, the state retains traditional managerial rights with regard to transfer of employees. Article twenty of the agreement sets forth specific guidelines that govern shift and facility assignments. Specifically, article twenty, \u00a7 6<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> governs voluntary transfers of employees. In order to effectuate a voluntary transfer, an employee must first place his or her name on a transfer list that corresponds to the employee\u2019s desired institution. Once a position at the designated institution becomes vacant, the employee\u2019s request will be granted if the employee is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>the most senior employee on the transfer list. Article twenty, \u00a7 6 does not reference any other factor to be considered in granting a voluntary transfer, other than compliance with the transfer list requirement and seniority.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">Pursuant to these and other operative provisions of the agreement, the defendant filed a grievance on behalf of Reyes. The parties submitted the following stipulated issues to the arbitrator: (1) \u201cDid the . . . [department . . . violate [a]rticle [seventeen] and/or [a]rticle [twenty] of the [agreement] when it removed the name of . . . Reyes from the transfer list to [Corrigan] on or before February 1, 2005?\u201d; and (2) \u201cIf not, what shall be the remedy consistent with the [agreement]?\u201d On November 21, 2005, and January 18, 2006, the arbitrator conducted hearings on the stipulated issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">On March 31, 2006, the arbitrator sustained the grievance and ordered Reyes\u2019 transfer to Corrigan. In the opinion and award, the arbitrator first concluded that a prima facie case had been made that the state violated Reyes\u2019 transfer rights and that the state was unable to satisfy its burden to demonstrate \u201cwhy [it was] entitled to remove a senior employee from a facility transfer list and award a vacant position to a junior officer.\u201d The arbitrator then found the following facts and drew the following conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">The arbitrator noted that after Reyes had requested the transfer to Corrigan, the state removed his name from the transfer list because it believed that Reyes sought the transfer to Corrigan as a means of retaliating against Locas for complaints that she had filed against him. The state feared that effectuating Reyes\u2019 transfer would create a hostile work environment for Locas. The arbitrator recounted Locas\u2019 testimony that she is still concerned about what Reyes might do to her, even though more than one decade had passed between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>December, 1994 incident and his transfer request. Locas also testified that Reyes had stalked her and had attempted to contact her by coming to her front door, in violation of the ex parte restraining order. The arbitrator also noted that Reyes\u2019 reasons for requesting the transfer were unknown. The arbitrator indicated that the state had argued that it had the authority, pursuant to article five of the agreement, to exercise its managerial rights and block Reyes\u2019 transfer request.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">The arbitrator found that while Locas had obtained an ex parte restraining order against Reyes, no criminal charges had ever been filed against Reyes, the restraining order had lapsed through operation of law after ninety days, Locas had filed no complaints after Reyes allegedly had violated the terms of the restraining order, and Reyes never had been disciplined by the state as a result of the December, 1994 incident. Regarding the state\u2019s contention that it retained managerial authority to block Reyes\u2019 request, the arbitrator recounted the testimony of the defendant\u2019s president, Lieutenant Cathy Osten, who testified that article twenty contains no substantive limitations and that the state, in negotiations in the successor agreement, had proposed new language that would permit the state to refuse an officer the right to transfer if it could establish just cause disciplinary reasons for the denial. The arbitrator concluded: \u201c[A]s noted in the [agreement], [a]rticle [five] contains the predicate qualifier, \u2018Except as otherwise limited by an express provision of this [agreement, the [s]tate reserves and retains . . . .\u2019 The [agreement] limits the [state] in [its] ability to transfer personnel from one facility to another. There is an express provision in the contract that minimizes the management right prerogative. The employee has certain transfer rights which are protected by the language of [a]rticle [twenty] which cannot be abrogated by the [s]tate. While the actions taken by [the state] in remov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>ing Reyes from the transfer list may have been well intentioned and designed to protect the rights of . . . Locas, the [agreement] controls.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Regarding the state\u2019s argument that public policy justified its removal of Reyes from the transfer list, the arbitrator concluded that \u201c[w]hile the [s]tate argues that the issue before the arbitrator must be whether . . . [the state] acted in a reasonable and rational [manner] by removing Reyes from the transfer list, in its assertion [it is] in error. The primary criterion that the undersigned, as he is a creature of the [agreement], must consider is the [agreement]. Moreover, in support of [its] position, the [s]tate argued \u2018public policy\u2019 as the justification for denying the Reyes transfer. While this argument was well reasoned, it was based on standards not yet codified by courts of competent jurisdiction [that] have oversight in such matters such as these. As of this writing the \u2018Public Policy\u2019 theory is in its formative stages and [is] not yet widely accepted as grounds for overriding clear contractual language.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The arbitrator concluded further that \u201c[t]he [present] matter is one of first impression and involves a contractual interpretation within the fabric of conflicting employee rights. While [the state] is within [its] rights to examine each transfer application on a case-by-case basis, there is no record evidence of any workplace interactions between Reyes and Locas or proof that they were or are unable to work together. Additionally there is no record of any inappropriate post 1994 interactions between the two.\u201d In summary of his conclusion, the arbitrator stated: \u201c[t]he [agreement] contains no limitations of the type argued by the [s]tate. Reyes met all of the contractual requirements for the reassignment and absent a compelling reason why the transfer of an otherwise qualified [lieutenant should be denied, the [s]tate violated the [agreement] by unilaterally removing . . . Reyes from the voluntary transfer list.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>The arbitrator also concluded that any lack of explanation from Reyes regarding his reason for requesting a transfer did not impact his contractual rights. The arbitrator then sustained the defendant\u2019s grievance and ordered the state to transfer Reyes to Corrigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">On April 27, 2006, the state filed an application with the trial court to vacate the arbitration award. In its December 22, 2006 memorandum of decision following a hearing on the matter,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the trial court recognized that \u201c[t]here is a clear public policy against workplace violence and against an employer maintaining a hostile work environment. That policy was articulated by the chief executive constitutional officer of the state in an [executive [o]rder of the [g]ovemor [Executive Order No. Sixteen, \u201cViolence in the Workplace Prevention Policy\u201d (August 4, 1999) (executive order)]<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and a state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>statute prohibiting as a discriminatory practice conduct amounting to sexual harassment. [General Statutes \u00a7 46a-60].\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trial court concluded that the award implicated this policy, but did not violate it. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>court based its decision on the following facts found by the arbitrator. The alleged acts of violence that gave rise to the restraining order occurred more than one decade prior to Reyes\u2019 transfer request and did not occur in the workplace. The trial court also concluded that Locas feared not violence but supervisory retaliation and accommodation of Locas\u2019 fears could be \u201caddressed through less draconian management tools.\u201d The trial court stated that the arbitrator\u2019s findings of fact indicated that there was no evidence of workplace interaction between Locas and Reyes, no evidence of workplace violence suffered by Locas at the hands of Reyes, and no showing that the two correction officers could not work in the same facility. The trial court emphasized that the only evidence of violence had occurred in 1994, and had resulted in a restraining order that lasted ninety days and lapsed by operation of law. The trial court then summarized its conclusion by stating \u201c[i]n the case at bar, there may be a policy [against violence in the workplace] but there is no connection to that policy of the facts. It is the burden of the [state] to clearly demonstrate that the award violates the policy. Here, the award does not even remotely implicate the ambit of the policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">On January 10, 2007, the state filed a motion to reargue and/or for reconsideration of the December 22, 2006 judgment, and on April 2, 2007, the trial court issued an amended memorandum of decision in response to the state\u2019s motion. In its amended memorandum of decision, the trial court concluded that the state \u201chas not shown that Reyes\u2019 transfer would necessarily result in Reyes having direct authority over Locas; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>nor has it proved that Reyes\u2019 transfer would necessarily result in Reyes and Locas having any work-related contact. If Reyes was intent on harassing or harming Locas, he would not need to work in the same correctional facility to do so. Therefore, [the state] has not proved that [Reyes\u2019] motive for requesting a transfer is to harm or harass Locas.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">The state claims that the arbitration award should be vacated because it violates a clearly defined and dominant public policy. In the alternative, the state claims that the award should be vacated pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4) because the arbitrator exceeded his powers in manifest disregard of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">We first set forth the applicable standard of review. When the parties \u201cagree to arbitration and establish the authority of the arbitrator through the terms of their submission, the extent of our judicial review of the award is delineated by the scope of the parties\u2019 agreement.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>New England Health Care Employees Union, </em>271 Conn. 127, 134, 855 A.2d 964 (2004); see also <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>205 Conn. 178, 185, 530 A.2d 171 (1987). \u201cWhen the scope of the submission is unrestricted, the resulting award is not subject to de novo review even for errors of law so long as the award conforms to the submission.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>New England Health Care Employees Union, </em>supra, 134; see also <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>AFSCME, Council 15, Local 530, </em>208 Conn. 411, 415-16, 544 A.2d 186 (1988). \u201cBecause we favor arbitration as a means of settling private disputes, we undertake judicial review of arbitration awards in a manner designed to minimize interference with an efficient and economical system of alternative dispute resolution. . . . Furthermore, in applying this general rule of deference to an arbitrator\u2019s award, [e]very reasonable presumption and intendment will be made in favor of the [arbitral] award and of the arbitrators\u2019 acts and proceedings.\u201d (Citation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>New England Health Care Employees Union, </em>supra, 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">In this case, it is undisputed that the scope of the submission was unrestricted. Nevertheless, despite our general rule that deference is normally accorded to arbitral awards in cases where the scope of the submission is unrestricted, we have recognized three grounds for vacating an award. Courts will vacate an arbitral award when the award rules on the constitutionality of a statute;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> see <em>Caldor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em>191 Conn. 336, 344, 464 A.2d 785 (1983), aff'd, 472 U.S. 703, 105 S. Ct. 2914, 86 L. Ed. 2d 557 (1985); violates clear public policy; <em>Watertown Police Union Local 541 </em>v. <em>Watertown, </em>210 Conn. 333, 339, 555 A.2d 406 (1989); or contravenes one or more of the statutory proscriptions of \u00a7 52-418.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>189 Conn. 16, 22-23, 453 A.2d 1158 (1983). As we previously have noted, the state claims that the arbitration award violates either public policy or one or more of the statutory proscriptions of \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4). We will address in turn the state\u2019s claims, as well as the appropriate standards that govern these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">The state first claims that the arbitrator\u2019s award violates the clearly defined and dominant public policy against violence in the workplace. The state argues that a \u201c [s]tate employer is mandated by [the executive order] and ... \u00a7 46a-60 to ensure all employees in state government with a safe, secure workplace free from intimidation and harassment.\u201d The state argues further that it produced sufficient evidence to support its claim that the arbitration award violates this policy and, thus, that the trial court\u2019s denial of vacatur was improper. In addition to the public policy against violence in the workplace, which the state expressly argues is implicated by the arbitral award, the state\u2019s argument implicates a second public policy, particularly because of its reliance on \u00a7 46a-60, against sexual harassment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We conclude that the public policies against workplace violence and sexual harassment are clearly defined and dominant, for the purposes of vacating an arbitrator\u2019s award. Nevertheless-, because we also conclude that the arbitrator\u2019s award in this case does not violate either public policy, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">When \u201ca party challenges a consensual arbitral award on the ground that it violates public policy, and where that challenge has a legitimate, colorable basis, de novo review of the award is appropriate in order to determine whether the award does in fact violate public policy.\u201d <em>Schoonmaker </em>v. <em>Cummings &amp; Lockwood of Connecticut, P.C., </em>252 Conn. 416, 429, 747 A.2d 1017 (2000). Because the plaintiffs claim has a legitimate, colorable basis, de novo review of the award is appropriate in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">\u201cThe public policy exception applies only when the award is clearly illegal or clearly violative of a strong <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>public policy. ... A challenge that an award is in contravention of public policy is premised on the fact that the parties cannot expect an arbitration award approving conduct which is illegal or contrary to public policy to receive judicial endorsement any more than parties can expect a court to enforce such a contract between them. . . . When a challenge to the arbitrator\u2019s authority is made on public policy grounds, however, the court is not concerned with the correctness of the arbitrator\u2019s decision but with the lawfulness of enforcing the award. . . . Accordingly, the public policy exception to arbitral authority should be narrowly construed and [a] court\u2019s refusal to enforce an arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of [collective bargaining agreements] is limited to situations where the contract as interpreted would violate some explicit public policy that is well defined and dominant, and is to be ascertained by reference to the laws and legal precedents and not from general considerations of supposed public interests.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>New England Health Care Employees Union, </em>supra, 271 Conn. 135-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">A \u201ctwo-step analysis . . . [is] often employed [in] deciding cases such as this. First, the court determines whether an explicit, well-defined and dominant public policy can be identified. If so, the court then decides if the arbitrator\u2019s award violated the public policy.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>AFSCME, Council 4, Local 387, AFL-CIO, </em>252 Conn. 467, 476, 747 A.2d 480 (2000). We note that \u201c[t]he party challenging the award bears the burden of proving that illegality or conflict with public policy is clearly demonstrated. . . . Therefore, given the narrow scope of the public policy limitation on arbitral authority, the plaintiff can prevail . . . only if it demonstrates that the [arbitrators\u2019] award clearly violates an established public policy mandate. ... It bears emphasizing, moreover, that implicit in the stringent and narrow confines of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>exception to the rule of deference to arbitrators\u2019 determinations, is the notion that the exception must not be interpreted so broadly as to swallow the rule.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>New England Health Care Employees Union, </em>supra, 271 Conn. 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Addressing the first prong of this test, we note that we have never determined, in the context of vacating an arbitration award, that public policies against either violence in the workplace or sexual harassment are clearly defined and dominant in Connecticut law.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In cases in which we have decided whether a public policy exists for the purpose of vacating an arbitration award, we have looked to a variety of sources for clearly defined and dominant public policies. <em>Schoonmaker </em>v. <em>Cummings &amp; Lockwood of Connecticut, P.C., </em>supra, 252 Conn. 428. Indeed, we previously have concluded that criminal statutes; see <em>Groton </em>v. <em>United Steelworkers of America, </em>254 Conn. 35, 36-37, 48, 757 A.2d 501 (2000); noncriminal statutes; see <em>State </em>v. <em>New England Health Care Employees Union, </em>supra, 271 Conn. 138; city charters; see <em>Waterbury Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Furlong, </em>162 Conn. 390, 423, 294 A.2d 546 (1972); as well as the rules of professional conduct governing attorneys; see <em>Schoonmaker </em>v. <em>Cummings &amp; Lockwood of Connecticut, P.C., </em>supra, 435; are sources of clearly defined and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>dominant public policies.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201cRather than requiring that public policy be grounded on aparticular type of source, however, in determining whether a party has satisfied its burden of demonstrating the existence of a well-defined public policy, we have instead focused our inquiry on whether the alleged public policy is in fact clearly discernible in the purported source.\u201d <em>MedValUSA Health Programs, Inc. </em>v. <em>MemberWorks, </em>Inc., 273 Conn. 634, 657-58, 872 A.2d 423, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Vertrue, Inc. </em>v. <em>MedValUSA Health Programs, Inc., </em>546 U.S. 960, 126 S. Ct. 479, 163 L. Ed. 2d 363 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">\u201cThus, our case law establishes that, although we have been willing to find a public policy grounded in a variety of sources, the party seeking to establish the public policy bears a heavy burden of showing the existence of such a well-defined and dominant public policy. Indeed, we have in the past found a clear statement of that policy in some objectively stated form, such as a statute, city charter or rule of professional conduct. Although we do not decide that a statement in such a form is always required as the predicate for the public policy exception, we nonetheless adhere to the principle that the public policy must be explicit, well defined and dominant . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>In support of its position that the public policies against workplace violence and sexual harassment are clearly defined and dominant, the state asserts that the sources of these policies are the executive order<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and \u00a7 46a-60. See footnotes 8 and 9 of this opinion. In particular, the executive order explicitly states that \u201c[t]he [s]tate of Connecticut adopts a statewide zero tolerance policy for workplace violence.\u201d Moreover, two Connecticut statutes, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4a-2a and 4b-136 (c), specifically address aspects of workplace violence. Section 4a-2a<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> commands the commissioner of administrative services to provide a program to educate state employees about, among other things, workplace violence awareness, preparedness and prevention. Section 4b-136 (c)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> requires all state agencies to report all incidents of workplace violence and the resolution of these incidents. The executive order, coupled with the two statutes, indicates that the public policy against workplace violence is clearly defined and dominant. Similarly, the clear and unambiguous language of \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (8) (C) explicitly indicates that the maintenance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>a hostile work environment constitutes sexual harassment and is prohibited by the laws of this state. We conclude that the policies against workplace violence and sexual harassment are explicitly discemable from their respective sources, and, therefore, are clearly defined and dominant for the purposes of vacating an arbitral award.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">The second prong of the inquiry focuses on whether the state has satisfied its burden to demonstrate that the arbitrator\u2019s award violated either a public policy against violence in the workplace or a public policy against sexual harassment. Our analysis of this issue is confined to the facts as found by the arbitrator. <em>Schoonmaker v. Cummings &amp; Lockwood of Connecticut, P.C., </em>supra, 252 Conn. 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Turning to the arbitrator\u2019s award with respect to a policy against violence in the workplace, the arbitrator found that no criminal charges had been filed against Reyes as a result of Locas\u2019 application for a restraining order, no disciplinary action had been taken against Reyes by the department as a result of the issuance of the restraining order, and that the order had lapsed as a matter of law, after ninety days. Despite the allegations that Reyes had violated the terms of the restraining order, the arbitrator found that Locas had filed no complaints against Reyes. The arbitrator found no evidence of any workplace interactions between Reyes or Locas or any proof that they were or are unable to work together.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The arbitrator also found no record of any inappropriate post-1994 interaction between Reyes and Locas. Although we acknowledge that Locas\u2019 concerns <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>about Reyes may be legitimate, we agree with the trial court and conclude that the state did not meet its burden of demonstrating that the award violates a public policy against violence in the workplace because the sole incident of violence between the two is too attenuated in time from the transfer request.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Turning to the arbitrator\u2019s findings with respect to a public policy against sexual harassment, the arbitrator concluded that the state had not disciplined Reyes for his actions that led to the December, 1994 ex parte restraining order. As we previously have noted, there is no evidence of any negative workplace interaction between Reyes and Locas or proof that they were unable to work together. Indeed, the record indicates that Reyes qualified for transfer to any facility other than Corrigan. The sole reason for the denial of his transfer request to Corrigan was his history with Locas.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Although the state asserts that, in its opinion, the transfer of Reyes would create a hostile work environment, it cites to no evidence that Reyes previously committed any acts of sexual harassment at work. The state, therefore, cannot meet its burden of demonstrating that the award violates a public policy against sexual harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">We now turn to the state\u2019s second claim on appeal, that the arbitrator exceeded his power in manifest disregard of the law. Specifically, the state argues that because the arbitrator was aware of and ignored the public policy promoting a safe and secure workplace, the arbitrator improperly concluded that the only crite<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>rion relevant to the disposition of the submission was the agreement. The state asserts that the provisions of the agreement\u2014specifically the seniority provision found in article twenty\u2014should have been balanced with the overriding public policy safeguards, grounded in the executive order and \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (8), attached to every state workplace and on behalf of every state worker.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We conclude that the state has not met its significant burden to demonstrate that the arbitrator exercised his power in manifest disregard of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">In <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>McCaskey, </em>223 Conn. 1, 612 A.2d 742 (1992), we outlined the standard of review for claims that an arbitrator issued a decision in manifest disregard of the law. We stated that \u201can award that manifests an egregious or patently irrational application of the law is an award that should be set aside pursuant to \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4) because the arbitrator has exceeded [his] powers or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made. We emphasize, however, that the manifest disregard of the law ground for vacating an arbitration award is narrow and should be reserved for circumstances of an arbitrator\u2019s extraordinary lack of fidelity to established legal principles.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>We apply a test \u201cconsisting] of the following three elements, all of which must be satisfied in order for a court to vacate an arbitration award on the ground that the arbitration panel .manifestly disregarded the law: (1) the error was obvious and capable of being readily and instantly perceived by the average person qualified to serve as an arbitrator; (2) the arbitration panel appreciated the existence of a clearly governing legal principle but decided to ignore it; and (3) the governing law alleged to have been ignored by the arbitration panel is well defined, explicit, and clearly applicable.\u201d <em>Saturn Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Premier Roofing Co., </em>238 Conn. 293, 305, 680 A.2d 1274 (1996). \u201c[W]e do not review an arbitrator\u2019s decision merely for errors of law .... Even if the arbitrators were to have misapplied the law . . . such a misconstruction of the law would not demonstrate the arbitrators\u2019 egregious or patently irrational rejection of clearly controlling legal principles.\u201d <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>McCaskey, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 11-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">This standard of proof has rarely, if ever, been met in Connecticut. Indeed, we previously have stated: \u201c[t]he exceptionally high burden for proving a claim of manifest disregard of the law under \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4) is demonstrated by the fact that, since the test was first outlined in <em>Garrity, </em>this court has yet to conclude that an arbitrator manifestly disregarded the law.\u201d <em>Economos </em>v. <em>Liljedahl Bros., Inc., </em>279 Conn. 300, 307 n.8, 901 A.2d 1198 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">We begin our analysis by noting that the arbitrator\u2019s ruling properly conformed to the submission.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The arbitrator was asked if article twenty had been violated by the state\u2019s actions, and he concluded, despite the language of article five, that it had. The arbitrator stated that although the state\u2019s argument that these public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>policies justified the removal of Reyes from the transfer list was well reasoned, \u201cit was based on standards not yet codified by courts of competent jurisdiction [that] have oversight in matters such as these. As of this writing the \u2018Public Policy\u2019 theory is in its formative stages and [is] not yet widely accepted as grounds for overriding clear contractual language.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">It is unclear whether the arbitrator, in this conclusion, refers to the specific public policies against violence in the workplace and sexual harassment or if he refers to the general public policy exception. On the one hand, if the arbitrator was referring to the specific policies against workplace violence and sexual harassment, whether the arbitrator\u2019s conclusion constitutes manifest disregard of the law depends on whether these policies were clearly applicable and ignored. On the other hand, if the arbitrator was referring to the public policy theory in general, his conclusion is improper because, as we previously have concluded, violation of public policy is a clearly defined ground on which an unrestricted arbitral award may be vacated. In either case, our inquiry would remain the same, however, because we would have to determine whether the general public policy exception was clearly applicable and ignored. Under either reading of the arbitrator\u2019s decision, it is clear that the arbitrator did not ignore clearly applicable law. Rather, at best for the state, he misapplied our law governing the vacating of arbitral awards on public policy grounds. The arbitrator considered the state\u2019s public policy arguments and decided that the clear contractual language was not contravened by any public policy. We note that, even if the arbitrator\u2019s decision constitutes a misapplication of the relevant law, we \u201care not at liberty to set aside an [arbitrator\u2019s] award because of an arguable difference regarding the meaning or <em>applicability </em>of laws\u201d; (emphasis added) <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>McCaskey, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 9; and such a miscon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>struction of the law does not demonstrate the arbitrator\u2019s \u201cegregious or patently irrational rejection of clearly controlling legal principles.\u201d Id., 11-12.
