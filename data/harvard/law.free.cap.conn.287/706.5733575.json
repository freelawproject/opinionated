In their appeal, the defendants claim that the trial court improperly determined that General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 20-312 (b)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 20-325a (a) through (d), as amended by Public Acts 2000, No. 00-160, \u00a7 2 (P.A. 00-160),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which dictate the conditions under which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>real estate commissions may be recovered, do not bar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>the plaintiff from seeking recovery of the commissions under the common law. In its cross appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly determined that the defendants were not liable for the full amount of the commission owed under a listing agreement between the plaintiff and another real estate developer and prior party to the action, Anthony Fonda. See footnote 1 of this opinion. We agree with the defendants and, accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The trial court reasonably found the following facts. At all times pertinent to this appeal, the plaintiff possessed a real estate broker\u2019s license. The plaintiffs president, Michael O\u2019Brien, was licensed only as a real estate salesperson.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In 1999, Fonda entered into option agreements with the owner of commercial property on Washington Street in North Haven for the possible purchase and development of that property. The plaintiff was the real estate broker for the owner of the property at issue. The plaintiff and Fonda subsequently entered into a listing agreement for a one year term, from June 1, 2000, to June 30, 2001, under which the plaintiff would receive commissions for obtaining tenants for the property. The plaintiff thereafter negotiated lease agreements with two tenants, CVS pharmacy (CVS) and Liberty Bank, during which negotiations Fonda also was represented by his attorney, Peter Alter. Fonda signed the lease with CVS, which set forth a specific date by which he would purchase the property, but he never signed the lease with Liberty Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Fonda subsequently decided not to pursue the project. In or about December, 2000, the defendants dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>cussed with Fonda their taking over development of the property. The defendants paid Fonda approximately $120,000 for costs he had expended on the preliminary development of the project, such as engineering fees, but did not execute any written agreement with him with respect to any obligations related to the property. By this time, Fonda\u2019s options to purchase the property had expired. The defendants entered into a purchase and sale agreement with the owner of the property, for which the plaintiff received a commission. By then, the acquisition date set forth in the CVS lease for Fonda to purchase the property also had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">At about the same time that the defendants purchased the property, the plaintiff wrote to Fonda and Alter, stating that it would \u201crequire written acknowledgement that the lease commissions will be paid as called for in the exclusive listing agreement.\u201d The plaintiff never received any response to, nor followed up on, this correspondence. At a meeting in Colaccino\u2019s office in January, 2001, however, O\u2019Brien and Colaccino orally agreed that Colaccino would pay him the commissions on the leases,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but O\u2019Brien did not thereafter memorialize that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>agreement in a confirmation letter to Colaccino because he felt it was unnecessary to do so in light of the plaintiffs listing agreement with Fonda.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In February, 2001, the defendants executed leases with CVS and Liberty Bank that were substantially the same as those that the plaintiff had negotiated for Fonda and that listed the plaintiff and O\u2019Brien as the broker.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After the defendants acquired the property and executed the leases, the plaintiff wrote to the defendants to demand its commissions. The defendants informed the plaintiff that there had been no agreement between them and refused to pay these commissions. This action followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The record also reflects the following procedural history. On or about March 26, 2003, the plaintiff filed a five count amended complaint against Fonda and the defendants, alleging breach of the listing agreement, unjust enrichment and a violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq. In response, the defendants raised nine special defenses alleging, inter alia, that the commission was barred because the plaintiffs president, O\u2019Brien, was not a licensed real estate broker in accordance with the requirements of \u00a7 20-312 (b), and because there was no writing between the plaintiff and the defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>in accordance with the requirements of \u00a7 20-325a (b).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thereafter, the trial court, <em>Miller, J., </em>granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the CUTPA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">After a bench trial, the court, <em>Stengel, J., </em>rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff only as to the count alleging unjust enrichment. As to the plaintiffs counts seeking recovery under the listing agreement between Fonda and the plaintiff, the court concluded that this agreement met the statutory requirements of \u00a7 20-325a (b) and (c), but the plaintiff had failed to prove that there was a valid assignment of Fonda\u2019s obligations under the listing agreement to the defendants. Thus, the plaintiff could not recover any commissions owed to it under that agreement. The court also rejected the plaintiffs claim that the defendants were equitably estopped from contesting their obligation to pay the commissions because it concluded that the plaintiff had not pointed to any conduct by the defendants in regard to the listing agreement that the plaintiff had relied upon to its detriment. The trial court concluded, however, that the plaintiff could recover under a theory of unjust enrichment: \u201c[The] [p]laintiff has established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>that [the defendants] had received a benefit, that [they] knowingly accepted, at the expense of [the] plaintiff under circumstances that would make it unjust for [the defendants] to retain the benefit. The court finds that it would be inequitable to deny the plaintiff the right to recover commissions that it otherwise earned.\u201d The trial court rejected the defendants\u2019 contention that, under this court\u2019s holding in <em>Location Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>General Financial Services, Inc., </em>273 Conn. 766, 780-81, 873 A.2d 163 (2005), the balancing of equities required under \u00a7 20-325a weighed against permitting any recovery because O\u2019Brien had not been licensed as a real estate broker. The court found that there was no evidence that O\u2019Brien wilfully had violated the statutory licensure requirement. The trial court did not consider expressly, however, whether \u00a7 20-235a otherwise precluded the plaintiff from recovering under the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Lastly, the trial court turned to the question of damages. The court determined that the plaintiff was not entitled to the approximately $145,000 in commissions that it would have been owed under the terms of the listing agreement, but, instead, was entitled to $125,000 because O\u2019Brien and Colaccino had discussed that lower commission at their January, 2001 meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Thereafter, the trial court denied the defendants\u2019 request for an articulation of the basis of various factual findings in its memorandum of decision. The defendants appealed, and the plaintiff cross appealed, from the trial court\u2019s judgment to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeals to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>In their appeal, the defendants contend that the trial court improperly permitted the plaintiff to recover a commission under the common-law theory of unjust enrichment despite the court\u2019s determination that there had been no substantial compliance with the requirements of \u00a7 20-325a. Specifically, the defendants contend that they were not a party to any written agreement satisfying the requirements of the statute and that the plaintiff was not a duly licensed real estate broker because its president did not possess a real estate broker\u2019s license at the time of the transaction. The defendants further claim that the trial court either applied the wrong standard to, or failed to rule on, other special defenses. The plaintiff responds that the listing agreement between it and Fonda and subsequent correspondence, documents and oral exchanges acknowledging that the defendants were taking over the project amount to substantial compliance with either \u00a7 20-325a (b) or (c), which, coupled with the trial court\u2019s finding that it would be inequitable to deny the plaintiff a commission, permit recovery under that statute. Specifically, the plaintiff points to various paragraphs in the leases executed by the defendants with CVS and Liberty Bank that reference the plaintiff as the broker and the lessors\u2019 obligation to pay a commission pursuant to a letter agreement, as well as a reference to brokerage commissions in the \u201cbudget review\u201d that the defendants submitted to People\u2019s Bank in connection with financing it sought for the project to the People\u2019s Bank. In its cross appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly failed to award $145,712.50, the full amount of damages owed according to the terms of the listing agreement between the plaintiff and Fonda. We agree with the defendants\u2019 principal claim and therefore do not reach the remaining issues raised by either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>Because the defendants\u2019 claim is premised on the view that no recovery may be had unless there is substantial compliance with \u00a7 20-325a, we first must consider to what extent the plaintiff satisfied the requirements of that statute. If we conclude that it did not meet those requirements, we then must turn to the question of whether equitable recovery nonetheless is permitted under the theory of unjust enrichment. To the extent that we are required to review conclusions of law or the interpretation of the relevant statute by the trial court, we engage in plenary review. <em>State </em>v. <em>Winer, </em>286 Conn. 666, 676, 945 A.2d 430 (2008). We review the court\u2019s factual findings, however, under a clearly erroneous standard. <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>284 Conn. 502, 511, 935 A.2d 126 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">To determine whether recovery is permitted under \u00a7 20-325a, we first note that the applicable version of the statute is the one in effect at the time of the transaction at issue from December, 2000 to early 2001.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>M.R. Wachob Co. v. MBM Partnership, </em>232 Conn. 645, 658-59, 656 A.2d 1036 (1995) (applying version of statute in effect at time of events forming basis for action). For purposes of the present case, there was an amendment to the statute effective October 1, 2000; see P.A. 00-160; which, we note, has particular significance to this case. Thus, the relevant version of the statute is General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 20-325a, as amended by P.A. 00-160.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>We begin with the pertinent text of \u00a7 20-325a, setting forth the requirements for the recovery of commissions in real estate transactions. Subsection (a) of that statute addresses persons \u201cnot licensed under the provisions of this chapter\u201d and provides that such persons may not \u201crecover any commission, compensation or other payment with respect to any act done or service rendered by the person, the doing or rendering of which is prohibited under the provisions of this chapter except by persons duly licensed under this chapter,\u201d while subsection (b) addresses persons \u201clicensed under the provisions of this chapter\u201d and prohibits such person from bringing any action with respect to services rendered, unless those services were performed \u201cpursuant to a contract or authorization from the person for whom the acts were done or services rendered.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 20-325a (a) and (b), as amended by P.A. 00-160. Subsection (b) then sets forth seven specific requirements for any agreement for a real estate commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Subsections (c) and (d) of \u00a7 20-325a, however, create some exceptions to the foregoing requirements. Subsection (c) provides that, \u201cin a commercial real estate transaction,\u201d a \u201cperson licensed under the provisions of this chapter\u201d may not commence an action related to \u201cacts done or services rendered after October 1, 2000\u201d unless there is a writing \u201cmeeting the requirements of subsection (b)\u201d <em>or </em>\u201ca memorandum, letter or cither writing stating for whom the licensee will act or has acted, signed by the party for whom the licensee will act or has acted in the commercial real estate transaction, the duration of the authorization and the amount of any compensation payable to the licensee . . . .\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 20-325a (c), as amended by P.A. 00-160. Thus, there is a more flexible standard for a writing in commercial real estate transactions than that which applies to noncommercial transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>Most significant for purposes of the present case, subsection (d) provides: \u201cNothing in subsection (a) of this section, subdivisions (2) to (7), inclusive, of subsection (b) of this section or subsection (c) of this section shall prevent any licensee from recovering any commission, compensation or other payment with respect to any acts done or services rendered, <em>if it would be inequitable to deny such recovery and the licensee (1) has substantially complied with subdivisions (2) to (7), inclusive, of subsection (b) of this section or (2) with respect to a commercial real estate transaction, has substantially complied with subdivisions (2) to (6), inclusive, of subsection (b) of this section or subdivision (2) of subsection (c) of this </em>section.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 20-325a (d), as amended by P.A. 00-160. Therefore, subsection (d) provides that, when, as in the present case, there is no strict compliance with the requirements of subsections (a), (b) and (c), an action for a real estate commission under \u00a7 20-325anonethelessmayproceed if two preconditions are met: (1) there has been substantial compliance with the requirements relevant to the transaction; and (2) the facts and circumstances of a case would make it inequitable to deny recovery.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As both parties agree that there has not been strict compliance, we examine whether both preconditions to the exception have been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">As an initial matter, we note that the parties have devoted much attention in their briefs to the issue of how significant a factor it should be that, because O\u2019Brien was not a licensed broker when acting on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>plaintiffs behalf as required under \u00a7 20-312 (b), the plaintiff was not duly licensed at the time of the transaction at issue.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>Location Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>General Financial Services, Inc., </em>supra, 273 Conn. 777.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We previously have concluded, in another case involving this same plaintiff, that \u201ca corporate broker licensee, whose president was not licensed as a broker, may not be denied its right to recover a commission otherwise earned <em>solely </em>because of that licensing failure. Its right to recover must be gauged, instead, under all of the facts and circumstances of the case and whether it would be inequitable, in light of those facts and circumstances, to deny it the right to recover. One of those facts and circumstances is, of course, that the licensee may not have been duly licensed; but that fact alone is not sufficient to deny recovery.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>Id., 781. Thus, while O\u2019Brien\u2019s license status would be relevant for purposes of balancing the equities, we need not determine, when reviewing the trial court\u2019s conclusions in this regard, how significant it is that the plaintiff was not duly licensed under \u00a7 20-325a (a), because we conclude that the plaintiff did not substantially comply with any of the requirements of the other subsections.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Because the present case involves a commercial real estate transaction, under \u00a7 20-325a (c), the plaintiff must substantially comply with the requirements of either subsection (b) or subsection (c) (2). According to the facts that the trial court found, the plaintiff has complied with <em>none </em>of those requirements. There is no writing between the broker and the person receiving the services, with the relevant dates, with the terms of authorization, signed by both the broker and the person receiving the services, or containing the requisite disclaimer regarding lien rights. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 20-325a (b) (2) through (7), as amended by P.A. 00-160. Nor, was there any compliance with the more flexible criteria for a writing under subsection (c) (2), which merely requires a \u201cmemorandum, letter or other writing stating <em>for whom the licensee will act or has acted, </em>signed by the party for whom the licensee will act or has acted in the commercial real estate transaction, the duration of the authorization and the amount of any compensation . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 20-325a (c) (2), as amended by P.A. 00-160. In other words, with no writing between the defendants and the plaintiff whatsoever, the plaintiff has failed to comply with both subsection (b) and subsection (c) (2) of \u00a7 20-325a. Accordingly, we agree with the defendants\u2019 contention that, \u201c[b]ased upon the trial court\u2019s own factual findings there could be no compliance\u2014let alone\u2014\u2018substantial compliance\u2019 with [\u00a7 20-325a (b) and (c) (2)].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>The plaintiffs contention that there was an oral assignment to the defendants of rights under the listing agreement between the plaintiff and Fonda is of no avail.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Although subsection (d) permits recovery under an agreement that substantially complies with the various requirements of \u00a7 20-325a, the statute clearly contemplates <em>written </em>agreements only. Section 20-325a, unlike the statute of frauds, General Statutes \u00a7 52-550, contains no exception for oral agreements. Indeed, this court has recognized that listing agreements \u201care governed exclusively by \u00a7 20-325a [and] such contracts do not fall within our statute of frauds.\u201d <em>William Pitt, Inc. </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>186 Conn. 82, 84, 438 A.2d 1206 (1982). Thus, even if the agreement at issue were to fall within an exception to the statute of frauds for parole agreements, the plaintiff still would be required to satisfy \u00a7 20-325a to bring this action. Because the plaintiff cannot meet the first of two requirements for recovery under subsection (d)\u2014i.e., substantial compliance\u2014the trial court properly concluded that it could not recover pursuant to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Having concluded that the plaintiff may not seek to recover pursuant to \u00a7 20-325a, we next determine whether the trial court properly concluded that the equitable remedy of unjust enrichment is available. See <em>Vertex, Inc. </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>278 Conn. 557, 573, 898 A.2d 178 (2006) (\u201c[ujnjust enrichment applies wherever justice requires compensation to be given for property or services rendered under a contract, and no remedy is available by an action on the contract\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). The plaintiff contends that an equitable remedy exists under \u00a7 20-325a. We note that the statute neither expressly embraces that remedy nor expressly disclaims it. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 20-325a (d), as amended by P.A. 00-160. Thus, we must determine whether the legislature intended to preserve the common-law equitable remedy of unjust enrichment when it enacted the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">\u201cWhen construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. ... In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>governing the same general subject matter . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>C. R. Klewin Northeast, LLC </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>284 Conn. 250, 261, 932 A.2d 1053 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Moreover, we are mindful of other rules of statutory construction applicable when determining whether a statute has abrogated the common law. \u201c[W]hen a statute is in derogation of common law ... it should receive a strict construction and is not to be extended, modified, repealed or enlarged in its scope by the mechanics of [statutory] construction. ... In determining whether or not a statute abrogates or modifies a common law rule the construction must be strict, and the operation of a statute in derogation of the common law is to be limited to matters clearly brought within its scope. . . . Although the legislature may eliminate a common law right by statute, the presumption that the legislature does not have such a purpose can be overcome only if the legislative intent is clearly and plainly expressed. . . . The rule that statutes in derogation of the common law are strictly construed can be seen to serve the same policy of continuity and stability in the legal system as the doctrine of stare decisis in relation to case law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Viera </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>283 Conn. 412, 426-27, 927 A.2d 843 (2007). Our review on this issue is plenary. <em>State </em>v. <em>Winer, </em>supra, 286 Conn. 676.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">We begin with the text of \u00a7 20-325a.

In carving out this excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>tion, the legislature clearly intended that the statutory requirements had to be met to <em>some </em>extent, which, as we concluded in part I of this opinion, did not occur in the present case. By further providing, however, that the licensee must satisfy the type of equitable considerations necessary for recovery under a theory of unjust enrichment; see <em>Cecio Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>Greenwich, </em>156 Conn. 561, 569, 244 A.2d 404 (1968); the legislature has, by necessary implication, eliminated the option of a separate equitable recovery under that theory absent substantial compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">To construe the statute otherwise to permit a separate action in equity under any circumstance would allow a broker to circumvent \u00a7 20-325a (a) through (c) altogether and thus recover the alleged commission with or without complying with licensure requirements and with or without executing some type of writing. It is axiomatic that we do not interpret a statute in a way that would so blatantly thwart its purpose. <em>In re William D., </em>284 Conn. 305, 317, 933 A.2d 1147 (2007). As we have noted in other contexts, common-law remedies are not appropriate where their application would eviscerate the force of the provisions of the statute. See, e.g., <em>Sanzone </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>219 Conn. 179, 191, 592 A.2d 912 (1991) (declining to permit common-law tort remedy that would effectively render null and void statute providing damages for injury caused by defect in road or bridge and thwart its purpose despite rule of strict construction); <em>Barrett Builders </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra, 215 Conn. 322-28 (declining to permit contractor who had failed to comply with Home Improvement Act\u2019s written contract requirement to recover in quasi contract because to do so would be to create exception to writing requirement and would do damage to public policy embodied in statute of protecting consumers).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>While our examination of the text strongly supports the proposition that the legislature evinced an intent to incorporate a common-law equitable remedy into the statute, the text by no means expressly and unambiguously indicates that the statute precludes separate equitable remedies in derogation of the common law. We, therefore, turn to its legislative history for clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Although we have discussed the pertinent sections of the operative statute previously herein, we consider the following historical background. Section 20-325a originally was enacted in 1971, and that simpler revision of the statute included a section prohibiting those not duly licensed from recovering a commission and a section setting forth five requirements for a written agreement between a licensee and an individual or entity receiving real estate brokerage services. Public Acts 1971, No. 378, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thereafter, the legislature made various changes to the requirements in what is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>now subsection (b). See, e.g., Public Acts 1984, No. 84-137, \u00a7 1 (permitting parties to listing agreement or their duly authorized agents to sign agreement); Public Acts 1993, No. 93-355, \u00a7 1 (adding notification provision concerning real estate broker\u2019s liens to writing requirements in subsection [b] and seven other new subsections).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The most significant change for purposes of the present case occurred in 1994, when the legislature added what is now subsection (d), the exception permitting recovery for those persons who substantially had complied with the requirements of the statute provided that the equities balanced in their favor. Public Acts 1994, No. 94-240, \u00a7 3. The legislative history of that provision specifically indicates that the real estate industry brought concerns about unjust enrichment to the legislature\u2019s attention. As a representative of the Connecticut real estate commission stated in a committee hearing with regard to that amendment: \u201c[T]he proposed changes expand [\u00a7] 20-325[a] so that if a broker in a real estate transaction has substantially complied with the provisions of this . . . section, the broker will be permitted to pursue their claims for payment of the [licensee\u2019s] fees in our court system. Right now, under [\u00a7] 20-325[a], if as much as a date the listing contract or authorization to ask for another is deleted from that listing agreement . . . [the licensee is barred] from going to court to seek payment of the commission and often this has resulted in unjust enrichment to various sellers of properties.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Insurance and Real Estate, Pt. 1, 1994 Sess., p. 91, remarks of Larry Hannafin.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">We made, and relied on, the same observation in <em>Location Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>General Financial Services, Inc., </em>supra, 273 Conn. 780-81, when we specifically examined the legislative history of the 1994 amendment. We stated: \u201cThe legislative history [of now \u00a7 20-325a (d)] indicates that the proposal was brought forth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>response to certain decisions of this court that strictly construed the requirements of \u00a7 20-325a (b), namely, the formal requirements of a listing agreement, and denied brokers the right to recover for failures of strict compliance therewith. See, e.g., <em>M.R. Wachob Co. </em>v. <em>MBM Partnership, </em>[supra, 232 Conn. 658-62]; Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, supra, p. 91. That history indicates that the task force that drafted the legislation considered that the strict construction of subsection (b) of \u00a7 20-325a <em>had resulted in some cases of \u2018unjust enrichment. </em>\u2019 Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, supra, p. 91. This history, in turn, also suggests that the question of recovery, despite a failure to comply strictly with subsection (a) of \u00a7 20-325a, must be determined on the basis of all of the facts and circumstances of the case. See, e.g., <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>Danforth, </em>222 Conn. 150, 158, 609 A.2d 654 (1992) (\u2018[u]njust enrichment requires a factual examination of the circumstances and of the conduct of the parties\u2019 . . . ).\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Location Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>General Financial Services, Inc., </em>supra, 780-81. Thus, subsection (d) was enacted, at least in part, to deal with the precise equitable concerns at issue in claims of unjust enrichment. Put differently, by addressing the unjust enrichment problems with a statutory remedy, conditioned on substantial compliance, we conclude that the legislature declined to leave intact a common-law remedy to parties in these circumstances. We therefore conclude that substantial compliance is the sole avenue to recovery that the legislature chose to provide in circumstances wherein the strict construction of \u00a7 20-325a would lead to unfair results or unjust enrichment.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that it was improper for the trial court to award a commission to the plaintiff on a theory of unjust enrichment. Because we reverse the judgment on these grounds, we do not reach the defendants\u2019 remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b731-6\"> The plaintiff also had named as defendants Anthony Fonda and AFAR, LLC, the parties with whom the plaintiff originally had entered into a real estate brokerage contract for the property at issue in this appeal, but the trial court rejected the plaintiffs claim for damages against them.

We concluded, however, that both the text and the legislative history of subsection (d), which at the relevant time in that case was codified as subsection (c), indicated that such an entity still might recover depending on a review of the \u201cfacts and circumstances of the case.\u201d Id., 779-80. We concluded, therefore, that the plaintiff could not be denied recovery \u201csolely because of [its] licensing failure.\u201d Id., 781. Instead, a determination must be made under all of the facts and circumstances in a given case whether it would be inequitable to deny recovery. Id.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b744-5\"> The plaintiffs argument that the listing agreement applies to the defendants because it contains a term stating that it is binding on \u201cassigns\u201d must fail because there is no modification or other agreement specifically designating the defendants as \u201cassigns.\u201d Indeed, the modification clause of the listing agreement expressly requires that any such assignment would had to have been in writing: \u201cThis [ajgreement. . . may be modified, waived or discharged only by an agreement in writing signed by both parties.\u201d There was no written agreement between Fonda and the defendants or between the plaintiff and the defendants according to which the defendants agreed to assume Fonda\u2019s duties under the listing agreement. Thus, even if we were to assume that the obligations under the listing agreement, which one could argue related to different leases than those ultimately executed, were assignable, we have no written instrument that describes the assignee and \u201csubject matter of the assignment. . . with such particularity as to render it capable of identification.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dysart Corp. </em>v. <em>Seaboard Surety Co., </em>240 Conn. 10, 17, 688 A.2d 306 (1997) (plaintiff was not assignee of right to sue on labor and material payment bond according to General Statutes \u00a7 4942 by virtue of employees endorsing their paychecks to plaintiff because mere endorsement did not describe subject matter with sufficient particularity so as to render it identifiable).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b748-7\"> We acknowledge that the legislature may have added what is now subsection (d) to provide a statutory equitable remedy in response to this court\u2019s conclusion in <em>William Pitt, Inc. </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>supra, 186 Conn. 84, that \u00a7 20-325a is the exclusive remedy for listing contracts and the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion that common-law equitable remedies are precluded by the statute. Because none of those cases performed a full statutory analysis, however, we do not rest our decision today on this basis. Rather, in light of the analysis of subsection (d) that we began in <em>Location Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>General Financial Services, Inc., </em>supra, 273 Conn. 771-81, we proceed to examine that subsection and its implications for the issue in the present case more closely.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b750-6\"> Our review of the legislative history of these provisions has revealed nothing to indicate that the legislature intended to preserve common-law equitable remedies with its enactment of \u00a7 20-325a and subsequent amendments thereto. The legislative history to the 1971 Public Act reflects that the statute was meant to ensure that \u201cno commission\u2019s fees or renumeration may [be] recovered in a court of law for real estate transaction unless the full terms of an agreement are signed by both parties .... These terms would be in writing with [the] names and addresses of all parties . . . .\u201d 14 H.R. Proc., Pt. 6, 1971 Sess., p. 2783, remarks of Representative Albert S. Crockett. As one legislator noted: \u201cThe [c]ourts are quite often filled with cases concerning disputes over real estate commissions and conditions under which the brokers were engaged to perform. This law spells it out and really clarifies a great number of problems.\u201d 14 S. Proc., Pt. 5, 1971 Sess., p. 2316, remarks of Senator William J. Sullivan. During committee hearings on the bill that later became No. 378 of the 1971 Public Acts, David Kotkin, who represented the Connecticut Association of Real Estate Boards, confirmed this problem when he stated that, whether the requirements were different for commercial real estate transactions and those involving homeowners, there should be \u201cat least something in writing to indicate that the owner of the property did consent to the property being listed.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Insurance and Real Estate, 1971 Sess., p. 230. Thus, at a minimum, the legislature intended that these transactions had to be memorialized in a writing in compliance with the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
