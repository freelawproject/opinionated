The plaintiff, Meredith Finan, appeals, following our grant of certification,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the judgment of the Appellate Court reversing in part the financial orders of the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>disposing of the marital residence and ordering the defendant, John Finan, to pay her unallocated alimony and child support of $95,000 annually based on his salary of $225,000. <em>Finan </em>v. <em>Finan, </em>100 Conn. App. 297, 299, 918 A.2d 910 (2007). The plaintiff claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the record was inadequate for review of her dissipation claim, and further asks this court, in the interest of judicial economy, to determine whether trial courts should consider both preseparation and postseparation dissipation of marital assets when fashioning financial orders. We conclude that the record is adequate for review of the plaintiffs claim and that a trial court should consider preseparation dissipation of marital assets, so long as the actions constituting dissipation occur either: (1) in contemplation of divorce or separation; or (2) while the marriage is in serious jeopardy or is undergoing an irretrievable breakdown. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The Appellate Court decision sets forth the following facts and procedural history. \u201cThe parties married on September 11, 1982, and, at the time of the trial, had three children, of which two were minors. The court rendered judgment dissolving the marriage on March 11, 2005. The court found that the marriage had broken down irretrievably without attributing fault to either party as to the cause of the breakdown.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">\u201cThe court entered orders regarding property distribution, alimony, child support and other miscellaneous matters. As part of the dissolution decree, the court ordered the defendant to pay to the plaintiff \u2018unallocated alimony and child support in equal semimonthly installments on the first and fifteenth of each month, the annual sum of $95,000 based on his base salary of $225,000.\u2019 \u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>The plaintiff appealed the trial court\u2019s judgment to the Appellate Court, claiming, inter alia, that the trial court \u201cimproperly refused to admit into evidence a report detailing the defendant\u2019s preseparation dissipation of marital assets . . . [and] that the court failed to consider evidence that the defendant dissipated marital assets by spending large sums of money prior to the parties\u2019 separation.\u201d Id., 308. Specifically, at trial, the report was initially admitted into evidence over the defendant\u2019s objection, but subsequently was stricken, redacted and then readmitted after the defendant renewed his objection. Id. The Appellate Court declined to review the plaintiffs claim pertaining to this ruling, however, concluding that the record was inadequate for review because the plaintiff had failed to have the first report admitted as an exhibit or marked for identification. Id., 308-309. This certified appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">We begin with the certified issue in this appeal, namely, the plaintiffs claim that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the record is inadequate to review her dissipation claims. Specifically, the plaintiff claims that there was no need for her to mark for identification exhibit G, the initial financial report summarizing activity in the parties\u2019 joint bank accounts, because it already had been admitted into evidence at trial and subsequently was replaced in the record with another report, exhibit L, which was limited to only postseparation expenditures. The plaintiff contends that the second report, exhibit L, \u201cwas entered as a wholly different exhibit . . . and not as a substitute for the original report. Thus, there can be no dispute that both exhibits were made a part of the trial court record.\u201d In addition, the plaintiff proffered copies of both exhibits in the appendix to her brief for Appellate Court review. The plaintiff further emphasizes that \u201cthe basis of the trial court\u2019s ruling is obvious and fully contained in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>record\u2014the trial court ruled that it would consider only postseparation spending by [the defendant].\u201d In response, the defendant relies on <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>188 Conn. 736, 453 A.2d 1151 (1982), and argues that the plaintiff failed to provide the court with an adequate record for review by not marking the stricken document for identification. We agree with the plaintiff, and conclude that the record in this case is adequate for appellate review of her claim, namely, that the trial court improperly refused to admit evidence of potential marital asset dissipation that occurred prior to the separation of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">\u201cThe duty to provide this court with a record adequate for review rests with the appellant. ... It is the responsibility of the appellant to provide an adequate record for review as provided in [Practice Book \u00a7] 61-10. . . . The appellant shall determine whether the entire trial court record is complete, correct and otherwise perfected for presentation on appeal. . . . Conclusions of the trial court cannot be reviewed where the appellant fails to establish through an adequate record that the trial court incorrectly applied the law or could not reasonably have concluded as it did .... The purpose of marking an exhibit for identification is to preserve it as part of the record and to provide an appellate court with a basis for review.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Daigle </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Casualty Ins. Co., </em>257 Conn. 359, 364, 777 A.2d 681 (2001); id., 363 (record inadequate for review because \u201cplaintiff did not enter into the record for identification purposes the income tax returns that he had intended to offer as proof\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Notwithstanding this general rule, evidentiary claims have been reviewed on appeal, even when the excluded exhibit was not marked for identification, if the record reveals an adequate substitute for that exhibit. See <em>Cousins </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>87 Conn.

App. 447, 456, 505 A.2d 1255 (case was \u201cone of those rare instances in which the record provides an adequate substitute for the proffered but unmarked items . . . [because] [t]he material in question is a disassembled automobile . . . [and] the defendant had admitted as full exhibits forty photographs of the automobile, some of which depict the parts detached from the body before reconstructive work, some showing the parts after work had been done, and others showing the body of the car with and without various parts . . . [and] the testimony of the witnesses extensively describes the parts depicted in the photographs and the details of the work that had been done on various parts\u201d), cert. denied, 200 Conn. 802, 509 A.2d 516 (1986); <em>Plawecki </em>v. <em>Angelo Tomasso, Inc., </em>1 Conn.

Moreover, the basis of the trial court\u2019s ruling is abundantly clear from a review of the transcripts. During the testimony of Karlene Mitchell\u2014a divorce financial examiner who had created exhibit G, the compilation at issue that summarized the parties\u2019joint bank accounts from January, 1999, through November, 2004\u2014the trial court ruled that \u201cwhat I need basically is, from the point of separation to the present time, which is contained in this compilation.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Indeed, the trial court clearly rejected the plaintiffs attempt to ask it \u201cto consider the propriety of your getting all of the information from December, 1999.\u201d After further testimony by Mitchell, the plaintiff then agreed to redact the portion of the compilation that preceded the parties\u2019 separation. When Mitchell returned to court the following day, she brought the redacted compilation with her, which was admitted as exhibit L in place of exhibit G, which had been stricken from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">We conclude that the Appellate Court improperly declined to review the plaintiffs claim in this appeal on the basis of her failure to mark the report, exhibit G, for identification.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The state of the record in this case provides a more than ample basis for understanding and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>reviewing the trial court\u2019s ruling,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> namely, that it would not consider claims of improper spending that occurred prior to the parties\u2019 separation.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Although outside the scope of the certified question in this appeal, the plaintiff requests that this court review, in the interest of judicial economy, her claim that the trial court improperly refused to consider the defendant\u2019s dissipation of marital assets prior to their separation. \u201cBecause both parties have briefed the issue and it was addressed at oral argument before this court,\u201d we will review the issue in the interest of judicial <em>economy.Montoya v. Montoya, </em>280 Conn. 605, 617 n.11, 909 A.2d 947 (2006). The plaintiff claims that the trial court was required, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81 (c),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to consider both preseparation and postseparation behavior in determining the amount of marital property to be assigned to each respective party. The plaintiff further asserts, citing <em>Bender </em>v. <em>Bender, </em>258 Conn. 733, 742, 785 A.2d 197 (2001), that \u00a7 46b-81 \u201cdoes not limit, either by timing or method of acquisition or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>by source of funds, the property subject to a trial court\u2019s broad allocative power.\u201d The plaintiff also claims that several decisions of both this court and the Appellate Court support the proposition that dissipation may occur at any time, and that those decisions, therefore, support her contention that a trial court should consider both preseparation and postseparation dissipation when distributing marital assets. In response, the defendant \u201cdoes not contest that evidence of preseparation expenditures can be considered relevant.\u201d Instead, the defendant claims that the trial court\u2019s temporal limitation of exhibit G, whereby all preseparation expenditures were redacted, was harmless, because the plaintiff has failed to show that the trial court\u2019s distribution would have been different in the absence of such limitation. We conclude that a trial court may consider evidence that a spouse dissipated marital assets prior to the couple\u2019s physical separation, for purposes of determining an equitable distribution of property under \u00a7 46b-81, so long as the actions constituting dissipation occur either: (1) in contemplation of divorce or separation; or (2) while the marriage is in serious jeopardy or is undergoing an irretrievable breakdown.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">In <em>Gershman </em>v. Gershman, supra, 286 Conn. 351, we recently concluded that \u201cdissipation in the marital dissolution context requires financial misconduct involving marital assets, such as intentional waste or a selfish financial impropriety, coupled with a purpose unrelated to the marriage.\u201d We now address the question left unanswered in <em>Gershman, </em>namely, whether a temporal element is an essential component of dissipation. See id., 350-51 n.10. More specifically, we must determine whether transactions that occur prior to the physical separation of spouses may constitute dissipation of marital assets for purposes of equitable property distribution under \u00a7 46b-81. As this issue is a matter of first impression for Connecticut\u2019s appellate courts, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>presents a question of law subject to plenary review. <em>Genesky </em>v. <em>East Lyme, </em>275 Conn. 246, 252, 881 A.2d 114 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">We begin by examining the language of the relevant statute. Section 46b-81 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) At the time of entering a decree annulling or dissolving a marriage or for legal separation pursuant to a complaint under section 46b-45, the Superior Court may assign to either the husband or wife all or any part of the estate of the other. . . . (c) In fixing the nature and value of the property ... to be assigned . . . [t]he court shall also consider the contribution of each of the parties in the acquisition, <em>preservation </em>or appreciation in value of their respective estates.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">As the term \u201cpreservation\u201d is not defined in the statute, \u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a) requires that we construe the term in accordance with the commonly approved usage of the language . . . [and, therefore] it is appropriate to look to the common understanding of the term as expressed in a dictionary.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Jim\u2019s Auto Body </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>285 Conn. 794, 808, 942 A.2d 305 (2008). The definition of \u201cpreserve\u201d in the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (4th Ed. 2000) is \u201c[t]o maintain in safety from injury, peril, or harm; protect. . . .\u201d \u201cDissipation,\u201d on the other hand, is defined as \u201c[w]asteful expenditure or consumption. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Id. Under the common usage of the terms, \u201cdissipation\u201d is the financial antithesis of \u201cpreservation.\u201d More specifically, a party that dissipates assets detracts from the preservation of those assets. Accordingly, Connecticut trial courts have the statutory authority, under \u00a7 46b-81, to consider a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>spouse\u2019s dissipation of marital assets when determining the nature and value of property to be assigned to each respective spouse. See also <em>Gershman </em>v. <em>Gershman, </em>supra, 286 Conn. 341. The language of \u00a7 46b-81 does not, however, expressly provide any temporal limitation on a court\u2019s consideration of marital asset dissipation. Furthermore, after review, we are unable to extrapolate any meaningful guidance from the relationship of \u00a7 46b-81 to other statutes, its legislative history or its underlying policy, with regard to whether the legislature intended to limit a court\u2019s consideration of dissipation to actions occurring within a prescribed time period. Accordingly, our resolution of this issue requires us to address a gap in the statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">A review of case law in other jurisdictions reveals that the majority of our sister states allow trial courts to consider a spouse\u2019s dissipation of marital assets, that occurs <em>prior </em>to the spouses\u2019 physical separation, in determining the allocation of assets to each respective spouse. See, e.g., <em>Hrudka </em>v. <em>Hrudka, </em>186 Ariz. 84, 93, 919 P.2d 179 (App. 1995) (trial court may compensate nondissipating spouse when apportioning community property, and governing statute contains no temporal restriction on court\u2019s consideration of dissipation); <em>In re Marriage of Paulsen, </em>677 P.2d 1389, 1390 (Colo.

We agree with the majority of our sister states, and conclude, therefore, that trial courts are permitted to consider, when determining the allocation of assets between spouses in a dissolution proceeding, whether a spouse\u2019s actions that occur <em>prior </em>to the spouses\u2019 physical separation constitute the dissipation of marital assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Several of the states that allow courts to recognize preseparation dissipation also require, however, that the actions constituting dissipation must occur either: (1) in contemplation of divorce or separation;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>when the marriage was in serious jeopardy or undergoing an irretrievable breakdown.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> At least three rationales have been offered for why courts have adopted the foregoing temporal restrictions. For instance, \u201cit has been argued that without a breakdown test [or some equivalent test], eveiy expenditure and economic decision made during the marriage can be questioned, and the courts would become auditing agencies for every failed marriage.\u201d L. Becker, \u201cConduct of a Spouse That Dissipates Property Available for Equitable Property Distribution: A Suggested Analysis,\u201d 52 Ohio St. L.J. 95,108 (1991); see <em>also In re Marriage of Getautas, </em>189 Ill.

See, e.g., <em>Bertholet v. Bertholet, </em>725 N.E.2d 487, 499-500 (Ind. App. 2000); <em>In re Marriage of Rodriguez, </em>supra, 266 Kan. 352; <em>In re Martel, </em>supra, 944 A.2d 581; <em>Anstutz </em>v. <em>Anstutz, </em>112 Wis. 2d 10, 13, 331 N.W.2d 844 (App. 1983). We are not, however, persuaded by these decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">With regard to <em>Anstutz, </em>the Wisconsin legislature subsequently enacted a temporal restriction on the trial courts\u2019 consideration of dissipation for purposes of determining how equitably to divide marital property. See Wise. Stat. \u00a7 767.63 (2005-2006) (\u201cany asset with a fair market value of $500 or more that would be considered part of the estate of either or both of the parties if owned by either or both of them at the time of the action and that was transferred for inadequate consideration, wasted, given away, or otherwise unaccounted for by one of the parties <em>within one year prior to the filing of the petition or the length of the marriage, </em>whichever is shorter, is rebuttably presumed to be property subject to division\u201d [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">The courts in <em>Bertholet v. Bertholet, </em>supra, 725 N.E.2d 499, and <em>In re Martel, </em>supra, <em>944 </em>A.2d 581, both refused to impose a temporal restriction because the relevant statutes required that the courts consider whether a party committed dissipation \u201cduring the marriage.\u201d The court in <em>Bertholet </em>determined, however, that \u201ctransactions which are remote in time and effect . . . may be deemed insignificant [by the trial court], while transactions which occur during the breakdown of the marriage, just prior to filing a petition or during the pendency of an action, may require heightened sera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>tiny.\u201d (Internal quotation marte omitted.) <em>Bertholet </em>v. <em>Bertholet, </em>supra, 499-500. Likewise, in <em>In re Martel, </em>supra, 581, the court implicitly determined that a trial court may place similar emphasis on <em>when </em>a party committed dissipation, by concluding that a trial court may consider \u201cany other factor\u201d it deems relevant in dividing marital assets. Thus, courts in these states may properly accord increased weight to acts of dissipation occurring at or near the time of a marriage\u2019s breakdown.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">In <em>In re Marriage of Rodriguez, </em>supra, 266 Kan. 352, the court utilized Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990), in determining whether the definition of \u201cdissipate\u201d encompassed a temporal element, and, therefore, whether the relevant statute imposed a temporal restriction on the trial courts\u2019 consideration of dissipation. The definition of \u201cdissipate\u201d in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990), is \u201c[t]o destroy or waste, as to expend funds foolishly. . . .\u201d Neither Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th Ed. 1999) nor Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Ed. 2004) provide a definition of \u201cdissipate,\u201d but rather define \u201cdissipation\u201d as \u201c[t]he use of an asset for an illegal or inequitable purpose, such as a spouse\u2019s use of community property for personal benefit <em>when a divorce is imminent.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Accordingly, had the decision been rendered just one year later, <em>after </em>release of Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th Ed. 1999), the <em>Rodriguez </em>court <em>may </em>well have reached a different conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b530-8\"> Whether these temporal elements have been met, however, is a question of fact for the trial court. See, e.g., <em>In re Mamage of Getautas, </em>supra, 189 Ill. App. 3d 152; <em>Kothari </em>v. <em>Kothari, </em>supra, 255 N.J. Super. 506; <em>Altman </em>v. <em>Altman, </em>supra, 181 S.W.3d 682. What constitutes, for example, an \u201cirretrievable breakdown\u201d or \u201cserious jeopardy\u201d will, therefore, vary with the circumstances of each case. Accordingly, we refrain from defining these temporal elements with further specificity, because an attempt to articulate a more precise standard may, in practice, be overly restrictive. While a trial court\u2019s determination of whether dissipative actions occurred may give rise to an exhaustive individualized inquiry in each case; see, e.g., <em>In re Marriage of Zweig, </em>supra, 343 Ill. App. 3d 599 (\u201c[e]ach dissipation situation is individual and requires a careful factual analysis\u201d); it, in practice, imposes no greater burden on the trial court than normally exists in marital dissolution actions. In fact, dissolution actions are fraught with such individualized inquiries. For example, in simply determining the nature and value of property to be assigned between the parties in a dissolution action, a trial court is required to consider \u201cthe length of the marriage, the causes for the annulment, dissolution of the marriage or legal separation, the age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate, liabilities and needs of each of the parties and the opportunity of each for future acquisition of capital assets and income ... [as well as] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>the contribution of each of the parties in the acquisition ... of their respective estates.\" General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
