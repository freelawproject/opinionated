Specifically, we are asked to consider whether the state can choose to collect reimbursement from the medicaid recipient under federal medicaid law instead of pursuing the third party tortfeasor directly, and, if so, whether the amount of reimbursement must be reduced pro rata to compensate the recipient for the attorney\u2019s fees and costs he expended in obtaining the recovery in which the state ultimately shares. The defendants<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeal from the trial court\u2019s granting of the state\u2019s motion for summary judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>ment on its interpleader action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The following undisputed facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. The named defendant, James Peters, was seriously injured in a motorcycle accident in 1997. Having incurred $280,000 in medical bills, Peters received $62,890.72 in medicaid assistance and $7700 in cash assistance from the state department of social services.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thereafter, Peters pursued damages from the tortfeasor and ultimately obtained an arbitration award in the amount of $747,500, which was reduced to $526,298.33 after attorney\u2019s fees and costs were deducted. The state department of administrative services, which is responsible for the billing and collection of any money due to the state in public assistance cases; see <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social </em>Services, 273 Conn. 434, 439 n.5, 870 A.2d 448 (2005); then asserted a lien in the amount of $70,590.72 against the arbitration award pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17b-93 and 17b-94 in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>order to obtain reimbursement of the public assistance funds that it had paid to Peters.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On June 17, 2005, the state brought an interpleader action against the defendants, seeking a determination of rights to the full amount of the lien. The defendants counterclaimed, asserting that the federal medicaid statutes require that the amount of the lien be reduced pro rata by one third to account for the attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred by Peters in pursuing the arbitration award from the tortfeasor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The parties then filed cross motions for summary judgment. The trial court, <em>Hon. Robert J. Hale, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>judge trial referee, granted the state\u2019s motion for summary judgment on October 17, 2006, and adopted the holding of the trial court, <em>Dunnell, </em>J., in a related proceeding that presented the same issues as this appeal. <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>supra, 434. In that proceeding, Peters had challenged the amount of the lien at a hearing before the department of social services, which had ruled that the state could recover the full amount of the lien. Peters then filed an administrative appeal with the Superior Court under the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA), General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 et seq. In dismissing that appeal, the trial court concluded that the department of social services was entitled to recover the full amount of the hen because neither federal nor state law required the department to pursue third parties directly for reimbursement of medicaid funds, or, alternatively, to accept a lesser reimbursement by a pro rata share of attorney\u2019s fees and costs from the recipient\u2019s recovery against a third party tortfeasor.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>supra, 440. In <em>Peters, </em>this court reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Id., 447-48. The state then filed the current inter-pleader action, and the defendants thereafter appealed from the summary judgment rendered in favor of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">On appeal, the defendants argue that the trial court improperly concluded that federal law does not require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>the state to pursue third parties directly for the reimbursement of medicaid funds. Alternatively, the defendants argue that the trial court improperly held that, if the state chooses to collect reimbursement from the medicaid recipient instead of pursuing the tortfeasor directly, the state is not obligated to reduce the amount of its reimbursement pro rata to compensate the recipient for his attorney\u2019s fees and costs. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">We undertake our analysis beginning with the applicable standard of review. \u201cPractice Book \u00a7 17-49 provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. . . . The party moving for summary judgment has the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue of material fact and that the party is, therefore, entitled to judgment as a matter of law. ... On appeal, we must determine whether the legal conclusions reached by the trial court are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision of the trial court. . . . Our review of the trial court\u2019s decision to grant the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bellemare </em>v. <em>Wachovia Mortgage Corp., </em>284 Conn. 193, 198-99, 931 A.2d 916 (2007). The defendants\u2019 claim challenging the trial court\u2019s interpretation of federal and state statutes is also subject to plenary review. \u201cIssues of statutory construction raise questions of law, over which we exercise plenary review. . . . The process of statutory interpretation involves the determination of the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of the case, including the question of whether the language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>does so apply. . . . When construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Alvord Investment, LLC </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>282 Conn. 393, 401-402, 920 A.2d 1000 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Our interpretation of federal and state statutes is guided by the plain meaning rule. See, e.g., <em>Cambodian Buddhist Society of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>285 Conn. 381, 400-401, 941 A.2d 868 (2008) (\u201cWith respect to the construction and application of federal statutes, principles of comity and consistency require us to follow the plain meaning rule for the interpretation of federal statutes because that is the rule of construction utilized by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. ... If the meaning of the text is not plain, however, we must look to the statute as a whole and construct an interpretation that comports with its primary purpose and does not lead to anomalous or unreasonable results.\u201d [Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]); <em>Alvord Investment, LLC </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 282 Conn. 402 (\u201cIn seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extra-textual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]). We conclude that the federal medicaid statutes reasonably cannot be categorized as plain and unambiguous; see, e.g., <em>Ahern </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>248 Conn. 708, 720, 733 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>A.2d 756 (1999);<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and, therefore, our determination of whether the statutes require the state to pursue the third party tortfeasor directly for reimbursement, or, alternatively, require the state to compensate the recipient pro rata for attorney\u2019s fees and costs, will encompass the text of the relevant medicaid statutes as well as their broader context and purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">We therefore begin with the language of the federal statutes that govern the medicaid assistance program.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The federal medicaid statutes place a priority on state reimbursement of medicaid funds and require that participating states have a recovery policy to effectuate such reimbursement. For states that elect to participate in the medicaid program,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> title 42 of the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>Code, \u00a7 1396a (a) (25) (A), mandates that the state\u2019s plan for medical assistance must \u201cprovide . . . that the [s]tate or local agency administering such plan will take all reasonable measures to ascertain the legal liability of third parties<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> ... to pay for care and services available under the plan . . . .\u201d Moreover, \u201cin any case where such a legal liability is found to exist after medical assistance has been made available on behalf of the individual and where the amount of reimbursement the [s]tate can reasonably expect to recover exceeds the costs of such recovery, the [s]tate or local agency <em>will seek reimbursement </em>for such assistance to the extent of such legal liability . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (a) (25) (B). To facilitate reimbursement, participating states also are required to adopt \u201claws under which, to the extent that payment has been made under the [s]tate plan for medical assistance for health care items or services furnished to an individual, the [s]tate is considered to have acquired the rights of such individual to payment by any other party for such health care items or services . . . .\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (a) (25) (H). Furthermore, in seeking reimbursement, title 42 of the United States Code, \u00a7 1396k (a), sets forth conditions that a state medicaid participation plan must meet, which include the requirement that medicaid recipients must assign to the state any rights they may have to payment of medical care from third parties: \u201cFor the purpose of assisting in the collection of medical support payments and other payments for medical care owed to recipients of medical assistance under the [s]tate plan approved under this subchapter, a [s]tate plan for medical assistance shall ... (1) provide that, as a condition of eligibility for medical assistance under the [s]tate plan to an individual . . . the individual is required . . . (A) to assign the [s]tate any rights, of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>individual ... to support (specified as support for the purpose of medical care by a court or administrative order) and to payment for medical care from any third party; (B) to cooperate with the [s]tate ... in obtaining support and payments (described in subparagraph [A]) for himself . . . and (C) to cooperate with the [s]tate in identifying, and providing information to assist the [s]tate in pursuing, any third party who may be liable to pay for care and services available under the plan . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Section 1396k further provides: \u201cSuch part of any amount collected by the [s]tate under an assignment made under the provisions of this section shall be retained by the [s]tate as is necessary to reimburse it for medical assistance payments made on behalf of an individual with respect to whom such assignment was executed (with appropriate reimbursement of the [federal [g]ovemment to the extent of its participation in the financing of such medical assistance), and the remainder of such amount collected shall be paid to such individual.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396k (b); see also 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 433.145 and 433.146.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">The state of Connecticut has elected to participate in the medicaid program, and, therefore, is obligated to comply with federal requirements. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17b-2 (8) and 17b-260;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> see also <em>Arkansas Dept. of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number><em>Health &amp; Human Services </em>v. <em>Ahlborn, </em>547 U.S. 268, 275-78, 126 S. Ct. 1752, 164 L. Ed. 2d 459 (2006); <em>Schweiker </em>v. <em>Gray Panthers, </em>453 U.S. 34, 37, 101 S. Ct. 2633, 69 L. Ed. 2d 460 (1981). Accordingly, the legislature has adopted a statutory scheme that provides three ways for the state to seek reimbursement of medicaid funds paid to recipients, namely, by an assignment of rights, aright of subrogation and alien. General Statutes (Sup. 2008) \u00a7 17b-265 requires that medicaid recipients in Connecticut, as a condition of eligibility, assign to the state the right to reimbursement from third parties for medical expenses.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 17b-265, the department of social services is subrogated to any right of recovery that a recipient has against a third party for reimbursement. Sections 17b-93 and 17b-94 provide that the state may assert a lien to effectuate the state\u2019s reimbursement of medicaid funds. Thus, to obtain reimbursement when a third party is liable for a recipient\u2019s medical expenses that the state has paid, the state may pursue those claims against the third party directly pursuant to the assignment and subrogation scheme or, alternatively, indirectly by placing a lien on personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>injury judgments or settlements obtained by a medicaid recipient from a liable third party. Cf. <em>Calvanese </em>v. Calvanese, 93 N.Y.2d 111, 117, 710 N.E.2d 1079, 688 N.Y.S.2d 479 (1999) (describing New York\u2019s similar statutory scheme), overruled on other grounds by <em>Arkansas Dept. of Health &amp; Human Services </em>v. <em>Ahlborn, </em>supra, 268, as stated in <em>In re Zyprexa Products Liability Litigation, </em>451 F. Sup. 2d 458 (E.D.N.Y. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">The federal statutes illustrate that Congress has mandated that medicaid be a \u201cpayer of last resort\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Arkansas Dept. of Health &amp; Human Services </em>v. <em>Ahlborn, </em>supra, 547 U.S. 291;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and that the state is required to seek reimbursement of medicaid funds.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The language of the relevant federal medicaid statutes, however, does not dictate the method that states must employ to effectuate that goal. The defendants\u2019 position would require us to read language into the medicaid statutes that simply does not exist, namely, that the state will seek reimbursement <em>directly from a liable third party, or if the state chooses to pursue reimbursement indirectly through a lien on </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number><em>judgment or settlement proceeds obtained by a recipient, the state must compensate the recipient pro rata for the attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred by him in pursuing the third party. </em>We decline to do so because the legislative history of the relevant medicaid statutes does not support that interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Significantly, Congress envisioned that third parties would be legally hable for a recipient\u2019s injuries and clearly intended that states should obtain reimbursement in that case. The Senate Report that accompanied the Social Security Amendments of 1967 stated that when \u201cpeople need medical care because of an accident or illness for which someone else has fiscal liability; for example, a . . . party who is determined by a court to have legal liability,\u201d \u00a7 1396a (a) (25) (A) through (C), was intended \u201cto make certain that the [sjtate and the [federal [governments will receive proper reimbursement for medical, assistance paid to an eligible person when such third-party liability exists . . . .\u201d S. Rep. No. 744, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. 165 (1967), reprinted in 1967 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2834, 3022. Our review of the legislative history for the relevant medicaid statutes reveals only one oblique reference to what method states should use in pursuing reimbursement when a third party is found to be liable for a recipient\u2019s medical expenses. In the same Senate Report, the Finance Committee stated that \u201cif medical assistance is granted and legal liability of a third party is established later, the [s]tate or local agency must seek reimbursement <em>from such party.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) S. Rep. No. 744, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. 165 (1967), reprinted in 1967 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2834, 3022. This language clearly permits states to pursue reimbursement directly from a third party, but it does not logically follow, from its silence, that it precludes states from seeking reimbursement by other methods or requires that the state deduct attorney\u2019s fees pro rata in seeking reimbursement indirectly from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>the recipient. Instead, we read this language to require that the state must obtain reimbursement from a hable third party, regardless of method, and must do so directly from a third party unless a beneficiary already has collected from that party because the state must collect reimbursement <em>in some manner. </em>We do not attribute more significance to this language than it warrants, particularly because there is no support in the statutes\u2019 text for limiting the state\u2019s reimbursement only to recovery from third parties directly.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Moreover, not only is there no other reference to the method by which states should seek such reimbursement in any of the legislative history, but, also, there is no support in the legislative history whatsoever for the defendants\u2019 argument that states seeking reimbursement indirectly should compensate the recipient for attorney\u2019s fees and costs.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Finally, the defendants have provided no author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>ity, from the legislative history or elsewhere, that requires us to adopt the methodology that they seek.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">We conclude, therefore, that the state has met its federal obligation to seek reimbursement of medicaid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>funds when third parties are found to be liable for a recipient\u2019s medical expenses by providing for assignment and subrogation rights; see General Statutes \u00a7 17b-265; and by allowing the state to assert a lien against funds recovered by medicaid recipients from third parties.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17b-93 and 17b-94. We therefore reject the defendants\u2019 claim that the federal medicaid statutes require states to pursue third parties directly for reimbursement, or, alternatively, if recovering the reimbursement indirectly, to reduce the reimbursement amount pro rata to compensate the recipient for attorney\u2019s fees and costs that he incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Moreover, to the extent that there is any policy justification for requiring states to provide for pro rata reductions for a recipient\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred in pmsuing liable third parties, we conclude that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>is a matter more appropriately addressed by the legislature.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> As Justice Borden noted when construing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>predecessor to \u00a7 17b-94 in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ebenstein, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford, Docket No. 251148 (July 6, 1981): \u201cIt may or may not be a wiser or [a] fairer policy to recognize the equitable [principle] . . . that . . . one enjoying the fruits of a recovery should be required to contribute to the costs of growing them. . . . [Wjhether the state should be required to contribute to the legal fee for generating the fund is a matter of policy which the legislature has clearly resolved in the negative .... It is free, of course, to change that policy .... But unless and until it does this court cannot read [the predecessor statute to \u00a7 17b-94] to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Indeed, we find it telling that the federal government has chosen to enact a pro rata reduction policy for medicare reimbursements, but has not done the same for medicaid. See 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 411.37 (a) (1) (2006) (\u201c[m]edicare reduces its recovery to take account of the cost of procuring the judgment or settlement . . . if\u2014[i] [procurement costs are incurred because the claim is disputed; and [ii] [t]hose costs are borne by the party against which [centers for medicare and medicaid services] seeks to recover\u201d). We also note that when the legislature amended what is now \u00a717b-94 in 1984 to allow the aid recipient to retain more of his recovery from the third party tortfeasor, it made no provision for the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees and costs from the state. Public Acts 1984, No. 84-455, \u00a7 1; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Marks, </em>239 Conn. 471, 479, 686 A.2d 969 (1996) (\u201cIn 1984, the statute was again amended to reduce the amount of the state\u2019s lien against the proceeds of causes of action held by public assistance beneficiaries to the lesser of 50 percent thereof or the amount of assistance paid, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>but the amendment did not disturb the rule of full reimbursement out of inheritances by such beneficiaries. See General Statutes [Rev. to 1985] \u00a7 17-83f. The obvious purpose of reducing the amount of the state\u2019s hen on such proceeds and, thereby, affording some of the recovery to the public assistance beneficiary, was to give an incentive to the beneficiary to prosecute his or her cause of action, thus benefiting the beneficiary and, possibly, the state as well, as described previously.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">Accordingly, for the aforementioned reasons, we conclude that the federal statutes that govern the medicaid program do not require the state to pursue third party tortfeasors directly for the reimbursement of medicaid funds, or, alternatively, if the state chooses to collect reimbursement indirectly from the medicaid recipient, to reduce the amount of the reimbursement pro rata to compensate the recipient for attorney\u2019s fees and costs that he incurred in pursuing the third party. We therefore conclude that Connecticut\u2019s reimbursement provisions, namely, \u00a7\u00a7 17b-93, 17b-94 and 17b-265, satisfy the medicaid reimbursement requirements imposed by federal law.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b105-9\"> The defendants are: James Peters, the accident victim and medicaid recipient; Daniel Shepro, Peters\u2019 counsel in the arbitration proceedings that resulted in his recovery of damages from the third party tortfeasor; and Shepro and Blake, LLC, Shepro\u2019s law firm.

In <em>Arkansas Dept. of Health &amp; Human Services </em>v. <em>Ahlborn, </em>supra, 547 U.S. 272-74, a medicaid recipient obtained a tort settlement from a third party and the Arkansas department of health and human services asserted a lien against the settlement proceeds for reimbursement of medicaid funds it had paid to that recipient. The lien was not reduced pro rata to compensate the recipient for attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Although whether a state may pursue reimbursement indirectly through a lien and, if so, whether that lien must be reduced pro rata, was not at issue in <em>Ahlborn, </em>the court, in holding that a state may assert a lien only on the settlement amount that represents medical expenses; id., 275; indicated that a state may pursue reimbursement indirectly through a lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">Our research also reveals that, like Connecticut, thirty additional states use liens to collect reimbursement of medicaid funds indirectly from recipients who have pursued liable third parties.

In fact, our research reveals only one state, New Jersey, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>where the court relied in part on the federal medicaid statutes to find that the state was required to reduce its reimbursement pro rata to compensate the recipient for his attorney\u2019s fees. See <em>Hedgebeth </em>v. <em>Medford, </em>74 N.J. 360, 378 A.2d 226 (1977). We do not fmd this case persuasive, however, because it did not involve a lien and was decided on equitable principles that are not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b122-7\"> The defendants also claim that the trial court improperly increased the lien amount from an interim amount quoted to the defendants. The department of administrative services had informed the defendants by letter on May 23, 2001, that the interim amount of the lien was $69,708.16, which included $62,008.16 of medicaid funds. By subsequent letter on September 10, 2001, however, the department of administrative services increased the amount of medicaid funds to be reimbursed to $62,890.72, which in turn increased the total amount of the lien to $70,590.72. The defendants claim that the increase was not warranted because no additional medical expenses had been incurred by Peters in the interim and that they were prejudiced by the increase because the arbitration proceedings had ended before the amount of the lien was increased, leaving the defendants no opportunity to recover the additional amount from the tortfeasor. We decline to consider this claim because it is briefed inadequately. The defendants offer only a conclusory assertion that the amount was improperly increased, and offer no analysis or authority for this conclusion.
