Upon the trial had on February 1 and 2,1888, it appeared from the entry by the Persia, of July 22, 1863, produced from the custom-house, that besides the China and Canton tram, and China organzine, there were also imported by that vessel certain silk velvets and other goods; that said tram and organzine was entered as dutiable at the rate of 25 per cent, <em>ad valorem, </em>and the velvets, as valued at over three dollars per square yard, and the other goods as dutiable at 40 per cent, <em>ad valorem; </em>that duties thereon at these rates, and amounting to the sum of $3,812.80, were paid July 25, 1863; that at about August 11, 1863, the said tram and organzine were returned by the appraiser as from beyond the Cape of Good Hope, as aforesaid, and therefore subject to a discriminating duty of 10 per cent, <em>ad valorem, </em>in addition to the 25 per cent, <em>ad valorem </em>already imposed;, a part of said velvets as under three dollars per square yard in value, and therefore dutiable at 30 per cent, <em>ad valorem,, </em>instead of 40 per cent., as already paid; and the remaining goods as dutiable at 40 per cent, <em>ad valorem-, </em>as already paid; that thereafter the collector re-estimated the duties on all of these importations in accordance with the return of the appraiser, and at the sum of $3,561.30, or by $251.50 less than the amount paid July 25, 1863; that as shown by the stamp on said entry, the duties were liquidated, the said firm notified of such liquidation, and the said sum of $251.50 refunded to them, October 29, 1863. The protest attached to the entry by the Persia, on which the plaintiffs relied to recover the discriminating duty, was dated August 13, 1863, or 19 days after the original payment of $3,812.80, on July 25, 1863. It also appeared from the evidence of plaintiffs\u2019witnesses that the importations in suit were purchased by said firm of the firm of Francis Bennoch &amp; Co., of London, England, -which in 1863 was the great center of the silk trade; that said firm of Francis Bennoch <em>&amp; </em>Co., were not manufacturers, but commission merchants. That said firm of E. B. Strange &amp; Bro. did not, in 1863, import tram or organzine from*China or Japan, and were in 1863 manufacturers of certain ribbons known as the \u201cCompass brand,\u201d and other well-known silk goods; that \u201ctram\u201d is produced by taking from four to six fibers of silk, as reeled from the cocoon of the silk worm, soaking them to soften the gum, and putting them together so that by their adhesion they form a thread, and then by twisting two such threads together; that \u201corganzine\u201d is produced by taking two of such threads, and first twisting each thread by itself, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>and then twisting together the two so twisted: that the term \u201cthrown silk\u201d includes both \u201ctrain\u201d and \u201corganzine;\u201d that the advancing of the silk fibers to tram and organzine forms a distinct industry, is done by complicated and expensive machinery, occupies about four days, and increases the value of the silk about 20 per cent.; that at a little distance it is impossible to distinguish with the eye the silk fibers \u201ctram\u201d and \u201corganzine\u201d apart, though they are readily distinguished by the touch; that the words \u201cChina,\u201d \u201cCanton,\u201d \u201cJapan,\u201d and \u201cItalian,\u201d etc., as used in the phrases \u201cChina tram,\u201d \u201cChina organzine,\u201d etc., in 1863, and prior thereto, indicated the country or place in which the silk fibers were reeled from the cocoon, hut not the country or place where they were advanced to \u201c tram \u201d or \u201c organzine; \u201d that in those years these fibers were so advanced in this country, in England, France, and Italy; that in those years \u201ctram,\u201d before it was lit to be used in manufacturing silk goods, was boiled, to take the gum out, dyed and'wound and quilled; and \u201corganzino\u201d boiled, dyed, wound, and warped; that an expert was able in 1863 to tell in what country any particular \u201ctram\u201d or \u201corganzine\u201d was thrown, or advanced from the silk fibers as reeled from the cocoon, etc., after such \u201c tram\u201d or \u201corganzine\u201d had been manufactured into silk goods; that while \u201ctram\u201d and \u201corganzine\u201d was so thrown or advanced in China and Japan, the ribbons known as the \u201cCompass brand,\u201d and other silk goods manufactured by the said firm of E. B. Strange &amp; Bro., in 1863, cotdd not be made out of such \u201ctram\u201d and \u201corganzine;\u201d and that, in fact, in 1863 such \u201ctrain\u201d and \u201corganzine\u201d was not imported into this country from China aild Japan; that there is no difference in the articles described by the phrase \u201csilk, raw, not more advanced in manufacture than * * * tram * * * or organzine,\u201d contained in Schedule F of the act of July 30, 1846; and the phrase \u201csilk in the gum not more advanced in the manufacture than * * * tram * * * or organzine,\u201d contained in the aforesaid act of August 5,1861; that in fact all \u201craw silk\u201d is \u201csilk in the gum,\u201d hut that in trade and commerce \u201craw silk\u201d is never called \u201csilk In the gum,\u201d because it goes without saying. Both sides having rested, the defendant\u2019s counsel moved the court to direct the jury to find for the defendant as to the importation by the Persia, on the ground that the said firm of E. B. Strange &amp; Bro. paid their money in the case of that importation on July 25, 1863, and the protest on which they relied as to the same, as appears by its date, not having been made until August 13, 1863, was not made at or before such payment, as required by the aforesaid protesi act of February 26, 1845.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-6\">Lacombe, J., <em>(orally.) </em>The facts here show that on .July 25, 1863, there was a sum of money paid to the collector, which represented 40 per cent, duty on some goods, velvets and others, and 25 per cent, duty only on \u201ctram\u201d and \u201corganzine,\u201d but no charge of a discriminating duty of 10 per cent, was then made. On or about August 11, 1863, it was made by one of the subordinates of the custom-house on liquidating the entry, and was then for the first time charged. It was thereafter paid, not by the importers paying any more money, but by taking from a credit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>which was created for them on that day by reducing the amount which they had paid on other goods, a sufficient sum to pay this. Now, that is an entirely different state of affairs from the case where the importer of goods pays originally an estimated duty in excess of what he ought to pay, and subsequently, upon a liquidation, it is found that he paid too much. The overpayment here was not on these goods, and he never paid, in any sense, a discriminating duty on the \u201ctram\u201d and \u201corganzine\u201d in suit, until the money was produced to pay such duty, not out of the proceeds of the duties estimated and paid in anticipation of what they should be, but out of other duties on other goods. I think, therefore, in view of the fact that that protest is dated August 13th, that upon the evidence the liquidation must have gone to the naval office, and come back to the collector, and, further, that it is stamped with the official stamp of the collector as of October 29th, that this protest is in time. I shall therefore deny the motion on that ground.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-4\">The defendant\u2019s counsel then moved the court to direct the jury to find a verdict in his favor as to all the importations in suit, on the <em>ground\u2014First, </em>that there was no proof in the case that the \u201ctram\u201d and \u201corganzine\u201d comprising the same was thrown in England; and, <em>second, </em>that these-importations being \u201csilk in the gum, not more advanced in manufacture \u201d than \u201ctram \u201d and \u201corganzine,\u201d are not, within the purview of the statute of the United States, new and distant articles made out of \u201csilk raw, or as reeled from the eocoo\u00f1,\u201dbut are merely such \u201craw silk\u201d subjected to a few processes which have changed its condition only, and not its identity as \u201craw'silk.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-5\">Lacombe, J., <em>(orally.) </em>The sixteenth section of the act of March 2, 1861, and the second section of the act of August 5, 1861, provides for duty on \u201csilk in the gum, not more advanced in manufacture than singles, tram, and thrown, or organzine.\u201d Is not that a statutory definition of what these particular articles are, to-wit, that they are incomplete manufactures, and are not other or different in the meaning of congress than silk in the gum, and that therefore, if silk in the gum is a growth or produce of a country east of. the Cape of Good Hope, it does not cease to be silk in the gum by being advanced to singles, to tram, or to organzine. Now, if that be so, it does not make any difference where it is advanced to singles, tram, or organzine, whether in the country of its growth or produce or elsewhere. I therefore direct the jury to find a verdict for the defendant.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-6\">Subsequently plaintiffs make a motion to set aside this verdict and for a new trial.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b220-7\"><em>Samuel B. Clarke </em>and <em>Wm. B.

There was evidence for the jury that the \u201ctram\u201d and \u201corganzine\u201d in suit were not produced beyond the Cape of Good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Hope. The change of \u201craw silk\u201d to \u201ctram\u201d and \u201corganzine\u201d is a material change in the character of the articles: (1) It is a process that takes several days to complete; (2) it requires complicated and expensive machinery; (3) it is a distinct industry; (4) silk in the raw state is indifferently applicable to all the various purposes for which silk is used, but in the process of conversion into \u201ctram\u201d and \u201corganzine\u201d regard is had to the sort of fabric in which the \u201ctram\u201d and \u201corganzine,\u201d when made, is to be used; (5) the effeet of the change, besides increasing the value of the silk about 20 per cent., is to give the article a new trade name. \u201cSilk, as reeled from the cocoon,\u201d is known in the trade as \u201craw silk,\u201d but that term is never applied to it after it has been thrown. It is then called \u201ctram,\u201d \u201corganzine,\u201d \u201cthrown,\u201d etc. The making of \u201craw silk\u201d into \u201ctram\u201d and \u201corganzine\u201d does not merely change its character commercially. It also changes its dutiable or statutory character. At the time of the importations in suit \u201csilk raw or as reeled from the cocoon, not being doubled, etc., and silk cocoons and silk waste\u201d were free of duty. Section 23, act March 2, 1861. By section 2 of the act of March 3,1863, it was proved that the discriminating duty of section 14 of the act of 1862 should not apply to \u201craw silk as reeled from the cocoon, of the growth or produce of countries beyond the Gape of Good Hopo.\u201d The very act (of March 2, 1861) which made raw silk free, places by its sixteenth section a duty of 15 per cent, \u201con silk in the gum, not more advanced in manufacture than singles, tram, and thrown, or organzine.\u201d Section 2 of the act of August 5, 1861, increased that duty to 25 per cent., but left \u201craw silk\u201d free. The statutes since the act of 1857 have made a clear and sharp discrimination between \u201craw silk as reeled from the cocoon\u201d on the one hand, and \u201ctram\u201d and \u201corganzine\u201d on the other. In making this discrimination congress did but conform to physical facts and trade usages. The ground upon which the court directed a verdict in favor of the defendant appears to be that the language used by congress indicates that the importations in suit are incomplete manufactures, and not other or different in the meaning of congress than \u201csilk in the gum,\u201d and that therefore, if \u201csilk in the gum\u201d is a growth or a product of a country east of the Cape of Good Hope, it does not cease to be \u201csilk in the gum\u201d by being advanced to \u201csingles,\u201d to \u201ctram,\u201d or to \u201corganzine.\u201d The fallacy which this reasoning contains, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel respectfully submits, lies in the assumption that all \u201csilk in the gum\u201d has one dutiable or statutory character. But the statutes show that this is not so. \u201cSilk in the gum as reeled from the cocoon\u201d was free of duty generally by tile act of 1861, and, when produced in countries beyond the cape, it was free of the discriminating duty specifically by the act of 1863; but silk in the form of \u201ctram\u201d and \u201corganzine\u201d was dutiable; hence in the eye of the law, the change from \u201craw silk\u201d to \u201ctram\u201d and \u201corganzine\u201d was a change of dutiable or statutory character. In the ease at bar the evidence warranted the jury in finding that the change from \u201craw silk\u201d to \u201ctram\u201d and \u201corganzine\u201d was not made beyond the Gape of Good Hope, and, therefore, that these goods were not of the growth or produce of a country beyond the cape, and were not subject to the discriminating duty of 10 per cent. In some respects the following cases ar\u00e9 similar to the one at bar: <em>Arthur </em>v. <em>Herold, </em>100 U. S. 75; <em>Reeknagel </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>102 U.

An examination of the United States statutes from. 1842 to 1882, both inclusive, shows that congress throughout them lias always regarded \u201craw silk,\u201d \u201csilk raw as reeled from the cocoon,\u201d \u201craw silk, or as reeled from the cocoon, not being doubled, twisted, or advanced in manufacture any way,\u201d and \u201csilk raw, or silk in the gum, not more advanced in manufacture than tram or organzine, \u201d not as separate articles, but as the same article, viz., \u201craw silk\u201d in different conditions. Section 2 of the act of March 3, 1863, which exempted from discriminating duty \u201craw silk,as reeled from the cocoon,\u201d of the growth or produce of countries beyond the Cape of Good Hope, when imported from places this side of that cape, does not affect \u201ctram\u201d and \u201corganzine,\u201d as contended by plaintiffs; for they are not \u201craw silk\u201d in its condition \u201cas reeled from the cocoon,\u201d but in a different condition. That section says, in effect, to the importer, so long as you import from places this side of the Cape of Good Hope \u201crawsilk\u201d in its condition \u201cas reeled from the cocoon,\u201d which is of the growth or produce of countries beyond that cape, you will be liable to no discriminating duty thereon; but if in places this side of that cape you advance \u201craw silk\u201d in that condition to some other condition, such as \u201ctram\u201d or \u201corganzine,\u201d then the discriminating duty will be levied under section 14 of the act of 1862, in precisely the same manner as if the act of March 3,1863, had never been passed.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b222-4\">Lacombe, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AXC\"><em>(after stating the facts as above.) </em>Careful <em>examination of </em>the exhaustive briefs submitted by the plaintiffs upon this motion for a new trial has not changed the opinion expressed on the trial. The plaintiffs are quite correct in their inference that the decision then rendered was founded upon the assumption that the language used by congress indicates that the importations in suit are incomplete manufactures, and that, despite the labor bestowed upon them, they are still but varieties of the growth or product whose generic name is \u201craw silk,\u201d or whose generic name is \u201csilk in the gum.\u201d He misapprehends the decision, however, when he paraphrases the assumption as being \u201cthat all silk in the gum has one \"dutiable or statutory character.\u201d The decision was not influenced by any assumption as to rates of duty, but because the manner in which congress expressed itself seemed to indicate quite clearly what it understood to be the result and effect of the labor bestowed upon these articles, and which advanced them to \u201ctram,\u201d \u201corganzine,\u201d etc. Sufficient indications of such understanding are found in the acts in force when these importations were made. Act of March 2,1861, \u00a7 16. \u201cOn silk <em>in </em>the gum,'not more advanced in manufacture than singles, tram, and thrown, or organzine,\u201d 15 per cent. duty. Clearly this indicates that silk in the gum does not lose its generic character by being advanced to singles, tram, and thrown, or organzine. Id. \u00a7 23.\u2019 \u201cSilk raw, dr as reeled from the cocoon, not being doubled, twisted, or advanced in manufacture in any way, and silk cocoons and silk waste,\u201d are put on the free list. Here are four enumerated varieties: (1) Raw silk, pure and simple; (2) raw silk, as reeled from the cocoon; (3) silk cocoons; and (4) silk waste. The qualification \u201cnot being doubled, twisted,\u201d etc., which is coupled with the first two, indicates that congress supposed that unless these words were added the importers of silk thus advanced might successfully claim that the article they brought in was still \u201csilk raw, or as reeled from the cocoon.\u201d The act of August 5, 1861, advancing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>duty on silk in the gum to 25 per cent., is in the same language as section 16 above quoted from. The act of March 3, 1863, \u00a7 2, amends a prior act so as to allow \u201ccotton and raw silk, as reeled from the cocoon,\u201d to be in certain cases free of discriminating duty. This refers only to the same article described in section 23 above quoted. It might, no doubt, be urged that, being used here without the qualifying words of the earlier act, the meaning of this phrase is broad enough to cover cases where the article is advanced to \u201csingles,\u201d \u201ctram,\u201d \u201cthrown,\u201d etc. In view, however, of the fact that the words \u201csilk in the gum\u201d do not appear in the later act, and of the evidence in the case which seems to indicate that there is no difference between \u201csilk raw advanced to tram,\u201d etc., and \u201csilk in the gum advanced to tram,\u201d etc., the point is too narrow to justify plaintiff\u2019s recovery.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
