In Arizona, preparatory offenses are distinct from, but defined by, a substantive offense. We consider whether a conviction for solicitation to commit possession of a dangerous drug for sale is a violation of a state controlled substance law. Affirming the superior court's judgment, we hold that it is.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 In June 2009, Mark Murro pled guilty to solicitation to commit possession of a dangerous drug for sale. The court suspended sentence and imposed probation, from which Murro was discharged in November 2011. In 2010, voters enacted the AMMA, which authorizes the Department of Health Services (\"DHS\") to approve a person to become a dispensary agent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    State v. Gear\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4311229\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/343/#p344\">\n    239 Ariz. 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 344, \u00b6 2,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4311229\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/343/#p344\">\n    372 P.3d 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 288 (2016) ; Ariz. Rev. Stat. (\"A.R.S.\") \u00a7 36-2804.01. In 2017, Murro applied for a dispensary agent registry identification card. In his application, Murro stated that he had not been convicted of an \"excluded felony offense,\" and subsequently was approved for a dispensary agent registry identification card. After a few months, DHS discovered his conviction for solicitation to commit possession of a dangerous drug for sale. DHS sent Murro a Notice of Intent to Revoke Dispensary Agent's Registry Identification Card and Notice of Right to Request Administrative Hearing. The Notice alleged that Murro was convicted of an excluded felony offense and had knowingly violated the AMMA by submitting false information in his application and acting as a dispensary agent when he was not qualified to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 Murro requested a hearing with an Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\"), and the ALJ upheld DHS's decision to revoke Murro's identification card. Murro appealed to the Director of DHS (\"Director\"), who adopted the ALJ's findings of fact and conclusions of law with minor revisions and revoked Murro's identification card. Murro appealed to the superior court, which affirmed the Director's decision. We have jurisdiction pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-913 and -2101(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 We will uphold the Director's decision unless it is \"contrary to law, is not supported by substantial evidence, is arbitrary and capricious or is an abuse of discretion.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 12-910(E). Statutory interpretation is a question of law that we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Compassionate Care Dispensary, Inc. v.

A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 36-2804.01(D), -2815(A). An excluded felony offense includes a felony \"violation of a state or federal controlled substance law,\" with certain exceptions that do not apply here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 36-2801(7)(b). The question is whether solicitation to commit possession of a dangerous drug for sale is a \"violation of a state ... controlled substance law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 Solicitation, like Arizona's other inchoate offenses, does not inherently deal with any particular subject matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 13-1001 (attempt); 13-1002 (solicitation); 13-1003 (conspiracy); 13-1004 (facilitation). Instead, solicitation is defined by the underlying offense, such that the elements of solicitation require proof that a person acted \"with the intent to promote or facilitate the commission\" of the underlying offense, and the classification of the underlying offense determines the classification of the solicitation offense. A.R.S. \u00a7 13-1002(A), (B). Because the crime of solicitation does not exist without incorporating other laws, solicitation is a law whose character or type depends wholly on the underlying substantive offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 For that reason, the law which Murro violated-solicitation to commit possession of a dangerous drug for sale-is a controlled substance law. Its status as an inchoate crime does not change the subject matter of the law that was violated, and Murro's conviction was for an \"excluded felony offense\" as defined in A.R.S. \u00a7 36-2801.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 Murro urges us to distinguish between completed and inchoate offenses. He argues that \"solicitation\" is part of a separate class of crimes, and therefore cannot be a controlled substance law. As support, he cites the general proposition that \"[p]reparatory offenses are separate and distinct from substantive offenses.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    State v. Tellez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1542662\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/165/381/#p383\">\n    165 Ariz. 381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 383,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1542662\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/165/381/#p383\">\n    799 P.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 3 (App. 1989). In\n   <em>\n    Tellez\n   </em>\n   , however, the only question before the court was whether solicitation was \"a violation of any provision of this section.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1542662\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/165/381/#p383\">\n    165 Ariz. at 382-83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1542662\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/165/381/#p383\">\n    799 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2-3 ; A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3408 (prohibiting knowing possession, use, or manufacture of a narcotic drug). And\n   <em>\n    Tellez\n   </em>\n   only held that solicitation was not a violation of A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3408 because it was not one of the specific offenses listed in that section.\n   <em>\n    Tellez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1542662\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/165/381/#p383\">\n    165 Ariz. at 382-83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1542662\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/165/381/#p383\">\n    799 P.2d at 2-3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b69 The statutory language at issue in this case does not support the conclusion that solicitation cannot be a controlled substance law. In contrast to\n   <em>\n    Tellez\n   </em>\n   , the relevant definition of \"excluded felony offense\" does not reference a specific statute, section, or chapter of the Arizona statutes and refers much more generally to the broad category of any \"controlled substance law.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 36-2801(7). The separate and distinct nature of a solicitation offense does not change our conclusion that solicitation to commit possession of a dangerous drug for sale is a violation of a controlled substance law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b610 Murro also cites\n   <em>\n    Coronado-Durazo v. I.N.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12013365,12013269\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/123/1322/\">\n    123 F.3d 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 1997). But unlike here, the federal statute at issue in that case provided \"that any alien who is convicted of 'a violation of (or a conspiracy or attempt to violate) any law or regulation ... relating to a controlled substance' may be deported.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12013365,12013269\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/123/1322/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12013365,12013269\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/123/1322/\">\n    at 1324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration in original) (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201251\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(B)(i) ). The court cited\n   <em>\n    Tellez\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that \"solicitation is a generic offense under Arizona law,\" and noted that the language in the statute's parenthetical \"limits convictions for generic crimes that may result in deportation to conspiracy and attempt. Simply put, solicitation is not on the list.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201251\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1325 (citing\n   <em>\n    Tellez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1542662\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/165/381/#p383\">\n    165 Ariz. at 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1542662\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/165/381/#p383\">\n    799 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   3 ). Because the statute expressly included only conspiracy and attempt, the court found that \"the plain language\" of the federal statute did not extend to other inchoate offenses such as solicitation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1542662\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/165/381/#p383\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b611 Even if\n   <em>\n    Coronado-Durazo\n   </em>\n   correctly interprets federal law,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   its analysis is inapplicable to this case. Unlike the federal statute at issue in\n   <em>\n    Coronado-Durazo\n   </em>\n   , Arizona statute does not define \"excluded felony offense\" to include or exclude generic offenses, but includes any violation of federal or state \"controlled substance law.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 36-2801(7). Because solicitation is defined by reference to the subject matter of the underlying offense, the crime of solicitation to commit a controlled substance offense is a violation of a controlled substance law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b612 Murro also argues that the superior court erred in finding that he knowingly violated the AMMA because he \"did not have a conviction for an excluded felony offense at [the] time that he applied to be a dispensary agent or while he worked as a dispensary agent.\" Because his conviction was for an excluded felony offense, we reject this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b613 Because solicitation to commit possession of a dangerous drug for sale is a violation of Arizona's controlled substance law, Murro was convicted of an excluded felony offense. We therefore affirm the superior court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    The exceptions are offenses whose sentence was completed ten or more years earlier and offenses that would be immune under A.R.S. \u00a7 36-2811, had it been effective at the time of the offense.
