Law enforcement officers concluded their gunfire struck and killed Brandon Morris, who was unaffiliated with the rival gang but happened to be in the area. Kitt, Gore, and Krentkowski were jointly tried and convicted of murder in the first degree and four counts of assault in the first degree. In addition, Kitt and Gore were convicted of unlawful possession of a firearm in the first degree, and Gore was convicted of intimidating a witness for threats he made before the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 In the published portion of this opinion, we reverse Krentkowski's conviction because his trial counsel had an actual conflict of interest that affected the representation, and the trial court erred by not allowing him to withdraw. In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we affirm the majority of Kitt's and Gore's convictions, but remand for the trial court to dismiss their murder in the second degree convictions with prejudice, conduct a\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   hearing for Gore, and strike specific legal financial obligations (LFOs) for Kitt and Gore.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   FACTS\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I. INCIDENT\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 3 Kitt, Gore, and Krentkowski were all members of the Hilltop Crips street gang.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 4 In the weeks before May 1, LeShaun Alexander, a member of the Knoccout Crips street gang, shot at some members of the Hilltop Crips, including Krentkowski. On the morning of May 1, Alexander shot at Kitt in the Tacoma Hilltop area outside the home of Trevion Tucker, another Hilltop Crips member.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 5 A few minutes after the shooting, Gore called Tucker's house and said he intended to go look for the shooters. A group gathered in a white Cadillac Escalade, driven by fellow Hilltop Crips member Lance Milton-Ausley. The group included Milton-Ausley, Kitt, Gore, Krentkowski, and Tucker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 6 Kitt brought a backpack that contained two handguns. He kept one and gave the other to Gore. Kitt said he wanted to shoot Alexander. Krentkowski had an AK-47 semiautomatic assault rifle. The group planned to shoot at a convenience store, known as the \"red store,\" in Knoccout territory where Knoccout members were known to gather. They planned to park somewhere near the store, get out, and shoot at it. They also planned to take pictures of themselves in Knoccout territory and post them on social media as a sign of disrespect to the rival gang.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7 As the group approached the red store, they noticed Alexander's car parked nearby. Milton-Ausley drove into the alley beside the red store. Alexander and several other Knoccout members were in a group near the store.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 8 As soon as they pulled into the alley, Gore and Kitt began shooting in the direction of the store. Each of them fired one of Kitt's handguns. During the shooting, Milton-Ausley drove slowly down the alley. He accelerated away when the shooting subsided. Krentkowski had the assault rifle on his lap but did not shoot. Tucker testified that no one was aiming and none of them saw anyone get shot; they were \"just shooting at the store.\" 14 Report of Proceedings (RP) at 2600.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 9 That same day, Morris and four companions were walking in the alley behind the red store. A bullet fired from the Escalade struck Morris in the head and he died several days later. Another bullet struck a backpack worn by one of Morris's companions, but it did not injure him. None of the Knoccout members near the store was injured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 10 At the time of the shooting, Kitt was 23 years old, Gore was 16 years old, and Krentkowski was 17 years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 11 The State charged Kitt, Gore, and Krentkowski each with one count of murder in the first degree and one count of murder in the second degree for the death of Morris. It also charged each of them with four counts of assault in the first degree, one for each of Morris's companions. It charged Kitt and Gore with unlawful possession of a firearm in the first degree and Gore with intimidating a witness. The case proceeded to a jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   II. CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 12 At the start of trial, Walter Peale, Krentkowski's lawyer, informed the court about a conflict of interest. He stated that he had represented Alexander in an unrelated case, in which the court had granted Peale's motion to withdraw based on his representation of Krentkowski. Peale argued that Krentkowski should be advised about the conflict by an independent counsel before the case could proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 13 The State argued that there was no actual conflict because Alexander was not involved in the case other than that his \"name may come up.\" 1 RP at 10. It explained that it would not be calling Alexander as a witness, but that the facts involved back-and-forth shootings between the Hilltop Crips and the Knoccout Crips and that Alexander was a \"principal[ ] on the Knoccoutz side.\" 1 RP at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 14 The court ruled that no conflict existed that required withdrawal. It stated that, \"[i]f they're totally unrelated matters, the representation of either Mr. Krentkowski or Mr. Alexander is not directly adverse to the other client.\" 1 RP at 31. The court recognized that a conflict would exist if there was \"a significant risk that the representation of one or more clients will be materially limited by a lawyer's responsibility to another client, a former client or a third person or by a personal interest of the lawyer,\" but stated that it would \"be surprised that a criminal defense attorney would have such a conflict\" and that, even in that case, the rule allowed representation \"in certain circumstances.\" 1 RP at 31-32. The court said Peale could raise the issue again with additional citation to authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 15 Several days later, Peale brought a motion to delay jury selection so that he could withdraw and Krentkowski could be appointed a new attorney or represent himself. Peale's motion raised his lack of preparation, his difficulties with the case, and the conflict of interest. The court denied the motion and stated that it had already ruled on Peale's motion to withdraw and substitute counsel. The court engaged in a colloquy with Krentkowski regarding self-representation. After conferring with Peale, Krentkowski withdrew his request to represent himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 16 Peale raised the conflict of interest issue again the following day, after an independent counsel had reviewed the situation and opined that Peale had a conflict. The court stated that it had ruled on the issue and again denied Peale's motion to withdraw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 17 During its opening statement, the State told the jury that the evidence would show that Alexander had shot at Gore and Krentkowski a few days before the red store shooting. Peale then argued that the State had made Alexander a part of the case, \"creat[ing] a relationship that [was] entirely different\" from how the conflict had previously been explained. 4 RP at 710. He argued that his client was alleged to be the victim of his former client and that a central part of the State's case placed his clients at odds with one another, creating a \"much greater risk of violating a variety of rules of professional responsibility.\" 4 RP at 711. Peale moved for a mistrial. The court denied Peale's mistrial motion and again denied his motion to withdraw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 18 During witness testimony, Peale raised the issue of his alleged conflict of interest two additional times. The first time, during Milton-Ausley's testimony, he stated that the case would require him to ask,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [W]hat was in the mind of Mr. Alexander? What was his reputation? What was his character? What do I know about him that would offer up an explanation in defense of Mr. Krentkowski? And why am I not pursuing that? And the reason I can't pursue it is because he's a former client.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   8 RP at 1471. Peale argued that if evidence about Krentkowski and Alexander's interactions came in, he would be unable to respond due to his conflict of interest. The court delayed ruling until Peale had a chance to interview Tucker about his planned testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 19 After interviewing Tucker, Peale learned that Tucker intended to testify that Alexander was armed and present at the red store shooting and may have fired at Krentkowski. Peale suggested that the court exclude evidence of Alexander's involvement so he could continue representing Krentkowski despite the conflict. He argued that, otherwise, Tucker's testimony would \"raise[ ] a considerable amount of information about [his] former client that in defense of [his] present client may be relevant to explore which [he couldn't] explore,\" preventing him from presenting a defense. 13 RP at 2372. The court denied Peale's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 20 At the conclusion of the trial, the jury returned guilty verdicts as to each count against all three defendants and found that each defendant was armed with a firearm during the commission of each murder and assault offense. The defendants appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 21 Krentkowski contends that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because the trial court denied his trial counsel's motion to withdraw based on a conflict of interest. He argues that, because an actual conflict of interest existed, we should presume prejudice and reverse his conviction. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 22 The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 22 of the Washington State Constitution guarantee the right to effective assistance of counsel.\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

Trial testimony established that Alexander had shot at Kitt the morning of the shooting and had shot at Krentkowski a few weeks prior. Alexander was one of the intended targets of the red store shooting. Peale said that the State's case raised a considerable amount of information about Alexander that may be relevant to his defense of Krentkowski, but that he could not explore this information because of his ongoing duty to Alexander.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 36 We accept Peale's representations that he learned confidential information in his representation of Alexander that he could not use to defend Krentkowski. Although Peale no longer represented Alexander at the time of trial, RPC 1.9(c)(1) prohibited him from using any confidential information he had obtained in his representation of Krentkowski. Peale raised numerous issues that could have been helpful to his defense of Krentkowski that he could not explore due to his ongoing duty to Alexander, such as Alexander's reputation and character and his relationship to Krentkowski. He was unable to pursue a defense relying on this information because Alexander was his former client.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 37 This case bears similarities to\n   <em>\n    Dhaliwal\n   </em>\n   , where the attorney represented numerous witnesses in the case. However, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Dhaliwal\n   </em>\n   , Peale raised the conflict numerous times before the trial court, repeatedly claiming that an actual conflict existed. Additionally, an independent counsel spoke with Krentkowski and concluded that Peale had a conflict of interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 38 Peale had an actual conflict of interest that affected his defense of Krentkowski. He repeatedly informed the trial court of this conflict and stated that the conflict would limit his representation of Krentkowski throughout the trial. We conclude that Krentkowski received ineffective assistance of counsel. In so ruling, we are mindful that the lawyer made numerous motions to withdraw due to the conflict, and the court denied all of them. Although Krentkowski couches his argument as ineffective assistance of counsel, the true error is in the court's failure to grant the motions to withdraw. We reverse Krentkowski's convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 39 A majority of the panel having determined that only the foregoing portion of this opinion will be printed in the Washington Appellate Reports and that the remainder shall be filed for public record pursuant to RCW 2.06.040, it is so ordered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   We concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Worswick, P.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Sutton, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    <em>\n     Miller v.
