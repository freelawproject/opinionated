Tracks showed the horses had passed through an open gate in a barbed-wire fence maintained by the State of Arizona adjacent to the highway. Investigators also spotted tire tracks of one or more all-terrain vehicles (\"ATVs\") leading through the gate. The motorist's parents sued several defendants, including the State, which filed a notice of nonparty at fault asserting that \"unknown ATV riders were responsible for leaving\" the gate open. The superior court struck the notice, noting the State had not tried to identify or locate the ATV riders and there was no evidence that any nonparty \"was actually known\" to be at fault. We hold the notice was valid. The claim against the State is that the highway gate was open because the State did not secure it. On these facts, the State may name as a nonparty at fault the individual who negligently left the gate open even though the State cannot identify that person by name.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 Joseph Ragsdale was driving to work in Miami when his car collided with the horses. Ragsdale was killed, and four of the horses also perished. His parents (the \"Plaintiffs\") sued a couple that owned property near the highway (the \"Owners\"), the couple who kept the horses in a fenced pasture on that property (the \"Ranchers\"), and the State. The Plaintiffs alleged the Owners and the Ranchers negligently failed to secure the gate to the pasture in which the Ranchers kept the horses. The Plaintiffs alleged the State negligently failed to secure a gate in another fence that ran along the highway about a half-mile beyond the pasture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 Discovery had revealed that hunters and hikers sometimes came and went through the pasture gate, and the State, joined by the Owners, filed a notice naming as nonparties at fault \"unknown persons\" who opened the pasture gate without closing it. The State separately filed another notice naming \"Unknown ATV Riders\" who, the State alleged, had left the highway gate open in disregard of a sign on the gate saying, \"KEEP GATE CLOSED.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 In support of its allegation about the ATV riders, the State cited a DPS report that stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [T]he horses came from the pasture and traveled towards State Route 77, where they located the opened right-[of-way] fence gate, traveled through it and up onto the highway where the collision occurred. It could not be determined who had left ... either the pasture gate or the right-[of-way] fence gate open, but ... a subject(s) operating [ATVs], based upon tire prints, had left the right-[of-way] fence gate open.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Plaintiffs objected to the notices of nonparty at fault, and, after briefing and oral argument, the superior court struck them both.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b65 The State petitioned for special action relief from the superior court's order striking its notice of the ATV riders as nonparties at fault. By prior order, we accepted jurisdiction of the State's petition because it raised a purely legal question and, in the circumstances presented, the State lacked an adequate\n   remedy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz.

The Plaintiffs contend that here, by contrast, as the superior court found, \"there is no person who actually saw anyone leave open the gate.\" On the facts presented, however, the State need not support its notice with testimony by someone who saw ATV riders open the highway gate and leave without closing the gate behind them. It is undisputed that the highway gate was open; indeed, the Plaintiffs allege the State negligently failed to secure the gate so that horses could not come from the nearby ranch onto the highway. Although the Plaintiffs do not concede that a human being must have opened the gate, at oral argument, they admitted they have no evidence to support the notion that the gate could have been opened any other way. And one of the Owners testified that gates like the one in the highway fence are not easy to open and \"generally ... don't get opened very often by people that can't close them.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b615 As the superior court noted, the premise of the State's notice is that the horses came onto the highway because someone left the gate open. Tire tracks mixed with the tracks of the horses show it may have been ATV riders who did so. On this record, given the nature of the gate and the other evidence in the record, the superior court erred by concluding the State's notice was too speculative. The Plaintiffs' claim against the State presumes the highway gate was open, and the State is entitled to argue to the jury that it should apportion fault to the ATV riders if it finds they opened the gate without closing it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b616 For these reasons, we accept jurisdiction of the State's petition for special action and grant relief by vacating the order of the superior court striking the State's notice of nonparty at fault concerning \"unknown ATV riders.\"\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    Our order vacated the ruling striking the State's notice and stated that we would issue an opinion in due course. This is that opinion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Absent material revision after the relevant date, we cite the current version of a statute or rule.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
