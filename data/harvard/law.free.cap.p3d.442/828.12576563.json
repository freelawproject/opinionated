(collectively, MC) and the Special Fund Division/No Insurance Section (the Fund) challenge an Industrial Commission of Arizona (ICA) decision finding MC and Juan Estopellan were Victor Reyes's employers at the time of his December 2015 industrial injury. We affirm the factual findings and conclusions of the administrative law judge (ALJ) with respect to those employers. We also hold that an ALJ is required to evaluate the liability of each contractor and subcontractor made a party to a workers' compensation claim. Because the ALJ did not do so in this case, we set aside the award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b62 In 2012, Taylor Morrison contracted with Younger Brothers Group, L.L.C. (YB) to complete the framing for various new home construction and lot improvement projects in and around Phoenix, including at Lot 31 of a housing development in Gilbert.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   That contract required YB to provide supervision, labor, materials, and services necessary to complete the work and provided that \"no such subcontracting shall relieve Younger Brothers from its obligations under th[e] agreement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b63 YB subcontracted the framing work on Lot 31 to a second framing contractor, Genaro's Framing Construction, L.L.C. (GFC). Pursuant to the independent contractor agreement, YB would provide general guidelines and framing materials for each job, but GFC was responsible for supplying the labor and tools, carrying workers' compensation insurance for employees, and controlling the day-to-day operations of the jobsite. YB did not return to the jobsite until it was completed, and then only to inspect the work and approve payment. Because GFC did not employ any actual framers, it subcontracted the Lot 31 job to a third framing contractor, MC, under similar terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b64 In 2015, MC assigned responsibility for completing the framing on Lot 31 to Estopellan, as it occasionally did when Estopellan sought additional work. At the time, Estopellan was also employed as a foreman for YB and responsible for supervising various projects including one near Lot 31. Nonetheless, Estopellan sometimes accepted other jobs through his own sole proprietorship. MC did not provide tools, materials, or labor; did not require any proof Estopellan maintained workers' compensation insurance; and did not direct or supervise Estopellan's work. As with YB and GFC, MC did not pay for a job until it had inspected and approved the work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b65 Estopellan immediately hired Roberto Navarro to help with Lot 31, as was Estopellan's practice when working side jobs, and paid Navarro a lump sum for the job via\n   personal check. Estopellan then directed workers to Navarro, who provided the day-to-day instruction and supervision. The framing crew received safety training and t-shirts from GFC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b66 Reyes, the injured worker, met Navarro and Estopellan in September 2015 when he arrived on a construction site looking for work. Reyes immediately began to work with the two men, first as an assistant, and then as a framer, at various locations. Over the next few months, Navarro told Reyes when and where to work and paid him weekly via cash or personal check. However, Navarro received a written budget and instructions from Estopellan, who would visit the jobsites in a YB truck, deliver tools and materials, and supervise the work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b67 On December 21, 2015, Reyes injured his hip and wrist after falling from a ladder while working at Lot 31. Navarro notified Estopellan, as he did with all issues that arose at a jobsite. Estopellan then reported the injury to MC, as MC had requested, and directed Reyes to the specific clinic MC preferred. Ultimately, YB inspected and approved the framing on Lot 31 but never paid Estopellan directly for any work on that project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b68 Reyes reported his injury to the ICA, which resulted in consolidated claims against five potential employers - Navarro, Estopellan, MC, GFC, and YB - and their insurers, all of whom denied liability for the claim. Because neither Navarro nor Estopellan had workers' compensation insurance, the Fund was also joined in the action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. Rev. Stat. (A.R.S.) \u00a7\u00a7 23-907,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   -1065 (governing the creation of and expenditures from a special fund to compensate employees whose employers fail to secure required workers' compensation insurance).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b69 After a three-day hearing, the ICA issued a consolidated decision in which the ALJ found Estopellan had employed both Navarro and Reyes to work on Lot 31 and MC maintained control over the project. Therefore, the ALJ concluded that Estopellan was Reyes's direct employer, MC was Reyes's statutory employer, and both were responsible for payment of Reyes's workers' compensation claim. The ALJ made no findings regarding GFC's or YB's status or liability. The ICA decision was affirmed upon review. MC and the Fund separately petitioned for special action review of the ICA's award and decision upon review, and the cases were consolidated for our review. We have jurisdiction pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-120.21(A)(2), 23-951(A), and Arizona Rule of Procedure for Special Actions 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Estopellan Was Reyes's Employer.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b610 The Fund argues Estopellan was not an employer subject to the Workers' Compensation Act as defined in A.R.S. \u00a7 23-902(A). We will not disturb the ALJ's factual findings unless clearly erroneous and will affirm so long as the findings were properly made and support the award.
