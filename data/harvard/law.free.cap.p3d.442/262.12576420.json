We affirm the conviction, but remand to strike two financial obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 This case has its genesis in a vehicle chase that began after Deputy Sheriff Spencer Rassier observed a speeding Mercury Cougar on Farr Road in Spokane Valley. He attempted to stop the vehicle, but the driver of the Cougar refused to stop and sped away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During a U-turn, Rassier was able to see and identify the driver as Mr. Schilling. The fleeing vehicle ultimately reached speeds of 80 to 100 m.p.h. in a 35 m.p.h. zone. Officer Rassier eventually called off the pursuit when it neared a hospital because Schilling was driving \"recklessly.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 Shortly thereafter, a deputy sheriff, Randy Watts, observed the vehicle crash while crossing train tracks. The vehicle suffered significant front end damage. The driver was not in sight, so Watts waited for Deputy Tyler Kullman and his dog, Kahn, to arrive. Kahn tracked from the open driver's door and soon located Mr. Schilling on a ridgeline of a nearby hill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Deputy Kullman, when asked at trial, explained how the dogs track humans:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Our dogs are trained to find human odor, especially when someone is running from us or trying to hide, they produce what we call a fear scent. They can't not produce it. Your armpits start sweating, all this stuff starts happening, your adrenaline's going, and a seasoned dog like Kahn, they pick up on that fear scent really quickly along with just the human scent they're trained from day one to track.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Report of Proceedings (RP) at 61. His testimony also explained how a person's scent, made up of the skin cells humans constantly shed, mixes with that of the newly disturbed ground to produce a unique, fresh scent for the dog. RP at 57-59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b65 Mr. Schilling testified that he was a passenger in the car who urged the driver, an unnamed friend, to stop driving dangerously while fleeing the police. He had to exit out the driver's door because the passenger door was damaged. He fled because he knew there was a warrant for his arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 The jury found Mr. Schilling guilty. After the trial court imposed a standard range sentence, he timely appealed to this court. A panel heard oral argument of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b67 This appeal presents a vagueness challenge to the eluding statute, alleges that two of the deputies provided improper opinion testimony, and contests two of the financial assessments of the judgment and sentence. We address the three claims in the stated order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Eluding Statute\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b68 Mr. Schilling initially argues that the \"driving in a reckless manner\" element of the eluding statute is unconstitutionally vague in light of\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.
