The State requested forfeiture of the cash bail. The trial court reserved ruling on the request. Eventually, Mr. Jeglum pleaded guilty and was sentenced. More than one year later, the trial court denied the State's request. In denying the State's request, the trial court construed existing law as preventing forfeiture of cash bail once an accused reappears in court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b62 The question before us is whether the trial court abused its discretion by misconstruing existing law. We conclude it did. We\n   hold that if an accused has violated a condition of cash bail, a trial court has discretion to forfeit cash bail even after the accused reappears in court and even after entry of the judgment and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b63 We reverse and remand this matter to the trial court for it to exercise its discretion to determine whether to forfeit Mr. Jeglum's cash bail and, if so, the appropriate amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b64 On February 10, 2015, the State charged Edward Jeglum with felony stalking and two misdemeanor counts of violation of a no-contact order. The trial court set bail at $ 100,000. Mr. Jeglum posted $ 100,000 cash bail and was warned that failure to appear in court would result in the immediate forfeiture of the bail money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b65 On August 31, the trial court signed an order modifying Mr. Jeglum's release conditions to allow him to travel to Arizona in November to attend scheduled medical appointments. The order provided that further requests for out-of-state travel would require prior court approval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b66 On November 30, Mr. Jeglum appeared in court and the court reset his trial readiness hearing to January 20, 2016, and his trial date to February 9, 2016. Mr. Jeglum failed to appear for his January readiness hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b67 On February 17, 2016, the trial court held a hearing to discuss Mr. Jeglum's absence. At the hearing, defense counsel submitted a letter ostensibly signed by a nurse practitioner and a physician stating that Mr. Jeglum was currently residing in a licensed assisted living home and that travel was not recommended. Defense counsel told the court he had been in contact with the doctor, and the doctor was Mr. Jeglum's primary care physician.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b68 Later, when the State called the telephone number on the letter, the State learned that the number was for a storage unit company. The State requested a warrant and bail forfeiture. The trial court reserved ruling on the State's requests and scheduled a hearing for March 3, for Mr. Jeglum to provide more specific information. The trial court ordered that Mr. Jeglum's doctor be available by telephone to testify at the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b69 Mr. Jeglum sent a facsimile to the court an hour before the March hearing. Mr. Jeglum confirmed his knowledge of the hearing, but asserted that the doctor who had earlier signed the letter was not his doctor, the doctor had never spoken to him or examined him, and he did not consent to releasing any patient healthcare information. The facsimile made it clear that Mr. Jeglum had committed a fraud on the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b610 The trial court granted the State's request for a warrant, but again reserved ruling on the State's request for bail forfeiture. A bail bondsman for Mr. Jeglum's other pending felony matters flew to Arizona, took Mr. Jeglum into custody, and surrendered him to the Chelan County jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b611 On March 14, the State once again requested bail forfeiture. The trial court reserved ruling on the State's request, but substantially increased bail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b612 Mr. Jeglum soon after pleaded guilty and the parties recommended one month in jail. The trial court refused to accept the recommendation and sentenced Mr. Jeglum to nine months in jail. The court explained, \"Frankly, Mr. Jeglum, I feel like you have made a mockery of the legal system. You have dragged out these legal proceedings beyond a point that I would have thought would have been possible.\" Report of Proceedings (3/3/16, 3/14/16, 3/22/16, 1/18/18) (RP) at 57. Once again the court reserved ruling on the State's bail forfeiture request. It directed defense counsel to set a hearing so it could hear from both parties and consider costs incurred by the bondsman in retrieving Mr. Jeglum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b613 Before the trial court could hear the forfeiture request, Mr. Jeglum filed a declaration of candidacy against the judge. The judge disqualified herself from Mr. Jeglum's case. The State eventually succeeded in removing Mr. Jeglum from the ballot on the basis that he failed to meet the legal requirements to serve as a judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b614 In January 2018, a successor judge heard arguments on the State's bail forfeiture request. The court ordered the cash bail to be returned to Mr. Jeglum, citing\n   <em>\n    State v. Paul\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   as the controlling case. The court reasoned,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   So I think the Court has the discretion to forfeit all or a portion of that cash bail at any time, after [a defendant] fails to appear, but before he shows back up, and has the case resolved.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Once he's shown up-and in this case, he did, eventually-and was sentenced-irregardless of why he showed up, he was here-then I don't believe this Court has any discretion, but must refund the bail money to the defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   ... I don't think I have discretion, at this point. I did, up until the time he appeared in court. But, once he appeared, I don't believe the Court has any-any discretion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   RP at 74, 81. The trial court stayed the order 30 days to permit the State to appeal, which it did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b615 The State argues the trial court had discretion to forfeit the cash bail and asks this court to remand with instructions for the trial court to exercise its discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b616 The decision whether to forfeit bail is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The trial court reserved ruling on the State's multiple requests mostly because it wished to give Mr. Jeglum an opportunity to rebut the State's factual and legal arguments. Were we to conclude that these multiple delays for Mr. Jeglum's benefit somehow deprived the trial court of its authority to forfeit cash bail, our conclusion would inequitably benefit a wrongdoer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b625 We conclude that the trial court had authority to forfeit Mr. Jeglum's cash bail even after he reappeared in court and even after entry of the judgment and sentence. The trial court misconstrued\n   <em>\n    Paul\n   </em>\n   and, in so doing, abused its discretion. We remand this matter to the trial court for it to exercise its discretion to determine whether to forfeit Mr. Jeglum's cash bail and, if so, the appropriate amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b626 Reversed and remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   WE CONCUR:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Siddoway, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Pennell, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"255015\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/95/775/\">\n     95 Wash.
