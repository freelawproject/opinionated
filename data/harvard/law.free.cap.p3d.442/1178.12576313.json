(Seller) sued Bloom Master LLC (Buyer) for breach of contract and unjust enrichment, claiming that Buyer underpaid on a promissory note. The district court granted summary judgment to Buyer based on a provision of the parties' contract purportedly allowing Buyer to make reduced payments. Seller appeals. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 Seller manufactured a garden planter product that it sold to garden stores and other consumers. After manufacturing and selling the product for some time, Seller decided to sell the manufacturing molds to Buyer, a local garden seed and supply company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 In August 2011, Buyer and Seller memorialized their transaction in an asset purchase agreement, by which Buyer purchased the planter molds and other assets for $500,000. At closing, Buyer paid Seller $100,000 in cash and financed the remaining $400,000 with a promissory note (the Note), which was attached to and made part of the purchase agreement. The Note provides that Buyer \"shall make eight (8) payments of interest and principal,\" beginning on August 15, 2012, \"and continuing on the 15th day of each August thereafter ... in accordance with the provision herein.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Note identifies August 15, 2019, as the loan maturity date, on which the entire unpaid principal\n   balance and accrued and unpaid interest are due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Immediately after setting forth the Note's repayment terms, section 3 of the Note provides for a modification of its terms in the event the planter product fails to generate \"expected sales numbers\" in any given year:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Inasmuch as this Note is being issued in connection with the Purchase Agreement and repayment is dependent upon the continued success of the [planter product], [Buyer] and [Seller] agree that this Note, the principal amount, rates of interest, maturity date and other terms and conditions will be reviewed on an annual basis by [Buyer] and [Seller] prior to each Payment Date. In the event the [planter product] failed to generate expected sales numbers in any given year, the terms of this Note shall be modified in proportion to the reduced sales numbers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 The Note does not define the term \"expected sales numbers.\" The only sales numbers referred to in the transaction documents are found in a disclosure schedule attached to the asset purchase agreement as part of Seller's representations and warranties regarding its customers and suppliers. In 2009, Seller's net sales totaled $355,314; in 2010, $283,261; and in 2011, $157,916.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 Beginning in August 2012, and continuing for the next three years, Buyer made payments to Seller under the Note. With each payment, Buyer disclosed to Seller how the payment was calculated. For each year, Buyer treated the 2010 net sales in the disclosure schedule as \"baseline sales\" and compared its actual net sales for the year to that figure to arrive at a percentage. Buyer then reduced what it referred to as a $50,000 \"annual payment\" by the same percentage. For example, in 2012, Buyer reported actual net sales of $199,325. This amounted to approximately 70% of Seller's reported net sales figure of $283,261 in 2010.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Buyer then multiplied $50,000 by the same percentage to arrive at $35,184-the amount Buyer paid on the Note in 2012. Buyer made similar calculations each year, and each year Seller accepted the payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 After four years of accepting Buyer's payments, Seller sent Buyer a written notice of default claiming Buyer had failed to pay the \"total amount due each year\" and demanding the full balance of the loan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Buyer relied on section 3 of the Note to justify the amounts tendered and to deny Seller's demand. Seller then sued Buyer for breach of contract and unjust enrichment, alleging that Buyer breached the contract by not making \"the full amount of the yearly payments due and owing.\" Both parties moved for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 In its motion, Seller argued that the Note requires Buyer to pay $50,000 annually and that Buyer breached its obligation by tendering less than that amount in 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015. Seller rejected Buyer's reliance on section 3, arguing that Buyer is not entitled to unilaterally modify the amount due each year because the Note requires all amendments to be in writing and signed by both parties. Seller also alternatively argued that section 3 is unenforceable because it is \"little more than an 'agreement to agree' \" on some future modification of the Note. Seller explained that because the term \"expected sales numbers\" is not defined in the Note and section 3 does not provide a formula for calculating reduced payments, it is impossible to know \"what this future modification is to be.\" Finally, it argued that, based on the Note's severability clause, section 3 should be severed from the Note, leaving Buyer obligated to pay the original amount due on the Note without any opportunity to modify its terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 For its part, Buyer argued that section 3 excuses it from making the payment Seller demanded and that the section is not unenforceable or severable. It reasoned that its annual payments were compliant without a written amendment to the Note because modification of the Note's terms is \"automatic[ ]\" under section 3 if the planter product fails to generate expected sales numbers, which could be found in the disclosure schedule identifying Seller's historical net sales. Buyer also asserted that the requirement for annual review under section 3 was satisfied because Seller had the opportunity to review Buyer's calculations accompanying its annual payments and Seller did not reject any payment or provide \"any alternative method of calculating\" Buyer's payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 The district court granted Buyer's motion and denied Seller's motion. The court concluded that section 3 is not \"an agreement to agree,\" because it makes plain that \"both the obligation to pay the Note and the amount to be paid was dependent upon the success of the\" planter product. It also concluded that Buyer did not breach the Note, because section 3 clearly allows for the annual payments to be \"reduced in proportion to sales.\" And while the court noted a \"possible ambiguity\" in the meaning of the term \"expected sales numbers,\" it looked to the disclosure schedule to determine that \"expected sales numbers\" means Seller's net sales in 2010.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on its interpretation of the Note, the court granted summary judgment to Buyer and dismissed Seller's claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment. Seller appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b611 Seller contends that the district court erred in denying its motion for summary judgment and in granting summary judgment in favor of Buyer. Specifically, Seller contends that the court erred in not deeming section 3, upon which Buyer relies to tender payment under the Note, unenforceable and severable from the Note as a matter of law. Summary judgment is appropriate when, viewing the facts and all reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, \"the moving party shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Utah R.

Breach of Contract\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b612 We must decide whether the district court correctly determined that Buyer was entitled to summary judgment and that Seller was not. Seller's argument in support of summary judgment in its favor proceeds in two parts: (A) section 3 is an unenforceable agreement to agree and (B) section 3 should be severed to allow enforcement of the balance of the Note.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree\n   with Seller that section 3 is an agreement to agree, and the district court accordingly erred in granting summary judgment to Buyer. But we conclude that Seller has not demonstrated that it is entitled to severance as a matter of law, and thus the district court did not err in denying Seller's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A.

The Note requires that Buyer make an annual payment toward the principal amount, but it does not identify how much Buyer must tender each year or provide a reliable mechanism for determining the amount. Instead, section 3 requires the parties to review \"th[e] Note, the principal amount, rates of interest, maturity date and other terms and conditions ... on an annual basis ... prior to each Payment Date\" and to modify the Note's terms \"in proportion to the reduced sales numbers\" should the planter product fail to generate expected sales. In other words, while the parties generally agreed that the terms would be modified under certain circumstances, the parties left the specifics to annual review and future agreement. And without a specific agreement, one is left to wonder, among other things, how terms like interest rates and maturity dates are to be modified in proportion to reduced sales numbers, whether the principal amount in its entirety is subject to a proportional modification, or how the amounts due in a given year are to be determined. At bottom, section 3 does not provide the tools or instructions for how to achieve the modification it requires, and it is therefore\n   an unenforceable agreement to agree.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11833258\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/955/357/#p362\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11833258\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/955/357/#p362\">\n    at 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b617 The district court reached the opposite conclusion, relying on the mandatory \"shall\" language in section 3.

While the parties here agreed in principle to modify terms, their failure to agree on the tools to achieve that modification renders the provision indefinite and unenforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b619 Buyer takes issue with that conclusion, arguing that section 3 is not an agreement to agree, because the annual payment amount can be automatically determined by comparing each year's sales to the 2010 net sales figure and reducing an annual payment of $50,000 in proportion to the reduced sales numbers. But that contention fails on its own terms. Buyer's argument that modification occurs automatically under section 3 is belied by the requirement for an annual review. If modification were truly automatic, there would be no need to review the Note's terms annually. Further, the terms subject to review under section 3 are not easily modified by the simple application of a mathematical equation. Section 3 states without exclusion that the \"terms of this Note shall be modified in proportion to the reduced sales numbers,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   and specifically identifies terms like interest rates, maturity date, and the principal amount as those terms subject to annual review. Thus, even assuming $50,000 represents the annual payment amount, and that the parties' expectations for future sales could be discerned,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   how the \"modified in proportion\" language is to be applied to the Note's other terms remains unclear.

In Seller's view, section 3 is \"unenforceable as a matter of law,\" and \"the district court should have severed the unenforceable language\" pursuant to the Note's severability clause.

The district court did not reach the severability question, having rejected Seller's argument regarding the provision's unenforceability. Seller argues that we can decide as a matter of law whether section 3 is severable and award it judgment on its breach of contract claim. But Seller has only addressed, both below and on appeal, the first element of severance, that is, whether Buyer and Seller intended severance.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10319851\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/924/357/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Seller has never attempted to demonstrate the second element, that is, whether \"the primary purpose [of the Note] could still be accomplished\" if section 3 is severed.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10319851\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/924/357/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, Seller has not shown that it was entitled to severance as a matter of law, and the district court did not err in denying Seller's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   II.

In moving for summary judgment, Buyer argued that it was entitled to summary judgment on Seller's unjust enrichment claim because \"there is a binding, enforceable contract that governs the relationship between the parties.\" In granting Buyer's summary judgment motion in its entirety, the district court did not separately address the unjust enrichment claim but presumably determined it was superfluous given its conclusion that the parties' express agreement was enforceable. Because the two claims and their disposition by the district court are intertwined, we reverse the court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Buyer on the unjust enrichment claim without opining on its merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b624 We conclude that Buyer was not entitled to summary judgment on Seller's breach\n   of contract claim because section 3, which Buyer relied on to submit payments less than $50,000, is an unenforceable agreement to agree. We also conclude that Seller was not entitled to summary judgment because although section 3 is unenforceable, Seller did not show that section 3 is necessarily severable.
