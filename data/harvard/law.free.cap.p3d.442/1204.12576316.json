At trial, after the jury had been empaneled, Steele moved to dismiss the case, claiming that the State's failure to preserve a recording of a 911 call made at the time of the accident (the 911 recording) violated her due process rights. The district court denied the motion, concluding that\n   Steele did not establish that she was prejudiced by the destruction of the 911 recording. Steele was ultimately convicted by a jury and now appeals, challenging the denial of her motion to dismiss. We conclude Steele has not made the necessary threshold showing of a reasonable probability that the 911 recording contained exculpatory evidence. Accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 At around 9:00 p.m. on the night of the accident, a woman (the eyewitness) was about to enter her apartment building when she heard a vehicle crash into a parked car. The eyewitness walked toward the SUV that caused the crash and asked if anyone needed medical assistance. The driver, a woman, got partway out of the SUV to inspect the damage, allowing the eyewitness to see the driver \"from her waist up.\" The driver \"demanded\" the eyewitness help her separate the vehicles. The eyewitness refused. The eyewitness asked again if anyone needed medical assistance, but the driver merely repeated her demand for help separating the vehicles. The eyewitness ignored the request and called 911.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 While the eyewitness called 911, the SUV's three passengers-a man, a woman, and a child-got out and walked away from the scene. The eyewitness was certain that at least one of the passengers exited from the passenger side of the SUV, but she was not certain if all passengers had exited from that side. The driver stayed behind and attempted to start the SUV and separate the vehicles by herself. When her attempts failed, the driver walked away in the same direction as the passengers who had already left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 While the eyewitness was on the phone with 911 dispatch, she kept an eye on the SUV and all of its occupants. Within five minutes of the 911 call, an officer arrived at the scene. The eyewitness told the responding officer that the driver of the SUV was a Native American woman, was wearing a black-and-white-striped shirt, appeared intoxicated, and left on foot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 The responding officer and his police dog have special training in tracking people fleeing on foot. After the officer had his dog smell around the SUV and inside the driver's side of the passenger compartment, the dog tracked the scent and led the officer to a woman who was wearing a black-and-white-striped shirt and otherwise matched the eyewitness's description. The woman identified herself as Loretta Steele.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 The officer walked Steele back to the scene of the accident and noticed she \"[had] a hard time walking,\" her speech was \"slurred,\" and she had \"glassy, glazed eyes.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Still at the scene, the eyewitness confirmed to the officer that Steele was the driver of the SUV. During the search incident to the arrest, the officer found the keys to the SUV in Steele's possession. The passengers were not located.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 The State charged Steele with driving under the influence and leaving the scene of an accident involving property damage. Almost two years later, the case went to a jury trial. After the jury had been empaneled, defense counsel moved to dismiss the case based on an alleged due process violation that resulted from the State's failure to preserve the 911 recording of the eyewitness's call to dispatch. Defense counsel explained that she had discovered only the week before that the 911 recording requested during discovery had yet to be disclosed. Two days before trial, she was informed that the recording was destroyed in accordance with the standard one-year record retention policy for recordings of 911 calls. The day before trial, the State sent defense counsel a computer-aided dispatch report (the report) made by the dispatcher who answered the eyewitness's call. In the report, there was no description of the SUV's occupants, other than noting the gender of the adults and the presence of a child. The report also provided the time the eyewitness called dispatch and the time the responding officer arrived on the scene, which was within five minutes of the call being placed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 Given the destruction of the recording, the State and defense counsel agreed not to question the eyewitness about what she told\n   dispatch when she called 911. The parties had informed the district court of the stipulation before jury selection, and the court had already entered an order in limine excluding that evidence. In making her oral motion to dismiss after the jury was empaneled, defense counsel explained that she was experiencing \"angst about [her] stipulation.\" On reconsideration, she believed dismissal was a more appropriate remedy and wished to withdraw the stipulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 Defense counsel asserted that the 911 recording was exculpatory because it \"allegedly contained a description of the driver ... [and we] don't know if that description actually conformed with [Steele's appearance] or not.\" Defense counsel argued that, under\n   <em>\n    State v. Tiedemann\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8357032\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/162/1106/\">\n    2007 UT 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8357032\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/162/1106/\">\n    162 P.3d 1106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , there was a reasonable likelihood that the 911 recording contained exculpatory evidence; that the State was culpable in failing to preserve it; and that, without it, Steele could not present her defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 The court denied Steele's request to withdraw the stipulation. In light of the arguments presented, the report, and the parties' stipulation to avoid asking the eyewitness about the details she might or might not have provided to dispatch, the district court denied Steele's motion to dismiss, focusing largely on the lack of prejudice. It explained that \"if [the eyewitness] gave a description to the [911] operator, and we don't know if she did or not, ... the officer shows up just a matter of minutes later and she gives a description again. It would seem ... to be unlikely that a different description is given.\" The court also explained that the eyewitness, who would testify at trial, gave the officer a description of what she saw and there \"appear[ed] to be no reason why that eyewitness ... would say something different to a [911] dispatcher one minute and a few minutes later would say something different to a police officer.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b611 At trial, defense counsel's opening statement suggested to the jury that the other female occupant of the SUV was actually the driver, not Steele. As trial progressed, defense counsel developed this theory. She first attempted to discredit the eyewitness's identification of Steele on cross-examination by asking the eyewitness numerous times to provide descriptions of the other SUV passengers, but the eyewitness could not provide anything other than their race, gender, and that there was a child present. Defense counsel further sought to discredit the eyewitness's identification of Steele by providing testimony from an eyewitness identification expert. The expert testified to the stages of memory; how memory can be affected by distractions, stressors, and the suggestibility of \"show ups\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; and the phenomenon of \"change blindness.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the jury rejected the defense's theory and convicted Steele of both charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b612 Steele appeals the denial of her motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   ISSUE AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b613 Steele contends the district court erroneously denied her motion to dismiss, arguing that her right to a fair trial was violated because the State destroyed exculpatory evidence.

But \"a defendant cannot rest on the claim that the evidence could have undermined confidence in a witness's testimony in some possible way, but must instead make some proffer as to what testimony would have been contradicted and how such a contradiction would have aided the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. \"Although the showing required of defendants is low, there must be something more than speculation about how the evidence could conceivably be exculpatory,\" and the defendant offered only \"speculation about potential impeachment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b625 Like the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Mohamud\n   </em>\n   , Steele has not satisfied the threshold requirement under\n   <em>\n    Tiedemann\n   </em>\n   of showing a reasonable probability that the 911 recording would have contained exculpatory evidence. Steele did not provide any evidence that the eyewitness gave a description of the driver to dispatch when she called 911, much less that the description would contradict the eyewitness's testimony. Instead, she claims only that the 911 recording \"very well may include\" details about the other female passenger. The only evidence to support this assertion was the officer's statement that dispatch usually asks callers for a description of the suspects. Just as in\n   <em>\n    Mohamud\n   </em>\n   , where the investigator explained that cameras at the facility \"generally record and are on\" but could not say whether \"those cameras were actually recording that day\" or whether they would have recorded the incident,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12339784\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/395/133/\">\n    2017 UT 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12339784\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/395/133/\">\n    395 P.3d 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified), whether the eyewitness gave dispatch a description of the driver in this case is purely speculative. Indeed, the only evidence as to what occurred during this particular call suggests that no such description was given. The dispatch notes contained no description of the SUV's occupants other than the gender of the adults and the presence of a child. Moreover, at trial, the officer never testified that he was given a description of the SUV's occupants from dispatch; he recounted only the description of the driver he received from the eyewitness when he arrived on scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b626 Significantly, in arguing her motion to dismiss, Steele never asked to present any evidence outside the presence of the jury as to whether the eyewitness gave a description to dispatch that would have been captured on the recording.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Unlike the defendant in\n   <em>\n    DeJesus\n   </em>\n   , who elicited testimony from eyewitnesses about what the video recording would show,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12339755\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/395/111/\">\n    2017 UT 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 45,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12339755\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/395/111/\">\n    395 P.3d 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Steele never asked to present testimony from the eyewitness or other witnesses who could have testified as to what description, if any, the eyewitness gave to dispatch during the 911 call.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor did Steele offer her own testimony\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   or that of the other occupants of the SUV to support the idea that the eyewitness might have confused her with the other female occupant, such as evidence that their clothing was similar or that Steele switched places with the driver after the eyewitness called 911. Thus, even if we were to assume that the eyewitness described the driver to dispatch, we must further assume that the description given to dispatch was inconsistent with the eyewitness's testimony at trial in order to conclude that there is a reasonable\n   probability that the recording was exculpatory. There is no actual evidence in this case to support either assumption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b627 We note that any lost or destroyed evidence-including the evidence here-has the potential to contain exculpatory evidence.
