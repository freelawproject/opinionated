Instead of stopping, Mr. Connors sped away to an apartment complex. He then abandoned the stolen car and fled on foot until he was apprehended by the pursuing officer. The officer described his own attire at the time of the incident as including\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   a black external vest carrier, so it actually goes over normal clothes, has all my normal duty gear, I just carry it on a vest in front of me instead of on a belt. It has a Spokane Police badge on the front; it's a patch. And then it has clear block reflective letters across the back that say police. Then I wear a drop-down style holster and it has a shiny silver Spokane Police badge on the front of my leg.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Report of Proceedings (RP) (Nov. 13, 2017) at 86.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 Mr. Connors was charged with, and convicted of, attempting to elude a police vehicle and possession of a stolen motor vehicle.

The pertinent language of the eluding statute is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Any driver of a motor vehicle who willfully fails or refuses to immediately bring his or her vehicle to a stop and who drives his or her vehicle in a reckless manner while attempting to elude a pursuing police vehicle, after being given a visual or audible signal to bring the vehicle to a stop, shall be guilty of a class C felony. The signal given by the police officer may be by hand, voice, emergency light or siren. The officer giving such a signal\n   <em>\n    shall be in uniform\n   </em>\n   and the vehicle shall be equipped with lights and sirens.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   RCW 46.61.024(1) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b65 Mr. Connors argues the State's evidence was insufficient to meet this standard because the officer who signaled Mr. Connors to stop was predominantly dressed in \"normal clothes,\" accompanied by a police vest and badges. Br. of Appellant at 1, 4; RP (Nov. 13, 2017) at 86. The merits of Mr. Connors's argument turns not on the nature of the State's proof (the facts are uncontested), but on the meaning of the word \"uniform.\" This is a matter of statutory interpretation, which we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    Dep't of Ecology v.

A \"uniform\" is defined as a \"dress of a distinctive design or fashion adopted by or prescribed for members of a particular group ... and serving as a means of identification,\" and \"a garment or outfit of a widely copied style or prescribed design.\" WEBSTER'S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 2498 (1993). In the context of the eluding statute, this definition appears to contemplate that the signaling or pursuing officer is wearing department-issued clothing that clearly communicates the officer's official status to members of the general public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b68 The clothing described during Mr. Connors's trial readily meets the ordinary definition of a \"uniform.\" The vest worn by the officer was specific to the Spokane Police Department. It served to notify the public that the officer was an official member of the police department. The fact that the officer wore \"normal clothes\" under his police vest does not mean he was not wearing a uniform. Some uniforms are comprehensive from head to toe. Others are not.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    People v. Estrella\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1125778\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/31/716/#p724\">\n    31 Cal. App. 4th 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 724,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20383\">\n    37 Cal. Rptr. 2d 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995) (marked police vest constituted distinctive police uniform). The eluding statute makes no preference. So long as an officer deploying the signal to stop is attired in a distinctive garment that clearly identifies him as a member of law enforcement, the statutory requirement of a \"uniform\" is met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b69 The judgment of conviction is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   WE CONCUR:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Siddoway, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Fearing, J.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
