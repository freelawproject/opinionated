The letter stated it had recently come to Toyota's attention that the Monroney label\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   on the vehicle he purchased might have indicated that an outside temperature gauge was included in the vehicle's rearview mirror. As the letter disclosed, that feature was not available on any 2014 model Tacoma. The letter apologized for the mistake and any confusion it might have caused. It offered to compensate Mr. Young with a cash reimbursement of $ 100.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b63 In January 2014, Mr. Young communicated with a customer service representative for Toyota named Jeffrey Moore, expressing his dissatisfaction with the reimbursement offer. By the end of January, Mr. Moore had offered to install a rearview mirror with an outside temperature gauge as an aftermarket part, but because it would not be factory-installed,\n   the three-year 36,000 mile warranty on many of the truck's other parts would not apply. Still dissatisfied, Mr. Young contacted an attorney, after which Toyota offered to pay him $ 500 to resolve his complaints. He declined the offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b64 Arbitration proceedings with Toyota led to an award of a buyback by Toyota for over $ 27,000. Mr. Young rejected the buyback because he thought he could sell the truck for more. He was right; he eventually sold the truck for $ 30,500.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b65 In May 2015, Mr. Young filed the lawsuit below. He sought to pursue it as a class action and asserted claims of common law fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and for violation of the CPA. The trial court denied class certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b66 Toyota moved for summary judgment on all of Mr. Young's claims; he responded with a cross motion for summary judgment on his CPA claim. In ruling on the motions, the trial court dismissed the fraud claim but declined to grant either party's motions on the negligent misrepresentation and CPA claims, which proceeded to a bench trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Trial\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b67 At the bench trial, Mr. Young testified that the outdoor temperature gauge was an important feature to him and he was misled into believing it would be included in the limited package by a Monroney label and by the \"Build-a-Tacoma\" feature on Toyota's website. The \"Build-a-Tacoma\" feature enables a consumer to select the features of the truck he or she is interested in purchasing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b68 In the defense case, Toyota called as a witness its distribution pricing administrator, who testified that in early September 2013, an audit of the Monroney label for the 2014 model Tacoma with the limited package revealed that it erroneously identified the truck's rearview mirror as including an outside temperature gauge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The 2013 model Tacoma had included such a temperature gauge, but it had been removed from the limited package for the 2014 model. Toyota presented evidence that in pricing the 2014 limited package the cost of that feature was removed, so purchasers of the limited package never paid for it. It also presented evidence that the cost of the feature was $ 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b69 The pricing administrator testified that the date on which Toyota first started wholesaling 2014 model Tacomas to dealers was September 4, 2013, so catching the error in the early September audit enabled it to substitute correct labels on most of the 2014 limited package models before they were shipped to dealers. In mid-October 2013, however, Toyota employees realized there might be vehicles in the field that had been shipped with incorrect Monroney labels. The pricing administrator testified that on October 22, 2013, she notified field offices of the possibility of incorrect labels, and that corrected labels would be available to print at their field offices the next day. The e-mail directed the field office to send the corrected Monroney labels to dealers in their region.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b610 The general manager for Toyota's Customer Experience Center testified that she learned in late October 2013 that incorrect information about the temperature gauge had been entered into the \"Build-a-Tacoma\" program on Toyota's website. She testified that the \"Build-a-Tacoma\" website information was corrected in early November 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b611 Toyota presented evidence that a total of 59 2014 model Tacomas with the limited package were sold in the state of Washington, and only three were sold before Toyota realized there was a mistake with the Monroney label. Of the remaining 56 trucks, 41 were sold after January 30, 2014 (roughly three months after the mistake had been corrected) and 31 were sold after May 1, 2014 (roughly six months after the mistake had been corrected).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b612 Toyota's witnesses testified that letters like the one Mr. Young received in December 2013 were sent to 147 individuals that it identified as the only consumers who possibly purchased the limited package after seeing misleading information. There was no evidence\n   presented that anyone other than Mr. Young claimed to have been misled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b613 At the conclusion of the bench trial, the court took the matter under advisement, issuing a lengthy and detailed memorandum decision three months later. It found \"at least seven areas\" where it \"question[ed] Mr. Young's credibility.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 411. It concluded that Mr. Young had not proved either of his two remaining claims and directed Toyota's counsel to prepare formal findings and conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b614 The findings and conclusions thereafter presented and entered incorporated all of the factual findings articulated in the court's memorandum decision. They concluded that Mr. Young failed to carry his burden of proving multiple elements of both of his claims. Mr. Young appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b615 Following a bench trial, appellate review is limited to determining whether substantial evidence supports the trial court's findings of fact and, if so, whether the findings support the conclusions of law.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Shortly after\n   <em>\n    Hangman Ridge\n   </em>\n   was decided, the legislature declared that \"[a]ny violation of [chapter 46.70] is deemed to affect the public interest and constitutes a violation of chapter 19.86 RCW.\" LAWS OF 1986, ch. 241, \u00a7 23, codified at RCW 46.70.310. Demonstration of a violation of the chapter therefore satisfies the first two elements of a CPA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b628 Mr. Young relies specifically on RCW 46.70.180(1). It provides that it is unlawful to disseminate in any manner \"any statement or representation with regard to the sale, lease, or financing of a vehicle which is false, deceptive, or misleading,\" \"including\" a list of five actionable statements or misrepresentations, all of which deal with sale, lease, or financing terms. The trial court construed the language \"with regard to the sale, lease, or financing of a vehicle\" as language of limitation and concluded that Toyota's temperature gauge error was not a statement or representation dealing with sale, lease, or financing terms. Mr. Young argues that this construes the provision too narrowly.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b629 The language relied on by the court and the maxim of ejusdem generis as applied to the five nonexclusive examples provide support for the trial court's construction of RCW 46.70.180(1). But we need not construe the statute because we hold that a materiality requirement inheres in the provision, just as it inheres in the CPA and in sections 5 and 12 of the FTC Act.

Thus, I would expect our state Supreme Court to follow the federal courts and add materiality to either the first element of a Consumer Protection Act action or add a sixth element to the consumer's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b645 I question whether the courts should graft a constituent of materiality to the element of unfair or deceptive act or practice. The words \"unfair\" or \"deceptive\" do not necessarily connote important, relevant, or material statements or conduct. Some people cannot help themselves from repeatedly acting and speaking deceptively even when their conduct and speech lacks materiality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b646 As noted by the majority, in addition to showing a material unfair or deceptive act or practice to establish the first element of the Consumer Protection Act action, the claimant may fulfill the first element by showing per se unfair or deceptive conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    Hangman Ridge Training Stables, Inc. v. Safeco Title Insurance Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1199153\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/105/778/#p780\">\n    105 Wash.2d 778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 780,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=719%20P.2d%20531\">\n    719 P.2d 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986). The claimant may establish a per se act by proving a violation of a statutory scheme declared by the legislature to affect the public interest.\n   <em>\n    Hangman Ridge Training Stables, Inc. v. Safeco Title Insurance Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1199153\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/105/778/#p780\">\n    105 Wash.2d at 780\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=719%20P.2d%20531\">\n    719 P.2d 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . One such legislative enactment is the auto dealers practices act, chapter 46.70 RCW. RCW 46.70.310.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b647 RCW 46.70.180, a portion of the auto dealers practices act, reads in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   Each of the following acts or practices is unlawful:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   (1) To cause or permit to be advertised, printed, displayed, published, distributed, broadcasted, televised, or disseminated in any manner whatsoever, any statement or representation with regard to the sale, lease, or financing of a vehicle which is false, deceptive, or misleading, including but not limited to the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   (2)(a)(i) To incorporate within the terms of any purchase and sale or lease agreement any statement or representation with regard to the sale, lease, or financing of a vehicle which is false, deceptive, or misleading, including but not limited to terms that include as an added cost to the selling price or capitalized cost of a vehicle an amount for licensing or transfer of title of that vehicle which is not actually due to the state, unless such amount has in fact been paid by the dealer prior to such sale.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   None of the language in RCW 46.70.180 requires that a false statement by an auto dealer be material to be actionable. I compliment Toyota Motor Sales for its conduct after misrepresenting the presence of a temperature gauge on the rearview mirror. Nevertheless, I conclude that Toyota Motor Sales violated the statute and committed a per se violation of the Consumer Protection Act by placing the false statement in its Monroney label and its website.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b648 A lack of materiality will generally preclude recovery under the Consumer Protection Act because of the act's fourth and fifth elements of injury and causation. If the absence of materiality always prevents a finding of injury or causation, my concurrence lacks any practical importance. But then adding materiality as an element also serves no function.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b649 Although I cannot fathom any occasion, there may be an occasion or two when immateriality will not otherwise preclude fulfillment of causation and damages. Thus, I disagree with creating an aftermarket \"materiality\" accessory to the unfair or deceptive act or practice element. In Duane Young's appeal, I would affirm the trial court's dismissal of Young's Consumer Protection Act cause of action based on findings supported by substantial evidence that any misrepresentation and, in turn, any unfair or deceptive act or practice by Toyota Motor Sales did not cause Young any damage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   I CONCUR:\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
