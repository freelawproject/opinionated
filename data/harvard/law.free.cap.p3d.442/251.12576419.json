Police soon arrived, and in the process of waking him up detected alcohol on his breath. Smith was later charged with driving under the influence (DUI), and moved to suppress all evidence discovered that night on the ground that he was unreasonably seized in violation of the United States Constitution. The district court denied that motion, determining that the seizure was justified by the community caretaking doctrine. Smith appeals that decision, and we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b62 In the wee hours of a cold December morning in 2016, several employees of a McDonald's restaurant in West Valley City, Utah noticed that a man-who was later identified as Smith-appeared to be asleep in his car, which was parked in the restaurant's parking lot with the motor running. The restaurant's shift manager (Manager) went out to the parking lot and attempted to wake Smith and tell him that he needed to leave, but Smith did not respond to verbal entreaties. Manager then knocked on the car's window and was finally able to rouse Smith and asked him to leave the premises. Smith then pulled out of the parking spot, drove around the building, and re-parked in the same parking lot. Manager then informed his co-manager that Smith had not left the premises as requested, and one of them notified the police.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b63 Police officers responded to the scene after receiving a dispatch call that a welfare check was needed at McDonald's. Specifically, the dispatch call notes mentioned that there was a \"male, slumped over the wheel, [who] appeared to be sleeping,\" and the first officer (First Officer) to arrive on the scene later testified that the dispatch call he received informed him that \"an individual ... was driving their car around the parking lot multiple times, and then had fallen asleep at the wheel in a parking stall.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   When First Officer arrived, he immediately located the vehicle in question, and noticed that \"the vehicle was on and running.\" Based on all of the information he had, First Officer made the decision to park behind Smith's vehicle in such a way that would have made it difficult for Smith to exit the parking stall, and waited for other officers before making contact. As he waited, First Officer observed that Smith was \"hunched over the center console,\" and that he was \"not awake.\" In addition, First Officer shined a spotlight on Smith's car to ascertain whether Smith was its only occupant. When the next officer (Second Officer) arrived on scene, he observed a parked car with its motor running in which a male occupant was slumped over the wheel, apparently asleep. Second Officer parked his patrol car alongside Smith's vehicle. Either First Officer or Second Officer was accompanied by a third officer; in total, three police officers were on scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b64 All three officers exited their vehicles, and approached Smith's vehicle. As they did so, they were wearing their typical police gear, but they never activated the emergency lights on their police vehicles, and there is no\n   indication in the record that any of the officers ever unholstered any weapon. The officers knocked on Smith's car window multiple times in an attempt to wake him. When Smith eventually awoke, the officers asked him to open his door, and he complied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b65 Once the door was opened, the officers \"smell[ed] the odor of alcohol on [Smith's] breath.\" Second Officer asked Smith to step out and perform field sobriety tests, and Smith complied. The results of the tests indicated that Smith was likely intoxicated. Second Officer also learned, upon checking Smith's driver license in a database, that Smith's license had been revoked. The officers arrested Smith and read him his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   rights, after which Smith admitted that he had consumed enough alcohol to make him believe that he was over the legal limit. The officers took Smith to the West Valley City police station where they administered a breathalyzer test, which indicated that Smith's blood-alcohol content was .135, well over the legal limit. Smith was later charged with driving under the influence of alcohol with prior convictions, a third-degree felony; operating a vehicle as an alcohol restricted driver, a class B misdemeanor; and driving on a suspended or revoked license, a class B misdemeanor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b66 Smith filed a motion to suppress his statements as well as the results of the field sobriety and breathalyzer tests, alleging that the evidence was obtained by virtue of an illegal seizure. Smith asserted that the facts did not justify the seizure, arguing that the officers did not have probable cause or reasonable suspicion to believe a crime had been committed. After an evidentiary hearing, the district court denied Smith's motion, ruling that, although the officers had indeed seized Smith, the seizure was justified under the community caretaking doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b67 Following the court's denial of his motion to suppress, Smith entered a conditional guilty plea\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   to the felony DUI charge, and the State agreed to dismiss the remaining counts. As part of his conditional plea, Smith retained his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress, which right Smith now exercises by challenging that decision on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   ISSUE AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b68 \"We review a [district] court's decision to grant or deny a motion to suppress for an alleged Fourth Amendment violation as a mixed question of law and fact.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   , the court articulated a two-part test to be applied in determining whether the community caretaking doctrine reasonably justifies a seizure. First, \"courts must ... evaluate the degree to which an officer intrudes upon a citizen's freedom of movement and privacy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.

In evaluating this second factor, courts should evaluate the seriousness of the \"perceived emergency,\" along with \"the likelihood that the motorist may need aid.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After evaluating these factors, \"[i]f the level of the State's interest in investigating whether a motorist needs aid justifies the degree to which an officer interferes with the motorist's freedoms in order to perform this investigation, the seizure is not 'unreasonable' under the Fourth Amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b613 In\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   , two law enforcement officers on patrol on a cold late-December evening noticed a car pulled over on the side of a rural highway with its hazard lights flashing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3. \"Because of the hazard lights, the cold weather, and the late hour, the deputies decided to stop and check on the welfare of any occupants of the vehicle.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   To this end, they turned their flashing lights on and pulled up behind the parked car, then exited their vehicle and approached the parked car on foot.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3-4. When the officers made contact with the occupant of the vehicle, they noticed that his eyes appeared bloodshot and that he was unable to tell them which direction he was going.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. Eventually, the officers obtained a warrant authorizing them to arrest the occupant and search his vehicle, and upon executing that search the officers found marijuana and drug paraphernalia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. After being charged with drug crimes, the occupant moved to suppress the evidence discovered in his vehicle, alleging the initial\n   actions of the officers constituted an unreasonable seizure, but the district court denied the motion, ruling that the stop was justified by the community caretaking doctrine.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. Our supreme court affirmed, concluding that both parts of the test weighed in favor of application of the doctrine.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. First, the court determined that the seizure was only minimally invasive, because the occupant \"was parked, rather than traveling down the highway, when he was seized,\" thereby \"lessening\" the officers' interference with his freedom of movement, and because the officers' \"show of authority ... was minimal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. Second, the court determined that, \"[b]ecause it was late December\" and \"dark and very cold,\" \"a reasonable officer would have cause to be concerned about the welfare of a motorist in [the occupant's] situation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b614 When we apply\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   's two-part test to the facts of this case, we conclude that the seizure of Smith in the McDonald's parking lot was justified by the community caretaking doctrine. First, the officers in this case were motivated by the same purposes as the officers in\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   -checking on the welfare of an occupant of a parked car on a cold night-and the officers carried out the welfare check in a similar and minimally invasive manner. Although the officers positioned their vehicle in such a way that Smith could not easily drive away, Smith was already parked and asleep in the driver's seat, and was not intending to go anywhere anytime soon.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27 (stating that the occupant \"was parked ... when he was seized, lessening ... the deputies' interference with his right to go about his business\"). In addition, the officers here-unlike those in\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   -did not activate their emergency lights, and-similar to those in\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   -did not draw their weapons. Finally, the initial seizure was brief, lasting only long enough for the officers to make sure that Smith did not pose a threat to himself or others.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Compare id.\n   </em>\n   (finding a seizure minimally invasive, given the purpose of the welfare check, because the occupant was parked, the officers' weapons were not drawn, and the seizure was only long enough for the officer to approach and ask whether the occupant needed aid),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In both\n   cases, officers were motivated by a concern for the safety of an occupant of a parked vehicle in the late hours of a cold December night, and in this case the officers were also motivated by a concern for the safety of members of the community. Indeed,\n   <em>\n    Cady\n   </em>\n   instructs us that the community caretaking doctrine may be motivated not just by a concern for the individual involved, but also for members of the community who might be in danger.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11341150\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/413/433/#p447\">\n    413 U.S. at 447-48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11341150\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/413/433/#p447\">\n    93 S.Ct. 2523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (applying the community caretaking doctrine where police officers conducted a warrantless search of the trunk of a parked car because they reasonably believed that the trunk contained a loaded gun that could endanger the public if it fell into the wrong hands). Here, the officers testified that they were concerned that the driver might have been \"unconscious or not breathing,\" or that, because the car was running, the driver might \"hit[ ] the gas\" and go \"backwards,\" thereby endangering others. Moreover, in this case, the officers were not acting of their own accord; they were responding to a 911 call from a concerned citizen. Officers in situations like this are entitled to rely on information received from citizens that is passed to them through a dispatch call.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

This contention, however, is not supported by the record. One of the officers specifically testified that \"dispatch had received a call from McDonald's employees that an individual ... was driving their car around the parking lot multiple times, and then had fallen asleep at the wheel in a parking stall.\" And First Officer testified that he observed that the car was running before parking behind Smith.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b617 Next, Smith asserts that the officers in this case acted with too much force, arguing that three officers and two squad cars was too strong a showing of police authority under the circumstances. While law enforcement may well have been able to handle this situation with one officer who parked alongside (rather than behind) Smith, we are not persuaded that the officers' show of force was so excessive here as to render the community caretaking doctrine inapplicable. The officers did not initiate their flashing lights, and did not draw their weapons; instead, they approached Smith's vehicle, knocked on the window, and asked to speak with him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b618 Finally, Smith asserts that the nature of the emergency in this case was not as acute as that presented in\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   .

That in itself, I think, supports the notion that community caretaking is not intended to be a broad, freewheeling exception to the Fourth Amendment. But the Supreme Court's treatment of related doctrines, notably the special needs exception to the warrant requirement, is also helpful in recognizing the community caretaking doctrine's limited application. Under the special needs exception, police may search or seize an individual without \"individualized suspicion,\" but the special needs must serve interests \" 'beyond the normal need for law enforcement.' \"\n   <em>\n    Chandler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651779\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/305/#p313\">\n    520 U.S. at 313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651779\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/305/#p313\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Skinner v.
