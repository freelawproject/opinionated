Dr. Rammell is a veterinarian, and he was hired by Mountainaire pursuant to an employment agreement dated November 14, 2016. The agreement was for a term of one year and provided as follows concerning termination:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   This agreement shall terminate immediately upon the occurrence of any of the following events:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   A.

Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, if Employer determines that continued employment of Employee is not desirable for any reason, such employment may be terminated, with or without cause, upon sixty (60) days prior written notice to Employee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [\u00b65] On April 19, 2017, Dr. Zancanella, in his capacity as Mountainaire's president, met with Dr. Rammell and terminated his employment. On July 5, 2017, Dr. Rammell filed a complaint against Mountainaire and against Dr. Zancanella and Vicky Zancanella in their individual capacities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complaint asserted claims for breach of express contract, breach of implied contract, tortious interference with contract, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of emotional distress. Mountainaire answered and counterclaimed for breach of the employment agreement's non-compete clause and for a $ 10,000 salary advance it had made to Dr. Rammell. It also applied for and was granted a preliminary injunction enjoining Dr. Rammell from directly or indirectly providing services that would compete with Mountainaire within a fifty-mile radius of the clinic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [\u00b66] On June 8, 2018, Mountainaire filed two summary judgment motions, one on its $ 10,000 claim for a salary advance refund, and the other against all of Dr. Rammell's claims. The district court granted Mountainaire summary judgment on all claims except a part of Dr. Rammell's breach of implied contract and his breach of express contract claims. Shortly thereafter, it granted Mountainaire's motion to reconsider the breach of implied contract ruling and entered summary judgment in its favor on that claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   That decision left only Dr. Rammell's breach of express contract claim for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b67] A few weeks before the August 27, 2018 trial, Mountainaire filed a motion for an order to show cause as to why Dr. Rammell's remaining claim should not be dismissed. In support of its claim for dismissal, Mountainaire alleged that Dr. Rammell flagrantly violated the court's preliminary injunction by offering veterinary services within a few miles of the Mountainaire clinic, that he provided false discovery answers regarding those services, and that he self-issued invalid trial subpoenas. Mountainaire subsequently supplemented the motion with allegations that Dr. Rammell gave false discovery answers concerning income he had earned since the termination of his employment with Mountainaire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [\u00b68] On August 15, 2018, the district court held an evidentiary hearing on Mountainaire's motion, and on August 20th, it issued its order ruling on the motion. The court found that Dr. Rammell had issued invalid subpoenas but that he had done so unintentionally, and it did not sanction him for that conduct. The court further found that Dr. Rammell had violated the preliminary injunction, but it concluded that the violation was not grounds for dismissal and otherwise ordered no sanction for it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [\u00b69] With respect to discovery responses concerning income he had earned since his dismissal from Mountainaire, the court found the responses ranged from \"evasive and misleading to outright false.\" For this discovery violation, the court dismissed Dr. Rammell's only remaining claim of breach of express contract. The court reasoned (footnote and citations omitted):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff's intent to fraudulently conceal this information can be inferred from the circumstances. There is a broad pattern of deceit. And given his obvious self-interest to enlarge his potential damages by concealing mitigation, the inference of deliberate deceit is hard to escape. At the hearing Defendant argued \"if he wanted to know if I personally was making money, he should have asked me that question. I mean, he could have easily put, are you - are you, Rex Rammell, receiving any money from veterinary income? And I would have said, yes. But that isn't what he asked.\" That is what Defendant asked. There is no meaningful, logical difference between that question and Defendant's discovery requests. In fact, Defendant asked the same thing five different ways so as to leave no room for exceptions, evasion or omission.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff's degree of culpability is high. Having seen Plaintiff testify and had an opportunity to evaluate his demeanor, the Court believes his true position is exemplified by his most confident and certain testimony that \"they were Wyoming Veterinary Center checks. I know it's a technicality, but it - LLCs are legal entities.\" His attempts to backpedal, such as his testimony that \"this all could have come out in the trial, too. I mean, I wasn't trying to hide anything\"-not that ambushing the opposing party at trial would excuse withholding evidence-were not credible. And his closing argument, \"And to be right honest with you, the Douglas thing, it was a little extra cash. I really didn't think about it\" was not supported by credible testimony. He had every opportunity to disclose this information. Instead he concocted a frivolous rationalization why disclosure was not required. Rather than assert his theory of non-discoverability, he deliberately concealed it, apparently confident he could justify himself if it were ever discovered. Since he concealed his withholding of this information, there was no opportunity to warn him that failure to comply with valid discovery requests would result in dismissal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   The degree of actual prejudice to Defendant is also high. On the eve of trial, Defendant fortuitously discovered Plaintiff has hidden evidence of mitigation of his damages, in violation of the Rules of Civil Procedure and three sets of discovery requests. Plaintiff's conduct created a substantial risk that if the jury verdict was in his favor, he would fraudulently recover greater damages than he was entitled to, misusing and interfering with the judicial process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Finally, no lesser sanction than dismissal will suffice. The judicial process depends on transparency. Compliance with discovery is an essential element of justice. Plaintiff willfully failed to comply with his obligations to produce the evidence of damages sought by Defendant's discovery requests and in bad faith concealed his failure to comply. A less severe sanction would not sufficiently remedy Plaintiff's abusive conduct, as there is no way to ascertain whether he has concealed other crucial evidence, casting doubt on the reliability of any verdict in his favor. And a less severe sanction will not sufficiently punish and deter Plaintiff's dishonest conduct. The Court finds the complaint should be dismissed and judgment entered against Plaintiff under Rule 37 and/or under the inherent power of the Court to sanction fraud on the court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   [\u00b610] Dr. Rammell thereafter filed a timely notice of appeal to this Court. His notice of appeal contained a certification of transcript request, which stated that \"[p]ursuant to W.R.A.P. 2.05(a) and 2.07(a)(4), Appellant, Rex Rammell[,] has ordered and made appropriate arrangements for payment of the transcript to be prepared in this matter.\" Handwritten next to that typed certification was the statement, \"No transcript.\" In keeping with the handwritten notation, Dr. Rammell did not procure any transcripts for his appeal. He likewise did not indicate whether he intended to submit a statement of evidence or agreed statement, as required by W.R.A.P. 2.05(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   [\u00b611] We will address first Mountainaire's argument that Dr. Rammell's failure to make a proper certification in compliance with W.R.A.P. 2.05 is a jurisdictional flaw that requires dismissal of his appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Jurisdiction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   [\u00b612] Mountainaire moved to dismiss Dr. Rammell's appeal, contending that he falsely certified that there were no transcripts from the proceedings below, and pointing out that his certification was otherwise not in compliance with W.R.A.P. 2.05. Mountainaire argued that Rule 2.05 is jurisdictional, and that the deficiencies in Dr. Rammell's certification therefore mandated dismissal of his appeal. We took Mountainaire's motion under advisement, and we now deny the motion. While we agree that the certification was deficient, we do not agree that Rule 2.05 is jurisdictional, and we decline to dismiss the appeal as a sanction for the deficiency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   [\u00b613] In response to Mountainaire's assertion that Dr. Rammell, through his handwritten \"No transcript\" note, falsely certified that there were no transcripts from the proceeding below, Dr. Rammell offered the following explanation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Appellant followed the example found on the W.R.A.P. page, but upon learning from the Clerk of District Court that transcript ordering was optional, Appellant made a notation that \"no transcript\" would be ordered, which was his prerogative, thereby making the certification null and void.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   [\u00b614] Although both Dr. Rammell's written alteration and his explanation are misguided and wrong as a matter of law, we will show him the leniency we have the discretion to afford\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   litigants and accept that he did not intentionally misstate the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zeitner v.

I have also worked very hard since 1983 to earn the confidence of the animal owners\n   who come to Mountainaire, and to treat our customers and their animals with courtesy, respect, and dignity. Because of Dr. Rammell's actions, the morale of Mountainaire's staff was seriously deteriorating. In my capacity as president of Mountainaire, I was concerned that Mountainaire would lose members of its staff who had been with us for many years. In addition, I was concerned that Mountainaire's customers would lose confidence in Mountainaire and in its ability to competently and courteously take care of their needs. ... By the morning of April 19, 2017, in my capacity as president of Mountainaire Animal Clinic, P.C., I had come to the conclusion that the best interests of Mountainaire required that Dr. Rammell's employment be terminated immediately.
