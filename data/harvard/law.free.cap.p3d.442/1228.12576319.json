Witnesses heard Graves-who hails from Puerto Rico-make the following exclamation as he fired his weapon: \"This is how we do it in Puerto Rico!\" The State charged Graves with (among other crimes) attempted murder. At the trial, the prosecutor asked several witnesses about Graves's exclamation and also made mention of it during closing argument. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury found Graves guilty. Although Graves did not object on racial or constitutional grounds to any of the State's questions and comments about Puerto Rico, and indeed brought up the subject himself on a number of occasions during trial, Graves now complains that the repeated references to Puerto Rico in a trial set in Emery County, Utah, imbued the proceeding with improper implications of racism and prevented him from receiving a fair trial. After reviewing the record in this case, including the entire trial transcript, we are unpersuaded by Graves's arguments, and therefore affirm his convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 On the afternoon of April 14, 2016, trouble was brewing in Ferron, Utah, as a string of profane text messages flew back and forth between and among four adult men: Graves, JH, ES and SO. The dispute appears to have originated from discussion of a woman (Girlfriend) who was at the time dating and living with Graves, but who had previously dated both JH and ES, and had also once lived in the same apartment as SO. As the texts were going back and forth, Graves, who had moved to Ferron just three months prior, was at ES's residence having a beer after work, and SO and JH were together at a different location. Graves and SO had never gotten along, though the reason for the bad blood between them is unclear from the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 As the text exchange escalated, someone using ES's phone wrote \"You want war[,] let's do war,\" to which JH replied, \"Ok me and [SO] is down .... Where at [a]nd when[?]\" A few minutes later, SO messaged ES that he was \"on [his way] to [ES's] place.\" SO then apparently called ES's phone, which Graves answered. Profanity-laced threats ensued from both men. At this point, JH and SO borrowed a car from a neighbor and drove to ES's place, bringing JH's minor brother (Brother) along \"for a witness.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 In front of ES's apartment, Graves and ES were sitting in ES's Ford Bronco smoking cigarettes and drinking beer, since ES did not like people to smoke in his apartment. When JH and SO pulled up to the apartment complex, Graves got out of the Bronco and fired three shots from a .22 caliber revolver (that belonged to ES) at least roughly in the direction of JH and SO as they exited the vehicle. The bullets did not hit anyone. Several witnesses would later\n   testify that, as he was firing, Graves rotated the gun sideways and yelled something to the effect of \"This is how we do it in Puerto Rico!\" Graves denied making any such statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 When the shooting started, JH moved in front of Brother, who had stayed in the car and ducked below the window. SO took cover behind the car, but began taunting Graves with insults and racial slurs. Graves continued to point the gun at SO until ES approached Graves and took the gun from him. ES then took the gun into his apartment and hid it under a pillow on his couch. Once Graves was disarmed, SO ran up to him and started to pummel him with his fists, continuing to punch him even after he felt Graves go limp. At some point, JH joined the fray and held Graves against a wall as SO continued to beat him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 The scuffle was eventually interrupted by an off-duty highway patrol trooper (Trooper), who happened to live down the street and responded after hearing the sound of gunfire in his neighborhood and observing a man pointing what looked like a gun. After calling the matter in to dispatch, Trooper drove his unmarked police vehicle to the apartment complex, drew his service weapon, and ordered all of the men to get on the ground. The men complied, and either JH or SO told Trooper that Graves had been shooting at them. Based on this information, Trooper used the single pair of cuffs in his possession to handcuff Graves. Trooper searched Graves, but found no gun and therefore ordered everyone on the scene to stay in place until backup arrived. At some point, ES explained that the gun was in his apartment. After additional law enforcement officers arrived at the scene, they confirmed that the gun was indeed where ES claimed it was, and secured his apartment until they procured a search warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 Graves, ES, JH, and SO were all arrested, taken into custody, and questioned independently that night. Brother also provided a statement to officers before leaving the scene. A detective (Detective) from the Emery County Sheriff's Office collected evidence from the scene, taking pictures of where it appeared that bullets had struck a nearby residence and the car that JH and SO had been driving. Detective examined the revolver recovered from ES's apartment and found that it contained three spent rounds and six unspent rounds. Detective also interviewed three additional witnesses, including one of ES's neighbors (Neighbor).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 The State charged Graves with two counts of attempted murder and two counts of felony discharge of a firearm, but after pretrial proceedings one of the attempted murder counts was changed to a charge of reckless endangerment. Graves eventually stood trial for one count of attempted murder, two counts of felony discharge of a firearm, and one count of reckless endangerment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9 At trial the prosecution called Trooper, ES, JH, Brother, SO, the officer (Officer) who transported ES to jail after the incident, Detective, and Neighbor. The State's case focused on the text messages exchanged on the day of the shooting as well as on Graves's actions immediately before and during the shooting. In his opening statement, the prosecutor described the shooting as well as Graves's alleged statement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   At that point, there hadn't been any words exchanged between them, but one thing that had been said that [ES] will tell you is that when the defendant got out of the Bronco, he said, \"I'll show you how we do things in Puerto Rico.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The defendant is from Puerto Rico. He had pulled his gun out, he held it an angle-not straight up but at an angle-and fired at least the first shot that way. We don't know exactly where those shots went, in what order. We know there were a total of three shots that were fired out of that .22.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 10 During trial, the prosecution asked ES, JH, and SO-but not Brother, Neighbor, or Trooper-whether they had heard Graves say anything about Puerto Rico.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   JH and SO\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   both testified that Graves shouted something to the effect of \"this is how we do it in Puerto Rico\" or \"that's how they do [it] in Puerto Rico.\" However, ES testified that he never heard Graves say anything about Puerto Rico that night. The prosecution pressed ES on this point, and after ES testified, called Officer to the stand, who testified that ES had told her, as she transported him to jail on the night of the incident, that Graves said something to the effect of \"I'll show you how we do it in Puerto Rico.\" At this point, defense counsel lodged a hearsay objection to the admission of Officer's statement about what ES had told her while being transported to jail, but the trial court overruled the objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 11 The State drew out other details of the shooting during its case-in-chief. ES testified that Graves had obtained his gun surreptitiously, after asking to see the gun while they were in the apartment. Further, the State asked JH, Brother, and SO whether Graves held the gun sideways or upright during the shooting. These witnesses all testified that Graves held the gun sideways, or (in Brother's words) \"like how gangs ... do it.\" JH and SO testified that Graves pointed the gun directly at them as he shot and continued to aim the gun at SO afterward. Trooper and Neighbor both testified that they saw Graves pointing the gun at SO, though neither saw the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 12 ES, JH, and SO also testified about the ongoing dispute between SO and Graves. ES and JH testified that the dispute was driven by SO, and began after Girlfriend evicted SO from her apartment and started a relationship with Graves. They further testified that SO had made several public threats to Graves, sometimes threatening to kill Graves and his family, though no one appears to have taken these threats seriously. For his part, SO testified that he never threatened Graves and that Graves had started the quarrel between them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 13 The State also called Detective, who testified that it appeared to him that a bullet had struck the vehicle driven by JH, although the bullet had not penetrated the vehicle. Though Detective was, by his own admission, \"by no means an expert,\" he testified that it appeared to him that the mark was made by a small caliber bullet, such as a .22. Detective also testified that he observed what appeared to be a fresh bullet hole in a house across the street from the apartment complex, again consistent with a .22 caliber bullet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 14 During the defense's case, Graves testified in his own defense, and disputed several parts of the State's version of events. Graves testified that ES handed him the gun as JH and SO arrived; that he fired into the air twice and into the ground once and that he never intended to actually hit anyone; that he fired the gun in self-defense; that he never made a statement about Puerto Rico on the night of the shooting; that he held the gun \"straight\" and not sideways; and that he had never shot a gun prior to that night. The defense also obtained the court's permission to have Graves's mother testify telephonically from Puerto Rico. At the outset of her testimony, defense counsel asked her where she was testifying from, and she answered that she was in Puerto Rico and that she had lived there for many years. She also testified that SO had once threatened her with a pistol when she was visiting Graves in Utah.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 15 During closing argument, the prosecutor argued that Graves could not claim self-defense because the whole altercation was combat by agreement, and Graves had \"brought a gun to a fistfight.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State also argued that Graves's alleged statement about Puerto Rico was probative of his intent to actually shoot JH and SO, and told the jury that \"[i]f you believe that he said, 'This is how we do it in Puerto Rico,' he cannot claim justification. He cannot claim ... anything but a consensual altercation there.\" Further,\n   the prosecutor told the jurors that they should not take seriously any possible threats made by SO to Graves because \"[t]hat's the way these people talk,\" and that the standard was \"what would a reasonable person do under the circumstance, not the culture that these people live in.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its closing, the defense countered by pointing to the inconsistencies in the witnesses' testimony, the fact that no bullets had been recovered to conclusively link the bullet holes or marks to the gun Graves used, and the fact that Graves insisted he fired in the air because he was scared. The jury found Graves guilty on all four charges, and Graves now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 16 Graves presents two issues for our review. First, he argues that his constitutional rights to due process and equal protection were violated at trial due to racial prejudice. \"Constitutional issues ... are questions of law that we review for correctness.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

First, the State notes that each of the references to Puerto Rico was, viewed individually, either entirely innocuous; brought up by Graves himself; or related to the statement Graves was alleged to have made at the time of the shooting, which statement the State maintains has probative value in establishing Graves's intent at the time he fired the gun. That is, the State contends-and Graves does not specifically contest-that each of the individual references to Puerto Rico was evidence-based rather than emotion-based. Second, the State correctly points out that Graves failed to object to any of the multiple references to Puerto Rico on the ground that they were racially motivated or that they deprived Graves of a fair trial for racial reasons, and argues that Graves has fallen short of demonstrating that the trial court committed plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 23 As noted above, in order to show that the trial court plainly erred, Graves must demonstrate that \"(1) an error exists; (2) the error should have been obvious to the [trial] court; and (3) absent the error, there is a reasonable likelihood of a more favorable outcome,\" i.e., that the error was harmful.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Graves makes no effort to identify any individual comment or question by the\n   prosecutor that amounts to an appeal to racial passion. To be sure, the prosecutor asked multiple witnesses about Graves's alleged statement, and mentioned it again during closing argument. But Graves denied making the statement, and by asking about it the prosecutor demonstrated that two witnesses had been consistent in their recollection of it, that one witness was inconsistent in his recollection of it, and that Graves denied it altogether. These types of questions did not violate Graves's constitutional rights, since \"unembellished reference[s] to evidence of race ... pose[ ] no threat to [the] purity of the trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3482200,10532330\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/903/16/\">\n    903 F.2d at 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the end, Graves has simply failed to demonstrate that the State's questioning about this issue was excessive, or that any individual reference to Puerto Rico was, standing alone, emotion-based rather than evidence-based.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 25 Graves's argument is further undermined by the fact that at least twenty of the references to Puerto Rico were introduced by the defense or defense witnesses. Graves's mother-a defense witness-mentioned Puerto Rico four times during her testimony, and Graves's attorney even specifically asked her, \"How long have you lived in Puerto Rico?\" and \"Have you ever left Puerto Rico?\" Graves testified in his own defense, and he and his attorney mentioned Puerto Rico nine times during Graves's own direct examination. Defense counsel also repeated Graves's alleged statement about Puerto Rico three times while cross-examining some of the State's witnesses, and mentioned the statement himself twice during closing argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 26 In addition, several other references to Puerto Rico came from witnesses, rather than at the instance of the prosecutor, and Graves directs us to no case law in which a reference to race or ancestry made by a witness-rather than by the State-was held to be constitutional error. Indeed, in\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   the racially-based evidence given by a detective, some of which had been elicited during questioning by the government, was analyzed and excluded under rules 402 and 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, not the Constitution, even while the racially-based remarks made by the prosecutor that relied on the very same evidence were analyzed and excluded on constitutional grounds.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3482200,10532330\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/903/16/\">\n    903 F.2d at 19-28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 27 Furthermore, Graves acknowledged at oral argument that the trial court properly allowed into evidence at least\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   references to Graves's Puerto Rican heritage, including references to the statement Graves was alleged to have made while firing the gun, and made clear that he does not take the position that the trial court was under an obligation, on the facts of this case, to scrub the trial clean of all references to Puerto Rico. Instead, Graves asserts that \"at some point\" the cumulative effect of the repeated references to Puerto Rico became error. By conceding that at least some of the references are permissible, and by failing to identify any of the specific references as emotion-based rather than evidence-based, Graves is effectively acknowledging that the State's individual references to Puerto Rico were the type of \"unembellished reference\" to ancestry that is not constitutionally forbidden, since even a single appeal to race-based emotion would be impermissible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3482200,10532330\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/903/16/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3482200,10532330\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/903/16/\">\n    at 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 28 While we certainly leave open the possibility that, in a different case, repeated and gratuitous references to race (even in an evidence-based context) might be employed for an improper racially-motivated purpose,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Graves has not persuaded us that any such thing happened here. As an initial matter, Graves does not identify any specific juncture in the trial, activated by any specific comment or question by the State, at which he believes the references crossed the line from individually permissible to cumulatively\n   impermissible. He merely asserts that this must have happened \"at some point.\" Without more assistance from Graves on this point, we have a hard time discerning any reason to vary our usual rule that a series of non-errors cannot amount to cumulative error.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Similarly, the State asked Brother questions about what he saw and heard on the night in question, but asked no specific question about the \"Puerto Rico\" statement; on cross-examination, however, defense counsel specifically asked Brother whether he had heard Graves make a statement about Puerto Rico as he fired, and Brother answered in the negative.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-2-402\">\n     Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-2-402\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2)(a)(iii) (LexisNexis 2017) (\"A person is not justified in using force ... if the person ... was engaged in a combat by agreement ....\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    It is unclear whether the prosecutor meant to use \"these people\" in a racially charged way (both SO and Graves were part of Emery County's small non-white population), or if he meant it to refer to all four men involved in the altercation (the prosecutor had also asked JH-who is white-if racial slurs and threats were \"just common talk\" \"in this culture that you're in\").
