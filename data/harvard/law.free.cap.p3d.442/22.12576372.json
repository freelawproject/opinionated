We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    FACTS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 On May 7, 2014, a fire caused significant interior damage to Mount Zion Lutheran Church in Mountlake Terrace. Mount Zion was insured by Church Mutual Insurance Company under Policy Number 0067342-02-381415 (the Policy). Under the Policy, Mount Zion could collect the \"Actual Cash Value\" (ACV) of the \"Covered Property,\" regardless of whether it chose to repair or replace the church. If Mount Zion chose to rebuild, it could file a claim for repair or replacement costs exceeding the ACV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Church Mutual hired J.S. Held Construction Consulting to prepare a scope of repair and cost estimate. J.S. Held estimated the cost to replicate the church building as it existed before the fire to be $ 729,106.42 (the Replacement Cost Valuation or RCV). J.S. Held estimated the ACV of the church to be $ 593,361.66, which Church Mutual paid to Mount Zion. The Policy allowed Church Mutual to withhold the difference between the RCV and ACV, approximately $ 135,744, until Mount Zion completed the repairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 J.S. Held's estimate included the cost of replacing arched glulam beams in the church sanctuary and replacing the sanctuary roof, a cost of over $ 196,000. Slaed Spiller, an independent adjuster hired by Church Mutual, inspected the church, including the glulam beams, and discussed their replacement with Pastor Frank Paine. Pastor Paine indicated to Spiller that he preferred to repair, rather\n   than replace, the glulam beams, as replacement would require removal of the church's roof. Church Mutual hired Rimkus Consulting Group to assess the glulam beams, and it concluded they did not need to be replaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 By the end of June 2014, Mount Zion had four bids, all of which reflected the cost of repairing, rather than replacing, the glulam beams. None included replacing the entire sanctuary roof. The bids ranged from $ 363,989, to $ 426,716, well below the ACV already paid to the church.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 In late July 2014, Mount Zion retained a public adjuster, Drew Lucurell, to assist with its insurance claim. Church Mutual's adjuster, Spiller, testified that Lucurell claimed the glulam beams had to be replaced, rather than repaired. Although Rimkus and the four bidding contractors did not deem replacement of the beams to be necessary, Church Mutual acquiesced and allowed Mount Zion to replace them. J.S. Held did not modify its RCV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 Mount Zion retained Seattle Remodeling Company to perform the repairs. Spiller performed a routine post-repair inspection of the church on October 28, 2015, and he discovered that the glulam beams had been repaired, not replaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8 Mount Zion prepared a replacement cost claim in April 2016 in which it reallocated the cost estimated to replace the glulam beams and sanctuary roof to a set of \"substitute expenditures.\" The claim is not a part of the record. But Church Mutual submitted documents from Lucurell's files indicating the church spent a total of $ 750,682.30 in repair and replacement costs. From what we can glean from the record, the contractor granted the church a credit of $ 53,874 for eliminating work to replace the glulam beams, identified supplemental expenditures of $ 28,432, and included additional costs of $ 75,500 for \"extras\" requested by the church. Church Mutual asserts on appeal it reimbursed the church for the cost of repairing the glulam beams, but we cannot find any evidence in the record to support this contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9 Mount Zion presented evidence that it elected to refurbish, rather than replace, the arched glulam beams in the sanctuary because removing the roof would have added significant time to the reconstruction timeline. Believing it was entitled to the funds to install new glulam beams, Mount Zion chose to make \"substitute expenditures\" with funds\n   otherwise allocated for the beam replacement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10 For example, Mount Zion presented evidence that the original church had a perpendicular wing with offices and a small kitchenette, which were irreparably damaged. Mount Zion chose to replace the old kitchenette with a full-size kitchen, redesigning it to make it more functional for the church's current needs. According to Lucurell's documents and Church Mutual's adjuster Spiller, the full-size kitchen had upgraded kitchen cabinets, an upgraded sink and faucets, new self-closing drawers, and upgraded appliances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 11 Church Mutual presented evidence that Mount Zion also upgraded the hardware on the front entry doors, upgraded the flooring and base trim in the sanctuary and foyer, upgraded wall and ceiling insulation, reframed the mezzanine for use as storage, installed underground conduits for phone and internet cables, added custom built shelving to a meeting room and classroom, refurbished a street sign not damaged in the fire, and upgraded lighting in the foyer, fellowship building, and sanctuary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 12 Church Mutual refused to pay the cost of replacing beams the church did not replace. It also refused to reimburse the church's \"substitute expenditures\" as \"unnecessary\" under the Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 13 Mount Zion sued Church Mutual, alleging breach of contract, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, and violations of the Washington Consumer Protection Act (CPA)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   and Washington Insurance Fair Conduct Act (IFCA). Mount Zion filed a \"motion for legal ruling regarding replacement cost coverage,\" arguing it was entitled under the Policy to the full amount of the RCV, regardless of its decision not to replace the sanctuary beams. The trial court denied Mount Zion's motion, holding it is \"not entitled to Replacement Cost Coverage for any substituted costs incurred that were unnecessary to repair or replace the lost or damaged portions of the church building.\" Mount Zion appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 14 The sole issue on appeal is whether Mount Zion is entitled to receive the full RCV calculated by Church Mutual under the Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 15 This court reviews de novo an order granting or denying summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Ruvalcaba v.

As in Hess's policy, section C.7.a.(3)(a) of the Policy places a condition on Church Mutual's obligation to make any payment under section C.7.a.(4). Church Mutual has no obligation to pay on a replacement cost basis for any lost or damaged property that is not repaired or replaced. This language is not ambiguous. Mount Zion is not entitled to the replacement cost of glulam beams it chose not to replace.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 22 Mount Zion further argues there is no basis for considering the glulam beams separately\n   from the building to which they are attached because they are both \"Covered Property\" under the Policy. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 23 First, under section C.7.a.(2) of the Policy, the insured has the option of making a claim for loss or damage on an ACV basis instead of on a replacement cost basis. If this option is selected, section C.7.a.(2)(a) requires the insurer to determine the ACV of the \"Covered Property.\" The \"Covered Property\" here is the church and all of its component parts, and the ACV reflects that value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 24 However, if the insured opts to make a claim on a replacement cost basis, as Mount Zion has done here, section C.7.a.(4) requires the insurer to reimburse for costs incurred to repair or replace \"the lost or damaged property.\" It does not require payment to repair or replace \"the Covered Property.\" While the ACV explicitly covers the entire building and all of its component parts as one unit,\n   the RCV explicitly covers only lost or damaged property within the Covered Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 25 Second, although the Policy does not define \"lost or damaged property,\" it uses this phrase repeatedly throughout the Policy in contexts that undercut Mount Zion's argument. For example, under section C.3.a.(4) of the Policy, insureds are required to provide \"complete inventories of the damaged and undamaged property,\" and if possible, to set aside \"damaged property\" for examination by the insurer. The Policy clearly distinguishes between components of a building that have been damaged and are in need of repair or replacement from undamaged components of that same building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 26 It is a fair, reasonable, and sensible construction of the Policy to consider the arched glulam beams separately from the rest of the lost or damaged property within the church building when determining how to compute replacement costs due to Mount Zion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 27 Even though Mount Zion is not entitled to the full RCV because it did not replace the glulam beams, it may nevertheless be entitled to reimbursement for its \"substitute expenditures\" if they were \"necessary\" to replace lost or damaged property as set out in Paragraph 7.a.(4)(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 28 Mount Zion argues the word \"necessary\" cannot be interpreted to require it to \"replicate\" the preexisting structure as a condition precedent to receiving replacement cost proceeds. Mount Zion is correct; there is nothing in the Policy requiring Mount Zion to rebuild the church, its office, and its kitchen in the exact same configuration as existed before the fire. But Church Mutual is not advancing such a narrow construction of the Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 29 Mount Zion further asks this Court to adopt a \"functional similarity\" test in determining whether its remodeling was \"necessary.\" It argues it should be reimbursed the full cost of its upgraded kitchen because what it\n   built was \"functionally similar\" to the property lost or damaged by fire. Mount Zion relies on several federal and out-of-state cases for this argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fitzhugh 25 Partners, L.P. v.
