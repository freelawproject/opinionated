Haggard seeks reversal of his convictions for arson and burglary, arguing that he was sentenced based on an improper offender score. Haggard contends that his score was miscalculated because a misdemeanor conviction dismissed after successful completion of a deferred sentence should not have interrupted the washout period for his prior class C felony convictions. Because the plain language of the statute is unambiguous and does not indicate that the legislature intended dismissal to be equivalent to vacation, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 David Haggard was convicted of three felonies in California in 2002, 2004, and 2005. He was released from incarceration for the last of these offenses on May 22, 2008. Haggard was charged with assault in the fourth degree in Snohomish County District Court for events occurring in late 2010 and pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of disorderly conduct. Haggard received a deferred sentence. On March 1, 2012, the Snohomish County District Court found Haggard to be in compliance with the conditions of his deferred sentence and dismissed the case ex parte.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 In this case, Haggard was charged with arson in the second degree and burglary in the second degree for events that took place on June 5, 2016. The trial court engaged in a full colloquy with Haggard and found that he knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waived his right to a jury trial and stipulated to the facts. The court found sufficient facts beyond a reasonable doubt to convict Haggard of both arson in the second degree and burglary in the second degree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 The State filed a memorandum detailing the timing of Haggard's prior convictions, which affected his offender score. The State argued that the critical distinction between dismissal and vacation was that a prior vacated offense would not impact a future offender score. Because Haggard's 2010 conviction had been dismissed but not vacated, the State contended that he was not entitled to exclude his prior California felony convictions from the offender score calculation. Haggard argued in response that the supreme court's analysis of the analogous felony dismissal and vacation statutes compelled the conclusion that a misdemeanor dismissed after a deferred sentence may not be included when calculating an offender score.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 The court also heard oral argument on Haggard's offender score. The State argued that the governing statute specifically states that vacated convictions will not be used to calculate a future offender score but does not provide the same benefit to charges dismissed after a deferred sentence. Haggard responded that the distinction between \"vacation\" and \"dismissal\" was artificial and the two terms were interchangeable for misdemeanor convictions. He argued that the two statutes recognized a procedural distinction and applied in different stages: dismissal when the trial judge still had jurisdiction over a defendant and vacation when the trial court no longer had jurisdiction because the defendant's probation had expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 Haggard argued that the statute was ambiguous because it was unclear whether vacation under RCW 9.96.060 had a different legal effect than a dismissal under RCW 3.66.067, and the court should apply the rule of lenity in his favor. The State responded that RCW 9.96.060 was not ambiguous because it was a general, stand-alone statute that applied to all courts in which a defendant seeks vacation of a misdemeanor. The trial court found that the statute was not ambiguous and that it was clear from the language of the statute that the defendant had to petition the court and give notice to the prosecutor to have the conviction vacated. Only then would the court exclude the prior conviction when calculating an offender score. Therefore, the court found that Haggard's dismissed misdemeanor conviction interrupted the washout period for his prior felonies because the misdemeanor was not vacated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 Because Haggard's prior felonies did not wash out, the court determined that he had an offender score of six. Haggard was sentenced to 39 months imprisonment on the arson charge and 29 months on the burglary charge. The sentencing hearings for this matter and another case in which Haggard was convicted of unlawful possession of a firearm and violation of the Uniform Controlled Substances Act occurred simultaneously. All four sentences were ordered to run concurrently. Haggard timely appealed. Haggard also appealed this same issue with a separate Statement of Additional Grounds for Review in\n   <em>\n    State of Washington v. David B.

However, the court in\n   <em>\n    Breazeale\n   </em>\n   relied on the language of the felony dismissal statute mandating that, after dismissal, the defendant \" 'shall thereafter be released from all penalties and disabilities resulting from the offense or crime of which he has been convicted.' \"\n   <em>\n    Breazeale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"970396\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/144/829/#p837\">\n    144 Wash.2d at 835\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20P.3d%201155\">\n    31 P.3d 1155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting former RCW 9.95.240).

RCW 3.50.320 ; RCW 3.66.067.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b617 The language of the misdemeanor dismissal and vacation statutes is clear and unambiguous. Although the misdemeanor dismissal statutes do not explicitly state the effect of dismissal on the defendant's record, the existence of a separate procedure for vacation implies that the legislature did not intend for a dismissal to automatically have the same effect as a vacation. The vacation statute contains numerous limitations that are not present in the dismissal statutes, including restrictions on the offenses that are eligible for vacation and the number of convictions that a person may have vacated. A defendant must also apply to the court for vacation, while dismissal can be carried out ex parte, as it was in this instance. Therefore, we find that the two procedures are not equivalent and dismissal does not automatically have the same effect as vacation. The trial court correctly found that Haggard's dismissed 2010 conviction interrupted the washout period for his prior felonies, and did not err in sentencing him based on an offender score of six.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   II. Statement of Additional Grounds\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b618 In a Statement of Additional Grounds, Haggard contends that the trial court erred in denying his motions to compel production of evidence and his motion to suppress evidence stemming from an allegedly defective search warrant. Haggard primarily relies on the briefing filed below and adopts the arguments raised by trial counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b619 In July 2016, Detective Christina Bartlett applied for a warrant to search the property where Haggard and his sister, Jamie,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   had been living before Jamie's disappearance. During the execution of that warrant on July 15, 2016, officers discovered evidence of the crimes with which Haggard was later charged in this case. Haggard subpoenaed a copy of the affidavit supporting the search warrant and King County Sheriff's Office provided him with a redacted copy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A. Motions to Compel\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b620 Haggard contends that the trial court erred in denying two motions to compel production of evidence. The first motion sought to compel an unredacted copy of Det. Bartlett's affidavit in support of the search warrant, but the State objected on the grounds that disclosure would compromise the ongoing investigation into Jamie's disappearance. The trial court reviewed the unredacted warrant affidavit in camera and denied the motion to compel. The second motion sought production of investigative\n   records pertaining to Jamie's disappearance. The trial court also denied this motion. The record on appeal is insufficient to allow for our review of these rulings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   B. Motion to Suppress\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b621 Finally, Haggard contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained from the execution of a search warrant at his residence. He argues that the warrant was neither supported by probable cause nor constrained by adequate particularity, and that Det. Bartlett recklessly omitted material information from her affidavit. He also claims that the search exceeded the scope of the warrant and that witness statements obtained during the execution of the warrant should have been excluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b622 Conclusions of law in an order pertaining to suppression of evidence are reviewed de novo.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In his motion to suppress, Haggard raised various arguments challenging all three searches.

Issuance of Warrant\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   a. Probable Cause\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b624 First, Haggard argues that the affidavit in support of the search warrant did not establish probable cause to believe that evidence of specific criminal activity would be found in his residence. Haggard contends that there was no probable cause to believe that Jamie was murdered or that there would be evidence of criminal activity in the place to be searched or items to be seized. The trial court found that there was sufficient probable cause detailed in the affidavit to allow a search of the premises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b625 A magistrate may only issue a search warrant after a showing of probable cause.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Generally, appellate courts review the issuance of a search warrant only for abuse of discretion, giving great deference to the issuing judge or magistrate.\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, when the trial court has reviewed the affidavit supporting the warrant after a motion to suppress, the trial court's finding of probable cause is a legal conclusion that we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=196%20P.3d%20658\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b626 In the affidavit, Det. Bartlett states that Jamie; her half-brother, Haggard; his girlfriend, Carlee Chew; and Jason Nolte lived together in the Kenmore house. Jamie disappeared without notice to anyone, including the person with whom she had plans the day after her disappearance. She had been involved in a physical altercation with Haggard the day before she disappeared. Haggard filled in a hole at the property soon after her disappearance and impersonated Jamie in a text message to their sister. Additionally, Haggard's accounts of the events leading up to Jamie's disappearance changed multiple times over the course of his contacts with police. Because the affidavit sets forth these facts, which are sufficient for a reasonable person to conclude that Haggard was involved in criminal activity and evidence of that activity could be found in the residence, probable cause existed to issue the warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   b. Particularity\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b627 Haggard also argues that the warrant was overbroad because it lacked sufficient particularity as to the items to be seized. Specifically, Haggard contends that the warrant allowed property belonging to other residents of the house to be seized because it did not provide objective standards for distinguishing between Jamie's belongings and the belongings of the other residents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b628 Det. Bartlett's affidavit said that she believed that evidence of Jamie's murder could be found at the Kenmore house, in Haggard's truck, in Nolte's car, and in the phone records of the relevant parties. The affidavit listed a specific date range for the cell phone data and position information to be searched. The affidavit also listed examples of items in the house that would help to establish whether Jamie was missing voluntarily, including \"clothes, phones, belongings, medications, prescriptions (given her abuse of narcotic pain pills), purses, suitcases, documents, diaries, etc.\" Haggard had stated to officers that Jamie had driven Nolte's car the night before she disappeared and he believed she had been in his truck since her disappearance. The trial court did not see any problems with the particularity of the warrant because the items listed were related to the suspected homicide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b629 \"A warrant is overbroad if it fails to describe with particularity items for which probable cause exists to search.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Reckless Omission\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b631 Haggard argues that Det. Bartlett recklessly omitted from her affidavit the fact that Nolte was in jail at the time of Jamie's disappearance, knowing \"that the court would draw unfair inferences as to the likelihood of [Nolte's] involvement in criminal activity.\" The trial court concluded that Det. Bartlett did not recklessly omit any relevant information from her affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b632 In order to invalidate the warrant on this basis, the defendant must show evidence of a deliberate, material omission or statements made in reckless disregard of the truth, rather than simply negligence or innocent mistake.\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"425294\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/143/731/#p747\">\n    143 Wash.2d at 751\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20P.3d%201006\">\n    24 P.3d 1006\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"A trial court's finding on whether an affiant deliberately excluded material facts is a factual determination, upheld unless clearly erroneous.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 752,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20P.3d%201006\">\n    24 P.3d 1006\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    State v.

Therefore, although the court listed its finding that Det. Bartlett did not recklessly omit any relevant information from her affidavit as a conclusion of law, we review it as a factual determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b633 Haggard contends that the affidavit \"gives rise to a clear inference that her disappearance may be linked to the jealous, assaultive boyfriend [Nolte].\" However, although Nolte is mentioned throughout the affidavit, the main focus of the affidavit seems to be Haggard's statements and actions leading up to and following Jamie's disappearance. Det. Bartlett's affidavit does not explicitly state that Nolte was in jail when Jamie disappeared, but it does state that he was arrested for domestic violence assault on June 8, 2016 and that Haggard filled in the pond \"while Nolte was incarcerated.\" These references indicate that the lack of an explicit statement that Nolte was in jail when Jamie disappeared was more likely negligence or an innocent mistake rather than a deliberate or reckless omission. Haggard has not shown that Det. Bartlett deliberately excluded material facts from her affidavit, and therefore the court's finding is not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   2. Scope of Warrant\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b634 Next, Haggard argues that the law enforcement officers who executed the warrant exceeded its scope by searching and seizing property unrelated to the target of the search warrant. Haggard contends that moving a welder to locate its serial number constituted a warrantless search and seizure because the warrant did not authorize them to move the welder. The trial court found it \"very clear\" that the serial number was in plain view because it was on the front of the welder and exposed. Therefore, the court found that there was no warrantless search or seizure of the welder when the serial number was in plain sight on the front of the equipment. In its written findings, the court concluded that the welder was in plain view in a common area of the house, and taking a picture of an object in plain view at a scene violates neither Article I, Section 4 of the Washington State Constitution nor the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. We review this conclusion of law de novo.\n   <em>\n    Gaines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5629054\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/154/711/#p716\">\n    154 Wash.2d at 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=116%20P.3d%20993\">\n    116 P.3d 993\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b635 Detective Kathleen Decker testified at the CrR 3.6 hearing that she participated in the search of the Kenmore house on July 15, 2016. She oversaw the search-and-rescue personnel and took photographs of the scene. During the search, she noticed a large metal arc welder located in the breezeway between the residence and the garage. She was asked to photograph the welder and she did so. She testified that, although the welder was moved slightly while being photographed, she was able to see the front of the welder without moving it and that the serial number was printed on the front of the welder. Det. Bartlett had told her that the welder was suspected stolen property, and Det. Decker knew that the purpose of photographing the welder was to document the serial number to research whether it was stolen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b636 Recording serial numbers that are in plain view does not constitute a search or seizure.\n   <em>\n    Arizona v.
