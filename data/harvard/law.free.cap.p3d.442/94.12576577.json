We further conclude that the proper test to assess the constitutionality of government fines under the Eighth Amendment is that set forth by the United States Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Bajakajian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11182447\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/321/#p334\">\n    524 U.S. 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 334,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11182447\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/321/#p334\">\n    118 S.Ct. 2028\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11182447\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/321/#p334\">\n    141 L.Ed.2d 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998), which requires an assessment of whether the fine is grossly disproportional to the offense for which it is imposed. We thus reverse the court of appeals' ruling and remand to that court for return to the Division of Workers' Compensation with instructions to, as appropriate and necessary, develop an evidentiary record sufficient to determine whether the $ 250-$ 500 fine that a business was required to pay for each day that it was out of compliance with Colorado's workers' compensation law is proportional to the harm or risk of harm caused by each day of noncompliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 Dami Hospitality, LLC (\"Dami\") is the owner-operator of a Denver motel located on Peoria Street. Dami employs between four and ten people at any given time. As an employer, Dami is required by statute to maintain workers' compensation insurance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 8-43-409, C.R.S. (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 Dami allowed its workers' compensation coverage to lapse on or about July 1, 2005. Upon receiving notification of the lapse from the Division of Workers' Compensation (\"DWC\"), Dami conceded the violation and paid a corresponding settlement in June 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 Approximately two months later, Dami again allowed its workers' compensation coverage to lapse. This time, Dami went without coverage from August 10, 2006, through June 8, 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 From June 9, 2007, to September 11, 2010, Dami carried the proper insurance, but the company's workers' compensation coverage again lapsed on September 12, 2010. Dami was without such insurance from that time until July 9, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 On February 19, 2014, the DWC discovered that Dami had allowed its workers' compensation insurance to lapse for these periods of time and issued a notice to Dami regarding this. That written correspondence was dispatched to Dami's Peoria Street address, which was the address on file with the Colorado Secretary of State for both the limited liability company and its registered agent, Soon Pak. The DWC notice advised Dami that it had twenty days to return an enclosed compliance questionnaire and to submit documents either establishing that it had maintained coverage during the relevant periods or demonstrating an exemption from the coverage requirement. It also specified that Dami could \"request a prehearing conference on the issue of default.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 After Dami failed to respond to the notice of subsequent violation, the DWC mailed a second notice to Dami on June 25, 2014, this time sending it to an East Dartmouth Place address.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the second time,\n   Dami was given twenty days to return the same compliance questionnaire and to submit documents either establishing coverage during the relevant periods or demonstrating an exemption from the coverage requirement. The DWC also specified, again, that Dami could request a prehearing conference on the issue of default.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 On July 11, 2014, the DWC received a faxed certificate of workers' compensation insurance for Dami effective from July 10, 2014, through July 10, 2015. Dami did not offer any other documentation or any explanation for the extended periods of noncompliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 Having received no claim of exemption or proof of coverage for the second and third periods of noncompliance, and no request for a prehearing conference, the DWC concluded its legally mandated investigation into Dami's noncompliance on October 29, 2014. The applicable statutory framework provides that the DWC shall:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   For every day that the employer fails or has failed to insure or to keep the insurance required by articles 40 to 47 of this title in force, allows or has allowed the insurance to lapse, or fails or has failed to effect a renewal of such coverage: impose a fine of: (I) Not more than two hundred fifty dollars for an initial violation; or (II) Not less than two hundred fifty dollars or more than five hundred dollars for a second and subsequent violation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00a7 8-43-409(1)(b), C.R.S. (2018). In implementing this provision, the DWC promulgated Rule 3-6(D), 7 CCR 1101-3, which provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   For the Director's finding of an employer's second and all subsequent defaults in its insurance obligations, daily fines from $ 250/day up to $ 500/day for each day of default will be assessed in accordance with the following schedule of fines until the employer complies with the requirements of the Workers' Compensation Act regarding insurance or until further order of the Director:\n  </blockquote>\n  <pre id=\"p-24\">Class VII 1-20 Days $250/Day Class VIII 21-25 Days $260/Day Class IX 26-30 Days $280/Day Class X 31-35 Days $300/Day Class XI 36-40 Days $400/Day Class XII 41 Days $500/Day</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b610 The DWC applied this statutory and regulatory regime in calculating the fine for Dami's second and third periods of noncompliance with the Workers' Compensation Act. On October 30, 2014, the DWC sent its \"Specific Findings of Fact, Conclusions and Order to Pay Fine-Subsequent Violation\" (the \"Order\") to Dami. This document categorized the fine amounts owed by Dami by the six classes of violation defined in DWC Rule 3-6(D), noting the per diem amount owed for each of the corresponding date ranges. The final paragraph of the order explained that the total amount Dami owed as a result of the 1,698 per diem fines was $ 841,200.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b611 On November 18, 2014, the DWC received correspondence from Soon Pak, Dami's registered agent. In a letter written on Dami's behalf, Pak conceded that the business had failed to maintain workers' compensation insurance during the noticed periods. Pak explained that Dami's failure to consistently maintain coverage was a result of her reliance on others to maintain \"business coverage.\" Pak stated that Dami's annual payroll is less than $ 50,000, and that the aggregate fine proposed by the DWC exceeded the business's gross annual income. Pak informed the DWC that Dami was thus unable to pay the aggregated per diem fines and requested leniency in the form of a penalty \"that is more reasonable to the size of [the] business.\" Pak also asserted that there had never been a worker-related accident or injury at the motel, either when coverage was in place or during any period of Dami's noncompliance. Pak did not request a\n   hearing on the issue of Dami's default on its workers' compensation insurance obligation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b612 The DWC construed Pak's correspondence as a petition to review the Order. The DWC then made settlement overtures, offering to decrease the fine by nearly half, to $ 425,000 (the aggregated minimum per diem fines permissible under section 8-43-409(1)(b)(II) ). Dami did not accept the settlement, and instead submitted a brief in furtherance of the petition to review. Dami argued that (1) it had \"reasonably believed that it was in compliance with the statute\" at all relevant times; (2) the DWC failed to provide adequate and timely notice of Dami's noncompliance; (3) because Dami promptly cured its default upon receiving notice, it should be assessed no penalty or at least a much smaller penalty; and (4) the assessed per diem fines were constitutionally excessive in violation of the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b613 The DWC issued an order upholding the fines. The DWC began by noting that the per diem fines were \"not discretionary\" and were properly calculated pursuant to section 8-43-409 and Rule 3-6(D)'s assessment classification schedule. Next, the DWC observed that the law places the responsibility for knowing whether workers' compensation coverage is consistently maintained on the employer and not on the DWC. Further, the order explained that Dami's policy was cancelled in 2006 due to nonpayment of required premiums and \"its 2010 policy was cancelled for failure to comply with terms &amp; conditions or audit failure.\" The DWC determined that both of those reasons for cancellation were within Dami's control. The DWC stated that Dami's procurement of coverage after receiving actual notice of its subsequent violation did not relieve it of responsibility to pay the statutory fines imposed for the prior 1,698 days of noncompliance. Finally, the DWC declined to address Dami's constitutional arguments, concluding that administrative agencies are not authorized to \"pass on the constitutionality of statutes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b614 Dami appealed to the Industrial Claim Appeals Office (\"ICAO\"). The ICAO rejected all but Dami's excessive fines argument. The ICAO remanded the matter to the DWC, directing it to review the constitutionality of the aggregated per diem fines assessed in accordance with the test established by the court of appeals in\n   <em>\n    Associated Business Products v. Industrial Claim Appeals Office\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8993796\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/126/323/\">\n    126 P.3d 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Colo. App. 2005). That test, borrowed from United States Supreme Court Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence, requires consideration of \"(1) the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant's misconduct, (2) the disparity between the harm (or potential harm) suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award, and (3) the difference between the punitive damages awarded and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8993796\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/126/323/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 326 (citing\n   <em>\n    Cooper Indus. v.

The potential harm caused by noncompliance, according to the DWC, was in line with the fines because each day of noncompliance presents a risk that an employee will be injured and insurance will not be in place to cover that injury. And because the penalties are statutorily imposed and apply to all violators equally, Rule 3-6(D) ensures that there is no disparity between the fines imposed on Dami and fines imposed on any other noncompliant employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b616 Dami again appealed to the ICAO, which affirmed the DWC's supplemental order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b617 Dami then appealed to the court of appeals.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b618 We first consider whether the Excessive Fines Clause affords corporations protection against constitutionally excessive fines. We conclude that it does. Next, we hold that the proper test for determining whether a fine is unconstitutionally excessive is whether it is grossly disproportional to the gravity of the subject offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bajakajian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11182447\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/321/#p334\">\n    524 U.S. at 334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11182447\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/321/#p334\">\n    118 S.Ct. 2028\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We explain that the evaluation of disproportionality should include consideration of the company's ability to pay the fine. We then consider whether the gross disproportionality analysis should be applied to each per diem fine or to the aggregate amount imposed for 1,698 days of noncompliance. We hold that where, as here, a statute expressly states that each day a party fails to comply with a legal obligation \"shall constitute a separate and distinct violation\" of the law, the Eighth Amendment analysis must focus on each per diem fine imposed by statute. \u00a7 8-43-305, C.R.S. (2018). We then remand the case to the court of appeals with instructions to return it to the DWC for the development, as appropriate and necessary, of an evidentiary record to facilitate application of the proportionality analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

For some types of criminal or regulatory infractions, a penalty that would have that kind of grave consequence might be warranted, whereas for others the severity of that outcome may be out of proportion to the gravity of the offense for which the fine is imposed.

The workers' compensation statutory regime explicitly states that \"[e]very day during which an employer ... fails to perform any duty imposed by articles 40 to 47 of this title shall constitute a separate and distinct violation thereof.\" \u00a7 8-43-305. Moreover, the statute directs the DWC to impose a daily fine of $ 250-$ 500 for each day of noncompliance. The statute thus puts every employer on notice that it will be fined between $ 250 and $ 500 per day for each day that it is out of compliance with its legal obligations. While the assessment for the 1,698 per diem fines may have reflected a lump sum total owed by Dami, the fines were clearly imposed at a daily rate as a result of many daily violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b633 In the criminal context, we have refused to aggregate sentences that were assessed individually for purposes of evaluating the proportionality of the sentences.

We concluded instead that \"[t]he question of whether Lucero's consecutive term-of-years sentences meet the dictates of the Eighth Amendment's proportionality principle requires consideration of each individual crime and each sentence imposed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342365\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/394/1128/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1134 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Close v.

We see no principled justification for taking a different approach in the context of the regulatory fines at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b634 We recognize that, under the circumstances, the fact that Dami did not receive notice of noncompliance regarding its subsequent violations from the DWC for several years resulted in a staggeringly high-dollar aggregate total of per diem fines.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, responsibility for that unfortunate circumstance rests squarely on the shoulders of Dami, and perhaps its business advisors. Dami was in fact well aware that it had an obligation to carry workers' compensation insurance and that it would be subject to daily fines for noncompliance; at the very moment that the company allowed its insurance to lapse in 2006 it was in the process of settling with the DWC for a year-long period of noncompliance during 2005 and 2006. Moreover, under the workers' compensation statutes, it is the employer who is responsible for ensuring that it is in compliance with the obligation to carry insurance. The statute makes plain-by excluding any mens rea element and imposing a daily fine for each day that an employer fails to have insurance or allows its insurance to lapse-that the legislature intended that a violation of section 8-43-409(1)(b)(II) be a strict-liability offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b635 There are good and practical reasons for putting the burden on the employer, and not on the DWC, to ensure compliance. First, workers' compensation insurance is not paid\n   to or by the DWC. Instead, it is private insurance coverage that an employer purchases from an insurance company.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Division of Workers' Compensation,\n   <em>\n    Employer's Guide\n   </em>\n   2 (Dec. 2015).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The employer is therefore in a better position than the DWC to know whether it has obtained the required coverage. Second, the lack of a mens rea element in the requirement to maintain coverage discourages both negligent noncompliance (where an employer should have known that coverage was lacking) on the one hand, and gamesmanship (where an employer knew coverage was lacking but willfully failed to procure or maintain a compliant policy) on the other. Adopting a rule that focuses on the proportionality of the aggregate of daily fines, rather than the proportionality of each daily fine, would actually incentivize employers to forego workers' compensation coverage for as long as possible, hoping that the DWC would not notice until the fines had accrued for an extended period of time so that they could then argue that the fine for noncompliance was excessive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b636 We thus cannot allow the size of aggregated per diem fines in this case to distort our Eighth Amendment jurisprudence more generally.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   When a fine is imposed on a per diem basis, with each day constituting an independent violation, the evaluation of whether a fine is excessive must be done with reference to each individual daily fine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Remand\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b637 There is scant evidence in the record before us, particularly about Dami's ability to pay the daily fines. Dami asserted in a letter to the DWC that it could not pay without going out of business. Dami did not request the evidentiary hearing to which it was entitled in order to develop a record supporting that claim. Moreover, because the test we announce today is a new one in Colorado, we remand to the court of appeals so that it can return the case to the DWC. Assuming it is appropriate or necessary to conduct an evidentiary hearing at this stage, the DWC should permit the parties to develop a record that permits a complete evaluation of whether the $ 250-$ 500 fine imposed on Dami each day that it violated the workers' compensation laws was constitutionally excessive in accordance with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b638 In sum, we hold that the Eighth Amendment does protect corporations from punitive fines that are excessive. The appropriate test to apply in assessing whether a regulatory fine violates the Excessive Fines Clause is the \"gross disproportionality\" test. In assessing proportionality, a court should consider whether the gravity of the offense is proportional to the severity of the penalty, considering whether the fine is harsher than fines for comparable offenses in this jurisdiction or than fines for the same offense in other jurisdictions. In considering the severity of the penalty, the ability of the regulated individual or entity to pay is a relevant consideration. And the proportionality analysis should be conducted in reference to the amount of the fine imposed for each offense, not the aggregated total of fines for many offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b639 We therefore reverse the ruling of the court of appeals and remand this case for return to the DWC so that the DWC can, as necessary and appropriate, permit the development of an evidentiary record sufficient to allow the application of this Excessive Fines Clause analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   JUSTICE SAMOUR concurs in part and dissents in part.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    We granted certiorari to review the following issues:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n    1.

I write separately because I disagree that the proportionality analysis must be conducted with regard to each individual per diem fine, as opposed to the total fine of $ 841,200. Like the court of appeals, I would focus on the aggregate fine that the Director imposed, which is what triggered Dami's appeal. Dami has never argued that the daily fine of $ 250 to $ 500 is unconstitutionally excessive; rather, Dami has contended all along that the $ 841,200 fine is.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b641 I agree that section 8-43-409(1), C.R.S. (2018), required the Director to impose a penalty on Dami, and that once Dami obtained insurance coverage (after receiving the notice from the Director), the only available penalty was a fine of between $ 250 and $ 500 for every day Dami was noncompliant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the penalty imposed in October 2014-the state action Dami complains about-was the $ 841,200 fine, not the per diem rate of $ 250 to $ 500. As the majority acknowledges, the Director did not send Dami a notice at the beginning of the violation period to inform it that he intended to impose a prospective fine of $ 250 to $ 500 every day until it obtained the required insurance. Maj. op. \u00b6 34. Had he done so, I might accept looking at the daily fine to determine constitutional proportionality. Instead, he waited\n   <em>\n    more than seven years\n   </em>\n   to contact Dami about a purported violation and then imposed a\n   <em>\n    retroactive\n   </em>\n   fine of almost a million dollars.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   To be sure, Dami, as an employer, was responsible for complying with section 8-43-409(1).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"345076\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/201/43/#p76\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But I nevertheless find it troubling that, under today's decision, if the Director retroactively imposes a \"staggeringly high-dollar aggregate\" fine,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"345076\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/201/43/#p76\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , simply because he delayed taking action to correct a potential violation, the employer's only recourse is to argue that the daily fine amount is excessive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b642 The majority today holds that the Eighth Amendment offers Dami protection against excessive fines.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 18, 26, 38. I wholeheartedly agree. Unfortunately, the majority opinion, at least in this context, has no teeth because it says that Dami is restricted to challenging the daily fine amount. That's where the majority and I part company. I would conclude that, to be meaningful, the proportionality analysis has to focus on the total fine the Director required Dami to pay ($ 841,200), not the daily fine amount ($ 250 to $ 500) used to calculate the total fine. In my view, to focus on the daily fine amount instead of the total fine Dami must pay renders the entire constitutional analysis an exercise in futility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b643 Notably, under the majority's analytical framework, if the Director had waited twelve years to contact Dami and then imposed a retroactive fine of over two million dollars ($ 500 \u00d7 4,380 days), the outcome would be identical: Dami would still be limited to challenging whether the daily fine amount of $ 250 to $ 500 is excessive. The same would be true if the Director had contacted Dami within a month of a potential violation and imposed a total fine of only $ 15,000 ($ 500 \u00d7 30 days). Stated differently, whether a fine of over two million dollars is excessive and whether a fine of $ 15,000 is excessive both depend on whether the daily fine amount of $ 250 to $ 500 is excessive. Hence, in evaluating the constitutionality of a section 8-43-409 fine under the Eighth Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause, the majority renders the total amount of the fine imposed completely inconsequential. To my mind, that greatly risks immunizing the Director and the statute from constitutional attack under the Eighth Amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   So\n   long as the daily fine amount is not excessive, it matters not whether the Director imposes a $ 1,000 fine or a $ 10,000,000 fine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b644 The reality here is that the Director imposed a one-time, aggregate fine retroactively when he advised Dami in October 2014 that it was required to pay $ 841,200. He did not impose a fine in the amount of $ 250 to $ 500 1,698 times (a fine each day Dami was in violation of section 8-43-409(1) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given that the Eighth Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause applies, Dami should be allowed to challenge the constitutionality of the Director's action-i.e., the one-time, aggregate fine imposed after the fact in October 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b645 Accordingly, like the majority, I would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the case with instructions to have it returned to the Division of Workers' Compensation. However, I would do so on slightly different grounds. For this reason, I respectfully concur in part and dissent in part.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    The statute also contemplates a cease-and-desist order and an order for injunctive relief as potential penalties.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 8-43-409(4) (\"The issuance of an order to cease and desist, the imposition of a fine ..., or the issuance of an order for injunctive relief ... shall be the penalty ....\").

He then waited until June 25, 2014, to mail a second notice to a different address.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    In some circumstances, such as when a fine is the only feasible penalty, the Director is required by the statute to impose a retroactive fine, the total amount of which is calculated by multiplying the number of days an employer was noncompliant times $ 250 to $ 500.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    I understand that section 8-43-305, C.R.S.
