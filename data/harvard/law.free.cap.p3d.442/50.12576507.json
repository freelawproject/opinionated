Berenergy produces oil from both federal and private oil and gas leases. The private lease known as the Thornburg lease is the subject of this appeal. Peabody mines coal pursuant to its separate federal leases. It plans to extract coal by strip mining areas subject to Berenergy's oil and gas leases, including the Thornburg lease. Peabody's process requires removing top soil, blasting, and excavating the subsurface. Peabody cannot blast within 500 feet of an engineered structure, including an oil well. The parties cannot simultaneously conduct their operations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Berenergy I\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12408448\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/408/396/\">\n    408 P.3d at 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Original Proceedings in District Court\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b67] Berenergy filed its lawsuit seeking a declaration of the parties' relative rights to develop the minerals subject to their leases. The district court granted in part and denied in part the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment concerning questions of which legal principles should govern their conflict. The district court held the dispute would be resolved under the accommodation doctrine and that its ruling on the relative rights of the parties under their conflicting federal mineral leases would apply equally to the Thornburg lease. A bench trial followed. After trial, the district court ruled on a number of issues. Those decisions relevant to this appeal are: (1) Berenergy must, at appropriate times, cease production and cap its wells below the projected coal seam allowing Peabody to mine through these areas; (2) Peabody must compensate Berenergy for losses in production on a per well basis; and (3) Peabody must escrow monies to cover Berenergy's costs for waterflood production of its oil leases using an off-site well.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      Berenergy I\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b68] In\n   <em>\n    Berenergy I\n   </em>\n   , we considered cross-appeals of the district court's ruling regarding the federal leases.\n   <em>\n    Berenergy I\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12408448\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/408/396/\">\n    408 P.3d at 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In response, Berenergy asserted that the Thornburg lease was appealed and the entire case-including the Thornburg issue-should be dismissed. In our order on rehearing, we held that \"the issues related to the Thornburg lease were not presented to the Court\" on appeal and said: \"Given the circumstances, this Court finds it inappropriate to amend [\n   <em>\n    Berenergy I\n   </em>\n   ] to address issues related to the Thornburg lease.

The district court did not decide what a suitable accommodation would be, concluding instead that the decision on what constitutes a suitable accommodation rested with the BLM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Current Appeal\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b611] Peabody contends that the district court: (1) can fully resolve the Thornburg lease dispute without the BLM's participation; and (2) the district court should not have reopened the final judgment on the Thornburg lease dispute. In the alternative, Peabody contends, if the Thornburg lease dispute is reopened, the district court should enforce Peabody's right to mine through the Thornburg lease pursuant to the Coal Lands Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2083\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 85, as opposed to the accommodation doctrine. Berenergy argues that the district court correctly held: (1) that our decision in\n   <em>\n    Berenergy I\n   </em>\n   deprived it of subject matter jurisdiction to determine suitable accommodation between Peabody and Berenergy; and (2) Peabody waived any right to rely on the Coal Lands Act when it failed to appeal this issue in\n   <em>\n    Berenergy I\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I.

Berenergy concedes that its original position was that the district court had jurisdiction over its claims for declaratory judgment but now argues that our decision in\n   <em>\n    Berenergy I\n   </em>\n   mandates the conclusion that the district court lacks jurisdiction over the Thornburg lease dispute, despite its belief \"that the jurisdictional ruling in\n   <em>\n    Berenergy I\n   </em>\n   is inconsistent with prior decisions on that issue.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   [\u00b613] The district court conflated subject matter jurisdiction with W.R.C.P.

To the contrary,\n   <em>\n    Berenergy I\n   </em>\n   did not question the existence of subject matter jurisdiction. Our decision in\n   <em>\n    Berenergy I\n   </em>\n   concerned joinder of an indispensable party, a non-jurisdictional question.

The fact that the district court applied the accommodation doctrine to all the leases, both federal and private, does not necessarily mean that the private lease dispute was \"interwoven\" with the federal disputes. The\n   <em>\n    Triton Coal\n   </em>\n   test for severability requires us to determine \"whether the matters or issues embraced\" in the first appeal \"are the same as, or interdependent upon, the matters or issues\" which were not appealed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12040216\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/846/664/#p667\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12040216\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/846/664/#p667\">\n    at 669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

A thorough review of the record reveals that the bulk of the pleadings, arguments, and trial focused on the federal leases. The Thornburg lease may have been somewhat of an afterthought for all involved. The Thornburg lease was, however, separately argued by the parties and separately addressed by the district court. It presented a separate issue. For example, in its amended complaint, Berenergy separately identified its leases and sought a declaration that each lease had priority either because the lease was first in time or because (as was the argument for the Thornburg lease), while not first in time, Peabody could not unreasonably interfere with them. Again, in its motion for partial summary judgment, Berenergy argued that although the Thornburg lease was not first in time, Peabody could not unreasonably interfere\n   with that lease. Berenergy asserted a different argument regarding the first in time federal leases. Likewise, in its pleadings, Peabody addressed the federal leases and the Thornburg lease separately. In its argument regarding the Thornburg lease, Peabody argued that the Coal Lands Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2083\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 85, applied because the Thornburg lease was \"[u]nlike the federal leases\" that govern the other wells. In its response to Peabody, Berenergy also separately addressed the Thornburg lease, but lumped it with the federal leases, arguing that for the reasons already specified in its motions, it should prevail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   [\u00b633] In its order on the parties' motions for summary judgment, the district court also addressed the Thornburg lease separately. It recognized that the original patent from the United States to Jack Thornburg conveyed an express right to extract oil and gas and that \"[t]he patent reserved unto the United States all of the coal, which includes the rights necessary to develop the coal as implied under the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Chartiers\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Block Coal Co. v. Mellon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"838184\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/152/286/\">\n    152 Pa. 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20A.%20597\">\n    25 A. 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1893) ].\" The district court separately recognized the federal leases stating that they \"must be construed as being consistent with the purposes of the MLA [Mineral Leasing Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20181\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , et seq. ].\" The district court ultimately held that both parties must accommodate one another. This ruling implicitly rejected Peabody's argument for the application of the Coal Lands Act to the Thornburg lease. The district court then held a trial to determine reasonable accommodations and damages. The district court awarded separate damages with respect to the Thornburg lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   [\u00b634] Indeed, the parties' appeals in\n   <em>\n    Berenergy I\n   </em>\n   provide compelling evidence of the severability of the federal and Thornburg lease issues. Berenergy appealed only the federal lease issues. Peabody appealed only the portion of the district court's order requiring it to escrow money in the event Berenergy engaged in a water flood recovery operation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Berenergy I\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12408448\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/408/396/\">\n    408 P.3d at 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As we have previously stated, \"the issues related to the Thornburg lease were not presented to the Court\" in\n   <em>\n    Berenergy I\n   </em>\n   . We have also said our holding in\n   <em>\n    Berenergy I\n   </em>\n   \"does not limit the district court's authority to consider the Thornburg lease issues, if the district court finds such consideration appropriate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   [\u00b635] The Thornburg lease issue was severable from the federal lease issues. Our ruling in\n   <em>\n    Berenergy I\n   </em>\n   applies only to the federal leases. Relitigation of the Thornburg lease dispute is not necessary to avoid a \"manifest injustice.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Entek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175838\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/840/1239/#p1242\">\n    840 F.3d at 1242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Both parties have had ample opportunity to set forth their relative positions throughout extensive litigation and have adequately done so. Accordingly, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it applied the law of the case doctrine. The district court's ruling that the accommodation doctrine applies to the Thornburg lease is correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   [\u00b636] The BLM is not an indispensable party to the Thornburg lease dispute, and the district court may fully resolve that dispute without its participation. Further, the district court was correct when it concluded that law of the case principles apply-the accommodation doctrine governs the parties' rights. We remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    The projected cost of this process was $13.1 million, and the district court ordered this amount to be escrowed. The release of money would be subject to Berenergy obtaining permission for the project from the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (WOGCC) and limited to reimbursement of actual expense to implement the process. Following our decision in\n    <em>\n     Berenergy I\n    </em>\n    , the BLM ordered Peabody to deposit this sum into an escrow account to reimburse Berenergy for costs the project might entail if the Wyoming State Office of the Bureau of Land Management designates a secondary recovery unit in the area covering the leases and the WOGCC approves the project.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    Rule 19 has been amended since this lawsuit was filed in 2014.
