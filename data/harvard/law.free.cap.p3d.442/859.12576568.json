Specifically, we are asked to decide whether the district court erred when it entered an order requiring petitioner Rugby International Marketing (\"RIM\"), which is a defendant below and a nonsignatory to a Professional Rugby Sanction Agreement (the \"Sanction Agreement\"), to arbitrate pursuant to an arbitration provision in that Agreement that covered the parties and their agents. The court found that because RIM was an agent for United States of America Rugby Football Union (\"USAR\"), a signatory of the Sanction Agreement, RIM fell \"squarely within the broad language of the arbitration provision.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 We issued a rule to show cause and now make the rule absolute. Although we have not yet opined on the issue, the weight of authority nationally establishes that, subject to a number of recognized exceptions, only parties to an agreement containing an arbitration provision can compel or be subject to arbitration. Here, because RIM was not a party to the Sanction Agreement and because respondents N.A. Rugby Union LLC d/b/a Professional Rugby Organization (\"PRO Rugby\") and Douglas Schoninger, who are the plaintiffs below, have not established that any of the recognized exceptions apply, we conclude that the district court erred in determining that RIM is subject to arbitration under the Sanction Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 Schoninger, a New York financier, was interested in launching a professional rugby league in the United States. Toward that end, he formed PRO Rugby and approached USAR, which was the national governing body for rugby in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Ultimately, PRO Rugby and USAR entered into the Sanction Agreement, which authorized PRO Rugby to establish a professional rugby league in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 As pertinent here, section 2.1 of the Sanction Agreement provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   g. N.A. Rugby Union LLC agrees to appoint Rugby International Marketing as its exclusive Player Representation agency through which it will contract with all Players and Coaching staff on a to be agreed fee basis (it being understood that such agency shall be the subject of an agency agreement and shall not be effective until such agency agreement has been executed by N.A. Rugby Union LLC and Rugby International Marketing)....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   h. N.A. Rugby Union LLC agrees to appoint Rugby International Marketing as a non-exclusive agency to present the commercial rights of the Competition to potential sponsors on a to be agreed fee basis (it being understood that such agency shall be the subject of an agency agreement and shall not be effective until such agency agreement has been executed by N.A. Rugby Union LLC and Rugby International Marketing).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 Notably, it appears undisputed that as of the date of this Agreement, RIM did not yet exist (it was not established until two months later).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67 The Sanction Agreement also contained an arbitration provision that stated, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [T]he parties agree that any claim or dispute between them or against any agent, employee, successor, or assign of the other, whether related to this Agreement or otherwise, and any claim or dispute related to this agreement or the relationship or duties contemplated under this Agreement, including the validity of this arbitration clause, shall be resolved by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association under the Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b68 RIM was not a party to the Sanction Agreement. Moreover, notwithstanding the fact that the Agreement states that PRO Rugby agreed to appoint RIM as its agent for player representation and commercial rights, no such agreement was ever executed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b69 After allegedly investing six million dollars of his personal funds, Schoninger folded the league after its first season. He and PRO Rugby then filed suit in Boulder County District Court, naming nine different defendants, including USAR and RIM, and alleging that the defendants had engaged in a concerted effort to force PRO Rugby out of business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b610 In their complaint, plaintiffs asserted an array of tort and contract claims, the latter arising out of alleged breaches of the Sanction Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b611 RIM subsequently moved to dismiss plaintiffs' breach of contract claims against it based on the undisputed fact that it was not a party to the contract. Plaintiffs responded that the above-quoted provisions of the Sanction Agreement demonstrated that USAR had assigned to RIM the obligations under that Agreement to act as PRO Rugby's exclusive player representation agency and to be the nonexclusive agency to present the commercial rights of the competition to potential sponsors. Based on this alleged assignment, plaintiffs contended that RIM was bound by the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b612 The district court disagreed with plaintiffs' assertion, noting that (1) a party to a contract cannot delegate duties to a nonparty without the nonparty's consent; (2) plaintiffs had conceded that RIM did not affirmatively agree to any promises in the Sanction Agreement; and (3) plaintiffs cited no evidence of any other agreement by RIM to assume any of the Sanction Agreement's obligations. The court thus dismissed plaintiffs' contract claims against RIM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b613 After further pretrial proceedings resulted in orders compelling arbitration as to certain defendants and dismissing for lack of personal jurisdiction the claims against certain other defendants, RIM became the sole remaining defendant in the lawsuit. Plaintiffs then moved to stay the proceedings against RIM to allow plaintiffs to arbitrate their claims against it. In support of this motion, plaintiffs argued that the plain language of the Sanction Agreement's arbitration provision, which bound the parties and agents of the other, bound RIM because it was allegedly USAR's agent. Plaintiffs further contended that, in any event, any dispute as to whether the claims at issue were arbitrable was to be decided by the arbitrator. RIM opposed the motion to stay, arguing that it was not a party to the Sanction Agreement and that it had never manifested an agreement to be bound by that Agreement's terms, including the arbitration provision. In light of this position, RIM did not directly respond to plaintiffs' assertion that RIM was bound by the arbitration provision because it was USAR's agent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b614 Notwithstanding its prior order dismissing the contract claims against RIM on the ground that RIM was not a party to the Sanction Agreement, the district court granted plaintiffs' motion to stay the case pending arbitration. In support of this ruling, the court did not rely on any claim that RIM was a party to the Sanction Agreement or that it had a prospective agency agreement with PRO Rugby. Instead, the court focused on the purported agency relationship between RIM and USAR. Specifically, the court found that the arbitration provision is phrased broadly and plainly subjects agents of both PRO Rugby and USAR to resolution by arbitration of any disputes brought by the other that are related to the Sanction Agreement. The court further found that USAR's control of and delegation of obligations to RIM (notwithstanding\n   the court's prior finding that USAR had\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   delegated any obligations to RIM) established that RIM was USAR's agent \"and thus squarely within the broad language of the arbitration provision.\" The court therefore ordered a \"full stay of this case pending the completion of arbitration.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b615 RIM then filed the present C.A.R. 21 petition, and we issued a rule to show cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b616 We begin by discussing our jurisdiction to hear this matter. After setting forth our standard of review, we proceed to analyze whether and in what circumstances a signatory can compel a nonsignatory to arbitrate by virtue of an arbitration provision contained in an agreement to which the nonsignatory is not a party. We conclude that the district court erred in compelling RIM to arbitrate here because RIM was not a party to the Sanction Agreement and because plaintiffs have not established that RIM fell within any of the recognized principles under which a contract signatory may compel a nonsignatory to arbitrate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Original Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b617 The exercise of our original jurisdiction under C.A.R. 21 rests within our sole discretion.\n   <em>\n    Fognani v.

Under prevailing statutory and case law, RIM has no right to file an interlocutory appeal from an order granting a motion to compel arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13-22-228(1)(a)-(b), C.R.S.

Accordingly, absent our intervention, RIM could be required to expend significant resources completing arbitration and confirming any arbitration award before it would have the opportunity to appeal. Because requiring RIM to do so would effectively deny it the relief that it seeks, we deem it appropriate to exercise our original jurisdiction in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Radil v.

Based on this, plaintiffs contend that we should discharge our order to show cause without reaching the above-described exceptions. Plaintiffs argue in the alternative, however, that should we reach the exceptions, then RIM is still bound by the arbitration provision of the Sanction Agreement because it was a third-party beneficiary of that Agreement, it was USAR's agent, and it is bound under a theory of equitable estoppel because it is seeking to enforce the rights and benefits that it received under the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b625 We view plaintiffs' contentions as framing the issues now before us, and we address each of those contentions in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b626 Plaintiffs first contend that the Sanction Agreement clearly and unambiguously required arbitration of any claim or dispute between PRO Rugby and USAR or against \"any agent, employee, successor, or assign of the other, whether related to [the Sanction] Agreement or otherwise.\" Plaintiffs further contend that because RIM is USAR's agent, it is bound by the arbitration provision's above-quoted plain language. Plaintiffs never explain, however, how a party to a contract can bind a nonparty to the terms of that contract without establishing legal or equitable grounds for doing so (e.g., assumption by the nonsignatory of obligations under the agreement, applicable agency principles, veil-piercing, equitable estoppel, or the nonsignatory's status as a successor-in-interest to a party to the contract or as a third-party beneficiary of the contract).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b627 Nor are we persuaded by plaintiffs' reliance on our decision in\n   <em>\n    Allen v.

That broad a principle would lead to absurd results (e.g., applied literally, such a principle would allow a signatory to argue successfully that a complete stranger to the agreement and to the parties thereto was bound because the parties to the agreement intended to bind the stranger). Rather, our statements in\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   must be read in context.

Rather, it received a promise of a subsequent agreement that would have provided benefits, but PRO Rugby and RIM never consummated that agreement.

Indeed, it has asserted\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   claims or counterclaims under that Agreement. To the contrary, it successfully argued that the contract claims against it should be dismissed because it is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   a party to the Agreement.

This general rule, however, is subject to certain exceptions, and a nonsignatory to an agreement containing an arbitration provision can be compelled to arbitrate when, as pertinent here, the nonsignatory is a third-party beneficiary of the agreement, traditional agency principles bind the nonsignatory to the arbitration provision, or the nonsignatory is equitably estopped from denying the applicability of the arbitration provision because, among other things, it is seeking to enforce rights or benefits conferred on it by the agreement containing the arbitration provision at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b642 Here, plaintiffs have not established that any of the foregoing exceptions apply. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court erred in determining that RIM is required to arbitrate the claims against it.
