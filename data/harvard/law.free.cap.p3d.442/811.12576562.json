Bartlett a private way of necessity (\"private condemnation\") over the Dabrowskis' property. Bartlett cross-appeals, contending he was entitled to either express easement rights or an easement by implied way of necessity. For the reasons set forth below, we hold that: (1) an unactivated easement is subject to a merger; (2) a common law easement by implied way of necessity does not exist if the severance of the parcel did not cause the lot to lack a reasonable outlet; (3) unity of ownership for a merger may occur even if the parties are technically different; (4) in a private condemnation action, a finding that a more reasonable route exists through the subject property constitutes \"bad faith, oppression, or abuse of power\" under\n   <em>\n    Solana Land Co. v.

Accordingly, we affirm the judgment on the easement claims and remand for the court to determine the route, scope, and cost of the private condemnation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 The parties dispute whether Bartlett should have access to his five-acre lot in Cave Creek over the Dabrowskis' adjacent lot. Both lots were part of a larger parcel that\n   was split into three lots in 1999, then identified as Parcels A, B, and C. In 2002, Parcel A was divided into three separate lots of approximately five acres each, which include the lots now owned by the Dabrowskis (\"Lot 1\") and Bartlett (\"Lot 2\") (collectively the \"Lots\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 Until 2007, Rockaway Hills Drive (the \"access road\") was the only road on the land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 2, 2000, Jack Lewis, the owner of Parcels A and B, declared an easement that reached Lot 2 through Lot 1 (the \"2000 Express Easement\") and then sold the Lots in Parcel A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 In April 2001, Lewis conveyed Parcel B to Andrew C. Jacob in his capacity as trustee of the ACJ [Andrew C. Jacob] Declaration of Trust (\"Jacob Trust\"). On September 18, 2001, Lewis reacquired the Lots via a trustee's sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 On September 18, 2002, the Town of Cave Creek approved a lot split (\"2002 Lot Split\"), which established the Lots as they currently appear. The survey that accompanied the 2002 Lot Split was prepared for Jacob and reflected an ingress, egress, and utility easement over Parcel B for the benefit of Lot 1, similar to the 2000 Express Easement, but did not extend to Lot 2. The month after the 2002 Lot Split was approved, Lewis conveyed Lots 1 and 2 to Jacob and his wife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Cave Creek approved a second lot split of Parcel A on April 11, 2003, based on a separate survey (\"2003 Lot Split\") also prepared for Jacob. The 2003 Lot Split was recorded on April 12, 2003. The survey, depicted below, showed an easement over Parcel B reaching the midpoint of the eastern\n   border of the Lots and did not encumber Lot 1 for the benefit of Lot 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 The next month, Jacob and his wife sold the Lots to Bartlett (\"Jacob-Bartlett conveyance\"). In 2005, Bartlett conveyed Lot 1 to Michael Hiltner and Julie Mahon but retained Lot 2 in his capacity as a trustee of the JoshuaBleu Trust (\"Bartlett-Hiltner conveyance\"). Bartlett did not record an express easement in connection with the conveyance. The Jacob Trust sold Parcel B to Bryan Anderson in June 2005.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 In 2007, Hiltner completed construction of a house and driveway located on Lot 1. Anderson began construction of his house on Parcel B in 2006, which was completed in 2014. The Dabrowskis acquired the house and property comprising Lot 1 via a trustee's sale in January 2012. A dispute arose shortly thereafter between the Dabrowskis and Bartlett regarding Bartlett's access to Lot 2, leading to the Dabrowskis filing suit to quiet title in 2013. Bartlett counterclaimed, alleging that he was entitled to an implied way of necessity, an implied easement of necessity, or in the alternative, a private condemnation across Lot 1. Bartlett later added a counterclaim alleging that he had express access rights via the 2000 Express Easement. At the time of trial, the land appeared as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 The superior court granted summary judgment to the Dabrowskis on Bartlett's express easement claim, finding that the 2000 Express Easement had terminated by a merger. The parties proceeded to a bench trial on the remaining claims. Following the trial, the court ruled that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [T]he 2003 Lot Split did not create a valid easement, there is no express easement, and there is no implied easement at this time over the Dabrowski property in favor of the Bartlett lot. The court further finds there is no other adequate alternative access to Bartlett's property. Accordingly, [Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") section] 12-1202 allows a [private condemnation] under the circumstances presented in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The court allowed Bartlett to \"select the route location and nature of the [private condemnation] ensuring the greatest amount of deference to the privacy and concerns of the Dabrowskis,\" ordered Bartlett to \"compensate the Dabrowskis for the easement over their property,\" and requested simultaneous briefing regarding the values of the available routes, stating that it could not \"provide a value based upon the testimony provided at the hearing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b610 In the post-trial briefing, the Dabrowskis submitted affidavits from a real estate appraiser, their trial expert, and Bogdan Dabrowski. They sought compensation ranging from $96,000 to $433,250 depending on Bartlett's choice of route. Bartlett objected, contending the affidavits had not been disclosed or offered at trial. The court overruled his objection and determined compensation for three potential routes as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"Graham #1\" Easement = $37,200\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \"Graham #2\" Easement = $36,000\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \"Slyder\" Easement = $96,250\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The considerably higher value assigned to the Slyder Easement reflected the increased burden the easement posed on the Dabrowskis' property. On Bartlett's motion for reconsideration, the court allowed him to present rebuttal evidence concerning value but affirmed its compensation determinations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b611 Bartlett submitted a proposed form of judgment. The Dabrowskis objected to the proposed judgment and asked the court to order Bartlett to compensate them when the easement was recorded, and to impose several new requirements on Bartlett, including: (1) indemnifying them for any liability resulting from construction; (2) repairing and maintaining their driveway following construction; (3) preserving unspoiled nature beyond 20 feet of the easement width; and (4) requiring Bartlett and his successors and assignees to equally share in future costs of the maintenance and repair of the shared roadway. The court rejected the Dabrowskis' requests and entered a partial final judgment ordering Bartlett to choose either the Graham #2 or Slyder Easement and to compensate the Dabrowskis before \"constructing a roadway ... or by June 1, 2017, whichever is earliest.\" The judgment is silent on the timing of the recording. The court also ordered the parties to bear their attorney's fees and costs, ruling that Bartlett's statement of costs was untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b612 The Dabrowskis timely appealed, and Bartlett timely cross-appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The Dabrowskis contend that the Lots' access through Parcel B terminated through merger when Jacob owned the Lots and Parcel B concurrently in 2002.

Jacob applied for and received certification for the 2002 Lot Split, and it was recorded. The month before selling the Lots to Bartlett, Jacob obtained another lot survey from Gray.

First, Jacob commissioned the 2002 Lot Split when Parcel B was owned by Jacob Trust. Jacob and his wife purchased the Lots after the Town of Cave Creek approved the lot split, and the survey was recorded. Next, Ian Cordwell, the Director of Planning and the Zoning Administrator for the Town of Cave Creek, testified that Jacob applied for a building permit for Lot 2 on March 11, 2003. The town would not approve a building permit unless the owner of the property could show that each lot had access from a dedicated public right of way to the parcel itself. At the time of Jacob's application for the building permit, he indicated that Lot 2 lacked access. Subsequently, Jacob again commissioned Gray to create the 2003 Lot Split, which provided access to Lot 2 without burdening Lot 1. Jacob then applied for the lot split, which was approved and recorded. Cordwell, who accepted both lot splits, testified that he believed the 2003 Lot Split was intended to establish an access point for Lot 2 through Parcel B and served as a replacement to the 2002 Lot Split.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b633 Jacob obtained and recorded lot splits that depicted access to the Lots through various access points in Parcel B immediately preceding Lewis's sale to Jacob and Jacob's sale to Bartlett. The 2002 and 2003 Lot Splits demonstrated that Jacob, as the trustee, exercised the control over Parcel B required to situate the land in a manner that benefited the Lots when Jacob and his wife purchased the Lots, and again as the seller of the Lots. As the Lots' seller, Jacob arranged access through Parcel B in a manner that was beneficial to the Lots, but detrimental to Parcel B, because of the proximity of the shared driveway to the location of the proposed home on Parcel B. Such control is sufficient to conclude that there was unity of ownership over the Lots and Parcel B. We conclude that Jacob's concurrent ownership extinguished any express easement that existed on Parcel B concerning the Lots. There was approximately a quarter mile between Lot 1's eastern boundary and the access road, for which the Lots did not have legal access-via an express easement-at the time of the Jacob-Bartlett conveyance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3, Figure 1. Accordingly, the Lots did not have an express easement through Parcel B at the time of severance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Bartlett Failed to Show Sufficient Evidence of the Need for Reasonable Access at the Time of the Bartlett-Hiltner Conveyance.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b634 Without legal access, Bartlett was required to show that at the time of the Bartlett-Hiltner conveyance he lacked reasonable access to his property. Bartlett argues\n   that Lot 2 does not have-and never has had-access through Parcel B. However, as noted above, immediately before selling the Lots to Bartlett, Jacob applied for a building permit concerning Lot 2 and recorded the 2003 Lot Split. The 2003 Lot Split was recorded before the Jacob-Bartlett conveyance and was listed as an exception in Bartlett's title report for the Jacob-Bartlett conveyance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b635 Michael Johnson, Bartlett's and Hiltner's architectural designer, testified that the 2003 Lot Split was provided to him when he began designing the Bartlett and Hiltner homes in 2006. He testified that there were \"a lot of different discussions because of the confusion\" of the two access points. Johnson stated that at some point Bartlett and Hiltner agreed to follow the entrance point through Lot 1 to cut costs and create less disturbance by sharing a driveway and utility site. With that plan, most of the disturbance fell on Lot 1, allowing Bartlett to build the larger home he wanted on Lot 2. Johnson also recalled that he wanted the driveway to conform with the 2003 Lot Split, but Bartlett refused. Ultimately, Johnson testified that Bartlett and Hiltner could not reach an agreement, and Hiltner built his driveway and home without Bartlett's assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b636 Although Bartlett asserted that he has always understood access to Lot 2 would be through Lot 1, he could not point to a recorded document to support that understanding. Bartlett insists that it was both his and Hiltner's intent that the shared driveway would follow the 2000 Express Easement. However, the completed Lot 1 driveway does not conform with the 2000 Express Easement; instead, it follows the 2002 Lot Split. Moreover, Bartlett failed to record an express easement granting access for Lot 2 through Lot 1 at the time of the Bartlett-Hiltner conveyance, although he stated that access through Lot 1 was the parties' intent. Bartlett, a mortgage broker at the time, failed to disclose his need for access through Lot 1 in the seller property disclosure statement, which he provided in connection with the Bartlett-Hiltner conveyance. The placement of the driveway and Bartlett's subsequent actions in connection with the Bartlett-Hiltner conveyance do not support Bartlett's contention that Lot 2's access was intended through the 2000 Express Easement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b637 There is conflicting evidence in the record regarding the intended access point for the Lots at the time of the Jacob-Bartlett conveyance. The superior court weighed the credibility of the witnesses along with the other evidence and concluded there was no implied way of necessity between the Lots. Given that the 2003 Lot Split indicates a reasonable access point for both lots, the superior court did not abuse its discretion by finding Bartlett failed to establish that Lot 2 lacked reasonable access in 2005 at the time of the severance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coll.

We do not need to decide whether the 2003 Lot Split evidences a valid easement because the mere fact that an alternate legal outlet is available to Bartlett does not, as a matter of law, preclude him from condemning a way over Lot 1.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Solana,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5160530\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/69/117/#p125\">\n    69 Ariz. 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 125,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5160530\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/69/117/#p125\">\n    210 P.2d 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1949) (\"[T]he condemnor need not show an absolute necessity for the taking, a reasonable necessity being sufficient.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b644 When determining whether a reasonable necessity exists, the court looks to whether the proponent of the private condemnation has an alternative legal route that is both adequate and reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Tobias v.

Because there is sufficient evidence in the record to support the superior court's conclusion that \"[t]here is no other adequate alternative access\" to Lot 2, the court did not abuse its discretion by ordering a private condemnation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b645 The route on the 2003 Lot Split may have been reasonable and adequate at the time of the Jacob-Bartlett conveyance. However, subsequent events show that it may no longer be a reasonable alternative. Anderson testified that at the time he purchased Parcel\n   B, the land only contained the access road and a well. After acquiring Parcel B, Anderson constructed a home, and the access road now leads to his driveway and garage. The Town of Cave Creek requires a road or driveway that services more than one single-family residence to be 16 feet wide with shoulders on each side that are at least two feet wide. To obtain a building permit from the Town of Cave Creek, Bartlett needs a 20-foot-wide easement for the entirety of the easement through the Anderson property. The Anderson driveway is currently 11-12 feet wide and some portions of the driveway have no shoulder at all. Anderson's utilities are on the west side of the driveway, and there is solid rock to the east. In short, the current specifications of the driveway do not comply with the Rural/Metro Fire Department standards for a roadway servicing more than one residence. Civil engineer Christopher Wilson testified that the amount of disturbance that would result from building the road following the 2003 Lot Split would leave approximately 90 square feet available for the actual home on Bartlett's lot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b646 These facts support the superior court's finding that there is no other adequate and reasonable alternative access to Lot 2 and its conclusion that Bartlett is entitled to a private condemnation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Bartlett is Not Required to Seek Alternative Routes.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b647 The Dabrowskis argue that Bartlett is not entitled to a private condemnation because Bartlett failed to establish both that \"the Town of Cave Creek would not allow Bartlett to build a roadway to the west or south of Bartlett's Lot\" and that he \"could not obtain an easement to the west or south of his Lot.\" Thus, the Dabrowskis contend, Bartlett failed to show a reasonable necessity for the taking. The Dabrowskis do not offer legal authority for this contention. Bartlett was not obligated to explore alternative outlets for which he did not have legal access.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Solana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5160530\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/69/117/#p125\">\n    69 Ariz. at 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5160530\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/69/117/#p125\">\n    210 P.2d 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"There is no merit to defendants' contention that [the statute permitting residents to petition to establish a highway], gives to plaintiff an appropriate and expedient method of obtaining a means of ingress and egress to its property by petitioning the board of supervisors for the establishment of a county highway....

But unlike\n   <em>\n    Gulotta\n   </em>\n   , there is no evidence that Bartlett appreciated the danger of losing his access or voluntarily relinquished access to seek a private condemnation from the Dabrowskis.

We affirm the superior court's determination that Bartlett is entitled to a private condemnation but vacate the portion of the order concerning the route, compensation, terms, and scope, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    Because neither party raised the issue of whether granting a common law easement by implied way of necessity is proper under Article 2, \u00a7 17 of the Arizona Constitution and the legislature's prescribed remedy for landlocked property in A.R.S. \u00a7 12-1202, we assume without deciding that a conveyance that causes a property to become landlocked may be entitled to an easement by implied way of necessity.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    A.R.S. \u00a7 12-1103(B) provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n    If a party, twenty days prior to bringing the action to quiet title to real property, requests the person, other than the state, holding an apparent adverse interest or right therein to execute a quit claim deed thereto, and also tenders to him five dollars for execution and delivery of the deed, and if such person refuses or neglects to comply, the filing of a disclaimer of interest or right shall not avoid the costs and the court may allow plaintiff, in addition to the ordinary costs, an attorney's fee to be fixed by the court.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    Bartlett appeals the court's allowance of post-trial evidence to determine the property's value. We decline to address the issue because the \"taking\" has not yet occurred and upon remand the court may admit additional evidence.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
