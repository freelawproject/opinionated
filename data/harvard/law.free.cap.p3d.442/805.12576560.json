Mashler (\"Ernest\") appeals from the superior court's judgment denying\n   his petition to partition certain real property (\"Farmland\") and approving the restatement of his mother's trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 We address in this opinion whether precatory language in a will directed to a personal representative or executor rather than devisees creates an enforceable instruction. We hold that, read with the other provisions of a will, precatory language may create an enforceable directive rather than a discretionary request. Additionally, we conclude that the trial court erred in approving a restatement of the decedent's trust, permitting the trustees to \"decant\" an otherwise irrevocable trust. We hold that, pursuant to Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") section 14-10819(A)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   , a trustee has discretion to decant-the authority to appoint or distribute trust property to a new or different existing trust with terms that differ from those of the original trust-only when the trust instrument expressly provides.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 Accordingly, we affirm the court's denial of Ernest's petition to partition the Farmland but vacate the court's order approving restatement of the trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 In 1986, Lucille F. Sibley (\"Lucille\") and her husband, Phillip R. Sibley (\"Phil\"), created the Phil R. Sibley &amp; Lucille F. Sibley Trust (the \"Trust\"), which became irrevocable upon their deaths. Lucille and Phil had one child together, Patricia Sibley Knott, and Lucille had three children by a prior marriage, Ernest, Christine Wolleson (\"Christine\"), and John Mashler (\"John\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 When Phil died in 2004, Lucille's separate property and her share of the community property were allocated to \"Trust A.\" When Lucille died in 2015, the Trust directed that the remaining principal and income of Trust A be distributed pursuant to the terms of Lucille's Last Will and Testament (the \"Will\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 The Will directed that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    [A]ll liquid assets of Trust \"A\"\n   </strong>\n   shall be divided into three equal shares and distributed free of trust to: [Ernest, Christine, and John,] or their issue per stirpes.\n   <strong>\n    It is my desire that the real property ( [F]armland)\n   </strong>\n   which is part of Trust \"A\" ... be held in further trust and that the income of such [F]armland, after the payment of expenses to keep it in trust, be divided equally among [Ernest, Christine, and John,] or their issue per stirpes. Unless required to satisfy the administration of my estate ...\n   <strong>\n    I desire that the [F]armland not be sold until my youngest great-grandchild reaches the age of twenty-one\n   </strong>\n   . At such time, the proceeds of which would be distributed equally to [Ernest, Christine, and John,] or their issue per stirpes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 7 Upon Lucille's death, John applied to superior court for the informal probate of the Will and appointment of a personal representative. The court appointed John as personal representative. John and Christine were the remaining co-trustees of the Trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 8 Approximately one year later, John petitioned the superior court to approve the exercise of his and Christine's power, pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 14-10819, to restate the terms of the Trust. He asserted that the Trust \"was outdated and lacked modern administrative provisions.\" Christine later joined the action. Ernest objected to their petition and filed his own petition seeking to partition the Farmland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 9 After a hearing on both petitions, the superior court entered a judgment (1) denying Ernest's petition to partition the Farmland and (2) approving John and Christine's restatement of the Trust. Ernest timely appealed from the judgment, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to Article 6, Section 9, of the Arizona Constitution, A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-120.21(A)(1), and -2101(A)(9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    I. Statute of Limitations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 10 As a preliminary matter, John and Christine argue that Ernest was barred from contesting the validity of the Trust by A.R.S. \u00a7 14-10604(A). That statute provides, in relevant part, that \"[a] person may commence a judicial proceeding to contest the validity of a trust\n   <strong>\n    that was revocable at the settlor's death\n   </strong>\n   within ... [o]ne year after the settlor's death.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 14-10604(A)(1) (emphasis added). Here, the Trust became irrevocable upon Phil's and Lucille's deaths. Therefore, \u00a7 14-10604, which applies to revocable trusts, did not preclude Ernest from contesting the validity of the Trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 11 John and Christine additionally argue that A.R.S. \u00a7 14-3306 also prohibits Ernest from contesting the Trust. Section 14-3306 prohibits an heir \"from commencing a formal testacy proceeding to contest the probate of the will after four months have elapsed\" following receipt of information regarding informal probate of a will. A.R.S. \u00a7 14-3306(B). John and Christine's brief, however, fails to explain how this statute applies to bar Ernest's petition to partition the Farmland or his objection to John and Christine's petition to restate the Trust.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ARCAP 13(a)(7) (requiring \"supporting reasons for each contention\" with citations to legal authorities). Accordingly, they have waived this argument on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Polanco v. Indus.

Further, Ernest did not commence a formal testacy proceeding to contest the probate of the Will; simply stated, \u00a7 14-3306 does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    II. Construction of the Will\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 12 In appealing the denial of his motion to partition the Farmland, Ernest first argues the superior court improperly interpreted the Will \"as directing that the Farmland be held in trust.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 13 The \"cardinal rule\" of will construction is to ascertain the intent of the testator from the words of the will.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Newhall v. McGill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5159339\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/69/259/#p262\">\n    69 Ariz. 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 262,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5159339\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/69/259/#p262\">\n    212 P.2d 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1949). On appeal, we review any legal issues raised\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , and apply \"the appropriate legal standard to the facts found\" by the superior court.\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Shumway\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"274404\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/198/323/#p326\">\n    198 Ariz. 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 326, \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"274404\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/198/323/#p326\">\n    9 P.3d 1062\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1065 (2000). \"[W]e do not reweigh conflicting evidence\" but rather \"examine the record only to determine whether substantial evidence exists\" to support the court's ruling.\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Pouser\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"747640\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/193/574/#p579\">\n    193 Ariz. 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 579, \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"747640\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/193/574/#p579\">\n    975 P.2d 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 709 (1999).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 14 Lucille's intent regarding the disposition of her \"liquid assets\" is easily ascertained from the language of the Will. She stated that the assets \"shall be divided into three equal shares and distributed free of trust\" to Ernest, Christine, and John. Her intent regarding the Farmland was expressed differently. She indicated that it was her \"desire\" that the Farmland \"be held in further trust and that the income of such [F]armland, after the payment of expenses to keep it in trust, be divided equally among\" Ernest, Christine, and John. She further expressed her \"desire\" that the Farmland not be sold until her youngest great-grandchild turned twenty-one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 15 The phrase \"I desire\" is \"precatory,\" which means \"requesting, recommending, or expressing a desire rather than a command.\"\n   <em>\n    Precatory\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). A precatory trust is \"[a] trust that the law will recognize to carry out the wishes of the testator or grantor even though the statement in question is in the nature of an entreaty or recommendation rather than a command.\"\n   <em>\n    Precatory trust\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). The issue we must resolve is whether Lucille's words placed the Farmland in the Trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 16 More than seventy-seven years ago, the Arizona Supreme Court addressed the effect of precatory language in a will. The court interpreted a will that provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   It is my wish, though this is not a restriction or a limitation upon the use and enjoyment of the legacies and bequests herein made, that my estate, after the payment of my debts, the cash bequests and expenses\n   of administration, shall be kept among the descendants of my late father and mother.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    In re Hayward's Estate\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2437285\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/57/51/#p58\">\n    57 Ariz. 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 58,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2437285\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/57/51/#p58\">\n    110 P.2d 956\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1941). Our supreme court concluded that this language constituted \"a recommendation or request directed to legatees and devisees\" rather than a command.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2437285\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/57/51/#p58\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2437285\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/57/51/#p58\">\n    at 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2437285\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/57/51/#p58\">\n    110 P.2d 956\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In reaching this conclusion, however, the court acknowledged \"many cases\" in which precatory language is properly \"construed as dispositive.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2437285\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/57/51/#p58\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2437285\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/57/51/#p58\">\n    at 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2437285\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/57/51/#p58\">\n    110 P.2d 956\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court cited with approval a California case holding that \"[w]here the words are used to describe a disposition of property, that is, where they are directed to the executor or to the law, and not to a devisee or legatee, the authorities are uniform that the word ['desire'] is sufficient to declare a disposition of the property.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2437285\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/57/51/#p58\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2437285\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/57/51/#p58\">\n    at 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2437285\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/57/51/#p58\">\n    110 P.2d 956\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Tooley's Estate\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2037046\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal/170/164/\">\n    170 Cal. 164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=149%20P.%20574\">\n    149 P. 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 575 (1915) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 17 Several years later in\n   <em>\n    Newhall v.

Her words \"it is my desire\" are not directed to her devisees but to the personal representative of her estate. Unlike the testator in\n   <em>\n    Hayward's Estate\n   </em>\n   , Lucille did not include qualifying language stating that her desire should not be construed as \"a restriction or limitation.\" And, most importantly, the Will reflects Lucille's intent to dispose of her \"liquid assets\" separately and differently from the Farmland. She expressly directed that her liquid assets be distributed \"free of trust.\" If Lucille wanted the same disposition for the Farmland, she would have so stated. Instead, she addressed the Farmland separately and expressed her will that it be held in \"further trust.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 19 On appeal, Ernest argues that the superior court's ruling contradicts the testimony of Stephen Shadle, the attorney who drafted the Will. Although it is true that Shadle testified that the word \"desire\" was precatory and not obligatory, his testimony was contradicted by a letter he sent following Lucille's death that stated, \"I think the time for closing the Trust and selling is about ten years out,\" and that he needed \"to get great grandchildren birth dates nailed down to get the exact date.\" The letter suggests Shadle's pre-litigation understanding that the Farmland should be held in \"further trust.\" It is not for this Court to reweigh conflicting evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Pouser\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"747640\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/193/574/#p579\">\n    193 Ariz. at 579, \u00b6 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"747640\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/193/574/#p579\">\n    975 P.2d 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 20 We conclude that the language of the Will supports the superior court's finding that Lucille intended the Farmland to be held in trust until her youngest great-grandchild,\n   alive at the time of Lucille's death, reaches the age of twenty-one. Accordingly, we affirm the court's denial of Ernest's petition to partition the Farmland.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    III. Restatement of the Trust\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 21 Ernest next argues that the superior court erred in approving John and Christine's restatement of the Trust pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 14-10819. He asserts that the power to appoint under \u00a7 14-10819 arises only when \"the trustee has 'discretion' with respect to trust asset or income distributions,\" and that the Trust here did not provide such discretion. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 22 Section 14-10819 provides, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Unless the terms of the trust instrument expressly provide otherwise,\n   <strong>\n    a trustee who has the discretion under the terms of a testamentary instrument or irrevocable inter vivos agreement to make distributions\n   </strong>\n   , regardless of whether a standard is provided in the trust instrument to or\n   <strong>\n    for the benefit of a beneficiary\n   </strong>\n   of the trust, may exercise without prior court approval the trustee's discretion by appointing part or all of the trust property in favor of a trustee of another trust.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 14-10819(A) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 23 Section 14-10819(A) grants a trustee the power to \"decant\" an irrevocable trust under certain conditions. As explained by the Uniform Law Commission, decanting refers to \"the distribution of assets from one trust into a second trust, like wine is decanted from the bottle to another vessel.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   A trustee with decanting power has \"authority to amend an unamendable trust, in the sense that he or she may distribute the trust property to a second trust with terms that differ from those of the original trust.\"\n   <em>\n    Morse v.

Thus, it is a trustee's discretionary authority to make distributions in favor of a beneficiary that provides the premise for decanting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   William R. Culp, Jr., Briani Bennett Mellen,\n   <em>\n    Trust Decanting: An Overview and Introduction to Creative Planning Opportunities\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20Real%20Prop.%20Tr.%20%26%20Est.%20L.J.%201\">\n    45 Real Prop. Tr. &amp; Est. L.J. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   37-38 (2010). Based on this rationale, Arizona's statute, like those of other states, requires that a trustee have the power to make discretionary distributions for the benefit of a beneficiary under the terms of the original trust.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 14-10819(A) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ferri v.

Prior to Lucille's death, the trustees had discretion to distribute principal for the benefit of Lucille's \"maintenance, support, health and well being.\" Upon Lucille's death, the trustees had discretion to draw upon the principal to cover any funeral expenses and death taxes. However, the Trust provides no authority for the trustees\n   to make discretionary distributions for the benefit of the beneficiaries following Lucille's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 26 John and Christine cite Article IV(B) of the Trust, which provides that, upon Lucille's death, the trustees:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   [S]hall distribute the then remaining principal and undistributed income to or hold the same for the benefit of such person or persons or the estate of [Lucille] in such amounts and proportions, for such estates and interests, and outright, or upon such terms, trusts, conditions and limitations as [Lucille] shall appoint by a Will referring specifically to this power of appointment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   This provision directs John and Christine to distribute or hold the Trust principal and income in compliance with Lucille's Will. It does not grant John and Christine discretion over the distribution of principal or income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 27 Alternatively, John and Christine argue \"that the discretionary power need not come directly from the testamentary instruments themselves.\" We disagree. Section 14-10819 expressly requires that the trustee's discretion come from \"the terms of a testamentary instrument or irrevocable inter vivos agreement.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 14-10819(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 28 Because the Trust does not grant John and Christine the discretion to make distributions for the benefit of the beneficiaries, they did not have the authority to restate the Trust pursuant to \u00a7 14-10819. Accordingly, we vacate that portion of the superior court's judgment. The original Trust remains in effect. If the parties wish to modify the Trust going forward, they must follow the appropriate statutory procedure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 14-10410.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    IV. Attorneys' Fees\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 29 John and Christine request an award of attorneys' fees on appeal pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 14-11004, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   A. A trustee ... is entitled to reimbursement from the trust for that person's reasonable fees, expenses and disbursement, including attorney fees and costs, that arise out of and that relate to the good faith defense or prosecution of a judicial ... proceeding involving the administration of the trust, regardless of whether the defense or prosecution is successful.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   B. A court ... may order that a party's reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements pursuant to subsection A be paid by any other party or the trust that is the subject of the judicial proceeding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 14-11004. We grant John and Christine's request for an award of reasonable attorneys' fees and costs on appeal to be paid by the Trust pursuant to \u00a7 14-11004(A) but deny their request for fees against Ernest personally pursuant to \u00a7 14-11004(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 30 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the superior court's denial of Ernest's petition to partition the Farmland but vacate the court's approval of the restated trust. We award John and Christine their reasonable attorneys' fees and costs on appeal upon their timely compliance with Arizona Rule of Civil Appellate Procedure 21.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    We cite the current versions of all applicable statutes as no revisions material to this opinion have since occurred.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Patricia Sibley Knott is not a party to this appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The Missouri Court of Appeals recently articulated the rule set forth in\n    <em>\n     Newhall\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Day v.

The superior court found that the language of the Will could \"be construed to apply to the youngest great-grandchild then living at the time of Lucille's death.\" Ernest has not challenged this ruling on appeal. Accordingly, we do not review the superior court's finding.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    <em>\n     The Uniform Trust Decanting Act, A Summary\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     http://www.uniformlaws.org/shared/docs/trustdecanting/UTDA% 20-% 20Summary.pdf\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    The Uniform Trust Decanting Act likewise authorizes decanting only when the trust confers discretionary distribution powers.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Uniform Trust Decanting Act , \u00a7\u00a7 11, 12 ( Unif.
