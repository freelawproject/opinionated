Contrary to that request, the body of Father's motion contested the validity of the child support order, not the Income Withholding Order. Specifically, he claimed\n   the minimum obligation under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2020-2-304\">\n    Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 20-2-304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) violates federal law. Thus, although Father requests that he be relieved \"from the\n   <em>\n    Income Withholding Order\n   </em>\n   ,\" he apparently does not distinguish between an income withholding order and an order establishing his child support. His motion requests that his child support obligation be vacated and that the district court return any money he has paid in child support. He presents no argument that the Income Withholding Order, itself, was improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [\u00b611] Father could have actually sought relief from the child support order under W.R.C.P. 60(b), if that was his intent. A challenge to an income withholding order can be brought under the procedures set forth in the Income Withholding Act. In addition, there are statutory procedures for modification of a child support order.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2020-6-216\">\n    Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 20-6-216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 20-6-209 (LexisNexis 2017). The statutory grounds for challenging an income withholding order include: modification, termination or suspension of the support order; full payment of arrearages; modification to conform to statutory maximum withholding limitations; inability to deliver withheld income to obligee because of an invalid delivery address; an agreement with the obligee; an improper service of notices; disputes over the amount of current support; and/or disputes over the identity of the obligor.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2020-6-216\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These statutes make it clear that a challenge to a child support order is not the same as a challenge to an income withholding order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b612] Father has not provided any cogent argument supporting his challenge to the Income Withholding Order. He has not provided any authority indicating that a challenge to the Income Withholding Order could result in the relief he seeks. We summarily affirm denial of Father's Rule 60(b) motion seeking relief from the Income Withholding Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [\u00b613] Even if we were to assume, as suggested in the dissent, that Father actually intended to challenge the original order establishing his child support, there are significant reasons to summarily affirm denial of his 60(b) motion. First, Father fails to present a record which would enable review of his claim.\n   <em>\n    Montoya v. Navarette-Montoya\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8994444\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/125/265/\">\n    2005 WY 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8994444\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/125/265/\">\n    125 P.3d 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 268 (Wyo. 2005) (\"It is [the Appellant's] burden to supply this Court with a sufficient record so that a proper evaluation of the trial court's decision can be conducted.\"). The record in this case does not establish that the presumptive minimum child support was applied to Father as the result of an irrebuttable presumption. There is no financial affidavit, either then or now, showing Father's income when the child support was established. The district court did not calculate a presumptive amount of child support. The district court did not make findings about income of either of the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [\u00b614] The court did make these findings: (1) deviation from the support guidelines was necessary; (2) Father was not scheduled to be released from prison until late November 2012; (3) Father was not realistically able to earn imputed income; and (4) it was in the children's best interest that Father pay $50.00. These findings do not necessarily indicate that Father did not have income from other sources, and they do not necessarily indicate his monthly income was less than $200.00.

The finding he was \"not realistically able to earn imputed income\" might mean he was not able to earn anything at all, or it might mean he was not able to earn minimum wage for 40 hours-the typical basis of imputed income.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Whichever meaning the trial court intended, there was no finding about other income. From the record, we cannot know if the court found $50.00 appropriate because of the presence of other income, an irrebuttable presumption, a rebuttable presumption, Father's stipulation, or based on other evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Leniency\n   for a pro se appellant cannot overcome a record that requires conjecture and speculation to reach a result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [\u00b615] Second, Father fails to present any cogent argument or statutory analysis to support his claim that Wyoming's statutory approach to setting child support includes an irrebuttable presumption. It is arguable that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2020-2-304\">\n    Wyo. Stat.
