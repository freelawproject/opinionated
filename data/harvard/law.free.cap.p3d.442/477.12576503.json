The respondent timely filed an answer to the complaint on January 18, 2018. A proposed probation plan was filed January 22, 2018. Stipulations signed by respondent and the office of the Disciplinary Administrator were filed August 7, 2018. Upon motion to continue which was granted on March 7, 2018, a hearing was held on the complaint before a panel of the Kansas Board for Discipline of Attorneys on August 28, 2018, where the respondent was personally present and was represented by counsel. The hearing panel determined that respondent violated KRPC 1.1 (2019 Kan. S. Ct. R. 295) (competence); 1.3 (2019 Kan. S. Ct. R. 298) (diligence); 8.4(c) (2019 Kan. S. Ct. R. 387) (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation); and 8.4(d) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice). Respondent stipulated to violating KRPC 3.4 (d) (2019 Kan. S. Ct. R. 353) (failure to comply with discovery request) and KRPC 8.4(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Upon conclusion of the hearing, the panel made the following findings of fact and conclusions of law, together with its recommendation to this court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Findings of Fact\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \"DA12201\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"12.

The respondent also failed to draft a case management conference order as directed by the court. As a result, counsel for the defendants drafted a case management order on August 8, 2014.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \"20. The respondent failed to disclose an expert witness by August 1, 2014, as ordered by the court.

On September 5, 2014, the court held the next scheduled case management conference. The court ordered the parties to develop a new case management order.

The respondent failed to sign and return the case management order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \"22. The respondent failed to provide discovery by September 12, 2014. The respondent failed to provide a written statement of monetary damages by September 12, 2014. The respondent failed to disclose his expert witness by September 22, 2014.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \"23. On October 2, 2014, counsel for the defendants filed a second motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \"24. On October 6, 2014, the respondent filed a designation of expert witness by fax. The respondent named Don Horton, R.N. as the expert witness. The respondent signed the designation. The respondent included certain factual allegations and the following to summarize Mr. Horton's opinions:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   'The expert witness believes these Defendants negligently failed to promulgate policies, procedures and/or systems to ensure that the proper hospital personnel could take quick corrective action in this instance. In the alternative, the hospital personnel who did receive the warnings described above, failed to act prudently in light of these warnings and failed to protect the Plaintiff from three threatening male patients. The expert witness believes that the warnings which Tim and she timely gave to the Defendants and/or their employees were more than sufficient to enable them to act in a timely fashion to easily and effectively protect the Plaintiff by physically intervening and physically separating the male patients from her before she was finally attacked.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   \"25. Also on October 6, 2014, the respondent filed plaintiff's statement of monetary damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   \"26. On October 24, 2014, the respondent filed a response to the defendant's motion to dismiss.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   \"27. On October 29, 2014, the court entered a second amended case management order which had previously been approved by the parties. It appears that the second amended case management order was drafted with the expectation that it would be entered in September, 2014. Many of the deadlines delineated in the order had passed by the time the order was signed. In addition, the court set the following deadlines:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   a. the defendant was required to make expert witness disclosures by November 7, 2014;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   b. the plaintiff was required to undergo the statutory medical examination by November 7, 2014;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   c. the parties were required to complete all discovery by December 8, 2014; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   d. the parties were required to file all dispositive motions by January 19, 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   \"28. On November 7, 2014, the respondent filed a second designation of expert witness, naming Gerald Gentry, Ph.D., as an expert in the case. The document contained the same opinion language as the designation of Mr. Horton.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24, above. Again, the designation was signed by the respondent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   \"29. Also on November 7, 2014, the court heard the defendants' motion to dismiss. During the hearing, the respondent indicated that he filed the second expert witness designation because Mr. Horton was unavailable. The court took the motion under advisement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   \"30. The respondent provided counsel for the defendant authorization to contact Mr. Horton to discuss the initial expert witness designation. On November 17, 2014, the defendants filed an objection to plaintiff's expert witness designation because Mr. Horton 'never agreed to be an expert witness and [he] informed [the respondent] that he did not believe Plaintiff had a case.' The respondent responded indicating that he was negligent in taking notes of interviews with potential expert witnesses and attributed the statements of another to Mr. Horton.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   \"31. On April 29, 2015, the court took up the defendant's objection to the plaintiff's expert witness disclosure and a motion for sanctions. The parties were afforded an opportunity to argue the issues.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   \"32. On May 16, 2016, the court issued a written ruling on the objection and motion. The court found that the respondent failed to prosecute the plaintiff's case. The court found that it had been more than seven years since the date of the alleged injury and that the time lapse would affect the memory of witnesses and make it impractical, if not impossible, for the defendants to present a defense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   \"33. The court found that the respondent missed numerous deadlines. The court stated that the 'Plaintiff has, with very rare exception, failed to comply with deadlines set by this Court or agreed to by Plaintiff.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   \"34. The court noted that the 6th Judicial District Local Rule 14 requires a party designating an expert to submit, '[a] written report signed by the witness' which 'shall contain a complete statement of all opinions to be expressed and the bases and reasons therefore.' Neither untimely expert witness designation filed by the respondent complied with Local Rule 14. The district court concluded:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   '... [expert witness designations] were neither signed by the expert holding the opinions, nor contained a complete statement of all opinions to be expressed and the bases and reasons therefore as evidenced by the false disclosure of Don Horton and the arguments by counsel regarding the deposition testimony of Gerald Gentry.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   The court further explained that had the respondent complied with the local rule, the respondent would not have provided the 'untrue witness designation of Mr. Horton because Mr. Horton would have had to review and sign the disclosure, affording Plaintiff the opportunity to realize the mistaken identity.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   \"35. As a result, the court sanctioned the respondent by dismissing the case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   \"36. On June 16, 2016, the respondent filed a request that the court alter or\n   amend its judgment and/or grant a new hearing on the motion to dismiss and/or grant relief from judgment. The respondent's requests were denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   \"37. The respondent filed a notice of appeal in the case on September 23, 2016. The respondent filed three motions requesting extensions of time to file an opening brief. On August 4, 2017, the Kansas Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's decision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   a. The Kansas Court of Appeals found that the respondent failed to provide citations to the record as required by court rule to support his claim that the court found fraud on the part of the respondent as a basis for dismissing C.Z.'s case. The court stated that the respondent did not support his argument with citations because there was no evidence in the record that the district court based the dismissal on fraud.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   b. The court also found that the delay caused prejudice to the defendants in the case. The court noted that defense counsel had contacted all eight employees of the hospital who were present at the time of the alleged incident with C.Z. Out of the eight, only two remembered C.Z. and none remembered the alleged incident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   c. Additionally, the court concluded that the respondent's conduct in repeatedly missing deadlines interfered with the judicial system.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   d. Finally, the court found that there was 'ample evidence from which a reasonable person could have found that Boone failed to prosecute C.Z.'s case to such an extent that dismissal was warranted.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   \"38. Three days after the Kansas Court of Appeals released its opinion, Chief Judge Arnold-Burger, of the Kansas Court of Appeals, reported the respondent's conduct in this case to the disciplinary administrator's office.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   \"39. On September 1, 2017, the respondent filed a motion for rehearing or modification. The court denied the respondent's motion for rehearing or modification with the Kansas Court of Appeals. The respondent filed a petition for review with the Kansas Supreme Court. On April 27, 2018, the court denied the respondent's petition for review.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   \"DA12772\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   \"40. The president of Kape Roofing and Gutters retained Michael Alley to collect $ 5,100 from C.M.C. Mr. Alley filed a mechanic's lien against C.M.C.'s house and sent a demand letter to C.M.C. After Mr. Alley filed the mechanic's lien, C.M.C. placed signs in his yard critical of Kape's work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   \"41. Later, Kape's president retained the respondent to file suit against C.M.C. and Community First National Bank (hereinafter 'the bank') in Dickinson County, Kansas, on behalf of himself and Kape (hereinafter 'the plaintiffs'). On July 9, 2012, the respondent filed suit in Dickinson County on behalf of the plaintiffs. On August 3, 2012, the respondent filed an amended petition. The respondent sought a permanent injunction against C.M.C. as well as damages for defamation, tortious interference with a prospective business advantage, and breach of contract. The respondent also sought to foreclose on the mechanic's lien. During the litigation, the respondent asserted that the plaintiffs' damages were $ 7,200,000 in lost income and profits and $ 250,000 for pain, suffering, and mental anguish.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   \"42. C.M.C. filed an answer and counterclaim alleging fraud and the tort of outrage. The bank filed an answer on November 15, 2012.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   \"43. On December 31, 2012, the bank served the plaintiffs with discovery. The respondent did not timely respond to the request for discovery. Counsel for the bank conferred with the respondent on several occasions regarding the production of timely discovery. However, the respondent did not timely file the responses to discovery nor did the respondent lodge an objection to the discovery requests. On April 4, 2013, the bank filed a motion to compel discovery.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   \"44. On January 24, 2013, C.M.C. served discovery on the plaintiffs. The respondent did not timely provide the discovery. Counsel\n   for C.M.C. conferred with the respondent on numerous occasions to secure discovery and avoid court action. On April 5, 2013, counsel for C.M.C. sent a Golden Rule letter. However, the respondent did not timely file responses to discovery nor did he make any objections. On April 15, 2013, C.M.C. filed a motion to compel discovery.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   \"45. The court scheduled a hearing on the motions to compel discovery for April 26, 2013. The respondent had a schedule conflict with that date. The respondent called counsel for C.M.C. and asked her to agree to an order continuing the case. Counsel for C.M.C. refused to do so. Additionally, counsel for the bank did not agree to continue the hearing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   \"46. On April 25, 2013, the respondent's father, Thomas [C.] Boone, an attorney licensed in Kansas, filed a motion to continue the case. The respondent's father, however, had not entered an appearance in the litigation. The court did not grant the senior Boone's motion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   \"47. The respondent did not appear at the hearing held April 26, 2013.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   \"48. Following the hearing, the court entered an order that if the respondent failed to provide the discovery within 10 days, the court would strike the plaintiffs' pleadings and dismiss the case. The court ordered the respondent to pay $ 1,300 to counsel for C.M.C. and $ 1,125 to counsel for the bank. The respondent did not provide discovery as ordered but the respondent did file a timely motion for an extension of time. Thereafter, the parties engaged in discovery.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   \"49. On January 27, 2014, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. The court scheduled a pretrial conference for March 7, 2014.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   \"50. In advance of the scheduled pretrial conference, on February 19, 2014, the respondent contacted opposing counsel and asked for their agreement to a continuance of the pretrial conference because he was scheduled to be out-of-state taking a deposition. Opposing counsel agreed to a continuance to a date certain in April, 2014. However, the respondent failed to file a motion and set forth the reason for the continuance. Additionally, the respondent also failed to circulate a proposed order to opposing counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   \"51. Because the respondent failed to file a motion and circulate a proposed order, on February 26, 2014, counsel for C.M.C. sent the respondent an electronic mail message, reminding him to file a motion and proposed order. The respondent failed to do so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   \"52. On March 3, 2014, counsel for C.M.C. spoke with the respondent and again reminded him to file a motion and proposed order. The respondent did not file a motion or provide a proposed order continuing the pretrial conference.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   \"53. The court held the pretrial conference as scheduled. The respondent failed to appear. Counsel for C.M.C. moved to strike the pleadings filed by the respondent on behalf of the plaintiffs. The court granted the defendants' joint motion for partial summary judgment, the court denied the plaintiffs' motion for punitive damages, the court granted C.M.C.'s motion to add claims for punitive damages, and the court struck the plaintiffs' pleadings, including the plaintiffs' answer to C.M.C.'s counterclaims. The plaintiffs lost their cause of action because the respondent failed to file a motion to continue the pretrial conference.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   \"54. On May 20, 2014, the respondent filed a motion asking the court to provide his client relief from what he described as the default judgment entered by the court as a result of the hearing which occurred on March 7, 2014. The respondent also requested permission to file an interlocutory appeal. On May 28, 2014, C.M.C. responded by pointing out that the court had not entered a default judgment. The court denied the respondent's motion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   \"55. The court scheduled a jury trial on C.M.C.'s counterclaims for July 17, 2014. The court ordered the parties to exchange proposed jury instructions. The respondent failed to exchange proposed jury instructions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   \"56. On June 25, 2014, the respondent filed an untimely motion for summary judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   \"57. At a subsequent status conference, the district court ordered that the trial be a bench trial rather than a jury trial because the respondent failed to file proposed jury instructions. The court refused to consider the respondent's motion for summary judgment because it was untimely.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   \"58. At the July 17, 2014, bench trial, the court granted judgment in favor of C.M.C. The court rejected the plaintiffs' advice of counsel defense and reaffirmed the previous finding that the mechanic's lien claim was improper and out of time. The court found that the plaintiffs caused C.M.C. substantial financial loss, engaged in outrageous conduct, and intentionally and maliciously committed deceptive acts. The court ordered the plaintiffs to pay compensatory damages of $ 88,000, punitive damages in the amount of $ 10,000, a civil penalty of $ 10,000, and $ 20,000 for attorney fees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   \"59. The respondent appealed the court's decisions. In affirming in part and reversing in part, the Kansas Court of Appeals stated:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   'Our policy in Kansas is to try lawsuits on their merits and not to award judgments based on the inaction of trial counsel. Unfortunately, this case is an example of the struggle a trial judge has when a lawyer fails to do what he is supposed to do in a timely way. A Kansas judge, keeping in mind the rights of the parties, has the authority and duty to sanction parties and lawyers as needed in order to bring a legal action to a just conclusion. Justice seldom arises from letting a case remain idle. In doing so, however, the judge must establish appropriate sanctions with an eye on what was done or not done. When setting sanctions, the judge must also consider the consequences of that lawyer's inaction. The more flagrant, harmful, foul deserve the more serious sanction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   'We see no evidence in the record that Kape Roofing and Gutters, Inc. was complicit in Caleb Boone's failure to appear for a pretrial conference.

This concerns us because the sanction of striking pleadings affects Kape the most. Should a litigant be penalized for the negligence of its agent? If Kape was in no way responsible for Boone's inaction, failure to appear, or move for a continuance, is it reasonable to punish his client? If there is evidence of complicity then we see where imposing the ultimate sanction is appropriate.

The Kansas Court of Appeals explained that the respondent could not have provided citations to the record as required by court rule because the district court did not base the dismissal on the respondent's fraud.
