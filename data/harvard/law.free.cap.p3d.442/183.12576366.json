In this case, defendant was convicted of driving under the influence of intoxicants and assault in the third degree after striking a pedestrian with his car, and the trial court ordered him to pay almost $ 155,000 in restitution for the victim's medical expenses. We allowed review to consider whether the trial court erred in refusing to apply the civil law defense of comparative fault to reduce the amount of economic damages that defendant would be required to pay as restitution. We conclude that defendant's conviction for third-degree assault establishes a degree of culpability for which the defense of comparative fault would be unavailable in a civil action. Thus, at least under the circumstances of this case, the trial court correctly refused to reduce the amount of restitution by the victim's alleged comparative fault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant was driving under the influence of intoxicants late at night when he struck the victim, who had walked onto the road in a dark area that was not marked for pedestrian crossing. He pleaded guilty to one count of driving under the influence of intoxicants and one count of assault in the third degree, but he resisted the state's request for restitution in the amount of the victim's full medical bills. Defendant offered evidence that the victim's own negligence was the primary cause of the collision and urged the trial court to apply the civil doctrine of comparative fault to reduce the requested restitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court refused to consider the victim's alleged negligence and ordered defendant to pay the requested restitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the circuit court, holding that the text of the restitution statute expressly precludes the court from applying comparative fault principles to apportion damages.\n   <em>\n    State v. Gutierrez-Medina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12414276\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/287/240/#p246\">\n    287 Or. App. 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 246,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12414276\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/287/240/#p246\">\n    403 P.3d 462\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). This court allowed review, and we now affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals, albeit on a different ground. We conclude that defendant's conviction for third-degree assault establishes that he was aware that he was using a deadly or dangerous weapon in a way that created a substantial risk of serious physical injury and that he consciously disregarded that risk. Therefore, defendant's conviction for third-degree assault establishes that he acted with a culpable mental state for which the doctrine of comparative fault would not be available in a civil action. Because we hold that the defense of comparative fault would be unavailable to defendant in a hypothetical civil action for the same injury, we decline to address the Court of Appeals' conclusion that ORS 137.106 precludes trial courts from reducing the amount of restitution when the victim is partly at fault for the injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The circuit court ordered defendant to pay restitution under ORS 137.106(1), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \"When a person is convicted of a crime * * * that has resulted in economic damages, the district attorney shall investigate and present to the court * * * evidence of the nature and amount of the damages. * * * If the court finds from the evidence presented that a victim suffered economic damages, in addition to any other sanction it may impose, the court shall enter a judgment or supplemental judgment requiring that the defendant pay the victim restitution in a specific amount that equals the full amount of the victim's economic damages as determined by the court.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant does not dispute that he was convicted of a crime that resulted in economic damages. He also does not dispute that the evidence supports the trial court's finding that the victim incurred economic damages, in the form of medical expenses, in the amount that the court ordered as restitution. Defendant contends, however, that he was entitled to reduce his restitution obligation by proving that the victim\n   was also at fault for the injury that required the medical care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant argues that the legislature intended to incorporate the civil law defense of \"comparative fault\" into the determination of \"economic damages\" that a criminal defendant must pay as restitution. Defendant relies on several cases in which this court stated that civil law concepts perform a significant role in a trial court's determination of \"economic damages\" for purposes of imposing restitution. In particular, defendant points to\n   <em>\n    State v. Ramos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802262\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/358/581/\">\n    358 Or. 581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802262\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/358/581/\">\n    368 P.3d 446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016), in which this court explained \"that the legislature's cross-reference to the definition of 'economic damages' applicable in civil actions, and the legislature's purpose in creating the restitution procedure as a substitute for a civil proceeding, make civil law concepts relevant to our interpretation of ORS 137.106.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802262\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/358/581/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802262\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/358/581/\">\n    at 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802262\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/358/581/\">\n    368 P.3d 446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We concluded in\n   <em>\n    Ramos\n   </em>\n   that the amount of \"economic damages\" for purposes of imposing restitution is limited by the civil law concept that a defendant is liable only for damages that are \"reasonably foreseeable.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802262\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/358/581/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802262\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/358/581/\">\n    at 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802262\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/358/581/\">\n    368 P.3d 446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    State v. Islam\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12166202\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/359/796/#p800\">\n    359 Or. 796\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 800,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12166202\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/359/796/#p800\">\n    377 P.3d 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016), this court again looked to limitations on the damages that a plaintiff can recover in a civil action to determine that the amount of restitution that the defendant would be required to pay to the local retailer from whom the defendant stole a pair of jeans must be measured by the wholesale value, not the retail value, of the jeans. Defendant argues that the statutory defense of comparative fault, ORS 31.600(1), is another limitation on the amount of economic damages that the legislature intended to incorporate into the concept of \"economic damages\" that a criminal defendant must pay as restitution. From that premise, defendant concludes that the trial court erred in refusing to consider his evidence of the victim's fault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   There is another step in the analysis, however. To reach defendant's desired conclusion, his argument requires us to accept his minor premise that, in a hypothetical civil action against him for causing the same injury, the defense of comparative fault would be available to reduce his liability. The premise is not sound. As we shall explain, the statutory defense of civil comparative fault is available only to defendants who act with a degree of culpability for\n   which the common law defense of contributory negligence would have been available. The common law defense based on a plaintiff's contributory negligence was not available to a defendant who acted with a culpability greater than what the common law considered to be \"gross negligence\"-conduct that was either \"wanton\" or intentional. And, in pleading guilty to third-degree assault, defendant necessarily admitted to elements that would require a hypothetical civil jury to conclude that defendant's culpability fell within the range of \"wanton\" conduct. Thus, even if we assume that the legislature intended to incorporate the civil law defense of comparative fault into the calculation of criminal restitution under ORS 137.106, the defense would be unavailable to a defendant who commits third-degree assault in the manner that defendant did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Comparative fault applies only to fault of the type to\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    which contributory negligence would have been a defense.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Before 1971, Oregon recognized the common law defense of contributory negligence,\n   under which some plaintiffs whose own negligence contributed to their injuries to any extent were barred from recovering damages. The 1971 legislature abandoned contributory negligence and adopted instead a statutory defense that is now called \"comparative fault,\" under which some plaintiffs whose claims previously would have been defeated by contributory negligence could now recover a proportionate share of their damages.\n   <em>\n    Towe v. Sacagawea, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363834\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/74/#p107\">\n    357 Or. 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 107,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=347%20P.3d%20766\">\n    347 P.3d 766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) (citing Or. Laws 1971, ch. 668, \u00a7 1);\n   <em>\n    former\n   </em>\n   ORS 18.470 (1971). As originally enacted,\n   <em>\n    former\n   </em>\n   ORS 18.470 (1971) provided that contributory negligence would not bar recovery if the negligence of the person seeking recovery was not as great as the negligence of the person against whom recovery was sought, but that any damages allowable would be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence of the person recovering.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In 1975, the legislature amended the statute to, among other things, substitute the word \"fault\" for the word \"negligence.\"\n   <em>\n    Former\n   </em>\n   ORS 18.470 (1975) ; Or. Laws 1975, ch. 599, \u00a7 11. Although the title of the statute continued to use the phrase \"comparative negligence,\" and still does today, the concept then became known as comparative fault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The version of that statute that is in effect today, now codified at ORS 31.600(1), is identical in all material respects to the 1975 amended statute. ORS 31.600(1) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \"Contributory negligence shall not bar recovery in an action * * * to recover damages for death or injury to person or property if the fault attributable to the claimant was not greater than the combined fault of all persons specified in subsection (2) of this section [specifying categories of people whose fault may or may not be compared to that of the claimant], but any damages allowed shall be diminished in the proportion to the percentage of fault attributable to the claimant. This section is not intended to create or abolish any defense.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   This court has explained that the 1975 amendment was intended to cover \"actions based on tortious conduct, however described, in which contributory negligence is an appropriate defense.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Tilden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2149670\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/278/11/#p17\">\n    278 Or. 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2149670\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/278/11/#p17\">\n    562 P.2d 1188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1977). In reaching that conclusion, we emphasized the statement of Representative Dave Frohnmayer, that, under the 1975 changes, \"[a]pportionment of damages is expressly extended to all actions to recover damages for injury to persons or property in which contributory negligence may properly be asserted as a defense.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2149670\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/278/11/#p17\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2149670\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/278/11/#p17\">\n    at 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2149670\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/278/11/#p17\">\n    562 P.2d 1188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting Minutes, House Judiciary Committee, May 28, 1975, Appendix G (written statement by Representative Dave Frohnmayer)). That legislative intention is reflected in the text of the statute, which specifies that the legislature did not intend to create any defense that did not otherwise exist. Thus, the rule of comparative fault would reduce defendant's responsibility for the victim's full damages, even in a hypothetical civil action, only if defendant's conduct is equivalent to conduct for which the defense of contributory negligence would have been available before 1971.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Comparative fault does not apply in a civil action for conduct involving a mental state more culpable than \"gross negligence.\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As defendant recognizes, the defense of contributory negligence was not available to all civil defendants. If the defendant acted intentionally or in a manner that was \"wanton,\" then contributory negligence by the plaintiff did\n   not bar recovery, as this court explained in\n   <em>\n    Cook v. Kinzua Pine Mills Co. et al.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4968691\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/207/34/\">\n    207 Or. 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4968691\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/207/34/\">\n    293 P.2d 717\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1956). The plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Cook\n   </em>\n   was driving on a private logging road when she encountered a logging truck that was owned by the defendant and driven by one of its employees (also a defendant). The plaintiff pulled off to the side of the road to permit the truck to pass, but the truck collided with her car, severely injuring her. In a tort action against the defendants, the plaintiff alleged two theories of liability. In a first count, the plaintiff alleged that the driver of the truck \"carelessly, recklessly, and negligently\" drove the truck into her car. In a second count, she alleged that the driver struck her car \"with knowledge of\" her presence, \"recklessly and in a wanton manner, and with an utter disregard\" for her safety. In their answer to the complaint, the defendants\n   alleged that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent in failing to keep a proper lookout and in failing to keep her automobile under control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   After the plaintiff prevailed at trial, the defendants appealed, raising issues that required this court to clarify the claims for which the defense of contributory negligence was and was not available to the defendants. This court construed the first count of the complaint to allege that the defendants' conduct was negligent and explained, \"if plaintiff proved only simple negligence on the part of the defendants she could not recover if defendant proved that she was herself guilty of negligence contributing to the accident.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4968691\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/207/34/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4968691\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/207/34/\">\n    at 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4968691\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/207/34/\">\n    293 P.2d 717\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On the other hand, the court construed the second count to allege that the defendants' conduct was wanton and held, \"if the plaintiff established her claim of wanton misconduct on the part of the defendants, as alleged in count two of the complaint, the defense of contributory negligence would not be available to defendants.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In discussing the circumstances in which contributory negligence operated as a defense, this court in\n   <em>\n    Cook\n   </em>\n   defined four categories of conduct \"into which the infinite variety of fact situations must fall\": \"(1) [s]imple negligence\"; \"(2) gross negligence\"; \"(3) injury to the person of another committed in a 'wanton' manner, meaning the doing of an intentional act of an unreasonable character in disregard of a risk known to the actor, or so obvious that he must be taken\n   to have been aware of it and so great as to make it highly probable that harm would follow, usually accompanied by a conscious indifference to consequences\"; and \"(4) [a]ssault and battery where there is an actual intent not only to do an act but to cause personal injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 58-59,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4968691\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/207/34/\">\n    293 P.2d 717\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court emphasized that claims alleging the first two categories of fault could be defeated by the defense of contributory negligence, but that \"contributory negligence is no defense\" for a defendant who acts either in a \"wanton\" manner or with an \"intent\" to cause injury.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4968691\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/207/34/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The court quoted from a leading torts treatise to explain why \"nearly all courts have held that ordinary negligence on the part of the plaintiff will not bar recovery\" when the defendant's conduct is \"that aggravated form of negligence, approaching intent, which has been characterized variously as 'wilful,' 'wanton,' or 'reckless[.]' \"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 42-43,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4968691\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/207/34/\">\n    293 P.2d 717\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting William L. Prosser,\n   <em>\n    Law of Torts\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 51, 289-90 (2d ed. 1955)). As Prosser explained, \"[s]uch conduct differs from negligence not only in degree but in kind, and in the social condemnation attached to it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Thus, under the common law, if a defendant's conduct could be characterized as \"wanton,\" then the plaintiff's contributory negligence was no defense. That is the line that the legislature carried forward when it created the defense of comparative fault: if the defendant's conduct was at least \"wanton,\" comparative fault is no defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    A conviction for third-degree assault establishes that the defendant acted with a mental state that is more culpable than the civil standard of \"gross negligence.\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendant recognizes that his argument for applying comparative fault to reduce the amount of his criminal restitution requires this court to conclude that defendant's criminal culpability, if translated to a hypothetical civil action, would align with categories of culpability for which the defense of comparative fault is available. But he contends that the evidence in this case meets that test. Defendant argues that his culpability under the circumstances of this case is comparable to common law \"gross negligence,\" because he drove with a blood-alcohol content of .11 percent, he stopped after the crash, and he showed remorse. He\n   adds that there was no evidence that he was \"staggeringly drunk\" or visibly intoxicated. Thus, he argues, the defense of comparative fault would have been available to him in a hypothetical civil claim for the same conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendant's argument, however, overlooks the weight that we must give to his conviction. The question is not whether the facts that defendant identifies could support a finding of \"gross negligence\" in a hypothetical civil action; the relevant comparison must be based on the culpable mental state that is established by defendant's conviction for third-degree assault. As part of his plea of\n   guilty to assault in the third degree, ORS 163.165(1)(a), defendant admitted that he\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \"recklessly caused serious physical injury to [the victim] by means of a motor vehicle, a dangerous weapon, which [he] drove on a public road under the influence of intoxicants.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   That admission establishes a degree of culpability that, in a hypothetical civil action, would fall within the category of \"wanton misconduct,\" for which the injured person's negligence provides no defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The task of understanding where particular conduct falls in relation to the line between \"gross negligence\" and \"wanton\" misconduct is one with which this court has repeatedly struggled. As we have previously acknowledged, \"definitions of gross negligence, as approved by this court, disclose a wide variety, and in a few cases, direct inconsistency.\"\n   <em>\n    Falls v.

Those seeming inconsistencies arise in part because, in certain statutory contexts, this court has construed the term \"gross negligence\" as meaning conduct that is actually comparable to the common law classification for \"wanton\" conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   For example, many of this court's older cases discuss the term \"gross negligence\" in the context of Oregon's \"guest passenger\" statutory immunity, ORS 30.115.

In other words, the word \"wanton\" described not only a person who acted with actual knowledge and disregard of the risk but also one who acted without such knowledge if a reasonable person would have realized the risk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   A conviction for third-degree assault establishes a degree of culpability that, if compared to common law civil concepts of fault, would fall within the range of culpability that represents \"wanton\" conduct, and thus a degree of culpability for which the victim's negligence affords no defense. As ORS 163.165(1)(a) specifies:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   \"(1) A person commits the crime of assault in the third degree if the person:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   \"(a) Recklessly causes serious physical injury to another by means of a deadly or dangerous weapon[.]\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   For purposes of that offense, the mental state \"recklessly\" is defined as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   \" '[r]ecklessly' * * * means that a person is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the result will occur or that the circumstance exists. The risk must be of such nature and degree that disregard thereof constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the situation.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   ORS 161.085(9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Given that definition, the culpable mental state of a person who is guilty of third-degree assault can be divided into three components: (1) the nature of the risk; (2) the degree of risk; and (3) the degree of awareness with which the person acts in the face of that risk. The culpability of a person who causes harm through conduct that civil law classifies as \"wanton\" can be divided into the same three components to permit a meaningful comparison. Based on that comparison, we conclude that a criminal defendant who is guilty of third-degree assault has acted with a degree of culpability that is at least as great as that of a civil defendant whose conduct meets the threshold for wantonness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The alignment between the criminal culpability and the classifications of civil fault is not seamless, in part because the former consists of specific elements while the\n   latter involves a range of culpability. But a conviction for third-degree assault necessarily establishes a degree of culpability that is at least as great as the degree of culpability that satisfies the threshold for civil \"wanton\" conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   First, the nature of the risk is comparable. A conviction for third-degree assault establishes that there was a risk the person's act would cause \"serious physical injury to another,\" ORS 163.165(1)(a), while proof in a civil action that a person caused physical injury through \"wanton\" conduct requires proof of a risk that the person's act-or failure to act-would cause \"substantial\" bodily harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4886010\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/229/259/#p264\">\n    229 Or. at 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4886010\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/229/259/#p264\">\n    366 P.2d 735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Restatement\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 500 and comment c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The degree of risk is also comparable. A conviction for third-degree assault under ORS 163.165(1)(a) establishes that the person used a \"deadly or dangerous weapon\" under circumstances that presented a \"substantial and unjustifiable\" risk that the person would cause \"serious physical injury\" with the weapon. ORS 163.165(1)(a) ; ORS 161.085(9). Proof in a civil action that a person caused physical injury through \"wanton\" conduct requires proof that the person acted-or failed to act-under circumstances that presented an \"unreasonable\" and \"highly probable\" risk that \"substantial\" bodily harm would result, but the risk of harm need not be that which flows from use of a deadly or dangerous weapon.\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4886010\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/229/259/#p264\">\n    229 Or. at 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4886010\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/229/259/#p264\">\n    366 P.2d 735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Finally, the mental state with which a person must create the risk of injury, to be guilty of third-degree assault, establishes a degree of culpability that would prove \"wantonness\" in a civil action. A conviction for third-degree assault establishes that the person actually was \"aware of and consciously disregard[ed]\" the risk. ORS 161.085(9) ; ORS 163.165(1)(a). In a civil action for the same injury, \"wantonness\" would involve a range of mental states into which proof of the mental state required for third-degree assault would fall. Although proof of \"wanton\" conduct may involve proof that the person actually\n   was aware of and consciously disregarded the risk, as does third-degree assault, \"wantonness\" does not\n   <em>\n    require\n   </em>\n   that proof. Rather, wantonness can be proven if a \"reasonable\" person would have realized the risk.\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4886010\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/229/259/#p264\">\n    229 Or. at 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4886010\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/229/259/#p264\">\n    366 P.2d 735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   Indeed, this court has already considered the relationship between the criminal mental state \"recklessly\" and the degrees of culpability in a civil action and, in doing so, reached the same conclusion that we reach here through more protracted analysis.
