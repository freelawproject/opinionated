He was also given an employee handbook containing a mandatory arbitration policy and told to read it at home. When Burnett later sued Pagliacci for various wage-related claims, Pagliacci moved to compel arbitration under the policy printed in its handbook. Pagliacci appeals the trial court's denial of that motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 We hold that because Burnett did not have a reasonable opportunity to review the arbitration policy before he was required to sign the Employee Relationship Agreement, the circumstances surrounding the formation of the parties' agreement to arbitrate were procedurally unconscionable. We hold further that the mandatory arbitration policy is substantively unconscionable because certain prerequisites to arbitration required by the policy unreasonably favor Pagliacci by limiting employees' access to substantive remedies and discouraging them from pursuing valid claims. Therefore, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 Pagliacci hired Burnett as a delivery driver for Pagliacci's Valley Street location in October 2015. Upon hire, Burnett attended a mandatory orientation, which took between 40 minutes and an hour. At the orientation, Burnett was shown around the store, given Pagliacci T-shirts, and told about Pagliacci's history and values. He also watched some videos about how to succeed as a delivery driver. Additionally, Burnett was given some forms and told to sign them so that he could start working. One of those forms was an Employee Relationship Agreement (ERA), which Burnett signed. Burnett was also given a copy of Pagliacci's \"Little Book of Answers\" (Little Book) and told to read it at home. Although the ERA directs the employee to \"learn and comply with the rules and policies outlined in our Little Book .... including those that relate to positive attitude, public safety, company funds, tips and FAIR [Fair and Amicable Internal Resolution] Policy,\" the ERA does not mention arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Pagliacci terminated Burnett's employment on January 22, 2017. In October 2017, Burnett filed a putative class action against Pagliacci, alleging among other things that Pagliacci failed to provide delivery drivers with required rest and meal periods, failed to pay all wages due to delivery drivers, wrongfully retained delivery charges, and made unlawful deductions from delivery drivers' wages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 Pagliacci moved to compel arbitration of Burnett's claims under its mandatory arbitration policy, which is printed in the Little Book. That policy provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The company has a mandatory arbitration policy with which you must comply for the binding resolution of disputes without lawsuits. If you believe you have been a victim of illegal harassment or discrimination or that you have not been paid for all hours worked or at less than the rate of pay required by law or that the termination of your employment was wrongful, you submit the dispute to resolution in accordance with the F.A.I.R. Policy and if those procedures are not successful in resolving the dispute, you then submit the dispute to binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator pursuant to the Washington Arbitration Act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The \"F.A.I.R. Policy\" referred to in the mandatory arbitration policy requires that before commencing arbitration, the employee first \"report the matter and all details\" to his or her supervisor (Supervisor Review). If Supervisor Review does not resolve the matter to the employee's satisfaction, he or she may initiate nonbinding conciliation, wherein the \"F.A.I.R. Administrator will designate a responsible person at Pagliacci Pizza (who may be its owner) to meet face-to-face with you in\n   a non-binding Conciliation.\" The F.A.I.R. Policy also includes the following limitations provision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   You may not commence an arbitration of a claim that is covered by the Pagliacci Pizza Arbitration Policy or commence a lawsuit on a claim that is not covered by the Pagliacci Pizza Arbitration Policy unless you have first submitted the claim to resolution in conformity with the F.A.I.R. Policy and fully complied with the steps and procedures in the F.A.I.R. Policy. If you do not comply with a step, rule or procedure in the F.A.I.R. Policy with respect to a claim, you waive any right to raise the claim in any court or other forum, including arbitration. The limitations set forth in this paragraph shall not be subject to tolling, equitable or otherwise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 Burnett opposed Pagliacci's motion to compel arbitration. He argued that the mandatory arbitration policy was both procedurally and substantively unconscionable, but the trial court did not reach those arguments. Instead, it concluded that although Burnett agreed under the ERA to \"learn and comply with the rules and policies outlined in our Little Book,\" the Little Book was not incorporated by reference into the ERA. The court therefore denied Pagliacci's motion, finding there was no agreement to arbitrate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67 Pagliacci moved for reconsideration, arguing that the Little Book was incorporated by reference into the ERA. Pagliacci also argued that regardless of whether it was incorporated by reference into the ERA, the Little Book created an agreement to arbitrate because Burnett received a copy of it and then continued his employment thereafter. The court denied Pagliacci's motion for reconsideration. Pagliacci appeals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b68 Pagliacci argues that the trial court erred by denying its motion to compel arbitration and its subsequent motion for reconsideration.

Here, like the Trade Contract in\n   <em>\n    Seventh-Day Adventists\n   </em>\n   , the ERA clearly and unequivocally incorporates the Little Book. Specifically, the ERA expressly provides that employees will, on their own initiative, \"learn and comply with the rules and policies outlined in our Little Book of Answers.\" Furthermore, Burnett does not argue that there was any lack of clarity that the Little Book described in the ERA is the same Little Book that he received at orientation.

As in\n   <em>\n    Mattingly\n   </em>\n   , there is no evidence in the record that Burnett had a reasonable opportunity to understand the terms contained in the Little Book-and specifically the mandatory arbitration policy-before he signed the ERA. Instead, the record reflects that Burnett was not afforded an opportunity to review the Little Book before signing the ERA: Burnett testified that he was told to sign the ERA to begin work and instructed to read the Little Book at home. Furthermore, like the warranty limitations in\n   <em>\n    Mattingly\n   </em>\n   , Pagliacci's mandatory arbitration policy is buried in a booklet: Although it is written in plain English, it appears on page 18 of the 23-page Little Book, in the same font size and with the same formatting as surrounding sections.

But the fact that\n   <em>\n    Mattingly\n   </em>\n   was not an employment case is not a relevant distinguishing factor because, as discussed, we apply ordinary contract law to determine the validity of an agreement to arbitrate.\n   <em>\n    McKee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3996174\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/164/372/#p383\">\n    164 Wash.2d at 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=191%20P.3d%20845\">\n    191 P.3d 845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The\n   <em>\n    Gaglidari\n   </em>\n   court did conclude that Denny's employee handbook, as modified by the alcoholic beverage handbook, created a contract between Gaglidari and Denny's, wherein Gaglidari agreed to abide by the policies and procedures outlined in the handbook.\n   <em>\n    Gaglidari\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1373861\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/117/426/\">\n    117 Wash.2d at 435-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=815%20P.2d%201362\">\n    815 P.2d 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But as discussed, the court reached this conclusion in the context of determining whether Gaglidari's behavior was grounds for immediate dismissal. An employee's agreement to comply with a policy or risk immediate dismissal is readily distinguishable from an employee's agreement to submit his or her claims to arbitration. That the former agreement can be secured by providing the employee with a handbook does not mean that the latter agreement can be secured in the same manner. Pagliacci's argument is not persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b632 Pagliacci also relies on\n   <em>\n    Govier v.

Policy's Supervisor Review procedure. In other words, the limitations provision acts as a complete bar to arbitration and suit for employees who do not become aware that they have a potential claim until after their employment with Pagliacci ends.

But Pagliacci's proffered interpretation would require us to read into the F.A.I.R. Policy an exception that is not expressed therein. Pagliacci's proffered interpretation also contradicts the F.A.I.R. Policy's unambiguous limitations provision, which states: \"If you do not comply with a step, rule or procedure in the F.A.I.R. Policy with respect to a claim, you waive any right to raise the claim in any court or other forum, including arbitration.\" We are not persuaded by Pagliacci's liberal interpretation of this limitations provision, which Pagliacci itself drafted in unambiguous terms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sales Creators, Inc. v.

Specifically, the F.A.I.R. Policy's limitations provision prohibits an employee from commencing arbitration (or filing suit) until he or she has fully complied with the policy's steps and procedures. And \"a claim sought to be arbitrated is subject to the same limitations of time for the commencement of actions as if the claim had been asserted in a court.\" RCW 7.04A.090(3). Therefore, the F.A.I.R. Policy's limitations provision has the effect of shortening, by whatever time it takes to complete the procedures set out in the F.A.I.R. Policy, the period during which employees may assert their claims under Pagliacci's two-step arbitration policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b650 To this end, our Supreme Court has repeatedly held that arbitration provisions that contain unreasonable contractual limitations periods are substantively unconscionable.

But because the time required for F.A.I.R. Policy compliance is entirely indeterminate, it-like the contractual limitations periods in\n   <em>\n    Adler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Gandee\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   -is substantively unconscionable because it provides Pagliacci with unfair advantages. Specifically, and as discussed, the F.A.I.R. Policy, which is a prerequisite to arbitration, acts as a complete bar to arbitration unless an employee has \"fully complied with the steps and procedures in the F.A.I.R. Policy.\" Therefore, an employee must anticipate and build in time to fully comply with the F.A.I.R. Policy before the applicable limitations period expires. But the time required for compliance is not within the employee's control. Under the F.A.I.R. Policy, Pagliacci makes no commitment to address disputes or schedule nonbinding conciliation within a specified period of time after the employee has reported the matter or initiated conciliation. Nor does the policy provide any \"release valve\" that allows employees to commence arbitration if conciliation under the F.A.I.R. Policy takes more than a specified amount of time, or if the applicable statute of limitations is set to expire while the employee is attempting to comply with the F.A.I.R. Policy. Indeed, the F.A.I.R. Policy's limitations provision provides just the opposite: Regardless of how long the conciliation procedure takes, the bar to arbitration \"shall not be subject to tolling, equitable or otherwise.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b652 Finally, Pagliacci does not dispute that the F.A.I.R. Policy contains no exception to Supervisor Review even when the employee's supervisor is the person subjecting the employee to unfair conduct or harassment. In such cases, Supervisor Review, like the confidentiality provision in\n   <em>\n    Zuver\n   </em>\n   , \"undermines an employee's confidence in the fairness and honesty of the arbitration process and thus potentially discourages that employee from pursuing a valid ... claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Zuver\n   </em>\n   , 153 Wash.2d at 315,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=103%20P.3d%20753\">\n    103 P.3d 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b653 For these reasons and because full compliance with the F.A.I.R.

But we are not limited by the specific types of provisions that the Supreme Court has already deemed substantively unconscionable.
