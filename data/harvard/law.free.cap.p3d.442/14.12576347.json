He argued that this was a de facto consecutive sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b610 On appeal, Mr. Smith contended that the DOSA and non-DOSA sentences in a multiple current offense setting created an illegal hybrid sentence. In an effort to dissuade the court from reaching that conclusion, the State argued that it was common for defendants to receive a DOSA sentence in combination with a non-DOSA sentence, providing as an example, drug prosecutions in which possession of a large amount of one controlled substance makes that count DOSA-ineligible, yet a charge of possessing a small amount of another controlled substance would be DOSA-eligible. \"The State warn[ed] that 'if such sentences were unlawful, every time a defendant is statutorily eligible for a DOSA on a current offense, but not another, a sentencing court could not lawfully order a DOSA for the eligible offense.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 128,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=173%20P.3d%20973\">\n    173 P.3d 973\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting the State's brief).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b611 Importantly, this court was not asked to decide in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   whether the DOC and the State were correct about the operation of the DOSA statute.

But it held, \"even if Smith's sentence is consistent with the DOSA statute, it is still a hybrid sentence in violation of RCW 9.94A.589(3),\" which provides for concurrent sentencing or consecutive sentencing, but not a hybrid model.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 128-29,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=173%20P.3d%20973\">\n    173 P.3d 973\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b612 The DOC's petition in this case argues, consistent with the State's position in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , that courts \"impose sentences on a per-count basis\" and that eligibility for DOSA \"is per-offense.\" Postsentence Pet. at 5, 7. It argues that Ms. Hardy's two controlled substance violations fail an eligibility criterion appearing at RCW 9.94A.660(1)(f), that \"[t]he end of the standard sentence range for the current\n   offense is greater than one year.\" It argues that because Ms. Hardy was not eligible for DOSA sentencing for the controlled substance counts, we should \"remand either for resentencing or to grant a DOSA only for the DOSA-eligible offenses.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State and Ms. Hardy respond with textual and policy arguments asking us to construe the DOSA provisions as taking a different, offender-based approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   I.

The \"Sentencing Data\" section of Ms. Hardy's judgment and sentence sets forth the standard range for each of her offenses. Had she received a standard range sentence, the court would have selected a sentence for each of her offenses within the applicable range. RCW 9.94A.530(1). She would have three sentences, not one, and her total period of confinement would be the result of applying RCW 9.94A.589, which would run the three sentences concurrently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b616 But RCW 9.94A.660 contains language suggesting a different approach when the sentencing alternative is applied. It provides, \"\n   <em>\n    An offender is eligible\n   </em>\n   for the special drug offender sentencing alternative\" if eligibility criteria are met, not that \"an\n   <em>\n    offense\n   </em>\n   is eligible.\" RCW 9.94A.660(1) (emphasis added). Most of the eligibility criteria are offender-based:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (1)\n   <em>\n    An offender is eligible\n   </em>\n   for the special drug offender sentencing alternative if:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (a)\n   <em>\n    The offender\n   </em>\n   is convicted of a felony that is not a violent offense or sex offense and the violation does not involve a sentence enhancement under RCW 9.94A.533 (3) or (4) ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (b)\n   <em>\n    The offender\n   </em>\n   is convicted of a felony that is not a felony driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug under RCW 46.61.502(6) or felony physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug under RCW 46.61.504(6) ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (c)\n   <em>\n    The offender\n   </em>\n   has no current or prior convictions for a sex offense at any time or violent offense within ten years before conviction of the current offense, in this state, another state, or the United States;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (d) For a violation of the Uniform Controlled Substances Act under chapter 69.50 RCW or a criminal solicitation to commit such a violation under chapter 9A.28 RCW, the offense involved only a small quantity of the particular controlled substance as determined by the judge upon consideration\n   of such factors as the weight, purity, packaging, sale price, and street value of the controlled substance;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (e)\n   <em>\n    The offender\n   </em>\n   has not been found by the United States attorney general to be subject to a deportation detainer or order and does not become subject to a deportation order during the period of the sentence;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (f) The end of the standard sentence range for the current offense is greater than one year; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (g)\n   <em>\n    The offender\n   </em>\n   has not received a drug offender sentencing alternative more than once in the prior ten years before the current offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   RCW 9.94A.660(1)(a)-(g) (emphasis added). This is a strong textual basis for applying an offender-based approach in determining whether the sentencing alternative is an option.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b617 The principal concern DOC expresses about the trial court's offender-based approach is that a court could waive standard range sentences for DOSA-ineligible crimes simply because they were sentenced alongside a DOSA-eligible crime.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   But this would not happen if RCW 9.94A.660 is based on offender-based eligibility rather than offense-based eligibility. If\n   <em>\n    the offender\n   </em>\n   is not eligible, then no DOSA sentence could be imposed on any current offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b618 The textual issue remaining, if we read RCW 9.94A.660 as offender-based rather than offense-based, is how to construe subsections (1)(d) and (1)(f), which speak in singular terms of \"the offense\" and \"the current offense.\" We conclude that each should be read in a manner consistent with its purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b619 The purpose of subsection (1)(d) is to limit DOSA eligibility in the case of the controlled substance violations it addresses to violations that involve only a small quantify of the particular controlled substance. Notwithstanding the State's position in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , eligibility should depend on\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of an offender's current controlled substance violations involving only small quantities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b620 We find no legislative history that clearly identifies the purpose of subsection (1)(f), which conditions eligibility on a standard range greater than one year. It is distinguishable from the other eligibility criteria, most of which are indicators of a lower risk offender. For the first decade of the sentencing alternative's existence, a minimum length for an offender's sentence-a sign of a\n   <em>\n    higher\n   </em>\n   -risk offender-was not even identified as one of the \"eligibility\" criteria for the alternative. LAWS OF 1995, ch. 108, \u00a7 3 (originally codified at former RCW 9.94A.120(6)(a) (1995); later recodified pursuant to Laws of 2001, ch. 10, \u00a7 6, at RCW 9.94A.660(1) ). A minimum length of the standard range was not identified as part of the \"eligibility\" criteria until October 1, 2005. LAWS OF 2005, ch. 460, \u00a7 1(e) (codified at former RCW 9.94A.660(1)(e) (2005)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b621 A minimum sentence was always required for the sentencing alternative to be available, but that requirement appeared in a separate statutory section. That section provided that the sentencing alternative could not be imposed unless (1) an eligible offender, (2) had a standard range of a certain minimum length, and (3) the offender and the community would benefit from use of the alternative. Originally, the minimum length was a standard range whose midpoint was greater than one year. LAWS OF 1995, ch. 108, \u00a7 3, codified at former RCW 9.94A.129(6)(b) (1995). Legislation effective in July 1999 changed the minimum, requiring that the standard range itself be greater than one year. LAWS OF 1999, ch. 197, \u00a7 4, codified at former RCW 9.94A.120(6)(b) (1999). The final bill report for the 1999 legislation may shed light on the reason for requiring a minimum sentence of a year: it discusses the fact that offenders sentenced to less than a year are eligible for other alternatives to total confinement. FINAL B. REP. ON ENGROSSED SECOND SUBSTITUTE H.B. 1006, at 3, 56th Leg. Reg. Sess. (Wash. 1999).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b622 Another possible reason for requiring an offender to have a standard range sentence of a minimum length might be to limit prison-based DOSAs (the only type originally available) to sentences long enough to afford a beneficial amount of treatment. Or it might\n   be because there is less of a cost benefit to state and local government of providing treatment when an offender will be confined for a shorter period of time. These rationales are supported by the legislature's directive to the sentencing guidelines commission, in originally creating the sentencing alternative, to deliver findings on the savings in state resources from implementing the drug offender options and the effectiveness of drug treatment services. LAWS OF 1995, ch. 108, \u00a7 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b623 Under any of these rationales, if an offender has\n   <em>\n    at least one sentence\n   </em>\n   whose standard sentence range will be greater than one year, the purpose of the provision will be served by treating the offender as eligible for the sentencing alternative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b624 An additional reason for rejecting the DOC's construction of subsection (1)(f) as disqualifying someone in Ms. Hardy's situation is that it leads to absurd results. If all three of her offenses had the same 17 to 22 month standard range as did her bail jumping charge, she would be eligible for a DOSA sentence. It makes no sense that she would be ineligible because two of her offenses (the drug offenses demonstrating her need for treatment) are considered less serious for purposes of arriving at the applicable sentencing range.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b625 RCW 9.94A.660(1) leads with the concept of \"offender\" eligibility, which we find to be more revealing of legislative intent than the fact that subsections (1)(d) and ( 1)(f) speak of a single offense. \"The DOSA program is an attempt to provide treatment for some offenders judged likely to benefit from it.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.
