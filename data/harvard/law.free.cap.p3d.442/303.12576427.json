(RHD) to provide nursing home management services at the Platte County Legacy Home. Shane Filipi worked for RHD and served as the nursing home's administrator until May 22, 2017, when RHD hired Trent Kaufman for that position. Mr. Filipi then became RHD's western regional manager and Mr. Kaufman's supervisor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b64] On June 20, 2017, a resident of the nursing home reported to Mr. Kaufman that on June 9, 2017, a physical therapist working at the home threatened her with loss of Medicare benefits and removal from the home unless she agreed to undergo a physical therapy assessment and participate in physical therapy. Mr. Kaufman sent an email to Mr. Filipi describing the resident's concern and asking, \"How do you suggest I address the situation?\" Mr. Filipi responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   I'm pretty positive that [the resident] made comments pretty similar in one of her previous stays. I hope I'm thinking of the same resident. After digging into that situation there were two other staff members present that gave different stories than hers that both lined up and contradicted what she said and that she added a lot of drama to her story. I would find out what time this happened and see if there were other staff members around or other residents that are better historians and see what they have to say. Let me know what you find out.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b65] The director of nursing spoke with the resident's attending nurse, who essentially confirmed the resident's version of the June 9 incident. The director of nursing instructed the nurse to document the incident using a grievance form, and that was done. Based on this corroborating information, Mr. Filipi, Mr. Kaufman, and the director of nursing all agreed that the incident should be reported to the State as a potential incident of elder abuse. Mr. Filipi also discussed the incident with the vice president of operations for the physical therapist's employer, and she likewise agreed the incident should be reported.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b66] Mr. Kaufman began work on the report, and while he was working on it, the director of nursing informed him that Mr. Filipi was on his way to the nursing home and wished to review the report before it was submitted. Mr. Kaufman submitted the report the afternoon of June 20, before Mr. Filipi had an opportunity to review it. The report included a copy of the attending nurse's grievance form as well as cut-and-paste copies of emails exchanged between Mr. Kaufman, Mr. Filipi, and the director of nursing. In the report's closing paragraphs, Mr. Kaufman stated, \"It was the consensus of the regional manager, administrator, and director of nursing that this issue should be reported to the State of Wyoming as a potential abuse issue.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b67] When Mr. Filipi arrived at the nursing home on June 20, Mr. Kaufman informed him\n   that he had submitted the report and provided him with a hard copy of it. Mr. Filipi was upset that Mr. Kaufman submitted the report without his review. He was also upset that Mr. Kaufman had included in the report the cut-and-paste emails exchanged between the two of them and the director of nursing, that he had not completed the investigation by interviewing the physical therapist before submitting the report, that he did not include a corrective action, and that the report was handwritten rather than typed. Mr. Filipi then told Mr. Kaufman that the two of them would work together to complete the investigation and submit a final report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b68] On June 21 and 22, Mr. Kaufman was out of state for training. On the 22nd, Mr. Filipi was at the nursing home to take care of payroll and accounts payable in Mr. Kaufman's absence. While he was there, several of the home's department heads approached him with concerns about Mr. Kaufman's management of the home. When Mr. Kaufman returned on the 23rd, Mr. Filipi met with him to discuss the concerns that had been brought to his attention, as well as his concerns regarding the submission of the abuse report. During this meeting, Mr. Kaufman asked if he should resign since the department heads had no faith in him. Mr. Filipi told him no, but that Mr. Kaufman needed to think about it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b69] After Mr. Filipi left his office, Mr. Kaufman sent an email to the department heads, stating, \"It has been a pleasure working with you all and I will miss working with you all. I am sorry that I did not meet your expectations.\" A few minutes later, he sent an email to Mr. Filipi that stated, \"With a lack of support from the managers and your concerns I am considering this as a 'termination.' \" He then left the building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b610] On June 26, 2017, Mr. Filipi and the director of nursing submitted a final report to the State concerning the June 9, 2017 incident. The report was signed by both Mr. Filipi and the director of nursing, and it indicated that the resident's physician and family had been notified and that the long term care ombudsman had been notified.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The report summarized the incident, and stated the nursing home's assessment and proposed corrective action as follows (bold typeface in original):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Summary:\n   </strong>\n   On the afternoon of 6/9/17 [the resident] was admitted into the facility. [The physical therapist] came in to do an eval with [the resident]. [The resident] did not want to participate in therapy. [The attending nurse] was present in the resident's room for part of the exchange. It is unclear whether [the physical therapist] told [the resident] that she would be kicked out/thrown out/discharged from facility/Medicare if she did not participate in therapy. Both [the resident] and [the physical therapist] apologized to each other the next day. [The resident] agreed to do an eval on the 12\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   and has been participating in therapy since. [The resident] reported this incident to Administrator Kaufman on the 20\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   . [The attending nurse] was asked on the 20th about the exchange that took place on the 9th and agreed to fill out a grievance. [The resident] was admitted directly from the ER on the 9th and was already anxious from a fall that took place at her home. [The resident] was sent back later in the night to hospital due to hypoxia.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    Administrative Decision based on evidence provided: [The physical therapist] should have taken a different approach and with [the resident's] anxiety and health issues that evening it would have been in everybody's best interests to come back the next day.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    Corrective Action taken: [The physical therapist] has been assigned education that will be completed in the next 2 weeks that covers patients' rights/resident rights, resident abuse, and diffusing customer complaints.

[The attending nurse] will be educated\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    on timely reporting of resident grievances.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [\u00b611] On September 20, 2017, the State issued a Notice of Conclusions. The notice indicated that the State had completed its investigation and had found the allegation of abuse to be unsubstantiated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [\u00b612] On September 25, 2017, Mr. Kaufman filed a complaint against RHD and Mr. Filipi, individually and as regional manager of RFD. The complaint asserted a claim for retaliatory constructive discharge, and in support alleged:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   45. Filipi instructed Kaufman that no report of the elder abuse incident should be made.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   46.

Under federal and state legislation and regulation, elder abuse reporting is mandated, and serves and is an important and well established public policy to protect elderly and susceptible citizens.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   68. Kaufman was given the choice to comply with the elder abuse reporting requirements under federal and state law, or to comply with Filipi's instruction not to file an elder abuse report.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   69. Kaufman reported to the Wyoming Department of Health and Wyoming Department of Family Services that a vulnerable adult was being or had been abused, neglected, exploited, intimidated, or abandoned.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   70. After Kaufman made his report, RHD provided Kaufman with two options as to his employment, to be fired or to resign.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   71. Kaufman reasonably believed his discharge was imminent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   72. Kaufman was not given any alternative to resignation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   73. Kaufman understood the only choice he had was to resign, so as to avoid an involuntary termination report on his employment record.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   74. Kaufman was not provided any time to make the resignation decision that Filipi required him to make.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   75. Kaufman was not permitted to select the effective date of his resignation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   76. Kaufman's resignation was involuntary and required by RHD and Filipi.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   77. RHD and Filipi's ultimatum to Kaufman created intolerable working conditions and required Kaufman's resignation on June 23.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   78. Kaufman's involuntary and forced resignation on June 23 was a constructive discharge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   79. No legitimate reason existed for RHD's constructive discharge of Kaufman.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   80. RHD's explanation to Kaufman for his discharge was pretextual.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   81. Kaufman's elder abuse report was the substantial and motivating factor for RHD's constructive discharge of him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   [\u00b613] RHD answered the complaint, and Mr. Filipi filed a W.R.C.P. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss the claims against him, which the district court granted. On June 25, 2018, RHD moved for summary judgment, asserting that based on the undisputed evidence, Mr. Kaufman had no claim that RHD retaliated against him for his filing of the elder abuse report. On August 29, 2018, the district court granted RHD's motion, and Mr. Kaufman thereafter filed a timely notice of appeal to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   [\u00b614] W.R.C.P. 56 governs summary judgment and imposes obligations on the movant and nonmovant that we have described as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   The party requesting summary judgment bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that summary judgment should be granted as a matter of law.

Before my hiring, RHD did not inform me that RHD's management of the Nursing Home was deemed \"deficient\" in several areas by the Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") on a June 2016 State Survey, or that as part of such Survey, the Nursing Home entered into a Plan of Correction requiring the facility to \"ensure that all allegations of abuse are reported to the appropriate state agencies.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   19.

I learned that in July 2016, CMS required the Nursing Home to implement a \"plan of correction\" in order to continue to participate in, and receive reimbursement from, the Medicare Program, and that Filipi agreed to the plan of correction as a signatory and as part of RHD's management of the Nursing Home (Filipi was the Administrator of the Nursing Home at that time).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   21. The required corrective actions included the requirement that \"all allegations of abuse are reported to appropriate state agencies\" and \"any potential abuse found will be investigated promptly and thoroughly with a full report of findings sent to the appropriate state agency.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   58. In my follow-up to the investigation of the June 9 incident, and in preparation for this matter, I obtained information from another physical therapist that worked at the Nursing Home while Filipi was administrator. Said physical therapist indicated that Filipi improperly inflated RUG\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   levels by \"constantly pressuring the physical therapy staff to spend more time with each patient than they could tolerate for billing purposes, and were asked to perform procedures that were unnecessary, unethical or downright mean.\" The physical therapist further indicated that his company's physical therapy contract was terminated and RHD apparently hired two subsequent companies that they could pressure into that conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   59. Based on my report, Filipi realized that I would not be coerced into or be complicit with his practice of pressuring providers to increase RUG levels and reimbursement; instead, I was a resident/patient advocate, who respected clinical judgment based on the needs of the residents, and would not apply Filipi's administrative mandates to meet inappropriate productivity quotas.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   60. By standing up against Mr. Filipi and filing the elder abuse report, Filipi became aware that prior practices of forcing therapy on residents would not be tolerated, and would likely result in further federal and state regulatory scrutiny and review of the Nursing Home, and might result in the Platte County Hospital District Board of Trustees terminating the Agreement for Nursing Home Management Services with RHD.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   61. That was the real reason for Mr. Filipi's clear threat and intent to fire me, and as a newly-licensed Administrator in a state with few available Administrator jobs, I was certain that being fired after only one month on the job would damage my entire career as a nursing home administrator.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   [\u00b623] \"Speculation, conjecture, the suggestion of a possibility, guesses, or even probability are insufficient to establish an issue of material fact.\"\n   <em>\n    RB, Jr. by and through Brown v.

The email was soon followed up with a three-way conversation between Filipi, Payne, and myself, and during that conversation, I sent to both of them the attending nurse's Grievance Form that corroborated the resident's complaint by a disinterested third party with firsthand knowledge of the interaction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   24. It was my understanding based on that phone call that Filipi was supportive of reporting the incident to proper state agencies, and is why I stated in my elder abuse report that \"[I]t was the consensus of the regional manager, administrator, and director of nursing that this issue should be reported to the State of Wyoming as a potential abuse issue\".\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   25. Filipi called me directly after the three-way conference call ended, and stated that physical therapy was an important revenue source for the Nursing Home, he reminded me of the difficulty in obtaining physical therapy services for the Nursing Home (and the number of other physical therapy companies that had come and gone), and implied that physical therapy at the Nursing Home (and lucrative Medicare reimbursements for providing physical therapy to residents) could be at risk by submitting the elder abuse report.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   26.

At an earlier point in my employment by RHD as the Nursing Home Administrator, Filipi told me in person that an individual from the Wyoming DFS Adult Protective Services was difficult to deal with, had investigated several Nursing Home employees individually for their purported conduct, and stated that \"you don't want her here at this facility.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   33.

I informed Filipi that I had already submitted the report, and provided him a file that contained the hard copy of the report and accompanying documents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   35. Filipi read the report and became visibly angry and upset. He repeatedly asked me, \"You submitted this? You submitted the actual emails? You submitted the Grievance Form?\" He then began yelling at me that I had done the report wrong, had made him look bad by the information I had provided in the report, and reiterated that he instructed me not to file the report until he had reviewed it. He repeated in a raised voice, \"I can't believe you submitted this\".\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   37.

When I finally encountered Filipi in the hallway, I asked him to join me in my office, whereupon I asked why he was angry and he told me that because of my report, he had to do lots of damage control with the PT, and had to talk the PT out of quitting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   45. Filipi then told me that the PT reported that the PT and the resident had reached some type of settlement amongst them, and that therefore the report I made should never have been sent because the issue had been resolved internally.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   46. I responded that I had not spoke with the PT because he was not an employee of the Nursing Home, but that I had instead contacted PT's manager (Beth Payne).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   47. Filipi then reprimanded me for including the emails in my report and including the attending nurse's Grievance Form; he told me on several occasions throughout the conversation that I did not understand the implications of my report and that the State of Wyoming could come through the door at any time after receiving a report like that.

In the absence of a showing that those protocols and procedures violate or undermine the reporting statute, we must take care to avoid an unjustified and unreasonable intrusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   [\u00b632] The reporting statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2035-20-103\">\n    Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 35-20-103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , does not bar an employer from requiring supervisory review of abuse reports, and it does not require disclosure of management's deliberative emails, or even its internal processing and reporting forms. We therefore draw no inferences from Mr. Filipi's enforcement of his protocols and process. Turning then to the statements attributed to Mr. Filipi, even giving Mr. Kaufman any reasonable favorable inferences, the most we are able to glean from the evidence is that Mr. Filipi wanted the report submitted in a different manner and he was concerned with the physical therapist's response to the report.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is again pure conjecture to suggest that from this evidence one can draw an intention to cover up abuse so that an illegal practice of forcing physical therapy would not be revealed. This evidence again, therefore, fails to create a genuine issue of fact as to Mr. Kaufman's prima facie claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Final Abuse Report\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   [\u00b633] The remaining evidence Mr. Kaufman points to as creating a genuine issue of material fact is the final report Mr. Filipi and the director of nursing submitted to the State. Mr. Kaufman argues the report is false because it categorizes the nature of the event as \"Mistreatment,\" rather than \"Verbal Abuse,\" and because it states that it is unclear what the physical therapist said to\n   the resident. We have reviewed the report, and we disagree that it is false or otherwise creates an issue of material fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   [\u00b634] First, with regard to the report's identification of the incident as one of mistreatment, rather than verbal abuse, this is a distinction without much of a difference for purposes of the report. The nursing home's \"Policies and Procedures\" defines \"mistreatment\" as \"To treat wrongly or badly contrary to the Nursing Home's policies and compromising the resident's physical or emotional integrity.\" It defines \"verbal abuse\" as \"Any use of oral, written or gestured language that willfully includes disparaging and derogatory terms to residents or their families or within their hearing distance, regardless of their age, ability to comprehend or disability. Examples of verbal abuse include, but are not limited to: Threats of harm; saying things to frighten a resident, name calling, threats of punishment in any form, such as telling a resident that he/she will never be able to see his/her family again.\" Mistreatment is a broader, more general category, that arguably includes verbal abuse. Use of one term over the other cannot reasonably be construed as a whitewash, particularly in light of the remainder of the report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   [\u00b635] The report confirms that the incident occurred, and it confirms that the resident's attending nurse was a witness. It states, \"It is unclear whether [the physical therapist] told Resident that she would be kicked out/thrown out/discharged from facility/Medicare if she did not participate in therapy.\" The report then goes on to state that \"[the physical therapist] should have taken a different approach and with resident['s] anxiety and health issues that evening it would have been in everybody's best interests to come back the next day.\" The report cannot be characterized as false, and no reasonable inference may be drawn from the report that it was an attempt to cover up an illegal practice of forcing physical therapy on nursing home residents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   [\u00b636] The evidence Mr. Kaufman submitted in response to RHD's motion for summary judgment failed to create a disputed issue of material fact that would make his prima facie claim a triable issue. We therefore have no need to address the remaining showings required under the burden shifting analysis, and we uphold the district court's grant of summary judgment to RHD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   [\u00b637] Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    Physical therapy services were provided to residents of the nursing home by an independent contractor physical therapy firm.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    While it is not entirely clear from the record, we understand the ombudsman referenced in the report to be the long term care ombudsman who is statutorily charged with investigating, advocating, and mediating on behalf of adults applying for or receiving long term care services.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%209-2-1304\">\n     Wyo.
