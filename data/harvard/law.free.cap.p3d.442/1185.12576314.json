Defendant argues, among other things, that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance. Apart from his aggravated kidnapping conviction, which we vacate and in connection with which we remand for further proceedings, we affirm his convictions and deny his request to withdraw his guilty pleas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    The Assault\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 Defendant, who lived with his mother (Mother), instigated an argument with her about whether she had been interfering with his prescription medications and telling other people that he, a convicted felon, had access to a gun. Defendant recorded the altercation with a video camera, apparently for the purpose of making a video record of her \"lies.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 A few minutes into the argument, Mother stood up, intending to leave, but Defendant pushed her back into her chair. Mother and Defendant continued to argue, and Defendant told Mother that he \"could fuckin' put a bullet in [her] fuckin' head and not even think twice about it.\" Mother admitted that she had told someone that he had a gun. She then shoved Defendant, knocking the video camera out of his hands. Although Defendant and Mother are no longer visible on the recording, a subsequent assault can be heard in the background.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 Mother testified that Defendant hit her \"hard\" with \"both hands\" for what \"felt like forever.\" He also put her in a headlock and squeezed her until it \"felt like something was breaking.\" After releasing Mother, Defendant took a piece of glass from a coffee table that had been broken during the attack and brandished it over Mother, making her think\n   it was \"all over.\" In the video recording, Defendant is heard saying, \"You, fuckin', you oughta get your fuckin' hands off you old bitch or I'll fuckin' kill you, to death. I'll choke you to death.\" As Mother pleads with Defendant to stop, he tells her he is going to \"beat [her] to death,\" \"kill [her],\" and that the beating was \"just a taste [of] what [she was] going to get.\" Defendant then stops the recording.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 For a few hours, Defendant left Mother alone and the two were not together. But once again Defendant became upset with Mother for interfering with his prescription medications. Defendant then got a gun, pointed it at her head and ordered her to call 911. He told her he was \"not kidding around\" and he \"could shoot [her] leg,\" and then he shot two bullets into the floor. Subsequently, Defendant grabbed Mother by the legs and pulled her out of the chair. She fell to the floor and \"could hear\" her ribs cracking. Mother eventually got back on the chair and stayed there \"because it was so painful that [she] couldn't do anything else.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 Unable to tolerate the pain anymore, Mother asked Defendant to open the garage door so that she could go to the hospital. She asked him three times to open the garage door before he complied with her request. Before Mother left, Defendant asked her what she was going to say at the hospital, and she told him that she would tell the hospital staff she fell off the cement steps.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 Defendant followed Mother to the hospital. Approaching her in the emergency room area, he lifted up his coat \"to show [her] that he had [a] gun.\" When the emergency room doctor (First Doctor) examined Mother, she told him that she had fallen off the front porch steps. First Doctor recommended that Mother stay the night, but Mother was worried that Defendant would hurt other people, so she returned home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 The next day, when her daughter picked her up, Mother told her that Defendant had attacked and \"pistol whipped\" her. After a few days at her daughter's home, Mother was still in a lot of pain and returned to the hospital. A doctor (Second Doctor) examined her and determined that she had a subdural hematoma and edema-bleeding between the brain and the skull and swelling of the brain. Another doctor confirmed the diagnosis with an MRI that showed a subdural hematoma and \"[shear] injury\" to Mother's brain. Mother also had a bruised spleen and four broken ribs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 Officers arrested Defendant. Defendant, smiling at an officer said, \"You guys didn't even find the gun, did you?\" But officers found a fully loaded .22 caliber gun hidden at the house, and Defendant unsuccessfully tried to dispose of .22 caliber ammunition at the jail. Defendant's sister later found the video recording and turned it over to the police. Defendant was charged as noted above,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1, and the case proceeded to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    The Trial\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b610 On the first day of trial, Defendant requested a continuance, seeking new counsel. The district court, unaware of any conflict between Defendant and his counsel (Trial Counsel), asked Trial Counsel about the conflict. Trial Counsel replied that it would be better for \"additional counsel [to] come in the case,\" based on the \"complexity of the case\" and given the number of counts and his \"relationship with [Defendant].\" Trial Counsel indicated that Defendant \"want[ed him] to continue to work on the case\" and appreciated counsel's efforts, but Defendant wanted \"an attorney of his own that he's selected to join in and be lead counsel.\" The State pointed out that Trial Counsel was a \"very experienced attorney\" who had \"tried a number of very difficult cases\" that were \"much more complicated and much more serious than\" Defendant's case, and he had the necessary skill and experience to try the case on his own. The court denied the continuance request, stating that Defendant should have made the request \"months ago\" instead of on the first day of trial. It also denied Trial Counsel's request for additional counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b611 Three days into the trial, and after having viewed the video recording made by Defendant, the jury heard detailed testimony from Mother about the assault. After Mother's testimony, Trial Counsel requested additional time during the break. After returning\n   from this break, the parties announced that Defendant would plead guilty as charged, but the State would amend the aggravated kidnapping count by removing the serious bodily injury allegation which would reduce the maximum sentence from life without parole to 15 years to life.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-5-302\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-5-302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3)(a)-(b) (LexisNexis 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b612 Defendant signed a plea statement, listing the rights that he was waiving, including his right to a trial at which the State would have \"the burden of proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, what are called 'elements' of the offense (or offenses) charged.\" The district court conducted a plea colloquy to ensure that Defendant understood his guilty plea. During the colloquy, Defendant acknowledged that he had read and understood the plea agreement and the rights he was waiving, had no questions about it and required no further explanation of it, and was \"acting freely and voluntarily\" in entering his guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    The Plea Withdrawal Hearing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b613 A few days later, Defendant wrote a letter to the district court seeking to withdraw his guilty plea. Although the pro se motion was filed before sentencing, the district court failed to address it and proceeded with sentencing. Defendant appealed and this court summarily reversed Defendant's sentence and remanded the matter to the district court to address the motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-5-302\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 77-13-6(2)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b614 On remand, Defendant was appointed new counsel and granted leave to amend his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. In his amended motion, Defendant argued that his plea was not made knowingly or voluntarily and that Trial Counsel provided ineffective assistance. In an evidentiary hearing on these issues, Defendant testified that he pled guilty because Trial Counsel was unprepared for trial and he felt forced to take the plea deal. But Trial Counsel contradicted this testimony, stating that he had met with Defendant multiple times, interviewed the witnesses, visited the crime scene, and reviewed the evidence. Trial Counsel further testified that, after Mother testified at trial, Defendant did not want her to be cross-examined because \"she'd been through enough\" and Defendant had seen \"the entire jury was in tears.\" Defendant also told Trial Counsel that he was \"going to be convicted,\" a conclusion with which Trial Counsel apparently did not disagree. Trial Counsel then asked Defendant if he wanted to seek a plea deal, and Defendant told him that he did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b615 The district court determined that Trial Counsel's testimony was more consistent with the record and that Defendant's testimony was self-serving and \"was contradicted by the record.\" Based on that determination, the court found that Defendant was the one who sought a plea agreement, not Trial Counsel, and that he was not \"coerced or compelled to accept a plea bargain.\" It also concluded that the record established that Defendant entered his plea knowingly and voluntarily and that Trial Counsel's performance \"was not deficient\" nor prejudicial to Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b616 Defendant was then sentenced to several prison terms, some running consecutively and some running concurrently. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b617 Defendant raises two arguments on appeal. He first argues that Trial Counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel in several ways, rendering his plea unknowing and involuntary. With regard to those issues upon which the district court found facts at the plea withdrawal hearing conducted at our direction on remand following Defendant's initial appeal, our decision is informed by the court's findings of fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12341161\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/392/997/\">\n    2017 UT App 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12341161\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/392/997/\">\n    392 P.3d 997\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For those issues upon which the district court did not find facts, we review the ineffectiveness issues for correctness, examining \"whether the defendant was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Layton City v. Carr\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6907429\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/336/587/\">\n    2014 UT App 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6907429\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/336/587/\">\n    336 P.3d 587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b618 Defendant also contends that cumulative errors made by Trial Counsel allow the withdrawal of his guilty plea. \"Under the cumulative error doctrine, we will reverse only if the cumulative effect of the several errors undermines our confidence that a fair [proceeding] was had.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Kohl\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11510213\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/999/7/\">\n    2000 UT 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 25,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11510213\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/999/7/\">\n    999 P.2d 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   I. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b619 Defendant contends that his plea was unknowing and involuntary because he either had to \"plead guilty to crimes he did not commit but have the chance of parole\" or \"continue with trial and assuredly be convicted without the possibility of parole.\" He essentially argues that Trial Counsel provided such deficient legal representation that Defendant had no choice but to plead guilty to the crimes for which he was charged, raising six instances where Trial Counsel provided such deficient representation and one instance in which his plea withdrawal counsel did.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b620 To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show \"that counsel's performance was deficient,\" and \"that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\"\n   <em>\n    Strickland v. Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    466 U.S. 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 687,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984).

Failure to Obtain Independent Medical Experts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b621 Defendant contends that Trial Counsel failed to \"follow up with independent medical analysis\" or call independent medical experts at trial to demonstrate that Second Doctor's subdural hematoma diagnosis was incorrect. He asserts that Mother's injuries can occur \"spontaneously\" as a result of her age and Trial Counsel should have followed up with a medical expert to confirm this theory. Defendant raised this claim at the plea withdrawal hearing, and the district court found that Trial Counsel's decision not to call \"an additional medical expert\" was \"a reasonable strategy choice.\" The court determined that \"a neurologist or an additional medical expert\" \"would not have made a significant difference to the outcome of the case\" and \"Defendant has not presented any actual evidence that these additional expert witnesses would have given ground shaking testimony to contradict or undermine the testimony the medical doctors gave in this case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b622 Defendant does not point to evidence in the record demonstrating that the court's factual findings were clearly erroneous. On appeal, a defendant \"cannot 'simply restate or review evidence that points to an alternate finding or a finding contrary to the trial court's finding of fact.' \"\n   <em>\n    Salt Lake City v.

Failure to View or Investigate Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b623 Defendant contends that Trial Counsel did not view or investigate critical evidence in his case. To begin with, Defendant argues that Trial Counsel did not view the video recording prior to the evidentiary hearing on his motion to suppress or otherwise before trial and that Trial Counsel's motion in support lacked \"legal authority or meaningful analysis.\" Had it not been for these errors, Defendant argues, the motion would have been successful because his sister conducted the warrantless, nonconsensual search on behalf of the police.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b624 At the plea withdrawal hearing, Trial Counsel stated that he viewed the video with Defendant multiple times before trial. It is not clear from the record whether Trial Counsel viewed the video prior to the evidentiary hearing on the motion to suppress. Nevertheless, the motion to suppress was futile. Trial Counsel filed a supporting memorandum after the evidentiary hearing, arguing that the video recording should be suppressed given that it was the fruit of an unconstitutional search by Defendant's sister. While the district court concluded that Defendant's sister conducted the search, it determined there was no evidence that this private search was done at the request of the police. And so, even if Trial Counsel failed to watch the video recording prior to the evidentiary hearing and his motion lacked \"legal authority or meaningful analysis,\" it was not prejudicial to Defendant given the futility of the motion premised on his sister acting as a police agent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b625 Defendant next argues that Trial Counsel failed to investigate ballistic and forensic evidence, asserting that it is not possible for him to have shot the gun at the angle the State claims he did, his fingerprints were not found on the gun, and there is no evidence the gun was fired. He contends that Trial Counsel should have hired an independent expert to testify to these claimed inconsistencies. But these claims are speculative, without any basis in the record, and are insufficient to overcome the presumption that Trial Counsel provided effective assistance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

An officer also testified that upon Defendant's arrest Defendant, with a smile on his face, stated, \"You guys didn't even find the gun, did you?\" But officers found a .22 caliber handgun at the house, and Defendant later unsuccessfully tried to dispose of .22 caliber ammunition, overlooked by the arresting officer during the search of Defendant once he got to jail. In light of this evidence, and given Trial Counsel's testimony that he had viewed the evidence and the crime scene prior to trial, we presume Trial Counsel did not pursue ballistic and forensic experts having concluded,\n   in his \"reasonable professional judgment,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , that such an exercise would be pointless. For these reasons, Defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim, premised on this ground, fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   C. Failure to Advise Defendant on the Sufficiency of the Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b627 Defendant contends that he should be allowed to withdraw his guilty pleas to possession of ammunition in a correctional facility, attempted murder, and aggravated kidnapping because Trial Counsel \"failed to provide competent legal advice\" on the insufficiency of the evidence supporting these charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b628 Determining that it was Defendant's request that Trial Counsel seek a plea agreement after hearing Mother's testimony and seeing the jurors in tears, the district court found that Defendant was \"not coerced or compelled to accept a plea bargain.\" And because there was compliance with rule 11 of the Utah Rules of Criminal Procedure, including a factual basis, \"provided by both the opening statement and the subsequent witnesses and exhibits that were presented to the court over two and one half days of testimony,\" the court concluded that Defendant \"entered his pleas knowingly and voluntarily.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah R.

Defendant only let her leave after knowing she would tell the hospital that she fell off the cement steps. But the record does not support these assertions, and nothing in Mother's testimony suggests that Defendant intended to \"detain\" Mother by not opening the garage door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b642 Mother testified that, after the assault, she asked Defendant three times \"to open the garage door\" before \"he opened it.\" She could not recall why she did not have a garage door key herself, but she did not. When the State asked Mother, \"Without him opening that garage was there a way for you to leave?\" Mother replied, \"I could have gone outside and there's buttons that you could push, but half the time it doesn't do it.\" Before Mother left the house, Defendant wanted to know what she was going to tell hospital personnel, but she gave no indication in her testimony that Defendant was preventing her from leaving the house. Instead, to prevent Mother from telling the truth, Defendant threatened Mother with a gun and followed her to the emergency room, lifting his coat to show her the gun before she met with First Doctor. And she testified that she was concerned about reporting Defendant's assault because of what he would do to his sisters if she told the truth. Because Mother never testified that Defendant prevented her from leaving the house, we conclude that Defendant did not \"detain\" her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b643 Because neither of these instances amount to a detention under the aggravated kidnapping statute, Trial Counsel was remiss in not moving to dismiss the charge after Mother's testimony or during plea negotiations. And although Mother's testimony of the assault may have persuaded Defendant that he was \"going to be convicted\" and he sought a plea agreement, Trial Counsel failed to inform Defendant that an insufficient factual basis supported the aggravated kidnapping charge. Trial Counsel testified that, during plea negotiations, he did not discuss the factual basis for the aggravated kidnapping charge with Defendant because Defendant said he understood the factual basis for each element based on the State's evidence given at trial. He further testified that his advice about the aggravated kidnapping evidence occurred prior to trial.

More likely, of course, had Trial Counsel considered the evidence more carefully and shared this analysis with the State, it is possible the plea arrangement would have gone forward with aggravated kidnapping off the table, given Defendant's willingness to plead to the other seven felony charges against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b644 We conclude that there is sufficient evidence for Defendant's possession of ammunition in a correctional facility and attempted murder convictions, and consequently, Defendant fails to demonstrate it would have been rational for him to withdraw his guilty plea to the charges resulting in these convictions. But, as to his aggravated kidnapping conviction, Trial Counsel erred in failing to object to the charge after Mother's testimony or during plea negotiations and in failing to advise Defendant that an insufficient factual basis supported the \"detention\" element of the crime.

First, he argues that Trial Counsel failed to preserve crime scene evidence, claiming that the State has an obligation to preserve exculpatory evidence and that Trial Counsel should have required the State to preserve this evidence for the defense. But Defendant fails to cite any legal authority supporting this argument and does not discuss why the absence of this evidence at trial was prejudicial to his defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b648 Second, Defendant argues that Trial Counsel failed to object to obvious hearsay testimony from First and Second Doctors. Defendant argues that these witnesses did not diagnose Mother because they relied instead on the \"radiologists specifically trained to read and interpret data.\" Defendant fails to develop any meaningful legal analysis of his arguments or of rules 801(c) and\n   803 of the Utah Rules of Evidence and controlling authority on this issue. And furthermore, he asserts that \"[a]t worst, the evidence shows that [Defendant] slapped his mother and pulled her out of a chair,\" arguing that the evidence is sufficient to support a simple assault charge but not attempted murder or aggravated assault. But Defendant was not convicted of aggravated assault, and as we discussed above, the video recording and Mother's testimony constituted sufficient evidence to support the attempted murder conviction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34-36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b649 Finally, Defendant argues that his plea withdrawal counsel \"failed to adequately question [Trial Counsel's] credibility\" and \"failed to establish that [Trial Counsel] was highly motivated to get a guilty plea.\" But the focus of Defendant's argument is on Trial Counsel's errors, not those of his plea withdrawal counsel, and in framing the argument this way, he fails to engage in a meaningful analysis of these ineffective assistance claims. Because Defendant fails to adequately brief these claims, he fails in his burden of persuasion, and we decline to address them further.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   II. Cumulative Error\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b650 Defendant contends that the cumulative prejudicial effect of his ineffective assistance of counsel claims undermines confidence in his guilty plea, and we should therefore reverse his convictions. However, \"[i]f [we] determine[ ] that either a party's claim did not amount to an error, or that the claim was an error but has no potential to cause harm on its own, the claim cannot weigh in favor of reversal under the cumulative effects test.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Accordingly, there was no cumulative error in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b652 We affirm Defendant's convictions and conclude that his guilty pleas were knowingly and voluntarily made, with the exception of the plea culminating in his aggravated kidnapping conviction. We vacate that conviction and remand for trial or such other proceedings as may now be in order.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    In relation to one of his ineffective assistance claims, Defendant also argues that the district court failed to apply the doctrine of merger to his aggravated kidnapping charge.
