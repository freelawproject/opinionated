While R.Y. was in her care, the Department of Child Safety (DCS) Office of Licensing and Regulation denied Natasha S.'s application to renew her foster care license.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. Rev. Stat. (A.R.S.) \u00a7 8-506 (2019).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Natasha S. challenged that\n   denial administratively and continued to serve as foster placement for R.Y. When DCS affirmed the denial of her foster care license, Natasha S. did not challenge that final agency action in superior court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1092.08 ; 12-901 to -914.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 In December 2017, R.Y.'s guardian ad litem moved for an order requiring DCS to pay Natasha S. for foster care provided to R.Y. through November 2017. The superior court granted that motion and DCS paid the amount ordered; that order and payment are not part of this appeal. Later, Natasha S. moved for an order requiring DCS to pay her for foster care provided to R.Y. in December 2017. The superior court denied the motion, and Natasha S. timely filed this appeal challenging that denial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Natasha S. asserts appellate jurisdiction pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 8-235(A) and 12-120.21(A)(1). DCS counters that Natasha S. is not an \"aggrieved party\" as required by A.R.S. \u00a7 8-235(A) and, alternatively, that the superior court lacked jurisdiction to consider her motion. Assuming (without deciding) that Natasha S. was an aggrieved party, the superior court lacked jurisdiction to consider her motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 \"[A]ppellate jurisdiction is derivative,\" meaning that \"when jurisdiction is lacking in the trial court, it is lacking on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Webb v.

Title 8, however, does not grant that court jurisdiction to address foster care licensing or payment. Instead, those matters are first addressed administratively.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , A.R.S. \u00a7 8-503(A)(4)(g) (granting DCS authority to \"[e]stablish rules, regulations and standards for ... [u]niform amounts of payment for all foster homes according to certification\"); Ariz. Admin. Code (A.A.C.) R21-1-301 to - 314 (setting forth such rules). An individual wishing to challenge an adverse decision by DCS on such matters may seek review by an Office of Administrative Hearings Administrative Law Judge (ALJ).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.A.C. R21-1-301 to - 314 ; Ariz. Dep't of Child Safety,\n   <em>\n    Policy and Procedure Manual\n   </em>\n   ch. 4, \u00a7 9 (eff. Oct. 15, 2018), https://extranet.azdcs.gov/DCSPolicy/Content/04_Out_of_Home_Care/foster_care_rate.htm. When such review is requested, the ALJ issues a recommended decision after an evidentiary hearing. A.A.C. R21-1-313. After review of the ALJ's recommended decision, DCS issues a final administrative decision.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4052335\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/223/540/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   An aggrieved party may seek judicial review of a final administrative decision pursuant to Arizona's Administrative Procedures Act (APA).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-901 to - 914; 41-1092.08(H); A.A.C.
