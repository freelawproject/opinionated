Code, \u00a7 790 et seq.), he admitted two charges filed against him in Welfare and Institutions Code section 602 petitions for possession of methamphetamine (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11377, subd. (a)) and first degree burglary (Pen. Code, \u00a7 459).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was declared a ward of the juvenile court, and ordered confined at the Fouts Springs Boys Ranch for a maximum period of six years and four months, followed by probation upon specified terms and conditions. In this appeal, he claims that the trial court erred by refusing to grant him deferred entry of judgment, ordered an excessively restrictive commitment, and imposed an invalid condition of probation. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Statement of Facts and Procedural History<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">The charged offenses were based upon several incidents, the first of which occurred on September 8, 2001, when a Vacaville police officer encountered appellant leaving the residence of a \u201cknown and documented Norte\u00f1o gang member\u201d on Callen Street, after visiting his girlfriend there. Appellant had tattoos, red clothing and a hairstyle \u201cindicative of Norte\u00f1o gang affiliation.\u201d A search of appellant uncovered a pocketknife and a \u201ccrank pipe\u201d he admittedly used to smoke methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">On October 12, 2001, Lorenzo Padilla\u2019s vehicle, a gray 1986 Nissan, was stolen, and the next day his house in Suisun was burglarized. Stolen from Padilla\u2019s residence during the burglary were rifles, televisions, a computer, and \u201cother electronic equipment.\u201d Padilla\u2019s grandson Jose Quezada, a known Norte\u00f1o \u201cgang member out of Napa\u201d with \u201ctwo outstanding warrants for his arrest,\u201d had been reportedly seen driving the stolen vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Vacaville police officers discovered Padilla\u2019s Nissan parked in Scoggins Court in Vacaville on October 13, 2001. Later that day the officers observed Quezada on the north side of a residence on Scoggins Court near the stolen vehicle with a group of \u201cseveral other subjects,\u201d one of them appellant, also \u201cknown to be a BSL Norte\u00f1o.\u201d Quezada was arrested on the warrants and for possession of suspected methamphetamine found near him. Miguel Melendrez, another Norte\u00f1o gang member in the group, was arrested for possession of cocaine and marijuana. A \u201clong mace-like stick weapon\u201d was found in the immediate area of the group, and an empty .22-caliber magazine was observed on the same step on which appellant had been seated.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">With appellant\u2019s consent, the officers searched his residence. They were escorted by appellant to the backyard, where stereo equipment and a heater stolen from Padilla\u2019s residence were found under a blanket. Appellant admitted that as part of his \u201cminimal\u201d participation with Quezada and others in the burglary at Padilla\u2019s residence, he removed items from the house, stored them on his property, and gave a stolen television set to someone else. Appellant also directed the investigating officer to a \u201c.22 rifle which matched the magazine,\u201d that \u201cwas located in the crawl space under the next apartment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">On October 16, 2001, appellant was contacted and searched by a Vacaville police officer behind an abandoned building. Two small baggies were taken from appellant; one contained methamphetamine, the other marijuana. Appellant admitted that he used methamphetamine that morning. He was also in possession of a large black marking pen, which his companion told the officer appellant had used to tag the building walls with \u201cgang graffiti writings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Appellant acknowledged to the police and his probation officer that he was a \u201cNorte\u00f1o gang member\u201d and methamphetamine addict. He also used marijuana \u201con a daily basis\u201d and cocaine occasionally. He did not attend school after expulsion for foul language, disruptive behavior and gang activity. Appellant\u2019s mother stated that appellant refused to attend school and \u201cwas beyond her control.\u201d Appellant further advised the probation department that \u201csince he was 12 years of age\u201d he has engaged in a sexual relationship with an adult girlfriend, who was pregnant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">I. <em>The Trial Court\u2019s Refusal to Grant Appellant Deferred Entry of Judgment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Appellant argues that the trial court erred by refusing to order deferred entry of judgment under rule 1495 and section 790 et seq.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Pursuant to section 790 and rule 1495, during the proceedings the district attorney filed a determination of eligibility for deferred entry of judgment that specified appellant met the eligibility requirements of the statute. The probation department and the district attorney, however, opposed deferred entry of judgment for appellant. Following a hearing on the matter, the trial court agreed with the probation department and found appellant unsuitable to participate in the deferred entry of judgment program. Appellant complains that the court \u201cdisregarded the statutory criteria,\u201d \u201cfailed to give consideration to crucial factors,\u201d and improperly relied upon the district attorney\u2019s speculation and mischaracterizations in denying him the benefit of deferred entry of judgment. He argues that since he \u201cmet all the requirements specified by rule 1495, the juvenile court abused its discretion and erred by denying deferred entry of judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Our first task is to determine whether, as appellant seems to suggest, failure to grant deferred entry of judgment is error if the minor meets the articulated statutory eligibility requirements.  We must interpret the statutes to ascertain the intent of the legislative body so as to effectuate the purpose of the law. <em>(People v. Jefferson </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 86, 94 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 893, 980 P.2d 441]; <em>People v. Dyer </em>(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 448, 452-453 [115 Cal.Rptr.2d 527].) \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018Penal Code sections must generally be construed \u201c \u2018according to the fair import of their terms, with a view to effect its objects and to promote justice.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 [Citations.] [f]  \u2018Consistent with that general principle, appellate courts first examine the language of the code section to determine whether the words used unequivocally express the Legislature\u2019s intent. If no ambiguity, uncertainty, or doubt about the meaning of the statute appear, the provision is to be applied according to its terms without further judicial construction. [Citations.] flj] When the language of the section is on its face ambiguous or leaves doubt, . . . , the court must resort to extrinsic aids to ascertain the purpose behind the statute and give the provision a judicially created meaning commensurate with the purpose. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Franz </em>(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1440 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 773]; see also <em>People v. Avila </em>(2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 791, 796 [95 Cal.Rptr.2d 651].) Our interpretation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>the statutory requirements for deferred entry of judgment is guided by settled principles.  \u201c[W]e look first to the plain meaning of the statute. If the statute\u2019s meaning is ambiguous, we turn to the voters\u2019 intent and, finally, if the voters\u2019 intent is not clear, construe the statute most favorably to . . . the offender.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Henkel) </em>(2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 78, 81 [119 Cal.Rptr.2d 465].)</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">\u201c \u2018Whether a particular statute is intended to impose a mandatory duty, rather than a mere obligation to perform a discretionary function, is a question of statutory interpretation for the courts.\u2019 [Citation.] The enactment\u2019s language \u2018is, of course, a most important guide in determining legislative intent, [but] there are unquestionably instances in which other factors will indicate that apparent obligatory language was not intended to foreclose a governmental entity\u2019s or officer\u2019s exercise of discretion.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (Ha<em>ggis v. City of Los Angeles </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 490, 499 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 327, 993 P.2d 983].)</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Nothing in the statutory language indicates to us an intent to require the juvenile court to grant deferred entry of judgment if the \u201ccircumstances\u201d specified in section 790 and rule 1495 are found to exist.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To the contrary, the statutes invariably use discretionary rather than compulsory terms when expressing both the guidelines and procedures that govern the trial court\u2019s responsibility to grant deferred entry of judgment to a qualifying juvenile defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Rule 1495(a) provides that a juvenile <em>\u201cmay </em>be considered for a deferred entry of judgment\u201d if all of the eligibility requirements are met. (Italics <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>added.) The procedures enumerated in the statutes once the threshold eligibility determination is made confirm that a grant of deferred entry of judgment is discretionary rather than mandatory. Subdivision (b) of section 790 specifies that \u201c[i]f the minor is found eligible for deferred entry of judgment, the prosecuting attorney shall file a declaration in writing with the court or state for the record the grounds upon which the determination is based,\u201d and the trial court then <em>\u201cmay </em>set the hearing for deferred entry of judgment at the initial appearance under Section 657.\u201d (Italics added.) The written notification sent to the eligible minor must include: \u201cA clear statement that, in lieu of jurisdictional and disposition hearings, the court <em>may grant a deferred entry of judgment </em>with respect to any offense charged in the petition, provided that the minor admits each allegation contained in the petition and waives time for the pronouncement of judgment. . . .\u201d(\u00a7791, subd. (a)(3), italics added.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">If the eligibility standards are met, \u201cthe court <em>may </em>refer the case to the probation department\u201d for an investigation and report \u201cor the court <em>may </em>summarily grant deferred entry of judgment. . . .\u201d(\u00a7 791, subd. (b), italics added; rule 1495 (d)(2).) <em>\u201cWhen directed by the court, </em>the probation department shall make an investigation and take into consideration the defendant\u2019s age, maturity, educational background, family relationships, demonstrable motivation, treatment history, if any, and other mitigating and aggravating factors in determining whether the minor is a person who would be benefited by education, treatment, or rehabilitation. The probation department shall also determine which programs would accept the minor. The probation department shall report its findings and recommendations to the court. . . .\u201d (\u00a7 791, subd. (b), italics added; rule 1495(d)(3)(A).) The court then makes the final decision on whether the minor will benefit from \u201ceducation, treatment, or rehabilitation,\u201d (\u00a7 791, subd. (b)) either without a hearing based upon the supplemental information submitted, or following a hearing at which consideration is given to \u201cthe declaration of the prosecuting attorney, any report and recommendations from the probation department, and any other relevant material provided by the child or other interested parties.\u201d (Rule 1495(f).) <em>\u201cIf the court grants the deferred entry of judgment,\u201d </em>search and seizure probation conditions must be imposed, and additional conditions \u201cmay\u201d be ordered regarding education, treatment, random testing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>for alcohol and other drags, if appropriate, curfew, and any other \u201cconditions consistent with the identified needs of the child and the factors that led to the conduct of the child.\u201d (Rule 1495(f)(4), italics added; see also \u00a7 794.)</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">We are persuaded that the statutory language empowers but does not compel the juvenile court to grant deferred entry of judgment once eligibility under section 790, subdivision (a) is established. (See <em>Allyson </em>v. <em>Department of Transportation </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1304, 1319 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 490]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Alvarado) (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 464, 476 [255 Cal.Rptr. 46]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Reiley </em>(1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1487, 1489 [238 Cal.Rptr. 297].) \u201c \u2018 \u201cShall\u201d is mandatory, . . . \u201cmay\u201d is permissive.\u2019 (Cal. Rules of Court, rale 407(a).)\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>(People v. Reiley, supra, </em>at p. 1489; see also <em>Judith P. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 535, 551 [126 Cal.Rptr.2d 14].) \u201c[T]he usual rale with California codes is that \u2018shall\u2019 is mandatory and \u2018may\u2019 is permissive unless the context requires otherwise.\u201d <em>(Walt Rankin &amp; Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Murrieta </em>(2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 605, 614 [101 Cal.Rptr.2d 48].) In the context of the statutory deferred judgment scheme, the consistent use of permissive rather than mandatory terms manifests a legislative intent to confer discretionary authority upon the trial court to act following a determination of eligibility. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Ledesma </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 90, 94-95 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 610, 939 P.2d 1310]; <em>People v. Craft </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 554, 558-559 [224 Cal.Rptr. 626, 715 P.2d 585].)</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">A conclusion that a grant of deferred entry of judgment to an eligible juvenile is not compulsory is also necessary to achieve a result in harmony with the rest of the statutory enactment. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Mendoza </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 896, 908-909 [98 Cal.Rptr.2d 431, 4 P.3d 265].)  \u201cA statute must be construed in the context of the entire statutory scheme of which it is a part, in order to achieve harmony among the parts. [Citations.] Also to be considered is the maxim that \u2018 \u201c. . . statutes should be interpreted in such a way as to make them consistent with each other, rather than obviate one another. [Citation.]\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People v. Lewis </em>(1993) 21 Cal.App.4th 243, 254 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 827].) The provisions that direct and empower the trial court to refer the case to the probation department for investigation and report, consider the findings and recommendations of the probation department, independently determine whether the eligible minor will benefit from \u201ceducation, treatment, or rehabilitation,\u201d and impose probation conditions if deferred entry of judgment is granted, all would be rendered meaningless surplusage if the court had no discretion to deny deferred entry of judgment once the eligibility requirements were satisfied. <em>(People v. Hicks </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 784, 794 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 469, 863 P.2d 714].) We must interpret the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>statutory language in a manner that avoids such an absurd result. (See <em>Gregory v. State Bd. of Control </em>(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 584, 595 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 575]; <em>Gomes v. County of Mendocino </em>(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 977, 986 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 93].)</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">The adult deferred judgment program (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1000 et seq.), also known as drug diversion, although more limited in its scope of eligibility to specified drug offenses, has corresponding provisions. \u201cUnder Penal Code section 1000 et seq., eligible drug offenders may be considered for a diversion program in lieu of criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>(People v. Fleming </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 1566, 1569 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 78].) Like the juvenile deferred judgment program, \u201cthe inquiry into diversion begins with a preliminary screening for eligibility conducted by the district attorney under standards prescribed by the statute. Section 1000 provides that when a defendant is charged with one of six offenses therein specified\u2014principally unlawful possession of narcotics, marijuana, or restricted dangerous drugs\u2014 the district attorney will review the defendant\u2019s file to determine whether he also meets certain minimum standards of eligibility for the diversion program.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (On Tai </em>Flo) (1974) 11 Cal.3d 59, 62 [113 Cal.Rptr. 21, 520 P.2d 405], fn. omitted; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Sturiale </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1313 [98 Cal.Rptr.2d 865].) \u201cIf the defendant meets all six criteria, the process of adjudication begins, during which the court will weigh relevant facts and make a decision either diverting or refusing to divert the defendant into a rehabilitation program.\u201d <em>(People v. Paz </em>(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 1209, 1213 [266 Cal.Rptr. 468].)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The adjudicatory function to weigh the relevant facts and \u201cmake a decision either diverting or refusing to divert the defendant into a rehabilitation program\u201d is vested \u201cin the trial court: \u2018The court shall hold a hearing and, after consideration of the probation department\u2019s report and any other information considered by the court to be relevant to its decision, shall determine if the defendant consents to further proceedings under this chapter and waives his right to a speedy trial and if the defendant should be diverted and referred for education, treatment, or rehabilitation.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (On Tai Flo), supra, </em>at pp. 62-63, italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>The drug diversion statutes have been construed not to impose an obligation on the trial court, but rather to grant discretion to divert an eligible defendant based upon \u201cwhether the accused \u2018would be benefited by education, treatment, or rehabilitation.\u2019 (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1000.1, subd. (a), 1000.2.)\u201d <em>(Harvey v. Superior Court </em>(1974) 43 Cal.App.3d 66, 68 [117 Cal.Rptr. 383]; see also <em>People v. Fleming, supra, </em>22 Cal.App.4th 1566, 1569-1570.) No reason appears to us to interpret the substantially similar language of the two comparable statutory schemes to have two different meanings. <em>(Malcolm </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 518, 527-528 [174 Cal.Rptr. 694, 629 P.2d 495]; <em>In re Jerry R. </em>(1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1432, 1437 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 155].)  In accordance with the plain meaning of the statutory language we conclude that the juvenile court has discretion to grant deferred entry of judgment to an eligible minor. Contrary to appellant\u2019s suggestion, denial of deferred entry of judgment is not an abuse of discretion merely because the minor has satisfied the eligibility requirements of section 790, subdivision (a), and rule 1495(a). Instead, the court makes an independent determination after consideration of the \u201csuitability\u201d factors specified in rule 1495(d)(3) and section 791, subdivision (b),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> with the exercise of discretion based upon the standard of whether the minor will derive benefit from \u201ceducation, treatment, and rehabilitation\u201d rather than a more restrictive commitment. (\u00a7 791, subd. (b); rule 1495(b)(2), (f).)</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">We further conclude that the record in the present case fails to demonstrate any abuse of discretion by the trial court. The court did not disregard statutory criteria and improperly rely on \u201cspeculation\u201d or \u201cincorrect assertions\u201d by the district attorney that appellant was \u201cnot eligible for deferred entry of judgment,\u201d as he maintains. The district attorney did not assert that appellant was <em>ineligible </em>for deferred entry of judgment; his eligibility had already been established and acknowledged by respondent. Instead, the district attorney argued that appellant \u201cis absolutely not <em>appropriate </em>for deferred entry of judgment just on the face of it,\u201d then proceeded to explain the supporting reasons.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court considered and followed the recommendation in the probation department\u2019s report that appellant was an entirely unsuitable, although eligible, candidate for deferred entry of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>We also agree with the court\u2019s assessment of the relevant factors stated in the record. While appellant\u2019s youth and lack of a prior record of offenses militate in favor of deferred entry of judgment, the remaining factors amply support the trial court\u2019s decision. He is an entrenched Norte\u00f1o gang member with a history of drug abuse and admitted addiction to methamphetamine. In addition to the drug offenses, he participated with other Norte\u00f1o gang members in a residential burglary and the theft of property that included a .22-caliber rifle. He stored some of the items appropriated in the burglary at his residence, and concealed the stolen rifle next door. When he was detained after the burglary with a group of other Norte\u00f1o gang members, a .22-caliber magazine, and a \u201cmace-like stick weapon\u201d were discovered nearby. On another occasion, he was found in possession of a pocketknife. Appellant no longer attended school, and his mother stated that he had become unmanageable. The evidence established that appellant was not a suitable candidate for deferred entry of judgment, and required more formal, restrictive measures. Denial of deferred entry of judgment was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">II., III.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AU4\">Marchiano, P.
