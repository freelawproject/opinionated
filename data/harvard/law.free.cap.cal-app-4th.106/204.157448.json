The City has enacted and administers a mobilehome rent control ordinance (the Ordinance). Respondent and cross-appellant is MHC Operating Limited Partnership (MHC). MHC owns and operates a 725-unit mobilehome park within the City known as Westwinds Manufactured Home Community mobilehome park (the Park), which it purchased in 1997. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>is also one intervener on appeal, cross-respondent Wallace Sucholas (Sucholas), who is a resident of the Park.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\"><em>The Ordinance: </em>The Ordinance permits mobilehome park owners a fair and reasonable return. (San Jose Mun. Code, tit. 17, ch. 17.22, \u00a7 17.22.020.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Ordinance operates on the rebuttable presumption that net operating income (NOI) provided owners with a fair return in the base year. (\u00a7\u00a7 17.22.480, 17.22.510.) The Ordinance therefore defines fair return as the amount needed to maintain base year NOI, as adjusted for inflation. (\u00a7 17.22.550.) Except in the case of rental units previously subject to long-term leases, the Ordinance establishes 1985 as the base year. (\u00a7 17.22.490.) Base year NOI is calculated by subtracting actual operating expenses from gross income for the year. (\u00a7 17.22.500; see also \u00a7\u00a7 17.22.530, 17.22.540.) Under the Ordinance, park owners are allowed certain rent increases without review. (\u00a7 17.22.450.) Applications for extraordinary increases (in excess of those allowed without review) must be approved by an administrative hearing officer. (\u00a7 17.22.460.)</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\"><em>Summary of Proceedings Below: </em>MHC applied for an extraordinary rent increase. The hearing officer denied the application on the ground that MHC had failed to provide base year NOI. MHC sought judicial relief, arguing that it was unable to calculate base year NOI because of missing financial records and further arguing that the Ordinance violated its constitutional right to a fair return. In 1999, the superior court issued a writ commanding the City to reconsider MHC\u2019s application. In response, the City amended the Ordinance to permit estimates of 1985 base year NOI. Thereafter, further administrative proceedings were conducted, but MHC was again denied a rent increase. MHC then sought' a supplement writ from the superior court, which was denied in July 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\"><em>The Appeals: </em>On appeal, the City claims that the trial court erred in granting the 1999 writ. MHC asserts that the court erred in refusing to grant supplemental writ relief in 2000. As we explain below, we dismiss the City\u2019s appeal as moot, and we reject MHC\u2019s appeal on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">In 1998, MHC applied for an extraordinary rent increase under the Ordinance. At the time of MHC\u2019s application, the Ordinance contained no provision permitting the use of estimates to establish base year NOI.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>\n<em>Proceedings Leading to the City\u2019s Appeal:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Hearings on MHC\u2019s rent increase application were conducted in September 1998.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At those hearings, MHC claimed that it was unable to establish 1985 NOI because the park\u2019s prior owner had not retained adequate financial records. MHC therefore sought to use 1996 as the base year, instead of 1985. The hearing officer rejected that approach and denied a rent increase, citing MHC\u2019s failure to establish 1985 base year NOI.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">MHC then petitioned the superior court for a writ of administrative mandamus, challenging the denial of its rent increase application. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">In 1999, the trial court granted MHC\u2019s writ petition. The court declared the Ordinance unconstitutional as applied to MHC, because it lacked a mechanism for calculating fair return when mobilehome park owners cannot prove actual base year NOI. Nevertheless, the court observed: \u201cIf the Ordinance did allow an estimation of net operating income for 1985, then [MHC] would not be deprived of a fair rate of return because [it] could present circumstantial evidence of the net operating income in 1985. . . . However, the Ordnance <em>[sic] </em>does not allow estimations.\u201d The court issued a writ of administrative mandamus commanding the City to reconsider MHC\u2019s rent increase application in light of the court\u2019s decision. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5, subd. (f).)</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">The City\u2019s appeal is from the August 1999 judgment granting MHC\u2019s writ petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">\n<em>Proceedings Leading to MHC\u2019s Appeal:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">In September 1999, in response to the trial court\u2019s decision, the City adopted an Urgency Ordinance, which amended the Ordinance to allow estimates of NOI when actual base year information is unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">In November 1999, the rent control hearing officer conducted further hearings to reconsider MHC\u2019s rent increase application in light of the trial court\u2019s decision and the City\u2019s amendment to the Ordinance. MHC acknowledged that the purpose of the hearings was to permit it \u201cto attempt to establish the net operating income for 1985 by inference . . . .\u201d Despite that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>acknowledgement, MHC again sought to use 1996 as the base year instead of 1985, based on its claim it could not reasonably estimate 1985 NOI with the information available to it. In support of that claim, MHC offered the testimony of a certified public accountant, Wanda Ginner, who testified that she had \u201crun out of ways to try to estimate 1985\u201d and that \u201cfrom an accountant\u2019s standpoint it cannot be done.\u201d To refute MHC\u2019s claim, the Park residents offered testimony from their own expert, Dr. Kenneth Baar, who opined that a reasonable estimate of 1985 NOI could be made using the available information.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The hearing officer credited the residents\u2019 evidence that 1985 NOI could be estimated. She also rejected MHC\u2019s contention that the Ordinance permitted it to use 1996 as a substitute base year. Based on those determinations, the hearing officer concluded that MHC had failed to carry its burden of establishing base year NOI, and she again denied MHC a rent increase. But the hearing officer made her decision \u201cwithout prejudice,\u201d ruling that \u201cMHC may reapply for the rent increase based on estimates of 1985 or such other base years as authorized\u201d by the applicable provisions of the Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">MHC then moved the superior court for issuance of a supplemental writ of administrative mandamus. MHC asserted that the hearing officer had ignored the amended Ordinance and the court\u2019s prior order, and that her refusal to establish MHC\u2019s fair rate of return constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">After a hearing in late May 2000, the trial court denied MHC\u2019s motion for a supplemental writ, issuing its tentative decision several days after the hearing and its formal order in July 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">MHC\u2019s appeal challenges the trial court\u2019s July 2000 order denying its motion for a supplemental writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">\n<em>Appellate Proceedings:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">In early May 2000, MHC moved this court for an order dismissing the City\u2019s appeal as moot. We initially deferred determination of MHC\u2019s motion pending the trial court\u2019s resolution of MHC\u2019s request for issuance of a supplemental writ, which was then still pending. In August 2000, after receiving a copy of the trial court\u2019s order denying MHC\u2019s request, we denied MHC\u2019s motion to dismiss the City\u2019s appeal, but without prejudice to its mootness claim being raised in the briefs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-11\">In November 2000, pursuant to stipulation, we consolidated the City\u2019s appeal with MHC\u2019s appeal in this proceeding. We designated the City as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>appellant and MHC as the respondent and cross-appellant. At the same time, we established a schedule for submitting briefs and appendices. The following month, on the motion of intervener Sucholas, we amended the consolidation order to permit Sucholas to respond in MHC\u2019s appeal. We subsequently denied the parties\u2019 requests for a stay of further administrative proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Both appeals have been fully briefed and argued. We consider each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">I. <em>The City\u2019s Appeal (H020648)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">The City\u2019s appeal challenges the August 1999 judgment in which the trial court initially granted MHC\u2019s petition for a writ of administrative mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">A. <em>Contentions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">1. <em>The City\u2019s Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">The City contends that the trial court erred in two respects when it issued the writ in 1999. First, the City asserts, the court should not have granted the writ petition because MHC failed to join the Park\u2019s residents, who were real parties in interest and indispensable parties to the judicial proceeding. Second, the City urges, the trial court erred in ordering the hearing officer to reconsider her decision, since there was no evidence that MHC was receiving less than a fair return.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-12\">2. <em>MHC\u2019s Response</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-13\">MHC initially responded to the City\u2019s appeal with a motion to dismiss on the ground of mootness. MHC renewed its mootness claim in its response brief. According to MHC, the City\u2019s actions following the August 1999 judgment operate as a waiver of its right to appeal and render its appeal moot. Specifically, MHC cites (1) the City\u2019s compliance with the trial court\u2019s mandate that its hearing officer reconsider MHC\u2019s rent increase application, and (2) the City\u2019s action in immediately amending the Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-14\">We consider MHC\u2019s mootness claim now\u2014at the threshold\u2014since our determination of that question disposes of the City\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>B. <em>Mootness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">A case is moot when the decision of the reviewing court \u201ccan have no practical impact or provide the parties effectual relief. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Woodward Park Homeowners Assn. v. Garreks, Inc. </em>(2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 880, 888 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 268].) \u201cWhen no effective relief can be granted, an appeal is moot and will be dismissed.\u201d <em>(In re Jessica K. </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1313, 1315-1316 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 798], citing <em>Eye Dog Foundation </em>v. <em>State Board of Guide Dogs for the Blind </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 536, 541 [63 Cal.Rptr. 21, 432 P.2d 717].)</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">In this case, we cannot grant the City any effective relief from the 1999 judgment, for it has already complied with the writ. The City acknowledges that it \u201cdid indicate in its writ return that, pending its appeal, it was making a \u2018good faith effort\u2019 to comply with the writ by amending its Rent Ordinance and offering MHC a new hearing.\u201d (Fn. omitted.) But the City argues that \u201cit did so on the most narrow of grounds,\u201d by amending the Ordinance \u201cto allow the use of \u2018estimations\u2019 in certain situations where records were unavailable.\u201d The City further argues that it did not thereby moot the \u201ckey issues\u201d raised in its appeal. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">In our view, the City\u2019s postjudgment actions render its appeal moot. First, and most significantly, the City complied with the writ by allowing further hearings on MHC\u2019s application for a rent increase. The City\u2019s characterization of its actions as a mere \u201cgood faith effort\u201d to comply is not persuasive. The writ commanded the City to reconsider MHC\u2019s rent increase application. Because the City complied with that command, it \u201cwaived its right to appeal. . . .\u201d <em>(City of Carmel-By-The-Sea </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 964, 970 [187 Cal.Rptr. 379], citations omitted; see also <em>Morehart v. County of Santa Barbara </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 725, 746 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 804, 872 P.2d 143] [compliance with the trial court\u2019s writ rendered the parties\u2019 dispute moot].) In addition to complying with the writ, the City amended the Ordinance. (See, e.g., <em>Equi v. San Francisco. </em>(1936) 13 Cal.App.2d 140, 141-142 [56 P.2d 590] [repeal of challenged provisions of ordinance rendered the appeal moot].) The fact that it did so \u201cnarrowly,\u201d in order to address the trial court\u2019s finding of unconstitutionality, does not alter the result. The City\u2019s appeal is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">Alternatively, the City urges us to consider its appeal on the merits\u2014even if moot\u2014because it presents issues of continuing public interest.  \u201c[I]f a pending case poses an issue of broad public interest that is likely to recur, the court may exercise an inherent discretion to resolve that issue even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>though an event occurring during its pendency would normally render the matter moot.\u201d <em>(In re William M. </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 16, 23 [89 Cal.Rptr. 33, 473 P.2d 737]; see also <em>Morehart </em>v. <em>County of Santa Barbara, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 746.)  The City argues that its appeal raises two issues of critical importance to future rent control disputes: (1) whether mobilehome park tenants are indispensable parties in rent control proceedings; and (2) what rights and responsibilities mobilehome park owners have when base year records are lost or destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Despite the City\u2019s urging, we decline to exercise our discretion to resolve the moot questions presented here. In our view, any such resolution would be unlikely to provide guidance for future rent control disputes, because the two issues presented in the City\u2019s appeal are essentially factual in nature and therefore require resolution on a case-by-case basis. (See <em>Giles v. Horn </em>(2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 206, 228 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 735] [\u201cBecause plaintiffs\u2019 claim is a particularly factual determination that must be resolved on a case-by-case basis, dependent upon the specific facts of a given situation, it is not one on which we would exercise our discretion to address on the merits, despite the fact that it is moot.\u201d].) The first question raised by the City\u2019s appeal\u2014whether a party is indispensable\u2014is \u201c \u2018fact-specific.\u2019 \u201d <em>(County of San Joaquin </em>v. <em>State Water Resources Control Bd. </em>(1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 1144, 1152 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 277], quoting <em>Travelers Indemn. Co. </em>v. <em>Dingwell </em>(1st Cir. 1989) 884 F.2d 629, 635.) Resolution of that question depends on \u201c \u2018practical considerations in the context of a particular litigation.\u2019 \u201d <em>(County of San Joaquin, </em>at p. 1152, quoting <em>Kickapoo Tribe of Indians in Kansas </em>v. <em>Babbitt </em>(D.C. Cir. 1995) 43 F.3d 1491, 1495.) As to the City\u2019s second appellate issue, which it frames as a question of recordkeeping responsibilities in connection with fair return calculations, its resolution requires resort to the evidentiary record, including the particular ordinance provisions at issue here. Thus, that second appellate issue is similarly case-specific, especially in light of the City\u2019s 1999 amendments to the Ordinance. (Cf., e.g., <em>San Marcos Mobilehome Park Owner\u2019 Assn. v. City of San Marcos </em>(1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1492, 1502-1503 [238 Cal.Rptr. 290] [whether rent falls within constitutionally permissible range of fair return depends on factors such as property\u2019s value or expenses].) In short, given the fact-driven nature of the questions presented, it is unlikely that our resolution <em>of </em>the City\u2019s appeal would \u201cprovide much needed guidance for \u2018the orderly administration of justice . . .\u2019 [citation] . . . .\u201d <em>(In re William M., supra, </em>3 Cal.3d at p. 25.)</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">We therefore dismiss the City\u2019s appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>II. <em>MHC\u2019s Appeal (H022038)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">MHC\u2019s appeal challenges the July 2000 order denying its motion for a supplemental writ of mandate. In support of its contention that the trial court erred in refusing to issue a supplemental writ, MHC proffers seven separate arguments on appeal, all of which essentially assert this single claim: MHC was denied a fair return because the hearing officer misinteipreted and misapplied the amended Ordinance in light of the evidence produced at the administrative hearing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Before addressing MHC\u2019s specific contentions, we construct the legal framework that necessarily guides our analysis. First, we review the basic precepts underlying judicial oversight of administrative decisions; next, we discuss the standards of review that govern this appeal; then, we examine the general principles that inform rent control decisions; finally, against this analytic framework, we assess MHC\u2019s specific claims of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">A. <em>Judicial Review of Administrative Decisions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">An aggrieved party may seek judicial review of an administrative rent control decision by filing a petition for a writ of mandate in the Superior Court. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5; <em>Carson Harbor Village, Ltd. </em>v. <em>City of Carson Mobilehome Park Rental Review Bd. </em>(1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 281, 287 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 569].) \u201cThe inquiry in such a case shall extend to the questions whether the respondent [agency] has proceeded without, or in excess of jurisdiction; whether there was a fair trial; and whether there was any prejudicial abuse of discretion. Abuse of discretion is established if the respondent has not proceeded in the manner required by law, the order or decision is not supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by the evidence.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>B. <em>Standards of Review on Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">The parties disagree on the proper standard of appellate review in this case. In its opening brief, MHC asserts: \u201cThe standard of review in this matter is not a simple \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 review. There are no factual determinations by the Hearing Officer that relate to the denial of the rent increase Application that are in dispute. Rather, the issues before this Court arise out of the legal conclusions that were drawn by the Hearing Officer and whether those conclusions are constitutionally proper.\u201d MHC thus urges us to independently review the asserted errors of law below. At oral argument, MHC argued for a \u201cspecial examination\u201d as to some of the issues on appeal, based on its contention its constitutional right to a fair return is implicated here. The City posits that the review standard depends on the nature of the claims presented. With respect to MHC\u2019s contention that the hearing officer misconstrued the Ordinance, the City argues that the administrative interpretation, unless unreasonable or unlawful, is entitled to \u201cgreat deference.\u201d With respect to MHC\u2019s claim that the hearing officer abused her discretion in denying a rent increase, the City urges us to apply the substantial evidence test. The intervener, Sucholas, likewise contends for substantial evidence review.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Given the parties\u2019 disagreement over the proper review standard, and the importance of that issue to our analysis, we set forth in some detail the standards that govern judicial review of administrative proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">We begin by explaining the standards that guide the courts\u2019 evidentiary review, both at the trial level and at the appellate level.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">In the trial court, the standard of review depends on the nature of the right affected by the administrative decision. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5, subd. (c).) \u201cIf the decision of an administrative agency will substantially affect a \u2018fundamental vested right,\u2019 then the trial court must not only examine the administrative record for errors of law, but must also exercise its independent judgment upon the evidence. [Citation.] When the administrative decision neither involves nor substantially affects such a right, then the trial court must review the whole administrative record to determine whether the findings are supported by substantial evidence and whether the agency committed any errors of law.\u201d <em>(Berlinghieri </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 392, 395 [188 Cal.Rptr. 891, 657 P.2d 383], citing <em>Bixby </em>v. <em>Pierno </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 130, 143, 144 [93 Cal.Rptr. 234, 481 P.2d 242]; see generally Cal. Administrative Mandamus (Cont.Ed.Bar 2d ed. 1989) Scope of Review under CCP \u00a7 1094.5, \u00a7\u00a7 4.128- 4.140, pp. 175-186 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>and 2002 supp., pp. 101-105.) Whether an administrative decision substantially affects a vested fundamental right is determined on a case-by-case basis. <em>(Bixby v. Pierno, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d at p. 144.) \u201cWhen determining what rights are fundamental for administrative review purposes, the court must determine if the right fundamentally affects the life situation of the individual to require independent review or whether it merely impacts an area of economic privilege in a less than fundamental manner.\u201d <em>(Concord Communities v. City of Concord </em>(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1407, 1413-1414 [111 Cal.Rptr.2d 511], citing <em>Berlinghieri v. Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at pp. 395-398.)  Against that measure, \u201ca landowner\u2019s property right to raise rents is not a \u2018fundamental\u2019 right for substantive due process purposes . . . .\u201d <em>(San Marcos Mobilehome Park Owners\u2019 Assn. </em>v. <em>City of San Marcos, supra, </em>192 Cal.App.3d at p. 1501, fn. 9.) \u201cA substantial evidence standard is proper when reviewing the decision of a rent control board because the owner\u2019s proposed rent increases do not involve an administrative decision which substantially affects fundamental rights.\u201d <em>(Concord Communities </em>v. <em>City of Concord, supra, </em>91 Cal.App. 4th at p. 1414, citing <em>San Marcos Mobilehome Park Owners \u2019 Assn. </em>v. <em>City of San Marcos, supra, </em>192 Cal.App.3d at p. 1500.)</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">In the appellate court, the appropriate standard of review is substantial evidence, regardless of the nature of the right involved.

(\u00a7 17.22.480.) The Ordinance incorporates adjustment mechanisms both for inflation and for increases in operating expenses. (\u00a7\u00a7 17.22.450, 17.22.470, 17.22.510.) The Ordinance expressly compels the hearing officer to \u201cset the rent increase in the amount required to provide the landlord with a fair and reasonable return.\u201d (\u00a7 17.22.580.) Further, pursuant to the Urgency Ordinance adopted in 1999: \u201cNo provision of Chapter 17.2[2] . . . shall be applied so as to prohibit the Administrative Hearing Officer from granting an increase that is demonstrated necessary to provide a mobilehome park owner with a fair return on investment.\u201d (Urgency Ord., \u00a7 1; see now \u00a7 17.22.030.) Finally, as amended by the 1999 Urgency Ordinance, the Ordinance allows estimates of base year NOI when actual base year information is unavailable. (Urgency Ord., \u00a7 2; see now \u00a7 17.22.495.)</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">On its face, then, the Ordinance allows owners a fair return. (See <em>Kavanau v. Santa Monica Rent Control Bd., supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at pp. 768-769.)</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">MHC does not contend otherwise; instead, it challenges the hearing officer\u2019s interpretation and application of the Ordinance. MHC offers two general lines of argument in support of that challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">MHC\u2019s first line of attack relates to the Ordinance provisions that define and relate to base year. MHC takes issue with the hearing officer\u2019s interpretation of those provisions; it also argues for its own interpretation. MHC thus urges in its brief on appeal that the hearing officer erred by concluding \u201cthat calendar year 1985 NOI must be utilized as the \u2018base year\u2019 NOI no matter what factual situation may exist.\u201d (Underscoring in original.) In MHC\u2019s view, although the Ordinance favors 1985 base year data as a \u201cpreferred methodology,\u201d it does not mandate the use of NOI from that year, either actual or estimated. MHC also reads the Ordinance to \u201cdefine [] base year NOI as 1985 plus each base year for the fifty-one (51) spaces at issue that were subject to a long term lease,\u201d (underscoring in original) and argues that the lack of a uniform base year renders the Ordinance unconstitutionally burdensome. (See, e.g., <em>Kavanau v. Santa Monica Rent Control Bd., supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 772; <em>Vega </em>v. <em>City of West Hollywood, supra, </em>223 Cal.App.3d at p. 1350.) Consistent with its view of the Ordinance, MHC proffered 1996 as a substitute base year. It characterizes that alternative as \u201ca viable and logical means, consistent with the economic foundation of the Ordinance, to measure MHC\u2019s fair rate of return . . . .\u201d MHC claims that the hearing officer \u201cwas legally and equitably empowered (if not required) to allow and implement a uniform \u2018base year\u2019 for MHC\u2019s mobilehome park\u201d and that she \u201cerred by rejecting 1996 as a base year.\u201d In support of its construction of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Ordinance as allowing an alternative base year, MHC argues that its proffered \u201cmethodology ... is the same as set in the Ordinance: comparison of a base year to a companion year. Only the base year is different.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">We reject all of MHC\u2019s arguments concerning the base year provisions of the Ordinance, starting with those that rely on its preferred interpretation. In the first place, substitution of an alternative base year does not employ the same methodology or accomplish the same result. The trial court explicitly recognized as much in its 1999 tentative decision. The hearing officer did so as well, observing: \u201cIt is true that [MHC] is entitled to maintain a fair return on its investment. However, it is equally true that the calculation of the fair return must be based on the comparison of fair net operating income established for 1985, with net operating income for the current year, [f] Neither the Superior Court nor the Ordinance allows for an alternative <em>methodology </em>for calculating the fair net operating income for the current year such as that proposed by [MHC].\u201d (Original italics.) That is particularly true in this case, since the alternate year MHC proposes\u20141996\u2014clearly postdates rent control.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In general, the maintenance of net operating income formula is based on pre-rent-control, fair-market assumptions. (See, e.g., <em>Kavanau </em>v. <em>Santa Monica Rent Control Bd., supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at pp. 768-769; <em>Palomar Mobilehome Park Assn. </em>v. <em>Mobile Home Rent Review Com., supra, </em>16 Cal.App.4th at p. 487.) Furthermore, even if MHC\u2019s proposal did offer a reasonably equivalent alternative, it is the City\u2019s prerogative to determine what rent control scheme it will adopt: it \u201cmay choose to regulate pursuant to any fairly constructed formula even though other proper formulas might allow for higher prices.\u201d <em>(Palomar Mobilehome Park Assn. v. Mobile Home Rent Review Com., supra, </em>16 Cal.App.4th at p. 487.) As to MHC\u2019s suggestion that the Ordinance is unduly burdensome to the extent it requires multiple base year estimates, we find no indication in the record that the hearing officer so construed the Ordinance. Finally, we uphold the hearing officer\u2019s decision to reject the \u201csuggestion that an alternative base year could be substituted for 1985.\u201d To the extent the decision rests on her interpretation of the Ordinance, it must be \u201cgiven considerable deference and must be upheld absent evidence the interpretation lacks a reasonable foundation. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Carson Harbor Village, Ltd. </em>v. <em>City of Carson Mobilehome Park Rental Review Bd., supra, </em>70 Cal.App.4th at p. 287.) MHC has failed to demonstrate that the hearing officer\u2019s interpretation is either unreasonable or unlawful. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>In a second line of attack, MHC asserts that the \u201chearing officer ignored the very mandate and guiding principle\u201d of the Ordinance to establish a fair and reasonable rate of return. As MHC sees it, the hearing officer refused to comply with the Ordinance\u2019s mandate despite the \u201cuncontroverted\u201d evidence (1) that it was \u201cimpossible to reconstruct net operating income for 1985 as a base year for this mobilehome park\u201d and (2) that \u201c1996 NOI reflected a reasonable measurement of return on investment . . . .\u201d (Underscoring omitted.) As a result, MHC claims, it has been denied a fair return.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">The vitality of that argument depends on the evidentiary record, because it is premised on MHC\u2019s assertion that its evidence was \u201cuncontroverted,\u201d \u201cuncontradicted,\u201d \u201cundisputed,\u201d and \u201cunrefuted.\u201d We therefore turn to an examination of the evidence in the administrative record, which we review under the deferential substantial evidence test.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">2. <em>The Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">To satisfy the substantial evidence test, the administrative record must disclose a \u201cproper evidentiary basis\u201d to support an agency\u2019s \u201cconclusions on a fair rate of return.\u201d <em>(Whispering Pines Mobile Home Park, Ltd. </em>v. <em>City of Scotts Valley </em>(1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 152, 161 [225 Cal.Rptr. 364]; see also <em>Carson Harbor Village, Ltd. </em>v. <em>City of Carson Mobilehome Park Rental Review Bd., supra, </em>70 Cal.App.4th at p. 287; <em>Yee v. Mobilehome Park Rental Review Bd. </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 1097, 1107 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 1].) \u201cApplication of the test inherently requires that the reviewing court first determine the question, \u2018Substantial evidence of what?\u2019 \u201d <em>(Yee v. Mobilehome Park Rental Review Bd., supra, </em>17 Cal.App.4th at p. 1106.) In this case, the \u201cwhat\u201d is MHC\u2019s ability to estimate 1985 net operating income.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">The question before us, therefore, is whether the administrative record supports the hearing officer\u2019s determination that 1985 NOI could be estimated.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">MHC asserts that there is no evidentiary support for that determination. MHC first points to the testimony of its expert, who testified that 1985 net operating income could not be estimated. MHC repeatedly characterizes that evidence as undisputed. We flatly reject that characterization. In fact, the expert testimonial evidence offered by MHC was squarely contradicted by expert testimonial evidence offered by the residents. The residents\u2019 expert, Dr. Baar, testified about specific income and expense data that could form the basis for a reasonable estimate of 1985 NOI and about methods for making such an estimate. Dr. Baar began by citing information sources available to establish 1985 income, including \u201cextensive information about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>base rents\u201d from prior rent \u201carbitration decisions.\u201d He also testified to two other potential sources of income data: information from longtime park residents (for rental income), and utility consumption records (for utility income). With respect to expenses, Dr. Baar testified that 1985 real estate tax data is available from the tax collector\u2019s office; he also opined that prior ground lease expenses could be extrapolated by using current data and adjusting for inflation. Given the available information concerning expenses, Dr. Baar concluded that about \u201ceighty percent of it you can estimate pretty precisely.\u201d Furthermore, he testified, \u201con top of this in this particular case we have an actual statement of allocation of income and expenses in the base year . . . .\u201d That statement of 1985 income and expenses was submitted by MHC as part of its original rent increase application, which was later amended. In sum, Dr. Baar opined, \u201creasonable estimates can be made by the hearing officer in this case about the 1985 base year information.\u201d The hearing officer credited Dr. Baar\u2019s testimony, noting that he \u201cintroduced evidence of many sources of information.\u201d Contrary to MHC\u2019s assertions, Dr. Baar did not merely testify that \u201chypothetically, 1985 base year NOI could be estimated.\u201d (Original italics.) Nor do we find it \u201cstriking\u201d or even noteworthy that Dr. Baar did not supply the estimates himself: it was up to MHC to do so in order to support its rent increase application.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">We conclude that Dr. Baar\u2019s testimony alone constitutes substantial evidence in support of the hearing officer\u2019s determination that 1985 NOI in fact could be estimated. But further evidentiary support for that determination exists: As the hearing officer observed, MHC supported its original application with a schedule based on 1985 operating income. Given that schedule, it may be reasonably inferred that 1985 base year NOI could be established. We therefore reject MHC\u2019s assertion that the hearing officer\u2019s determination lacks evidentiary support..</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">In view of our determination that substantial evidence supports the hearing officer\u2019s decision, we necessarily reject MHC\u2019s argument that it was denied a fair return as a result of that decision. (Cf. <em>Vega v. City of West Hollywood, supra, </em>223 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1349-1350.) Any denial of fair return resulted from MHC\u2019s failure to submit the available evidence of estimated net operating income for 1985 needed to support its rent increase application. (\u00a7 17.22.510.)</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">3. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">To summarize: First, with respect to interpretation of the Ordinance, we conclude that MHC failed to carry its burden of showing that the hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>officer\u2019s construction of the Ordinance was either unreasonable or unlawful. We therefore uphold the hearing officer\u2019s interpretation of the Ordinance as requiring base year data for 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Next, with respect to the evidence, we reiterate that MHC bore the burden of presenting evidence from which either actual or estimated 1985 net operating income could be determined. MHC failed to submit any such evidence. MHC also failed to persuade the hearing officer that it was impossible to do so. Substantial evidence supports the hearing officer\u2019s conclusion that it was possible to submit such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">The hearing officer therefore acted properly in concluding that MHC failed to carry its burden of proving entitlement to a rent increase under the Ordinance as properly construed. For the same reason, the trial court acted properly in denying MHC\u2019s motion for a supplemental writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">The City\u2019s appeal (H020648) is dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">In MHC\u2019s appeal (H022038), we affirm the trial court\u2019s order denying MHC\u2019s motion for issuance of a supplemental writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">Rushing, P. J., and Bamattre-Manoukian, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-11\">A petition for a rehearing was denied March 13, 2003, and the petition of respondent MHC Operating Limited Partnership for review by the Supreme Court was denied May 21, 2003.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b160-10\">Further section references are to chapter 17.22 of title 17 of the San Jose Municipal Code unless otherwise stated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b161-12\">An earlier administrative hearing in this matter took place in August 1998. At that hearing, many of the mobilehome park residents settled their rent increase dispute with MHC. The September 1998 hearings thus affected only the nonsettling residents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b166-9\">MHC\u2019s seven arguments may be fairly summarized as follows: Its first four arguments assert that the hearing officer ignored various provisions of the Ordinance, including the urgency amendment. In its fourth and fifth arguments, MHC adds the claim that the hearing officer also.ignored the evidence in rejecting 1996 as a base year and instead insisting on 1985 data. MHC\u2019s sixth argument is that the trial court should have issued a supplemental writ, because the Ordinance as applied denies MHC a fair return. MHC\u2019s seventh and final argument urges 1996 as an appropriate base year under the Ordinance. At the core of each of MHC\u2019s seven arguments is the assertion that it was denied a fair return as a result of misinterpretation or misapplication of the Ordinance in light of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"AO5\">We do no violence to MHC\u2019s contentions by distilling them in this fashion. As MHC itself acknowledges, the basis of its appeal \u201cis relatively simple. MHC contends that the administrative hearing officer . . . , and the Superior Court, erred, as a matter of law, by interpreting the . . . Ordinance as exclusively requiring the use of calendar year 1985 Net Operating Income to determine whether a just and reasonable return is being provided under the . . . Ordinance no matter what factual circumstances may exist.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b173-6\">MHC argues that the Ordinance\u2019s selected base year\u20141985\u2014likewise postdates rent control in San Jose, which began in 1979.
