Code, \u00a7 187, subd. (a) ; count l)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and first degree robbery (\u00a7211; count 3) and true findings on the allegations that the murder occurred during the commission of a robbery (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)); that during the offenses Bracamonte used a weapon (blunt instrument) (\u00a7 12022, subd. (b)(1)); and that as to Medina, he personally and intentionally discharged a firearm which inflicted great bodily injury (GBI) or death (former \u00a7\u00a7 12022.5, subd. (a)(1), 12022.53, subds. (b) -(d)). Bracamonte was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole (LWOP), plus one year for the weapon use enhancement, on count 1 and to a concurrent term of five years, i.e., the four-year middle term on his conviction plus one year for the weapon use enhancement, on count 3. Medina was sentenced on count 1 to LWOP, plus 25 years to life on a firearm discharge and use enhancement. The court imposed a concurrent term of four years for his robbery conviction in count 3. The court also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>imposed and stayed certain firearm discharge and use enhancements as to counts 1 and 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">\n<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Appellants attack their respective sentences on the ground the multiple punishment bar of section 654 compels their sentence on count 3 to be stayed. Medina further contends two of his three stayed firearm discharge and use enhancements on count 3 must be stricken as well all three of those enhancements as to count 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Based on our review of the record and applicable law, we conclude the trial court erred in failing to stay the four-year term for appellants\u2019 convictions on count 3 and in its disposition of the firearm discharge and use findings on counts 1 and 3 as to Medina. In all other respects, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Factual Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the People and presume the existence of every fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the evidence that supports the judgment. <em>(People v. Ochoa </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 1199, 1206 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 23, 864 P.2d 103].) The following summary is based on this appellate standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">On January 21, 2000, around 4:00 or 5:00 p.m., Joey Kovall was inside his home on West Bonita in Glendora when he told Audra Mahlke, his girlfriend, that after he removed his shirt during a fight with Steve Sierra, Sierra said he would be back and left. Kovall cautioned Mahlke they need to be careful that night. Kovall and Mahlke sold marijuana and methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">Around 7:30 p.m., someone knocked on Kovall\u2019s front door. At home with Kovall was Mahlke, Allen Baldwin, Jason Reader, and someone called \u201cClown.\u201d When Kovall asked who was there, a voice responded, \u201cMike.\u201d After Kovall opened the door and identified himself in response to Medina\u2019s request for \u201cJoey[,]\u201d Medina pulled out a gun, pointed it at Kovall, and said, \u201cBreak yourself.\u201d \u201cBreak yourself\u2019 to Reader meant Kovall was expected to hand over everything he had. Mahlke believed it meant \u201c[g]ive him what you have or run[.]\u201d Medina then fired the gun. Afterwards, appellants and another man rushed inside. Medina and Kovall fought in the living room as Malke, Reader, Baldwin, and Clown fled to other parts of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">From her hiding place, Mahlke saw Kovall hitting Medina with both hands and Bracamonte hit Kovall with a black, shiny object. When Mahlke <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>ran out the back door, she heard someone say \u201cshoot him\u201d twice and afterwards heard at least three gunshots. Looking back, she saw appellants leap over the couch, remove something from the living room floor, jump back and exit the front door. Mahlke\u2019s purse and Kovall\u2019s bat were later discovered missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Around that time, Michelle Giampaolo and her boyfriend drove up to Kovall\u2019s residence to buy drugs. Upon seeing Bracamonte and Andrew Hernandez standing at Kovall\u2019s front door, Giampaolo went around to the back door. She heard the front door open, someone outside yell, \u201cBreak yourself\u2019 and then five gunshots. Afterwards, she saw Bracamonte and Hernandez run out the front door to Sierra\u2019s waiting truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Around 7:30 p.m. while passing by in his car, Brian Majerus observed two or more individuals run out of the house and enter a white truck through the passenger door. One was holding a purse and a bat. Someone was seated in the driver\u2019s seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Mahlke identified Medina and Bracamonte from photographic lineups. She recognized Bracamonte as the att\u00e1cker who wielded the black object.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Around 11:15 p.m., after the police stopped Sierra in his white truck, a bloodstain matching Kovall\u2019s blood type was found in the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">Kovall sustained two gunshot wounds. The wound through his chest, heart, and left lung was fatal. Kovall also sustained numerous fractures to his head and skull. Such fractures also contributed to his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">Medina presented evidence to support his alibi and mistaken identity defenses. Bracamonte also presented evidence in support of his mistaken identity defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b542-11\">1.-5.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-12\">6. <em>Section 654 Compels Staying of Count 3 Sentences</em></p>\n<p id=\"b542-13\">Appellants contend, and respondent concedes, their respective four-year terms imposed on count 3 must be stayed under the multiple punishment bar of section 654. We find their joint contention to be meritorious. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>(See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Meredith </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 682, 696 [175 Cal.Rptr. 612, 631 P.2d 46] [conviction of, but not punishment for, both felony murder and the related robbery proper]; <em>People v. Boyd </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 541, 575-576 [271 Cal.Rptr. 738] [robbery sentence stayed under \u00a7 654 where robbery was crime underlying first degree felony murder conviction].)</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Bracamonte further contends his one-year weapon use enhancement on that count also must be stayed. We agree. Where the base term of a sentence is stayed under section 654, the attendant enhancements must also be stayed. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Guilford </em>(1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 406, 411 [198 Cal.Rptr. 700].)</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">7. <em>Correction of Medina\u2019s Firearm Discharge and Use Enhancements Warranted</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">Medina contends two of his three stayed firearm discharge and use enhancements on count 3 must be stricken as well as all three of those enhancements as to count 1. We find the court committed various errors in sentencing Medina on the firearm discharge and use findings as to counts 1 and 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">In pertinent part, the information alleged that in the commission of the offenses pleaded in counts 1 and 3, Medina \u201cpersonally used\u201d a handgun (\u00a7\u00a7 12022.5, subd. (a)(1), 12022.53, subd. (b)) and he \u201cpersonally and intentionally discharged\u201d a handgun (\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (c)) \u201cwhich proximately caused . . . death\u201d to Kovall (\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (d)). The jury found thes\u00e9 allegations to be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">There is an apparent conflict between the clerk\u2019s transcript and the reporter\u2019s transcript regarding which enhancements were imposed and which were stayed. The clerk\u2019s transcript recites that on count 1, the court imposed an enhancement of \u201c25 years to li[f]e\u201d pursuant to section \u201c1203.06A(A)(1) [sic]\u201d and that the \u201cremaining\u201d enhancements pursuant to sections \u201c12022.5, 12022.53(B), 12022.53(D) and 12022.53 (C)\u201d were \u201cimposed but stayed pursuant to . . . section 654.\u201d With respect to count 3, the court did not expressly impose any enhancement of 25 years to life. Rather, the \u201c[sentence as to allegations [sic] pursuant to . . . sections 1203.06(A)(1), 12022.5(A)(1), 12022.53(B) and 12022.53(D) is imposed and stayed pursuant to . . . section 654.\u201d The court made no ruling regarding the finding under subdivision (c) of section 12022.53 on count 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">In contrast, the reporter\u2019s transcript reflects that as to count 1, the court imposed a \u201c25[-year-to-]life\u201d enhancement for \u201cpersonal use of a firearm\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>pursuant to section \u201c12022.53 (c) <em>[sic] </em>[.]\u201d In discussing Medina\u2019s sentence on count 3, the court ruled that having imposed such enhancement on count 1, \u201call [remaining] allegations <em>[sic] </em>relating to personal use of a firearm are stayed by virtue of 654 and/or subdivision [(f)] of 12022.53. The remaining special allegations [sic] as to count 1, specifically, 12022.5, 12022.53, subdivision [(b)], 12022.53(d), are imposed but stayed by virtue of 654 as to 12022.5 and by virtue of subdivision [(f)] of 12022.53(B) [sic].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">We need not determine which transcript reflects the correct record. Under either scenario, the court was incorrect in the sentence it imposed with regard to the personal discharge and use findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Initially, we deem the 25-year-to-life enhancement on count 1 to have been imposed pursuant to subdivision (d) of section 12022.53, rather than under section 1203.06, subdivision (c) of section 12022.53 or some other section.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">A plain reading of section 1203.06 reveals it does not pertain to the imposition of any enhancement for the discharge or use of a firearm. Subdivision (c) of section 12022.53 mandates a consecutive 20-year enhancement for a qualifying felony conviction during which the defendant \u201cintentionally and personally discharges a firearm,\u201d and thus, cannot serve as the authority for imposition of a 25-year-to-life enhancement. Similarly, neither section 12022.5, subdivision (a), which provides for an enhancement of 3, 4, or 10 years, nor subdivision (b) of section 12022.53, which provides for a 10-year enhancement for use of a firearm, can support the enhancement imposed. The only applicable enhancement is the consecutive 25-year-to-life term set forth in subdivision (d) of section 12022.53, which pertains to a defendant who during a qualifying felony \u201cintentionally and personally discharges a firearm and proximately causes . . . death[] to any person other than an accomplice . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">The remaining related issues are whether the trial court was required to impose and then stay such enhancement as to count 3 and whether the court erred in imposing and then staying the remaining firearm discharge and use enhancements on counts 1 and 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">Respondent urges California Rules of Court, rule 4.447 empowers the trial court to stay the remaining enhancements. We disagree. No case has expressly applied this rule to a situation involving an indeterminate life term and the Advisory Committee Comment refers to enhancements only in the context of the Determinate Sentencing Act (DSA). (See, e.g., \u00a7 1170.1; see also <em>People v. Felix </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 651, 659 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 54, 995 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>186] [DSA, e.g., \u00a7 1170.1, inapplicable where both determinate and indeterminate sentences involved].) Additionally, such rule can only implement, not contradict or vary, the controlling legal principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">There appears to be no one definitive case or statutory authority resolving these issues. Nonetheless, when viewed in context, the applicable case and statutory authorities lead us to conclude the appropriate resolution requires the trial court to: (1) impose all firearm discharge and use enhancements, except for the use enhancement under section 12022.5, on counts 1 and 3; (2) stay all imposed enhancements, including the 25-year-to-life enhancement (\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (d.) as to count 3; and (3) stay all imposed enhancements in count 1 except for the one for 25 years to life (\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (d))-</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Initially, we point out the word \u201cimpose\u201d encompasses both situations where an enhancement is imposed and then executed and imposed and then stayed. However, as a practical matter, the word \u201cimpose\u201d is often employed as shorthand to refer to the first situation, while the word \u201cstay\u201d often refers to the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">The better rule is the trial court must either impose an enhancement or strike the underlying finding, and set forth its reasoning for such striking in the minutes. It is without authority simply to stay the enhancement. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Haykel </em>(2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 146, 151 [116 Cal.Rptr.2d 667] [enhancement either imposed or stricken, not stayed]; <em>People v. Bradley </em>(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 386, 390-391 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 244] <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 756, 758 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 502]; <em>People v. Irvin </em>(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 180, 190 [281 Cal.Rptr. 195] [failure to impose or strike enhancement unauthorized sentence subject to correction on appeal]; contra, <em>People </em>v. <em>Vergara </em>(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 1564, 1568-1569 [282 Cal.Rptr. 90] [permanent staying of enhancement equivalent of striking enhancement].)</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">Nonetheless, \u201can enhancement must necessarily be stayed where the sentence on the count to which it is added is required to be stayed [under section 654].\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Guilford, supra, </em>151 Cal.App.3d 406, 411.) \u201c[F]allure to stay an enhancement, where the base term to which it is added is stayed, and requiring that time be served only for the enhancement^] has the [improper] effect of elevating the enhancement to the status of an offense. Enhancements are not offenses, they are punishments. . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 412, citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">We first conclude the court erred in failing to find the 25-year-to-life enhancement under subdivision (d) of section 12022.53 applied to count 3. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>Although this enhancement was imposed as to count 1 (murder), it was again triggered by Medina\u2019s conviction in count 3 for robbery. (\u00a7 12022.53, subds. (a)(4) [enhancement applies to robbery conviction], (f) [\u201cOnly one additional term of imprisonment under this section shall be imposed per person <em>for each </em>crime\u201d (italics added)]; see also <em>People v. Perez </em>(2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 675, 681-682 [103 Cal.Rptr.2d 533] [plain reading \u201cmakes clear that the subdivision (f) limitation applies \u2018for each crime,\u2019 not each criminal.\u201d].)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">As discussed <em>ante, </em>the four-year term on Medina\u2019s robbery conviction in count 3 must be stayed under section 654. Accordingly, the trial court was required to stay the 25-year-to-life enhancement (\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (d) on that count. (Cf. \u00a7 12022.53, subd. (g) [\u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law ... the execution or imposition of sentence [shall not] be suspended for[] any person found to come within the provisions of this section\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">We next conclude where, as here, an enhancement under section 12022.53 applies, the trial court must strike the firearm use finding under section 12022.5.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cAn enhancement involving a firearm specified in Section . . . 12022.5 . . . shall not be imposed on a person in addition to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>enhancement imposed pursuant to . . . section [12022.53].\u201d (\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (f); cf. <em>People v. Herrera </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 987, 993-994 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 539] [\u00a7 12022.5 use enhancement must be imposed, not stayed, and underlying finding may not be stricken under \u00a7 1385].)</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">In pertinent part, section 12022.53 also provides: (1) <em>\u201cOnly one additional term </em>of <em>imprisonment under this section shall be imposed per person for each crime. </em>If more than one enhancement per person is found true under this section, the court shall impose upon that person the enhancement that provides the longest term of imprisonment.\u201d (\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (f), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">If viewed in isolation, the language of section 12022.53, subdivision (f) would dictate that the trial court in this case could only impose the 25-year-to-life enhancement (\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (d) [intentional and personal discharge of firearm proximately causing GBI or death]) and must strike the findings underlying the 10-year (\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (b) [personal firearm use]) and 20-year (\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (c) [intentional and personal discharge of firearm]) enhancements. Such construction of section 12022.53, however, would conflict with subdivision (h) of that section, which provides: \u201cNotwithstanding Section 1385 or any other provision of law, the court shall not strike an allegation under this section or a finding bringing a person within the provisions of this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">To harmonize these seemingly conflicting provisions, we conclude that section 12022.53 operates to require the trial court to add the applicable enhancement for each firearm discharge and use allegation under that section found true and then to stay the execution of all such enhancements except for the one which provides the longest imprisonment term. (See, e.g., <em>Lungren v. Deukmejian </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 727, 735 [248 Cal.Rptr. 115, 755 P.2d 299] [\u201cThe meaning of a statute may not be determined from a single word or sentence; the words must be construed in context, and provisions relating to the same subject matter must be harmonized to the extent possible. . . .\u201d (citation omitted)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>In summary, we conclude the trial court should have: (1) stricken the use findings under section 12022.5 for counts 1 and 3; (2) imposed the 25-year-to-life enhancement on count 1 pursuant to subdivision (d) of section 12022.53; (3) imposed that enhancement on count 3 and then stayed it because the base term was stayed (\u00a7 654); and (4) imposed and stayed the 10-year and 20-year firearm use and discharge enhancements (\u00a7 12022.53, subds. (b), (c)) on counts 1 and 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The sentence on count 3 as to Bracamonte. imposing the concurrent four-year term on his robbery conviction, plus the one-year weapon use enhancement is reversed. The sentence as to Medina imposing the concurrent four-year term on his robbery conviction on count 3 is also reversed. The order disposing of the findings on the personal discharge and use of a firearm (\u00a7\u00a7 12022.5, subd. (a), 12022.53, subds. (b), (c), &amp; (d)) is reversed. The matter is remanded with directions to the court to impose and stay the four-year term on count 3 as to Bracamonte and Medina; to impose and stay the one-year weapon use enhancement on count 3 as to Bracamonte; to strike the 12022.5 use findings on counts 1 and 3 to Medina; and to impose and stay the enhancement under section 12022.53, subdivision (d), on count 3 as to Medina; and to impose and stay the enhancements under section 12022.53, subdivisions (b) and (c) as to Medina on counts 1 and 3. In all other respects, the judgments are affirmed. The trial court is further directed to prepare amended abstracts of judgment consistent with the views expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Vogel (C. S.), P.

This amendment was a declaration of existing law as set forth in <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 206 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 174, 841 P.2d 159], in which the California Supreme Court held that a trial court has no discretion to strike a firearm enhancement imposed under section 12022.5. <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 208, 212-214.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Amf\">Respondent\u2019s position is incorrect. Section 12022.5 must be construed in conjunction with section 12022.53 where, as here, personal firearm use under section 12022.53 is also alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"Ay4\">The court strikes a section 12022.5 enhancement under subdivision (f) of section 12022.53, which provides that \u201cAn enhancement involving a firearm specified in Section . . . 12022.5 . . . <em>shall not be imposed </em>on a person in addition to an enhancement imposed pursuant to this section.\u201d (Italics added.) Such directive is mandatory. No discretion is involved. (See also <em>People v. Jenkins </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 494, 505 [170 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 620 P.2d 587]; <em>People v. Tanner </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 514, 521 [156 Cal.Rptr.2d 450, 596 P.2d 328].)</p>\n<p id=\"Agb\">Respondent\u2019s companion position is that the trial court properly imposed and stayed the section 12022.5 enhancements, because \u201cby staying the enhancement, it preserved . . . Medina\u2019s sentence in the event of a reversal on another enhancement or count\u201d and \u201csafeguarded the section 12022.5 findings properly made at trial.\u201d Respondent urges that by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>staying the section 12022.5 enhancements, the court \u201cdid not add \u2018additional\u2019 prison terms\u201d proscribed by section 12022.53, which, as rephrased by respondent, \u201cmandates that the greatest enhancement be imposed and prohibits imposition of \u2018additional term[s] of imprisonment\u2019 for the enhancement. (\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (f).)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ap0\">This position is untenable in the face of the plain and clear language that a section 12022.5 firearm use enhancement \u201cshall not be imposed ... in addition to an enhancement imposed pursuant to . . . section [12022.53].\u201d (\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (f).)</p>\n<p id=\"Anr\">Moreover, such position is also based on the faulty premise that staying of the section 12022.5 enhancement is necessary \u201cin the event of a reversal on another enhancement or count.\u201d No such need arises. In the situation where the reviewing court finds no enhancement under section 12022.53 could be imposed, then the section 12022.5 finding would be revived by operation of law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
