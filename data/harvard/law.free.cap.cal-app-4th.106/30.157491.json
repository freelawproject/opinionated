J.</author>\n<p id=\"AA\">An employee\u2019s supervisor asks her to lie about company business, asks her to secretly take a document from the desk of another supervisor, insults her and uses profanity in her presence. On one occasion he makes a negative comment about her race. Here we conclude these circumstances coupled with a single ethnic remark are sufficient to create a triable issue of fact whether the employer has created a hostile work environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-11\">Glenda Dee appeals a summary judgment granted in favor of defendant Vintage Petroleum, Inc. (Vintage) on her employment discrimination lawsuit. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand with instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Dee began work as a production clerk for Vintage, in November 1993. In October 1998, Andy Marsh became her supervisor and Paul Strickland became Marsh\u2019s supervisor. Strickland changed Dee\u2019s working conditions. He required her to discuss \u201cvery personal matters\u201d with him instead of bringing them to the attention of the personnel department as she had done in the past. He degraded and insulted her for following his orders and denied responsibility when others criticized these orders. He called Dee a \u201cbitch\u201d and \u201cconstantly\u201d used the word \u201casshole\u201d in her presence. He told Dee the chairman of the board was a friend who would support his decision to terminate employees. He warned her that \u201cif someone caused trouble for him . . . he\u2019d drag that person down.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">In March 1999, Strickland ordered Dee to secretly take a document from Marsh\u2019s desk and said, \u201cDo not get caught.\u201d She complied, but while in Marsh\u2019s office Marsh walked in. When Strickland discovered what happened, he \u201cscolded\u201d her and said, \u201cI told you not to get caught!\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">In April 1999, Strickland told Dee that she should \u201cmake up stories\u201d to hide information from Marsh. Dee stated, \u201cMy relationship with Andy is straightforward and honest, and I do not know how to lie to Andy.\u201d Strickland said, \u201cDid I tell you to lie?\u201d Dee replied, \u201cWell, you did not tell me to lie. You told me to make up stories. Isn\u2019t that the same as telling a lie?\u201d Strickland said, \u201cWell, what are you, a Filipino?\u201d Dee said, \u201cYes, a Filipino.\u201d Strickland said, \u201cWell, it is your Filipino understanding versus mine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">Dee left work on May 4, 1999, because of Strickland\u2019s conduct. Doctor Victor Contreras diagnosed Dee as suffering from a posttraumatic stress disorder. In her deposition Dee admitted that she was able to work, continue a flower business, transport her children to school, take care of a baby, drive a car, walk, dress, sing, smile and go to PTA meetings. She admitted that she had hypertension but it was controlled by medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">Dee went on disability leave, but offered to come back to work if Vintage would accommodate her disability by limiting her contacts with Strickland. Vintage refused and terminated Dee on August 20, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">Dee sued Vintage, alleging it violated the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12900 et seq.) by 1) harassing her on the basis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>\u201crace [and] national origin\u201d and refusing to accommodate her disability, 2) wrongfully terminating her, 3) breaching an implied contract which required good cause for termination, and 4) breaching the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Vintage moved for summary judgment. Dee filed a timely opposition but shortly thereafter discovered additional evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">\n<em>Dee\u2019s Supplemental Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Christopher Olmstead, Dee\u2019s counsel, filed a declaration stating he was unable to file Marsh\u2019s deposition with the opposition to summary judgment. He took Marsh\u2019s deposition and, to his surprise, Marsh made admissions that were \u201cessential\u201d to Dee\u2019s case. Olmstead \u201cexpedited\u201d the preparation of the transcript and attached it to a supplemental opposition he filed with the court on June 25. Marsh testified Dee was \u201cvisibly shaken\u201d by Strickland\u2019s demands. He said Dee performed well on the job. He said Vintage needed good cause to terminate employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">At the summary judgment hearing on June 28, Olmstead requested the court to either consider Marsh\u2019s deposition or \u201cprovide additional time for briefing on the issue.\u201d The court did not grant a continuance and did not consider Marsh\u2019s deposition. It granted summary judgment for Vintage. It stated, \u201cOne racial comment is insufficient as a matter of law to establish a hostile environment\u201d under FEHA. It found \u201c[t]he evidence is undisputed that plaintiff is not disabled under FEHA.\u201d It ruled there was no contract which required Vintage to have good cause before terminating Dee.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">I. <em>Dee\u2019s Additional Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">Dee contends the trial court erred by granting summary judgment without considering her recently discovered additional evidence. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">\u201c \u2018[A] summary judgment is a drastic measure which deprives the losing party of trial on the merits.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Bahl </em>v. <em>Bank of America </em>(2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 389, 395 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 270].) \u201cTo mitigate summary judgment\u2019s harshness, the statute\u2019s drafters included a provision making continuances\u2014which are normally a matter within the broad discretion of trial courts\u2014virtually mandated . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.; </em>Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (h).) Where the opposing party submits an adequate affidavit showing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>essential facts may exist but cannot be presented timely, the court must either deny summary judgment or grant a continuance. <em>(Frazee v. Seely </em>(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 627, 633 [115 Cal.Rptr.2d 780].)</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Olmstead\u2019s declaration explained why he was unable to file the deposition of Marsh within the deadline for opposing summary judgment. He stated that Marsh made admissions that were \u201cessential\u201d to Dee\u2019s case. Marsh\u2019s testimony was relevant, as it supported Dee on such issues as a hostile working environment and whether there was a good cause requirement to terminate Vintage employees. Olmstead acted promptly so that the deposition transcript was available to the court before the summary judgment hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">At the hearing, he requested the court to either consider Marsh\u2019s deposition or \u201cprovide additional time for briefing on the issue.\u201d But the court did neither. It should have granted a continuance so it could consider the additional evidence. <em>(Frazee </em>v. <em>Seely, supra, </em>95 Cal.App.4th at p. 633.) Not doing so was reversible error. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">II. <em>Hostile Work Environment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">Dee contends the trial court erred because Strickland\u2019s ethnic slur combined with other evidence established a triable issue of fact on the issue of a hostile work environment. We agree.  We review an order granting summary judgment de novo to decide whether there is a triable issue of fact. <em>(Brantley v. Pisaro </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 1591, 1601 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 431].)</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">\u201c[California\u2019s] Fair Employment and Housing Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12900 et seq.) . . . explicitly prohibits an employer from harassing an employee on the basis of race, sex or [ethnicity.]\u201d <em>(Etter v. Veriflo Corp. </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 457, 464 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 33].) Harassment includes \u201c \u2018epithets, derogatory comments or slurs . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Ibid) </em>\u201cCalifornia courts have been guided in their interpretations of FEHA by the federal court decisions interpreting Title VII\u201d of the federal Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1)). <em>(Etter, </em>at p. 464.) To prove a claim under Title VII, the harassment must be \u201csufficiently severe or pervasive \u2018to alter the conditions of [the victim\u2019s] employment and create an abusive working environment.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson </em>(1986) 477 U.S. 57, 67 [106 S.Ct. 2399, 2405, 91 L.Ed.2d 49].)</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">Vintage contends that the trial court correctly ruled that \u201c[o]ne racial comment is insufficient as a matter of law to establish a hostile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>environment.\u201d But \u201cthere is neither a threshold \u2018magic number\u2019 of harassing incidents that gives rise ... to liability . . . nor a number of incidents below which a plaintiff fails as a matter of law to state a claim.\u201d <em>(Rodgers </em>v. <em>Western-Southern Life Ins. Co. </em>(7th Cir. 1993) 12 F.3d 668, 674.)</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">In many cases, a single offensive act by a coemployee is not enough to establish employer liability for a hostile work environment. But where that act is committed by a supervisor, the result may be different. <em>(Brooks </em>v. <em>City of San Mateo </em>(9th Cir. 2000) 229 F.3d 917, 927, fn. 9.) In Brooks, Selvaggio, a male employee, made improper advances and touched the breast of a female employee. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that this single incident was insufficient to support a title VII claim. But it also stated, \u201cA different question would arise if Selvaggio were Brooks\u2019 supervisor, rather than her co-worker. Because the employer cloaks the supervisor with authority, we ordinarily attribute the supervisor\u2019s conduct directly to the employer.\u201d (Ib<em>id.) </em>\u201cThus, a sexual assault by a supervisor, even on a single occasion, may well be sufficiently severe so as to alter the conditions of employment and give rise to a hostile work environment claim.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">In other jurisdictions a single racial slur by a supervisor may also create a hostile work environment. <em>(Rodgers </em>v. <em>Western-Southern Life Ins., supra, </em>12 F.3d at p. 675.) The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals stated, \u201cPerhaps no single act can more quickly \u2018alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive working environment\u2019 . . . than the use of an [unambiguous] racial epithet ... by a supervisor in the presence of his subordinates.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">In <em>Taylor v. Metzger </em>(1998) 152 N.J. 490, 508 [706 A.2d 685, 694] the New Jersey Supreme Court reversed a summary judgment granted to an employer in an employment discrimination case. It concluded that where a supervisor makes a single racial slur, that exacerbates the severity of the remark and is sufficient to establish a triable issue of fact. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 504, 508.)</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Here Strickland\u2019s remark that \u201cit is your Filipino understanding versus mine\u201d is an ethnic slur, both abusive and hostile. Dee testified it was \u201cvery demeaning.\u201d Strickland\u2019s slur followed Dee\u2019s complaint that he told her to lie. A reasonable inference is that Strickland wished to intimidate her so that she would not complain to higher management about his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">A reasonable trier of fact could infer that the racial slur was not an isolated event because it explained Strickland\u2019s motivation for creating an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>abusive working environment for Dee. Dee\u2019s evidence showed that Strickland called her a \u201cbitch\u201d and \u201cconstantly\u201d used the word \u201casshole.\u201d He berated her, \u201charassed\u201d her, ordered her to lie and blamed her for tasks he ordered her to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Strickland warned Dee that the chairman of the board was a friend who would support his decisions. Dee left because of Strickland\u2019s conduct. His actions were stressful to her. We also note that Marsh\u2019s deposition testimony corroborates, to a significant extent, Dee\u2019s claims about an abusive working environment. He testified Strickland made unreasonable demands over \u201cpetty things\u201d and Dee, a good worker, was \u201cvisibly shaken\u201d by Strickland\u2019s conduct. It could infer that Strickland felt the company would not believe Dee because of her ethnicity.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Vintage contends Dee has no discriminatory discharge claim because it replaced her with a person of Hispanic origin. But Dee\u2019s claim involved discrimination based on her Filipino ancestry. Vintage did not replace Dee with someone from that ethnic group. There was a triable issue of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">III. <em>Disability Under FEHA</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">IV. <em>At-will Employment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">Dee contends that Vintage needed good cause to terminate her employment. Vintage responds that Dee\u2019s evidence did not overcome the presumption that her employment was at will. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 2922.)</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">Whether there is an implied contract not to terminate an employee except for good cause \u201cmust be determined from the \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019\u201d <em>(Guz </em>v. <em>Bechtel National, Inc. </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th 317, 337 [100 Cal.Rptr.2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089].) We have already ruled that the court should have considered the deposition of Marsh, Dee\u2019s supervisor, as additional evidence. In that deposition Dee\u2019s counsel asked him, \u201c[Vintage] can\u2019t just fire you for no reason. They have to have good cause to fire you; is that right?\u201d Marsh responded \u201cThat\u2019s my belief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-11\">The judgment is affirmed as to the trial court\u2019s ruling that Dee did not have a disability under the FEHA. The judgment is otherwise reversed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>remanded as to the court\u2019s ruling granting Vintage summary judgment. Costs to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Yegan, J., and Coffee, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">A petition for a rehearing was denied March 5, 2003, and on February 27, 2003, and March 5, 2003, the opinion was modified to read as printed above. Respondent\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied May 14, 2003.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b55-12\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 30.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
