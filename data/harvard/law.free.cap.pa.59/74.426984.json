The plea was <em>\u201cnon est factum.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-19\">The cause of action was the following note :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-20\">\u201c $1500.

J., the plaintiff having proved the handwriting of Zehring, rested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-9\">The defendants offered the will of Zehring, dated September 6th 1860, and proved October 23d 1861. The purpose of the offer was* not stated. The plaintiffs objected to the offer; it was admitted by the court, and a bill of exceptions sealed. By the will the testator gave all his estate to six children, excluding Elizabeth Rouch. In the concluding clause after naming the executors, who are his son and son-in-law, he says: \u201cIn the disposal of my estate as aforesaid I have considered that my daughter Elizabeth intermarried with Henry Rouch has received her share of patrimony in that, that I sold her husband a certain farm or plantation much below its real value.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-10\">The defendants then called Henry S eiders, who testified to facts tending to show the imbecility of the testator, about the time of the execution of the note; they then proposed to ask the witness if from what he saw and heard, detailed, the deceased was in his opinion fit and competent to transact business. This was objected to by the plaintiffs, admitted, and a bill of exceptions sealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-11\">The defendants called Plenry Chubb, who testified: \u201c Zehring called me to his house in the spring before he died; he said Mrs. Rouch had the note, but he never had put his name to it; it was worth nothing; was of no account; I said I did not want to hear.\u201d The plaintiffs objected, that it was not competent to show by his declarations he did not sign the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-12\">The court admitted the testimony, saying: \u201c It cannot be received for that purpose, nor permitted to have that effect. Is only received to show Zehring\u2019s want of memory and understanding about what had been done; received to show imbecility and not overreaching or want of indebtedness.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-13\">A bill of exceptions to this ruling was sealed for the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-14\">Witness further testified: \u201c He said I must know; he was down at Eliza Rouch\u2019s; he sent by one of the boys to come to his house; said he wanted to tell some things which might make trouble some day; said Eliza Rouch wrote a note; wanted him to sign it; he said he never could sign a note to that effect; sent for me again about a month after; said he wanted me to testify before court that he never did sign that note; that he did not find himself capable of doing business to that effect; he sent for me again; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>said he wanted me to say that he had never signed that note; if the last words he had to say, he had never signed that note; now if the note was signed Eliza must have done it herself; he never did it in his life.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-6\">After much other evidence for the purpose of showing the incapacity of the testator, Mrs. Eouch\u2019s influence over him, and want of consideration, the defendants closed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-7\">The plaintiffs, in rebuttal, after giving evidence in answer to the allegation of incapacity, &amp;c., gave evidence that the farm sold to Henry Eouch was sold at its full value, and called one of the testator\u2019s granddaughters, who said: <em>\u201c </em>Grandmother heard he had made a will,, and she wanted to know how it was made. I went for William Lichtenwater; he read the will; grandmother scolded grandpap; she said the will was not right; said he was persuaded; was over with Mary Ann, and she got him to make it so; she said, aunt Eliza worked over age for him, she thought she ought to have her share; he said she would get it yet; grandmother said she ought to have it; had worked over age; Mary Ann had got so much, and Eliza had not got anything.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-8\">The judge in his charge said: * * * \u201c [It is assumed that Mr. Zehring reposed great confidence in his daughter, Mrs. Eouch, and was in the habit of leaning upon her better judgment in his feeble state of mind; that she advised him in business transactions, prepared his writings, and paid away his money for him in the discharge of his debts. If confidence is reposed it must not be abused.] If the relation of confidential adviser is assumed it must not be used to the benefit of the adviser, and injury of the party confiding.\u201d * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-10\">\u201cWe have three distinct grounds of consideration suggested by the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel. 1st. As compensation for services rendered by the daughter after she attained her majority. * * * [2d. It is said to be a gift by the parent to the child, and doubtless the closeness of the relationship ordinarily furnishes sufficient consideration for such gifts, but certainly this one has assumed an unusual form \u2014 that of a judgment-bond with power to enter it up, and issue an execution, and covering perhaps one-third of the donor\u2019s property, as a gift this would be subject to grave suspicion, when we consider that it was drawn secretly, no one present, the father old and feeble, the daughter active and intelligent, the instrument drawn by herself, and the donation wholly in her own favor.] Still if you believe that the father was of sound business capacity and not in anywise overreached, it would be good as a gift; but if his intellect was weak to almost second childishness, such an act requires explanation. 3d. The main reliance is that the bond was given with perfect understanding by the father to correct an injustice and inequality in his will. If the decedent at the time of giving this bond had a sound dispos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>ing mind and understanding, was convinced of having done injustice to this daughter <em>by </em>his will, and resorted to the bond as a means of correcting that injustice, it may be sustained, although the instrument was drawn by Mrs. Eouch in her own favor, and not attested with the usual formalities attendant on the execution of wills. [There is however in this action itself some evidence not only of vacillation, buffof great mental weakness \u2014 first that he would be persuaded by one daughter so to frame his will as to cut out another, and then on the mere suggestion of his wife should probably more than reinstate her. The will solemnly declares that Eliza had secured her share in the price of the land, and although this may not have been the case, we must believe that the deceased so considered when he dictated the instrument.] Did he change his opinion, and did he understand that he had subsequently made a great alteration in the arrangement of his business ? * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-6\">\u201c This question is almost entirely for the jury. Was this bond obtained from a parent of feeble intellect by any management or overreaching on the part of a daughter of business capacity, in whom he reposed confidence, and was that confidence abused ? If such was the case and the bond given without consideration, or one greatly inadequate, it is not obligatory, should not be enforced, and your verdict should be in favor of the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-7\">\u201c If the executors have failed to show the weakness and imbecility of the testator, that he was not of reasonable capacity to transact business when the obligation was given, or if you are satisfied that it was for a good or valuable consideration and fairly given and taken, you will find for the plaintiffs, with interest from the time the bond fell due.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-8\">The verdict was for the defendants. The plaintiffs took a writ of error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-9\">The 1st, 2d and 3d assignments of error were the admission of evidence objected to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-10\">The 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th, the parts of the charge included in brackets.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b77-11\"><em>F.

The only plea was <em>non est factum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The 1st assignment of error is to the admission in evidence of the will of Jacob Zehring. It was not stated for what purpose the will was offered by the defendants. It showed that they were the executors, which, however, they had already admitted of record by their plea: Hantz <em>v. </em>Sealy, 6 Binn. 410. To say the least, the will at the time it was offered was wholly irrelevant to the issue. If the object was to put in evidence declarations contained in it bearing on the question of the single bill in suit, such evidence was clearly incompetent. If the purpose was to rebut the presumption of a gift by showing that the plaintiff had been fully provided for, the will contained no such provision. It averred a fact as a reason for not making provision for her. Whether this were or were not so may have been material, but it could not be proved by the mere declarations of the obligor. If the evidence was improper when offered, the error is not cured by the plaintiff\u2019s having given testimony to rebut it or avoid its effect. A party ought not to be prejudiced by an attempt to parry what has been illegally admitted against him. We are of opinion that there was error in the admission of the will of Jacob Zehring.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">The 2d assignment of error is to a part of-the testimony of Henry Seiders. It was proposed to ask him, if from what he saw and <em>heard detailed </em>the deceased was in his opinion competent to transact business. Heard detailed \u2014 by whom ? If the witness had been an expert he could not state an opinion founded upon what he had heard out of court. In the case of a witness not an expert, he must give facts and circumstances within his own knowledge as the grounds of his opinion: Rambler <em>v. </em>Tryon, 7 S. &amp; R. 90; Bricker <em>v. </em>Lightner\u2019s Executors, 4 Wright 205; Aiman <em>v. </em>Stout, 6 Wright 114; Dunham\u2019s Appeal, 27 Conn. 198. As to experts, their opinions must either be predicated of the facts proved or admitted: Champ <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 2 Metc. (Ky.) 17; or of such as appear in evidence, hypothetically stated: Spear <em>v. </em>Richardson, 37 New Hamp. 23; State <em>v. </em>Windsor, 5 Harring. 512. One not an expert cannot so testify: Dunham\u2019s Appeal, 27 Conn. 192; 1 Greenl. on Ev. 440, n. We think there was error, therefore, in this admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">The 3d error assigned relates to the evidence of Henry Chubb. He was offered to testify to declarations by Jacob Zehring the spring before he died, shortly after the execution of the note in suit, that he had not signed it. This was not a fact in dispute. The testimony was admitted not to disprove the execution of the instrument, but to show want of memory and understanding about what had been done. In this point of view we cannot say that it was inadmissible. Upon such a question a wide scope must of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>necessity be allowed, that tbe jury may possess tbe materials from wbicb to form an intelligent judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Tbe remaining assignments of error are to expressions of opinion by tbe judge below in bis charge on the weight of the evidence. He had a right to express his views, provided he did not intrude on the province of the jury. There is language which the plaintiffs in error consider as declaring certain facts to have been proved, but it is susceptible of another construction. At-the close of the charge the question of fact upon the whole evidence is submitted to the jury. Any complaint on this score had, however, better be avoided on another trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
