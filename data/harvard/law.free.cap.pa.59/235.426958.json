The auditor, amongst other things, reported that Green had satisfied the mortgage against Boyle and Low, and therefore they could not be pursued by the ward, if she had been otherwise bound to do so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-6\">The guardian, June 3d 1864, filed exceptions, that the auditor erred:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-7\">\u201c 1. In charging him with the balances in the hands of Keener and Boyle and Low.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-8\">\u201c2.

The report was confirmed July 13th 1865.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-12\">On the 7th of March 1867, the guardian presented a bill for review of the decree of the court confirming the report of the auditor. The bill set out, amongst other things, that the balance due from Keener can be collected from him and cannot be proved to have been lost by the accountant\u2019s negligence; that in a settlement for the Boyle and Low mortgage, originally $911.25, there was found due from the mortgagors the sum of $91.25, which was paid to Green and a receipt for that amount given by him as the balance due on the mortgage, and that,the sum of $120 was all he had received besides on account of the mortgage; that \u201c within the two months last past, he had been informed by a man that he, said man, saw, about the 1st of October last, two notes in said Keener\u2019s possession, payable to said Keener, calling for $404 each, and in both of said notes it was stated that they were for money belonging to said Ann Jane Dickey. Before the confirmation of said auditor\u2019s report appellant endeavored to find Cantwell, Boyle and Eorquer, to prove by them the payments mentioned in said calculation which were made to said Keener; Boyle was absent from the county, and appellant could not ascertain where he was; Eorquer was in the army; and he could not find where Mr. Cantwell was in time to give the requisite notice to take his deposition before the special court held in July 1865, when said auditor\u2019s report was confirmed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>In the hill of review he specifically assigned the following errors to the auditor\u2019s report:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-6\">1. The erroneous basis on which the auditor\u2019s calculations were made in restating said account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-7\">2. Even if the petitioner were legally chargeable with the money of his ward that did not come into his hands, he is charged with too much in said restated account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-8\">3. The auditor in his final report, stated that petitioner paid, 18th June 1864, only $255, whereas he then paid $285.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-9\">4. The auditor, in restating said account, charged petitioner with a balance of $908.50, whereof $623.64 never came into his hands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-10\">5. The auditor, in restating said account, wrongfully charged petitioner with the money of said ward that did not come into his hands unless it were proven, as it was not, that it was lost by his negligence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-11\">The ward filed an answer setting out the proceedings as above stated. The Orphans\u2019 Court, April 9th 1869, dismissed the bill. On appeal to the Supreme Court he assigned for error:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-12\">1. The dismissing his bill inasmuch as it sets forth errors of law apparent on the face of the record,.viz., the appellant\u2019s being unlawfully charged, in the account restated by the auditor, with a large sum of money that he never received; and with interest while his account was pending in the Orphans\u2019 Court on exceptions filed thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-13\">2. Not granting a review to the appellant to enable him to show by testimony which he could not use before the confirmation of the auditor\u2019s report, and especially by the new proof which, he states in his petition, came to light since its confirmation, that the money sought to be recovered from him is in Keener\u2019s hands, if it be material and necessary more satisfactorily to establish that fact than it is already established.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b237-14\"><em>R.

Golden, </em>for appelleq.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARq\">Review will not be granted without error in law apparent in the decree, or new matter arising since the decree: Riddle\u2019s Estate, 7 Harris 433; Hartman\u2019s Appeal, <em>supra; </em>Yeager\u2019s Appeal, 11 Id. 173.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The opinion of the court was delivered, November 2d 1868, by</p>\n<author id=\"AF-\">Sharswood, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJJ\">This is an appeal from the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Armstrong county, dismissing the appellant\u2019s petition for review of his guardianship account, as restated by the auditor appointed by the said court to audit his final account as guardian of Ann Jane Dickey, since intermarried with William Summerville. It is now well settled that petitions of review in the Orphans\u2019 Court, as provided by the Act of Assembly of October 13th 1840, \u00a7 1, which directs the court to \u201c give such relief as equity and justice may require,\u201d are to be governed by the principles and rules which prevail in the Court of Chancery as to bills of review, and which have been followed in that court ever since the time of Lord Chancellor Bacon.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">A review can only be had as a matter of right in two cases: The first is for error of law appearing in the body of the decree, and the second for new matter which has arisen after the decree. It may also be allowed <em>ex gratia </em>for new evidence as to facts on which the decree was grounded which have been subsequently discovered, and which could not have been procured by the use of due diligence before: Riddle\u2019s Estate, 7 Harris 431; Bishop\u2019s Appeal, 2 Casey 470; Stevenson\u2019s Appeal, 8 Id. 318; Russell\u2019s Appeal, 10 Id. 258; Hartman\u2019s Appeal, 12 Id. 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">All the five errors specifically assigned in the petition of review in this case were errors in fact in the decree. The allegation as to newly-discovered evidence, even admitting that the refusal of the court below to entertain the petition on that ground was re-examinable here, was not of the character required by the rules of law and equity on that subject. The appellant knew the facts and the witnesses, but he complains that they were then beyond his reach. He should have applied to the court for time to obtain their testimony. As to one of them, Boyle, his own allegation is that he was absent from the county, without showing any effort to obtain his testimony. As all three witnesses were to testify to the same fact, the evidence of any one of them would have been sufficient. The court below were right therefore in dismissing the petition of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">Appeal dismissed, and decree affirmed at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
