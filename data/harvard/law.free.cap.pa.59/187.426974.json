Brandon, was treasurer of Porest county for 1858 and 1859. The county auditors settled his account, finding a balance against him. On the 3d of April 1862 an Act of Assembly was passed authorizing a re-audit of his accounts. In pursuance of this act his accounts were again audited, and on the 30th of July a balance of $528.92 found to be due from him to the county. On the 22d of September Brandon appealed, and on the 5th of March 1864 an agreement was entered into between Brandon and the county, signed by two of the county commissioners, \u201cto make an amicable submission of all matters at variance\u201d to three referees named, \u201c their award to be final and conclusive, and no appeal is to be taken by either party. John Gr. Brandon is to take a credit of $597.95 balance due him at first settlement, and $707.54 commission on orders received, and what other credits the arbitrators may think him entitled to.\u201d On the same day the parties entered into another agreement signed by the same two commissioners, by which it was agreed that Brandon should \u201cbe charged with $1235.53, being the amount received from the collectors for both years, and take a credit for $599.69, for orders paid over at first settlement, over and above what paid the county tax on Darling and Pox\u2019s notes.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-10\">An account was annexed containing the following items: \u2014 \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-11\">\u201cDr. Or.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-12\">To Unseated Tax, . . $2,484.69 By Balance at Settlement, $597.95</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-13\">Bee\u2019d from Collector, . 1,235.53 Commissions, . . 707.54</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-14\">Orders, . . . 599.69\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-15\">with some other items of credit not important to state.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-16\">On the 29th of March 1864 the referees made and filed an award, finding for Brandon $1307.64. On the 24th of May, on motion of the attorney for the county, the court granted a rule to show cause why the \u201c rule of reference\u201d and all proceedings under it should not be stricken off. Depositions were taken, and on the 25th of February 1867 the \u201caward of arbitrators was set aside\u201d by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Brandon took a writ of error and assigned for error the setting aside the award.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b188-6\"><em>R. Brown, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKE\">It is not necessary that a submission should be made a rule of court when an action is pending: Act of June 16th 1836, \u00a7 6, Pamph. L. 717, Purd. 61, pl. 6; Bemus <em>v. </em>Quiggle, 7 Watts 362; McAdams <em>v. </em>Stilwell, 1 Harris 97; Ford <em>v. </em>Keen, Id. 179; Okison <em>v. </em>Flickinger, 1 W. &amp; S. 257. The award is in pursuance of the submission and therefore good: Buckman <em>v. </em>Davis, 4 Casey 211; Kenneigh <em>v. </em>Kramer, 14 Wright 533; Brendlinger <em>v. </em>Yeagley, 3 P. F. Smith 464; Herman <em>v. </em>Freeman, 8 S. &amp; R. 9.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b188-7\"><em>W. L. Corbitt, </em>for Forest county, defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Af3\">No issue had been formed as is required by the Act of April 14th 1838, \u00a7 10, Pamph. L. 400, Purd. 207, pl. 18. The treasurer\u2019s compensation is fixed by law: Act of April 15th 1834, \u00a7 41, Pamph. L. 544, Purd. 213, pl. 22. The award not having been approved had only the effect of a verdict: Stephens\u2019s Appeal, 2 Wright 13; Murray <em>v. </em>Henrie, 1. Jones 413. The setting aside of an award on matters of fact is not reviewable in the Supreme Court: Buckman <em>v. </em>Davis, <em>supra; </em>Gratz <em>v. </em>Phillips, 11 S. &amp; R. 144; Bellas <em>v. </em>Levy, 2 Rawle 23 ; Harker <em>v. </em>Elliott, 7 S. &amp; R. 285; Cochran <em>v. </em>Eldridge, 13 Wright 365.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b188-8\">The opinion of the court was delivered, October 29th 1868, by</p>\n<author id=\"b188-9\">Agnew, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AbI\">It is not necessary to decide whether the reference in this case was regularly made a rule of court, and after issue framed by the court; or what power the court may exercise over the award to correct a mere irregularity. It is very manifest to our minds that the court below set aside the award on the ground of fraud and collusion between two of the county commissioners and the plaintiff in the concoction of the submission, and the agreement controlling the finding to be made by the arbitrators. The effect of these agreements was to prevent an inquiry into the real matters of controversy, and to give to the plaintiff (a relative of one of these two commissioners) a compensation, as county treasurer, of a most extravagant and extraordinary amount, without the approbation of the county auditors, under the Act of 15th of April 1834, or a decision of the arbitrators upon any evidence of its reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">There can be no doubt of the power of the court to set aside a submission and award on the ground of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
