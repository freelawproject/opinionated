Conkle, and R. Lamberton &amp; Co., to try the title to certain goods levied on under a fi. fa. to March Term 1867 of the Common Pleas, at the suit of Lamberton &amp; Co. against Conkle.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-6\">Lamberton\u2019s execution was for $4725, was tested December 8th 1866, and placed in the sheriff\u2019s hands at 8J o\u2019clock P. M. of that day. On the same day, Conkle executed and acknowledged a deed of assignment for the benefit of his creditors, leaving a blank for the name of the assignee; the assignment was left with the. scrivener until the name of an assignee could be procured and inserted. This was all done before Lamberton\u2019s execution came into the sheriff\u2019s hands. On the 10th of December, the name of Reamer was inserted in the blank, and the deed then put on record. On the 11th of December, the sheriff levied on Oonkle\u2019s goods in question in the issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-7\">The court (Mellon, J.) charged that the assignment did not divest the property of Conkle. The jury found for the defendants. The plaintiff took out a writ of error. No assignment of error was filed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b463-8\"><em>R.

It is clear that Conkle\u2019s title to the property levied on by the sheriff was not divested by his deed of voluntary assignment to the plaintiff until after the lien of the defendant\u2019s execution had attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-12\">Though the deed was signed and acknowledged by Conkle before the hour at which the execution went into the sheriff\u2019s hands, a blank was left therein for the insertion of the name of the assignee as soon as one should be determined on or procured, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>and the plaintiff\u2019s name was not inserted as such assignee until the second day after the defendant\u2019s writ was received <em>by </em>the sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">At the time the writ went into the sheriff\u2019s hands there had been no delivery of the deed. It had been merely left in the hands of the scrivener until an assignee should be selected or procured.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">The title to the property remained in Conkle, and did not pass to the assignee until after the insertion of his name in the deed, and its delivery to him. The insertion of his name as assignee was essential to the completion and validity of the instrument; and, as was said in McKinney <em>v. </em>Rhoads, 5 Watts 844, delivery of the instrument was necessary to constitute it a deed and consequently to protect the property from execution. The court below, therefore, rightly instructed the jury that the voluntary assignment, executed in the manner it was, did not, before an assignee was named or inserted in the deed, divest the property of the defendant in the execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">Agwbw, J., was holding a Court of Oyer and Terminer in Westmoreland county, from the 9th to the 14th of November, inclusive.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
