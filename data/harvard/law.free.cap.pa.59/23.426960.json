Ho. 46.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-9\">This was an action of ejectment, brought July 24th 1866, by John B. McLahahan against The Cumberland Yalley Railroad Company. After bringing the suit the plaintiff specified his claim to be for 1501 square feet in Chambersburg, on which a corner of defendants\u2019 warehouse\u2019was built.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-10\">The premises were part of a piece of land which, on the 13th of December 1839, belonged to Margaret McKnight. On that day she conveyed to Thomas G. McCulloh and George Chambers. McCulloh died about September 1848. On the 1st of August 1850, his executors, S. D. Culbertson, James L. Black and John D. Grier, conveyed an undivided half of the piece to the plaintiff: on the 16th of January 1855, Judge Chambers conveyed the other undivided half to the plaintiff. The deed from Chambers contains this clause: \u201c The said Cumberland Yalley Railroad Company having erected a corner of their brick warehouse on the same, and in consideration, were to allow the use of the ground south of the warehouse for a road or way from Second street in said borough to the premises above described, to the proprietors of said described piece of land, their heirs and assigns.\u201d It further appeared by the cross-examination of one of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, that \u201cif the company is entitled to hold 2\u00a3 perches' from the centre of the road, there would be 430 square feet outside of the line.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-11\">The defendants read the deposition of Daniel Tyler. He testified : between 1848 and 1851, he, as engineer and agent of the defendants with full powers, &amp;c., reconstructed the defendants\u2019 road, depots, &amp;c. When the warehouse was located it was found a corner would project on to the land of Chambers and McCulloh, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>and before it was built the right to occupy the land was obtained from Chambers and the legal representative of McCulloh, by agreement between them and the company, the consideration being a right of way over other land of the company from the land of McCulloh and Chambers to the street: the parties to the agreement were Chambers and a person whose name he did not recollect, but whom he knew to be the legal representative of McCulloh's estate. lie supposed the agreement had been reduced to writing, but he could not speak positively: the warehouse was built on its present site in pursuance of the agreement. There was other evidence tending to show the existence of an agreement, search for it and that it could not be found. There was evidence for defendant of the building of the warehouse some time in 1850: of its having been burned by the rebels July 30th 1864, and rebuilt on the original foundations in the spring of 1865: also that the plaintiff lived in Chambersburg at that time,, and for several years before; that a lot belonging to plaintiff and adjoining the warehouse was leased for a coal and lumber yard; the lessees passed over the company\u2019s ground; there was no way for wagons to get to the yard except over the company\u2019s ground, which was the regular passage way to it. They also gave evidence that Culbertson, one of the executors, &amp;c., of McCulloh, was present when the ground for the warehouse was \u201c staked off.\u201d They called the plaintiff, who testified: \u201cI was not aware of this agreement between McCulloh\u2019s executors and the railroad company. I accepted the deed from Judge Chambers. I did not know at the time I bought from the executors of McCulloh that the company had any agreement with them. No warehouse built there when I purchased. I lived in Chambersburg since 1845. I know the warehouse was burnt, and I have seen that they rebuilt it. I gave them no notice that I claimed the land. When I bought from Chambers I put grain in and raised five successive crops. When I quit farming, the soldiers took possession and burnt the fences. Allison Eyster rented it and so did Melhorn. We passed over the vacant lot of the company to my land. I claimed a right of way, owing to the privileges the company had to build a part of warehouse under the deed of Mr. Chambers.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-6\">The plaintiff, in rebuttal, gave evidence by Black and Grier, two of McCulloh\u2019s executors, that they had made no agreement with the defendants for the erection of the warehouse: he further gave evidence that the warehouse was built after August 1st 1850.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-7\">The defendant asked the court to charge:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-8\">1. By the charter of The Cumberland Valley Bailroad Company, it had the right to take and occupy for its road and business five rods of land. And if, in the erection of the warehouse of the company, any portion of the plaintiff\u2019s land was occupied, for so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>much of the land as falls within- the five rods there can be no recovery in ejectment. The plaintiff\u2019s remedy is for the assessment of damages under the charter of the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-5\">2. The evidence of John B. McLanahan shows that he had knowledge, by the terms of the deed from Hon. Greorge Chambers, that the company claimed to have procured the right to project their warehouse over the land in dispute from the proprietors of the land, in consideration of having given to said proprietors a right of way over other land of the company, to the lot now owned by the plaintiff; and it further appearing, from the testimony of Mr. McLanahan, that he and his tenants claimed and used the right of way, from that time to the present, under the alleged arrangement ; and that the warehouse was destroyed by fire on 30th July 1864, and re-erected before this' suit, with his knowledge, and without any notice by him to the company, that it should not erect the warehouse on his land \u2014 all these facts constitute sufficient evidence of a ratification, by the plaintiff, of the arrangement made before he purchased, even if such arrangement was ineffectual on account of having been made by one of the executors of Thomas Gr. McCulloh.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-6\">3. If the plaintiff meant to repudiate the arrangement, and had knowledge that the company was re-erecting its warehouse partly on his land, before bringing the suit, and he gave no notice of his claim, and the company labored under the honest belief that he was satisfied with, and had sanctioned the previous arrangement made before the warehouse was originally built, he is estopped from recovering in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-7\">King, P. J., after referring to the facts, charged:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-8\">\u201c The legal title of the plaintiff is not disputed, but his right to a verdict is denied on several grounds set forth in the defendant\u2019s points which we will notice in their order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-9\">\u201c 1. It is undeniable that the company might occupy- so much of plaintiff\u2019s land as was necessary for the reconstruction of its railway, sidings, turnouts, depots and- stations by paying adequate compensation therefor; but in order to obtain this right, a strict compliance with the several Acts of Assembly, on the part of the company, was necessary, and must be shown by defendant. Having failed to show it, we refuse to affirm this point.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-10\"><em>\u201c </em>2. The plaintiff having accepted a deed from Mr. Chambers for the undivided half of the tract of land,, embracing within its limits the land in dispute, in which the right of the railro.ad company to erect its warehouse in consideration of a right of way over other land of the company is distinctly recognised, he cannot now be permitted to repudiate the arrangement between Mr. Chambers and the company, but he will be bound by it, at least, so far as it relates to the interest he acquired under that deed. It is not so clear, however, that his acceptance of that deed will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>preclude him from asserting his title to the whole of the interest he acquired, five years before, from the executors of T. Gr. Mc-Culloh. We do not see how the clause in the deed from Mr. Chambers proves that Mr. McCulloh was a party to the arrangement, and affects plaintiff with notice of it. There is no proof that any such arrangement existed in the lifetime of Mr. Mc-Culloh, or that his executors, as such, ever entered into any such arrangement with the company, even if they had the power to do so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-6\">\u201c 3. If there was any evidence that the plaintiff stood by while the defendant\u2019s agents were re-erecting the warehouse, and were thus encouraged to re-erect it, there might be some plausibility in this point. The plaintiff, being called to the stand by his opponent, testified that he knew the house was burnt, and that he had seen that it was rebuilt, but he does not say that he saw it while it was being re-erected. The fact that he was a resident of Chambersburg is not enough to affect him with the knowledge that the house was being rebuilt, and thus make it his duty to notify the defendant of his claim to the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-7\">\u201cHaving expressed these opinions, we instruct the jury to render 'a verdict for the plaintiff for the undivided half of 1501 square feet of land, the land in dispute.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-8\">The verdict was for the plaintiff for an undivided half of the land in dispute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-9\">The defendants took a writ of error, and assigned for error the answers of the court to their points, and instructing the jury to find for the plaintiff for one-half of the land in dispute.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b27-10\"><em>T.

It is a perfectly well-settled principle that when the legislature has provided a specific remedy for the recovery of damages for injuries sustained by the construction of a work of internal improvement by a corporation, a party injured cannot have recourse to a common-law action: McKinney <em>v. </em>The Monongahela Nav. Co., 2 Harris 65. The defendants below were incorporated by the Act of April 2d 1831, Pamph L. 373, entitled \u201cAn act to incorporate the Cumberland Yalley Railroad Company.\u201d It gives to the company no powers \u201c except such as may be necessary or incident to the making and using of the said railroad,\u201d and specially declares that \u201cthe said company shall at no time hold any land for any other purpose than the construction of the said railroad, or for depots, toll-houses or other necessary works.\u201d By the 12th section they have power to survey, lay down, ascertain, mark and fix such route as they shall deem expedient for said railroad, the said road not to be more than five rods wide. By the 14th section \u201c it shall and may be lawful for the company hereby incorporated to make, erect and establish a double railroad on the route laid out as aforesaid; and they are also hereby empowered to erect, make and establish all works, edifices and devices to such railroad as may by the said company be deemed expedient for the purpose of carrying into effect the objects of their incorporation; and also to contract or agree with the owner or owners for the purchase of any lands or tenements which may be necessary for the purpose of constructing and using the said railroad.\u201d And finally, by the 15th section, they have power \u201cto enter in and upon and occupy for the purpose of making said railroad\u201d any land upon which the same may be located, and if the owner refuses to permit such entry and occupation, and the parties cannot agree, they shall appoint appraisers, and if they cannot agree upon the appraisers, the Court of Common Pleas shall make the appointment. Erom this recital of the provisions of the charter on this subject it would seem sufficiently clear that while the company may have had power to purchase and hold land for the general purpose of \u201c erecting, making and establishing all works, edifices and devices to such railroad as may by the said company be deemed expedient for the purpose of carrying into effect the object of their incorporation,\u201d yet that their authority to enter upon and occupy land without the eonsent of the owner is confined to such as is required \u201c for the purpose of making such railroad.\u201d With this end in view they can enter and occupy to the extent of five rods in width, and no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>more; for that purpose and no other. Whatever buildings and erections were necessary to the railroad as such \u2014 without which it would not be a complete and perfect railroad \u2014 fit for use \u2014 are included by implication. Such would be depots for the reception and landing of passengers and freights, wood and water stations, toll-houses, watch-houses and others of similar character. But these words cannot be extended by any latitude of construction to comprehend a warehouse \u2014 a place for the storing and safe-keeping of goods \u2014 any more than it can be to the offices and residences of the officers and employees of the corporation. This court has often had occasion to consider the question of what is to be regarded as forming a necessary part of a railroad \u2014 generally in cases in which claims have been made by the companies to hold their property exempt from county or municipal taxation. The cases are collected in the opinion of Judge Pearson, in The Lackawanna Iron Co. <em>v. </em>Luzerne County, 6 Wright 428, and the result of them stated to be, that the line of road and ground occupied thereby, and the buildings immediately necessary for its enjoyment, not merely useful or convenient, are exempt; whilst all other property, though erected for the convenience of the company and to promote its trade and business, is subject to taxation. The opinion of the judge below in that case was adopted by the Supreme Court. The principle of it has been reaffirmed in subsequent eases not yet reported, and may now be considered as firmly established.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">If this be so, then the taking of the plaintiff\u2019s land for the erection of this warehouse was not within the power conferred on the company by the 15th section of their charter. They could only acquire title or a right to use it for that purpose by agreement with the owners. The refusal of the court below to affirm the 1st point presented by the defendants below was right. It is perhaps unnecessary to go further, as nothing more is contained in the specification of error than that refusal; but as the cause is to be remitted for another trial, it will be proper to notice and dispose of another ground of objection made to the remedy by action of ejectment adopted in this case. It is contended that as the defendants below without question had a license from Judge Chambers, who was one of the tenants in common of the lot of ground in question, which gave them a right to occupy and use the land, ejectment cannot be maintained by the plaintiff below, the other tenant in common, for his undivided moiety., It is urged also that the right of the defendants under the grant from Judge Chambers being to an easement, or more properly perhaps a license to occupy, ejectment is not the proper remedy \u2014 they are not the tenants of the land, and that if the plaintiff below recovers, the sheriff under the <em>habere facias </em>cannot put him in possession. But it is to be remembered that ejectment is not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>real, but a mere possessory action. The defendant is the occupier, not the tenant of the freehold. If, therefore, as for the purposes of the argument we must assume, the company had no grant or authority from the plaintiff below, their occupation, as far as he was concerned, if it amounted to an ouster, was a wrongful disseisin or dispossession of the land itself. The plaintiff below had in that aspect of the case nothing whatever to do with the nature of the right acquired by the company under Judge Chambers. Was then the exclusive occupation and use of the ground by the company by building the warehouse an actual ouster of the plaintiff? If it was, he can maintain ejectment. That it was, no doubt, we think, can remain after Law <em>v. </em>Patterson, 1 W. &amp; S. 184; McMahan <em>v. </em>McMahan, 1 Harris 376; Hill <em>v. </em>Hill, 7 Wright 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">We are of the opinion, however, that there was error in the answers of the court to the 2d and 3d points of the defendants below, and that consequently the court also erred in the direction to the jury to find for the plaintiff as complained of in the 4th assignment. The 2d point, indeed, might have been met by a flat refusal; for it assumed as actually proved the main facts of the case, and asked the court to charge that they constituted sufficient evidence of ratification by the plaintiff of the arrangement made before he purchased. The court, however, did not take this course, but answered the point, saying to the jury: \u201c It is not so clear that his (plaintiff\u2019s) acceptance of that deed (Chambers to him) will preclude him from asserting his title to the whole of the interest he acquired five years before from the executors of T. G. McCulloh. We do not see how the clause in the deed from Mr. Chambers proves that Mr. McCulloh was a party to the arrangement, and affects plaintiff with notice of it.\u201d The deed to which reference is here made from George Chambers to the plaintiff below contained a distinct and unequivocal recital that the defendants had erected a corner of their brick warehouse on the premises, and that the consideration of the permission to them so to do was that they should \u201c allow the ground south of the warehouse for a road or way from Second street in said borough to the premises above described to the proprietors of the said described piece of land, their heirs and assigns.\u201d It will be observed that the consideration is stated as moving not to himself (Chambers) alone, but to all the proprietors. If the plaintiff below, with full knowledge of such a grant having been made, whether by George Chambers alone, or in conjunction with the executors of McCulloh, availed himself of and enjoyed the right of way, which was the consideration of the grant, it was evidence which ought to have been submitted to the jury of a ratification by him of the license to the company. It was a license on the faith of which valuable improvements had been made by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>grantees, and therefore not within the Statute of Frauds and irrevocable ; and subsequent ratification by parol must be held to be equivalent to a precedent authority: Le Fevre <em>v. </em>Lefevre, 4 S. &amp; R. 241; Rerick <em>v. </em>Kern, 14 S. &amp; R. 267; McKellip <em>v. </em>McIlhenny, 4 Watts 317; Swartz <em>v. </em>Swartz, 4 Barr 353. Of the use and enjoyment of the right of way by the plaintiff there was abundant evidence: among the rest, the testimony of the plaintiff himself, who was examined as a witness. He said: \u201cWe passed over the vacant lot of the company to my land. I claimed a right of way, owing to the privilege the company had to build a part of warehouse under the deed of Mr. Chambers.\u201d The answer of the court denies any operation or effect whatever, to these facts, if substantiated to the satisfaction of the jury. We think that in this there was error. .' ;</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">We are of opinion, also, that the 3d point of the defendants below ought to have been affirmed: that \u201cif the plaintiff meant to repudiate the arrangement, and had knowledge that the company was re-erecting its warehouse partly on his land, before bringing the suit, and he gave no notice of his claim, and the company labored under the honest belief that he was satisfied with and had sanctioned the previous arrangement made before the warehouse was originally built, he is estopped from a recovery in this case.\u201d The learned judge did not question the law as proposed, but denied that there was evidence in the cause to which it could be applied. It is certainly true that it would not be enough to show that the plaintiff resided in the same town, to authorize the jury to draw the inference that he knew of the improvement. But there was something more than that here. Mr. McLanahan himself testified as follows: \u201c I lived in Ohambersburg since 1845. I knew the warehouse was burnt, and I have seen that they rebuilt it. I gave them no notice that I claimed the land.\u201d The learned judge, in commenting on this evidence, remarked to the jury \u201c that he does not say that he saw it while it was being re-erected.\u201d This criticism upon the oral testimony \u2014 applying the strictest grammatical interpretation to the words \u2014 was no reason for taking the case from the jury. It was for them to say what the witness meant when he said, \u201c I have seen that they rebuilt it.\u201d Whether he used the word \u201c rebuilt\u201d as the perfect or imperfect past \u2014 that they \u201c rebuilt or were rebuilding\u201d it \u2014 which in common speech are often confounded \u2014 especially as he had not given a more particular denial of so material a fact \u2014 was for the jury. That this conduct on the part of the plaintiff was an estoppel if believed, the eases are numerous, clear and consistent. There seem to have been here all the requisites as laid down in Woods <em>v. </em>Wilson, 1 Wright 379; and one of the latest cases in our reports, Arnold <em>v. </em>Cornman, 14 Wright 361, is very much in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">Judgment reversed, and <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
