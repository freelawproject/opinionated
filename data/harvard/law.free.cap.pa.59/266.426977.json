The 2d count charged that they <em>\u201c </em>did wilfully and maliciously disturb and interrupt a certain meeting of the school directors of St. Clair township, in said county; they, the said school directors, being then and there lawfully assembled for the purpose of discharging their duty as school directors for the said township of St. Clair, to the evil example of all others in like eases offending, contrary to the form of the Act of Assembly, in such case made and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-10\">The jury found the defendants guilty on the 2d count.

Where people rightfully assemble for worship, or assemble in their township meetings and the like, and probably in all cases where they come together in an orderly way for a lawful object; those who unlawfully interrupt them are indictable at the common law. It has been said that in England the statutes which were there passed were necessary to protect dissenters on account of an assembling of them not being lawful, while it is equally admitted that in this country where all forms of worship are favored they are not required.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">In Respublica <em>v. </em>Teischer, 1 Dall. 338, Chief Justice McKean says: \u201c But it seems to be agreed that whatever amounts to a <em>public wrong </em>may be made the subject of an indictment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">Here these school directors were lawfully assembled, and in discharge of duties of great importance to the public, and to disturb and interrupt them is an act injurious to the public and a public wrong, and of course indictable at common law, although not punished by any Act of Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">The objections to the form of the indictment, if there was anything in them, came too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">The court were therefore right in sentencing the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b267-12\">Thompson, C.
