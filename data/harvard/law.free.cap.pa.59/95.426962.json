The lumber for all was procured from the plaintiff and charged indiscriminately to Wertz. That portion claimed in this suit was furnished between May 5th and September 21st 1865.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-17\">Wertz was unable to pay, and this suit was brought to recover for the lumber which went into the defendant\u2019s house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-18\">The plaintiff called his son, D. F. Royer, who testified: Abraham Landis and the defendant, in August or September 1865, looked over the account in plaintiff\u2019s hooks with the witness; the brothers made out on a piece of paper the amount which they had got, and what Reuben had got; they showed what each had got; the defendant said, both brothers being then present, if Reuben would pay $800 they would pay the rest; the defendant\u2019s part was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>$342.53; they said they had paid Wertz all the money he was to get. They called about two weeks afterwards, said they had not got all the lumber, and offered to pay $573, a little less than the two accounts, which witness did not agree to take. Reuben paid the $300'. There was other evidence that the defendant recognised his liability to pay for the lumber.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-6\">The defendant offered to show by a witness that he was present on 3d of April 1867, and saw a settlement made between Wertz and defendant, that the books now offered were then present, and the accounts admitted by Wertz to be correct. The offer was rejected, and a bill of exceptions sealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-7\">The defendant gave evidence that Wertz had been in good credit till about November 1865; that the offer to pay $572 had been made by way of compromise and for the sake of peace, and that it had been declined; that each was to pay the half of $572 ; that the lumber was taken from the books for both houses without making any distinction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-8\">The defendant submitted the following points amongst others :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-9\">2. This case is within the statute of 26th of April 1855, relating to frauds and perjuries, and therefore the plaintiff cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-10\">3. There was no lien entered against the defendant\u2019s hpuse at the time this alleged promise was made, and therefore the claim was not the debt of the property; the alleged promise not being in writing is consequently within the statute of 26th of April 1855, and the plaintiff cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-11\">4. The plaintiff must establish, 1st. That the lumber was sold on the credit of the building; and 2d, an absolute unconditional promise to pay the <em>whole </em>amount claimed, and the evidence of such promise must be clear and explicit, so that there may be no room to suspect mistake or misapprehension. -</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-12\">5. The fact that this lumber was charged only to the contractor on the plaintiff\u2019s books, raises the presumption that it was sold solely on his credit, and if the jury believe that Wertz, the contractor, was reputed of good credit at the time this lumber was bought, and that Royer obtained an order from him on Landis for this lumber at one time, this presumption becomes very strong.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-13\">9. Even if the jury believe the promise was made, there is no sufficient consideration to support it; the promise is therefore void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-14\">The court (Pearson, P. J.) answered the points as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-15\">3. <em>\u201c </em>Although no lien was entered against the property of the defendants at the time of the promise, yet if the same was subject to a lien, there was sufficient consideration for the promise to .pay, as their own debt or one which might be brought against their property, and if it stood in that situation, the promise would be to pay their own debt and in ease of their own property, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>not the debt of Wertz. If such was tbe situation at the time of the promise, it may be binding, notwithstanding the statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-6\">4. <em>\u201c </em>This is correct, except as to the whole amount claimed\u2014 they can be bound for so much as is legally due, if the promise was as stated or supposed in this point.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-7\">5. <em>\u201c </em>If the lumber was sold on the credit of Wertz alone, without any intention to look to the property of defendants, plaintiff cannot .recover. The fact of the lumber being charged in the name of Wertz, is evidence that the credit was given to him; but it may be merely the method of keeping the account. The fact of an order having been given, and Wertz being in good credit at the time, is of weight, but may be counteracted by the defendant\u2019s subsequent promise to pay. That question is wholly one of fact to be decided by the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-8\">9. \u201c If the promise was made on the ground that the lumber had been furnished on the credit of defendant or his building, his subsequent promise to pay, if made, is on sufficient consideration.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-9\">The verdict was for the plaintiff for $320.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-10\">The defendant took a writ of error and assigned for error,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-11\">I.

It was submitted to the jury to say whether they were furnished at the defendant\u2019s request or on his credit, or that of his building, and whether he afterwards expressly assumed to pay the bill. We have only to consider the errors which have been assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">The first is that the court excluded the testimony of a witness who was offered to show that he was present and saw a settlement made between Wertz and the defendant, that certain books produced were then present, and the account admitted by Wertz to be correct. Admissions by Wertz, the contractor, were certainly not evidence as against the plaintiff. It may be that the bare fact of a settlement might have been proved by any competent witness present, just as the fact of payment might be. Rut that was not the offer. It was to show that certain books of the defendants were admitted by Wertz to be correct, and then to submit them to the jury. But even Wertz\u2019s receipt in writing would not be evidence except as against himself. This is too well settled a principle of the law of evidence to be now brought into controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">The 2d assignment of error is to the answer of the court to the defendant\u2019s 3d point. This may be advantageously considered together with the 5th error assigned, the answer to the 9th point, because in both the jury were instructed that if the lumber was originally furnished on the credit of the defendant\u2019s building, his subsequent promise to pay would be on sufficient consideration. The ruling we think is fully sustained by the decision of this court in Cunningham <em>v. </em>Garvin, 10 Barr 366. It was there held that a past consideration flowing from a benefit conferred would support an express promise: in other words that a benefit derived from the unsolicited services of another creates a moral obligation to compensate that other, and though not enough without a previous request to give rise to an implied, it is sufficient to sustain an express assumption. A considerable part of the value of the defendant\u2019s house was derived from materials furnished by plaintiff on the credit of it, and with the expectation of being paid for them. Unless there was some other equitable consideration, which is not presented to vary the case in the points put to the judge, surely there can be <em>no </em>question that it would have been immoral and unjust for the defendant to enjoy the plaintiff\u2019s property without paying him for it. It remains to inquire whether the defendant\u2019s promise was within the Act of April 26th 1855, Pamph. L. 308, \u201ca special promise to answer for the debt or default of another.\u201d If the defendant\u2019s contract was a direct and absolute engagement to pay on a consideration moving to himself: if at the time the promise was made the plaintiff\u2019s claim was a lien on the house: it was the debt of the defendant\u2019s own building, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>the payment of which could legally be enforced against it; though it may not have been personally his debt, his property was answerable for it, and his engagement to pay was in relief of his property. So the case was put to the jury in these answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">As to the 3d assignment of error it is enough to say that the defendant\u2019s 4th point was affirmed, with the necessary qualification that the promise need not be to pay the whole amount claimed. So also there was no error in the answer to the 5th point. In fact that was also affirmed, although not in terms: for it did not become the court to adopt the language of the party and instruct the jury as to the degree of strength of a presumption arising from the evidence. It is sufficient that the question was fairly submitted to the jury as one wholly of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
