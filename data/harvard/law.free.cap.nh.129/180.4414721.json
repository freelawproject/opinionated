Does HB 70 violate the equal protection clause of either the United States Constitution or the New Hampshire Constitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">2. Does HB 70 violate the due process clause of either the United States Constitution or the New Hampshire Constitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b195-13\">3.

Does HB 70 violate the freedom of association under either the United States Constitution or the New Hampshire Constitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b195-15\">5. Does HB 70 violate any other provisions of the United States Constitution or the New Hampshire Constitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b195-16\">\u201cThat the clerk of the House of Representatives transmit copies of this resolution and HB 70 to the Justices of the New Hampshire Supreme Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-17\">The following reply was returned:</p>\n<p id=\"b195-18\">\n<em>To The Honorable House of Representatives:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b195-19\">On March 4, 1987, this court received a resolution from the House of Representatives requesting an Opinion of the Justices. The resolution requests that the justices give their opinion on five questions concerning the constitutionality of HB 70, a bill that would prohibit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>homosexuals \u201cfrom adopting any person, from being licensed as [members] of a foster family, and from running day care centers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The court respectfully requests that it be excused from giving an opinion at this time. Because the bill does not define \u201chomosexual,\u201d in order to render an opinion about the constitutionality of HB 70, we would have to supply our own definition to resolve the uncertainty about the scope of the legislature\u2019s possible intent in using that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">While \u201chomosexual\u201d is understood generally to refer to a person who sexually prefers another of his or her own sex, the court does not know how broadly or narrowly the house of representatives would desire that definition to be applied in administering the statute. For example, should \u201chomosexual\u201d be limited to those currently engaging in physical homosexual practices, should it apply to any person who has ever at any time engaged in such a practice or could it apply to a person who considers himself or herself to be a homosexual but who has never performed a homosexual act? Should homosexual practices include any form of sexual contact, as defined in RSA 632-A:l, IV, or should \u201csexual penetration,\u201d as defined in RSA 632-A: 1, V, be required? Should \u201chomosexual\u201d refer to a bisexual person?</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Without a more definite statement of the house\u2019s perception of the disqualifying homosexuality, it would be difficult to provide a useful answer to the questions. Our only alternative would be speculation about the scope of the sponsors\u2019 intended purpose, which would render our answers so hypothetical as to lack practical value. Moreover, the definition to be given the term \u201chomosexual\u201d involves questions of policy which in this context are the sole prerogative of the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">The court, therefore, respectfully requests the House of Representatives to furnish a definition of \u201chomosexual\u201d as it is to be used in the bill, as well as a statement of factual findings about the nexus between homosexuality as the legislature would define it and the unfitness of homosexuals as declared by the bill. Such factual findings would be highly relevant and helpful in answering the questions, as well as in passing on the bill in greater detail if it is subsequently enacted and challenged. The due process and equal protection questions involve the relation between the statute and lawful legislative objects. While legislative fact-findings are not indispensable in ruling on such questions, they can be extremely helpful to the courts and can affect the results reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">David A.
