On January 13, 1987, the Superior Court <em>(Morrill, </em>J.) found the named officials in contempt and issued a further order that the \u201cpopulation of the [YDC] is not to exceed 107 juveniles under any circumstances at any time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">The defendants moved for reconsideration of the order because of its inconsistency with RSA 621:10, I. The court conceded that the motion raised \u201ca valid point,\u201d but observed that the statutory language was \u201cunclear\u201d and \u201cfor the sake of clarity\u201d denied reconsideration. The defendants appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">The statute plainly gives the defendants leeway to exceed the limit of 107 for short periods of twenty-four hours plus Sundays and holidays continuous therewith. The apparent reason for this is the practical difficulty of making alternative dispositional arrangements on very short notice and on days when judicial and other governmental agencies are not conducting regular business.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">Although the order in question would remove that leeway, we are unable to find any foundation in the record for doing so. The motion for contempt seeks no such order, and there is no finding that the health and safety of juveniles committed to the YDC has been or would be jeopardized by allowing an expanded population during the limited periods allowed under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">The plaintiffs have attempted to justify the order under appeal by reference to the Governor\u2019s Executive Order 84-9, dated December 7, 1984, but we do not find support in the latter for the superior court\u2019s imposition of an absolute limit of 107. While the executive order generally requires that the \u201cmaximum population of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>[YDC] permitted by law ... of 107 residents shall be maintained and . . . not . . . exceeded,\u201d its preamble quotes the statutory language giving the administration discretion to exceed that number temporarily. We do not believe, therefore, that the executive order can reasonably be interpreted to limit the statutory permission to exceed 107. Equally to the point, perhaps, is the fact that this is not a proceeding to enforce the executive order.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">Because we find no basis for subjecting the defendants to a more onerous burden than the statute imposes, the superior court\u2019s order shall be amended to allow the population of the YDC to exceed 107 to the extent permitted by RSA 621:10,1.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">\n<em>Remanded for modification.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
