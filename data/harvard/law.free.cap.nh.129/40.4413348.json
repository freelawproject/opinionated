The petitioner was terminated on the basis of a personnel department memorandum, dated January 21, 1985, which announced a new personnel policy under which State employees were to be \u201cconsidered to have voluntarily resigned\u201d if they were \u201cabsent due to illness after exhausting sick leave, but were not authorized leave without pay.\u201d The January 21, 1985, memorandum provided further that: \u201c[voluntary resignations do not give rise to any appeal rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The parties do not dispute that on January 25, 1985, the day of Daly\u2019s termination, she was too ill to report to work. They also do not dispute that Daly had illnesses in August and November, 1984, and again in January, 1985. Thus, her \u201csick leave\u201d was exhausted, but she had approximately four days of accrued annual leave to her credit when she was terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Both Daly\u2019s supervisor and counsel for the DPWH agreed Daly never received any written warnings as to the possible consequences of her further absence due to illness. Further, she asserted that she was not made aware of the January 21, 1985, memorandum setting forth the \u201cself-termination\u201d policy. Daly appealed her termination to the personnel commission, now the personnel appeals board, RSA 21-1:45 (Supp. 1986), which refused to hear the appeal. Her subsequent petition for certiorari to this court was accepted. The commission then reversed itself and granted Daly a hearing. The commission upheld Daly\u2019s termination, and the present request for certiorari followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">First, we find that the issuance of the memorandum by the personnel department on January 21, 1985, was not a proper exercise of the personnel commission\u2019s rulemaking authority. RSA chapter 541-A requires that a rule must be filed properly to be \u201ceffective against any person or party.\u201d RSA 541-A:12, I (Supp. 1986). RSA 541-A:3 (Supp. 1986) sets out a specific procedure for adoption of rules, including filing a notice of and holding a public hearing on the proposed rule. The record in this case indicates that this procedure was not followed. \u201cWe stress [again] that State agencies must comply with the Administrative Procedures Act if their \u2018rules\u2019 are to have effect.\u201d <em>Appeal of John Denman, </em>120 N.H. 568, 573, 419 A.2d 1084, 1088 (1980). We note that every policy of the personnel department is not equivalent to a \u201crule,\u201d with the concomitant necessity to comply with specific rulemaking procedures. <em>See </em>RSA 541-A: 1, XIII (Supp. 1986). In this case, however, one cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>seriously question that a policy regarding State employee termination is a \u201crule.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 21-1:43, II(k) (Supp. 1986) (adopted in 1986, specifically related to removal procedures). When a policy modification constitutes a substantive change in agency policy, it is defined as a rule, not as an explanation of existing policy as the State asserts. <em>See </em>RSA 541-A:1, XIII (Supp. 1986). The termination policy set out in the personnel department\u2019s memorandum of January 21, 1985, was a substantive policy change. Thus, we hold that it is invalid because proper procedures were not followed and that the personnel commission\u2019s already existing rules govern the disposition of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The personnel department\u2019s rules affecting the discipline of State employees generally set out three categories of discipline, specifically identifying offenses requiring mandatory discharge, allowing optional discharge in other specified offenses, and categorizing \u201cother offenses\u201d and how they should be handled. <em>See </em>N.H. Admin. Rules, Per. 308.03 (hereafter Per. 308.03). \u201cAbsenteeism without approved leave\u201d is included in the category of \u201cother offenses.\u201d Per. 308.03(3)b. The \u201cother offenses\u201d section requires that a State employee be given two written warnings for the same offense before the employee\u2019s conduct, in this instance, absence without approved leave, can trigger a discharge. Per. 308.03(4)e. The record in this case indicates clearly that the petitioner did not receive the requisite written warnings prior to her termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\"> \u201cAn agency must follow its own regulations and a discharge procured in the face of a substantial violation of those regulations is invalid.\u201d <em>Colburn v. Personnel Commission, </em>118 N.H. 60, 63, 382 A.2d 907, 909 (1978). Here, the employee was not adequately warned of the consequences of her continued absenteeism without prior approved leave. For that reason, her discharge was improper and the personnel commission\u2019s determination is set aside. The petitioner\u2019s discharge is vacated, and she shall be reinstated as a permanent State employee retroactive to the date of her dismissal, with an appropriate award of back pay and other benefits to which she is entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b56-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
