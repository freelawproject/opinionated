On appeal of the attempted assault conviction, the defendant claims that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he attempted to cause bodily injury with a knife. We affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-13\">The testimony at trial established the following facts. At approximately 10:30 p.m. on September 5, 1985, Patricia Smith went to bed. It was a warm night and she left a side door open, locking the outside screen door and her bedroom door. Around 1:00 a.m., Smith was awakened by her dog\u2019s barking. She turned on her bedroom and hallway lights and went to investigate. When she opened her bedroom door, there was a man standing in the hallway, whom she recognized as the defendant, Steven Meaney.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-14\">Meaney came at Smith with a knife. She grabbed his hand and the knife. A struggle ensued, and the defendant knocked Smith to the floor, pushing her head down by gouging her eyes. Meaney then grabbed her by the throat with his free hand, pulled her up, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>repeatedly told her, \u201cTurn off the light.\u201d She managed to turn off the hall light without releasing her grip on the hand holding the knife. Meaney then forced her into the bedroom. After she turned out the bedroom light, Smith began struggling again because she could not breathe. Both she and Meaney lost their grip on the knife, and it \u201cflew across the room.\u201d Meaney then forced her onto the bed and strangled her almost to the point of unconsciousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">When she felt herself on the verge of unconsciousness, Smith began kicking furiously. One kick hit the television that was on the side of the bed and the television came on full blast. Meaney continued to strangle Smith and then suddenly disengaged himself and ran out of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">The police later arrested Meaney at his home, and a search of his home and cars uncovered evidence linking him to the crime. The only issue raised by the defendant on appeal is whether the evidence was sufficient to support his conviction for attempted first degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\"> When a person \u201c[pjurposely or knowingly causes bodily injury to another by means of a deadly weapon,\u201d he or she is guilty of first degree assault. RSA 631:1, II. Attempt is defined statutorily as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-8\">\u201cA person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, with a purpose that a crime be committed, he does or omits to do anything which, under the circumstances as he believes them to be, is an act or omission constituting a substantial step toward the commission of the crime.\u201d RSA 629:1,1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">An act must be \u201cstrongly corroborative of the actor\u2019s criminal purpose\u201d to constitute a substantial step toward committing the crime. RSA 629:1, II.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-11\"> The State correctly notes that on appeal the defendant has the burden to show that the evidence was insufficient to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Smith, </em>127 N.H. 433, 436, 503 A.2d 774, 776 (1985). When we review the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, and uphold the jury\u2019s verdict unless no rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Wright, </em>128 N.H. 122, 123, 509 A.2d 1253, 1254 (1986); <em>State v. Smith supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b464-12\">The defendant claims that the evidence at trial was insufficient to show that he acted with a specific purpose to commit bodily injury with a knife, which was required to support a conviction for attempt<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>ed first degree assault under the indictment against him. He argues that his initial attack on Smith with a knife was not strongly corroborative of a purpose to cause bodily injury with a knife in light of the evidence that he made no attempt to free the knife from the victim\u2019s defensive grasp or recover it once it was dropped. This argument is completely without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The essence of a jury\u2019s function is to determine the weight and credence to be given the evidence at trial. <em>State v. Sands, </em>123 N.H. 570, 590, 467 A.2d 202, 214 (1983); <em>see also State v. Chapin, </em>128 N.H. 355, 357, 513 A.2d 358, 359 (1986). The jury was free to reject the inferences urged by the defendant. Indeed, the jury could quite understandably have found that the reason the defendant did not free the knife from his victim\u2019s grasp was that, as Smith testified, she \u201cwas using every bit of strength [she] had not to let go of the knife.\u201d Furthermore, the fact that, after the defendant and his victim lost their hold on the knife, the defendant chose to strangle his victim almost to the point of unconsciousness, rather than retrieve the knife in order to stab her, does not negate the inference that he intended to cause her bodily injury when he initially came at her with the knife. It is simply incredible to suggest otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">As the defendant notes, \u201cConduct illuminates intent.\u201d <em>State v. Wills, </em>107 N.H. 107, 109, 218 A.2d 47, 48 (1966). Smith testified that the defendant \u201chad the knife in his hand and came up like this (demonstrating) towards me ... a lunge.\u201d Based on her testimony, a jury could rationally have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had intended to cause bodily injury to Smith when he came at her with a knife and that this act was a substantial step towards the commission of first degree assault. Therefore, we affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b465-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
