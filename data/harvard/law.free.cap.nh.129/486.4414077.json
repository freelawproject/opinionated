We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">James Beaupre was previously tried on an indictment which charged that he \u201cpurposely cause[d] serious bodily injury to Stephen Chess by stabbing him with a knife in the stomach, chest, face and neck area.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 631:1. RSA 631:1 creates the offense of first degree assault, which may be committed in different ways. <em>See State v. Kiluk, </em>120 N.H. 1, 5, 410 A.2d 648, 650 (1980). Beaupre was tried under a single indictment interpreted, without objection by counsel, as charging each alternative. A special jury verdict form was utilized under which the defendant was acquitted under paragraph I of RSA 631:1, but convicted under paragraph II. His conviction was subsequently reversed because of the introduction of inadmissible evidence. <em>See State v. Beaupre, </em>123 N.H. 155, 459 A.2d 233 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">The State now seeks a retrial under RSA 631:1, II, and the defendant claims that this violates the prohibition against double jeopardy. U.S. Const. amend. V; N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 16. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\"> As originally indicted, the defendant could properly have been convicted under RSA 631:1, II for purposely causing serious bodily injury to another by means of a deadly weapon. There is no doubt that the defendant\u2019s former conviction was erroneous, but a former prosecution as such does not support a defense of double jeopardy where the defendant\u2019s conviction was reversed at his instigation. <em>Cf. State v. Siel, </em>122 N.H. 254, 258, 444 A.2d 499, 502 (1982); <em>Justices of Boston Municipal Court v. Lydon, </em>466 U.S. 294, 308 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
