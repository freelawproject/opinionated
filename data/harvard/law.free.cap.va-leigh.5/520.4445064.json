Plea, the general issue. The facts were stated in a case agreed by the parties, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-16\">James Cooper, by deed, dated the 18th May 1828, but in fact executed in 1829, conveyed the two slaves in question (among others) to Mason, the plaintiff, in trust, for the purpose of indemnifying Brown and Harris from loss by reason of a suretyship they had incurred for him. This deed was recorded in the county court of Southamption, in May 1829. Cooper resided in the county of Southampton, at the time the deed was executed and recorded, but the slaves were then in the county of Sussex, in the possession of Cooper\u2019s father, under an agreement by which the father was to hold the possession for two years; before the expiration of which two years, though after the deed had been recorded in Southampton, Cooper\u2019s father died, and he thereupon took possession of these slaves, and removed them to Southampton, where the deed had been recorded. It was never recorded in Sussex. After the slaves had been removed to Southampton, Cooper, by another deed, dated the 4th May 1830, mortgaged the slaves in question to Dane, the defendant: this deed was duly recorded in Southhampton : *and under it, Dane claimed and got possession of the slaves, and they were sold for his benefit. And the question referred to the court, was, Whether the plaintiff upon this state of the case had right to recover the two slaves?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-19\">The circuit superiour court held, that the law on the case agreed was for the plaintiff, and gave him judgment: to which this court upon the petition of Dane, allowed a supersedeas.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b197-20\">The cause was argued here by Shands for the plaintiff in error, and Robinson for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AvL\">It turned on the construction and effect of the provision of the statute of conveyances, touching the registry of deeds of trust of personal chattels, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 99, \u00a7 11, p. 364.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b197-21\">BROCKENBROUGH, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFk\">The statute provides, that every deed of trust of person<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>alty, which ought to be recorded, shall be recorded in the court of that county in which such property \u201cshall remain.\u201d It is clear, that at the time the deed was recorded in Southampton, and between that period and that in which the slaves were carried to Southampton, the deed was void as to purchasers for valuable consideration without notice, and as to all creditors, because the slaves were remaining in a different county, namely, Sussex. Did the subsequent removal of them to Southampton, give life and energy to the deed which had been void before? I think not. In what clerk\u2019s office would a purchaser of these slaves, or a creditor of Cooper, look for a deed passing the title to some one else? Certainly, he would examine the Sussex office, because in that county the slaves were abiding. When, at a posteriour period, they were removed to Southampton by the visible owner of them, he would not look to the registry of deeds in that county, at_ any prior time; because, during such prior time, the slaves were not there, and he could not expect to find any deed for slaves that were not then remaining there; that is, residing or abiding there. The recording of the deed in Southampton ^'before the slaves were removed, was not constructive notice to purchasers and creditors. I am of opinion, that the judgment is erroneous, and must be .reversed, and a judgment entered for the defendant in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">The other judges concurred. Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
