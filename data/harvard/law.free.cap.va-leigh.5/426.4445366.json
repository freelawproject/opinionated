That, in the mean time, namely, in April 1822, Burton combining with George flag well (who was the father of his wife) to defraud Cropper, made a pretended sale of a mill and parcel of land he owned in Accomac, to Bagwell, for the nominal consideration of 2100 dollars, and conveyed that property to Bagwell; that this transaction was wholly fictitious and fraudulent, and no money was in fact paid by Bagwell to Burton; that Burton also, in August 1824, conveyed all his personal estate to Theodore Adair, in trust to secure a debt pretended to be due to Bagwell, and other pretended debts to other creditors; but there were in fact no such debts due, ana this conveyance was also fraudulent; that Bagwell never exercised any act of ownership whatever over the mill and land conveyed to him by Burton, who continued in uninterrupted possession and enjoyment thereof; that Bagwell had since died, having by his will devised and bequeathed the mill and land conveyed to him by Burton in April 1822, and all his interest in the trust subject conveyed to Adair by the deed of August 1824, to Thomas Bagwell, *upon trust to apply the profits thereof to the use of Sarah the wife of John Burton for life, remainder to her children, with liberty to the trustee to apply part of the profits, at his discretion to the maintenance of John Burton himself. Copies of the conveyance of Cropper to Burton, the mortgage of Burton to Cropper, the records of the judgment recovered by Warner against Burton on his bond, and of Warner\u2019s suit in chancery to foreclose Burton\u2019s mortgage, the conveyances of Burton to Bagwell, and to Adair, Bagwell\u2019s will, and a statement of the balance of the debt marked A. were referred to in the bill, as therewith exhibited, and to be taken as part thereof. And the prayer of the bill was, that the conveyances made by Burton to Bagwell and to Adair, should be set aside as fraudulent, and the property therein conveyed subjected to the debt due to Cropper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-3\">John Burton, in his answer, alleged, that in the contract of sale between Cropper and him, it was expressly stipulated, that Cropper should take a mortgage of the land itself to secure the purchase money, and if that should prove insufficient, yet Burton should be exempt from all personal responsibility ; and that Cropper had obtained a bond for the purchase money from him by fraud. That he had sold the mill and the land thereto adjoining to Bagwell, at a public sale, at which Cropper was present and a bidder; that the 2100 dollars which Bagwell gave for it, was its fair value, and that this was a bona fide sale; and that his conveyance to Adair for the benefit of his creditors was also a real bona fide transaction. And the answer of Sally Burton (the wife of John) confirmed the allegations of her husband\u2019s answer, as to the terms of the contract between him and Cropper, But there was no proof whatever to sustain these allegations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-6\">The answer of the infant children of Mrs, Burton, was put in by a guardian ad litem appointed for them by the court, and it disclaimed all knowledge on the subject.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-7\">The answer of the executrix of George Bagwell also disclaimed all knowledge on the subject. The trustee Thomas Bagwell did not answer; and as to him the bill was taken pro confesso.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AKT\">*The defendants also put in a demurrer to the bill, on the ground, that the exhibits therein referred to and made part thereof, were not in fact filed with the bill. All the exhibits were in the record (except the statement A. which was never filed), but whether they were filed with the bill, or after the demurrer was put in, did not appear.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-10\">Depositions of witnesses were taken and filed by the plaintiff, to prove, that the conveyance of the mill &amp;c. made by Burton to Bagwell, in April 1822, was wholly fictitious, and that it was a fraudulent contrivance devised by the parties, for the purpose of hindering Cropper from recovering the debt which Burton owed him, and of securing the property to Burton\u2019s family; and in the opinion of the county court, the allegation of fraud was proved by the evidence. But there was no proof adduced by the plaintiff, that he had paid the balance of the debt to his assignee Warner, as he alleged in his bill, so as to entitle himself to the benefit of Warner\u2019s judgment against Burton ; such proof being probably regarded as unnecessary, because that allegation of the bill was nowise questioned in the answers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-11\">When the cause was called for hearing in the county court, the counsel of the defendants prayed a continuance, on the ground of his own ill health; but the plaintiff urged the hearing, and the court refused the continuance; and thereupon, the defendants\u2019 counsel withdrew from the cause. And the cause coming on for hearing, the court, without taking any notice of the defendants\u2019 demurrer to the bill, made an interlocutory decree, setting aside the conveyance of the mill and land, executed by Burton to Bagwell in April 1822, for fraud; adjudging, that Burton should pay Cropper the balance of 2412 dollars due him, with interest and costs ; and directing, that the whole of the property conveyed by the fraudulent deed of Burton to Bagwell, should be sold to pay the debt, interest and costs. From this decree, the defendants (except John Burton and wife) appealed to the superiour court of chancery of Williamsburg.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-12\">The chancellor held, that the decree was erroneous, because Cropper was not himself a creditor of John Burton *by judgment, and was not entitled to be so considered on the principle of subrogation to the benefit of Warner\u2019s judgment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>since he had not adduced any proof that he had paid the debt to Warner or his representative; and, therefore, he reversed the decree of the county court, and, proceeding to make such decree as that court ought to have made, dismissed the bill with costs. And then Cropper appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b166-3\">Leigh, for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUl\">submitted, that the fact of the payment by Cropper to Warner\u2019s representative, of the balance due on his judgment against Burton, being alleged in the bill and not denied in the answers, proof of it was unnecessary; Scott &amp; ux. v. Gibbon &amp; Co., 5 Munf. 89, 91, 2. But, supposing such proof was necessary, yet it was obvious, the error of the county court consisted merely in the opinion that it was not so; and the chancellor, reversing the decree for that error, instead of proceeding to dismiss the bill, should have retained the cause, or remanded it to the county court, in order that the proof might be supplied, and Warner\u2019s representative made a party.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b166-4\">Stanard, for the. appellees,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJS\">denied, that proof of facts alleged in a bill was dispensed with, in any case, by the failure of the defendant to deny them in his answer. But, in this case, there were infant defendants interested; certainly, proof was necessary, of every fact material to the relief sought against them. The appellant had no right to complain; he urged the hearing in the county court, when the counsel for the appellees was so unable to attend to his duty, that he was obliged to withdraw from the cause; and he must take the consequence of his own precipitation. It was his own fault, that he brought his cause to a hearing, without proof of the fact on which his claim to the relief he sought, his right, indeed, to ask the aid of the court, depended; and it was not the duty of the court to give him counsel, or to guard him against his own mistakes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-5\">Another point was argued, but the court gave no opinion upon it, and, therefore, it is merely mentioned; namely, ^Whether the decree of the county court was not erroneous in directing the whole of the mill and land thereto adjoining, to be sold to satisfy the debt? Whether it ought to have gone farther than to subject the moiety, which might have been extended on an elegit, if the fraudulent conveyance had not stood in the way?</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b164-12\">Chancery Practice \u2014 Answer\u2014Failure to Respond to Material Allegation of Bill \u2014 Effect.\u2014Where the answer is not responsive to a material allegation of the bill, the plaintiff may except to it as insufficient, or may move to have that part of the bill taken for confessed, and an order of court to that effect served on the defendant; hut, if he does neither he shall not, <em>on the trial, </em>avail himself of any implied admission hy the defendant.

Yet I am of opinion, that it was too rigorous to proceed to enter a dismissal of the bill, under the circumstances of the case. The bill distinctly alleged the payment; it was not denied by the adult defendants; and it can only be considered as put in issue by the general and sweeping denial of the answer of the guardian ad litem for the infants, filed in the customary form. Had the objection been made in the county court, the evidence might have been supplied, and Warner\u2019s representative might have been made a party, as indeed he ought to have been. But no objection was made. The court itself deemed the proofs sufficient; and by its very decree in the plaintiff\u2019s favor, it entrapped the appellant, if it be really true that the appellate court was bound to dismiss his bill, out and out. Such a course is certainly not calculated to further the purposes of justice, and should therefore be discountenanced. The chancellor, in reversing the decree, should have sent the .cause back, with directions, that Warner should be made a party and an in.quiry instituted as to the payment of the judgment by Cropper. In the case of Duff v. Duff\u2019s ex\u2019ors, 3 Leigh 523, I have explained my views of the spirit that ought to govern the courts in cases of this kind.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b166-9\">CABELL, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AgX\">I concur in reversing the decree, and remanding the cause, with directions that Warner\u2019s representative shall be made a party, and an inquiry instituted as to the paj\u2019ment of the judgment by Cropper.</p>\n<author id=\"AXb\">*CARR, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AN_\">The decree of the county court setting aside Burton\u2019s sale and conveyance of the mill &amp;c. to Bagwell, and ordering a sale thereof to satisfy the plaintiff\u2019s claim, was certainly erroneous, in the actual state of the case. In the first place, the demurrer should have been disposed of. It was, I think, well taken ; for an exhibit made part of a bill ought always to be filed with it, and the clerk certifies that exhibit A. was never filed; but whether well taken or not, the demurrer ought to have been disposed of. In the second place, the plaintiff failed in proving the very gist of his bill. He could have no right whatever to-file this bill, unless he had satisfied the claim of Warner, the assignee of the bond. Without an allegation of this kind, his whole bill would have been demurrable; for as the chancellor correctly says, he would have shewn no right either as a judgment creditor, or by way of substitution, to Warner, to question the fairness of the deed. With respect to the general position, that all the allegations of a bill, not expressly denied by the answers, must be taken as admitted, I consider it incorrect and mischievous. When Scott v. Gibbon was referred to in the argument, it struck me, that the court had, in some case, since I was a member, had the subject before itj and I find, that in Coleman v. Lyne\u2019s ex\u2019or, 4 Rand. 454, the general proposition was disapproved, and the reasons and authorities given. It was added, that \u201cone or two-cases were cited from our reports as countenancing the idea of the counsel; but they will be found to be cases (as in Page v. Winston, 2 Munf. 298,) in which the allegation in the bill was, that some fact did not exist, or that something was not done (negatives, which could not be proved), or cases where the documents and circumstances in the cause, proved prima facie,, that the fact alleged and not denied, was true, as in Scott v. Gibbon.\u201d In the case before us, there could be no ground for the application of the principle; for the parties chiefly interested, and claiming under the sale, are infants, whose guardian could make no admission to their injury, and did not attempt it. It is clear, then, that the decree of the county court was properly reversed. *But it was in-. sisted, that the chancellor, instead of dismissing the bill, ought either to have retained it, or sent it back, to afford <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>the plaintiff an opportunity of _ furnishing proof that he had satisfied the judgment of Warner. As a general rule, it would not seem to be the business of courts to exercise this kind of guardianship over persons sui juris, and able to take care of themselves; nor have we any evidence in this record, that the court was moved to retain or send the cause back, or that the party avowed his ability to produce the proof. I have, therefore, felt some doubt, as to reversing on this ground; but as my brethren think this the best course, I shall not gainsay it. As to the sale of the whole mill &amp;c. out and out, as the chancellor has not considered it, I shall not now give any opinion on the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Decree reversed, and cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
