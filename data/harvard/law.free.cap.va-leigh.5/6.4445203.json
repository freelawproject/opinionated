Neil M\u2019Coul was present at this sale of the sheriff ; and no objection to the sale was made by him or any one else.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-9\">But, in the year 1819, Mrs. M\u2019Coul, the legatee for life, regained possession of these slaves, claiming her life estate therein, and continued to hold them till her death, which happened in October 1823.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-10\">Meantime, by deed dated in October 1822, and duly recorded, Neil M\u2019Coul the younger conveyed to the defendant Briggs, all his estate, real, personal or mixed, in possession, reversion or remainder, upon trust to secure the payment of debts in the deed mentioned ; and after making that deed, he took the oath of an insolvent debtor, and was discharged as such, surrendering, in a schedule of his estate, whatever interest might remain to him after satisfying the debts provided for in the deed of trust.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-11\">Sometime after the death of Mrs. M\u2019Coul, the legatee for life, a suit in chancery was brought in the country court of Spotsylvania, by Briggs and others claiming the rights of Neil M\u2019Coul, against John and Neil M\u2019Coul, the legatees in remainder, in which the plaintiffs prayed a division of the slaves bequeathed by the will of Neil M\u2019Coul the elder to his two sons, the defendants in that suit, and that the defendant Neil\u2019s moiety thereof should be assigned to them. Leslie\u2019s executor was not a party to that suit. The court made a decree according to the prayer of the bill, directing *that the slaves should be divided by commissioners, and that Neil M\u2019Coul\u2019s moiety should be delivered to the plaintiffs in that suit holding his rights in the subject. A division of the slaves was made by commissioners in pursuance of the decree, and Neil\u2019s moiety, including the slaves Milley and her children demanded in this action, were delivered to Briggs, the trustee in the deed of October 1822, and the defendant here.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-15\">And the question referred to the court, was, Whether, upon this state of the case, Leslie\u2019s executor was entitled to recover the slaves Milley and her children, in this action against Briggs. The circuit court held that he was not, and gave judgment for Briggs; from which Leslie\u2019s executor appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b13-16\">The case was argued here, by the attorney general and Taylor for the appellant, and by Harrison for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b13-17\">I. There was one point very earnestly debated at the bar, but not decided by the court; namely, Whether an interest in remainder in personal chattels, is a subject that may be taken in execution under a fieri facias against the remainderman ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b13-18\">The counsel for the appellant argued, that such a remainder was personal property of the debtor, which he might dispose of by sale, pledge by mortgage, or bequeath by testament, which was transmissible to his distributees in case of his death intestate, like any other property, and of which the value in the market was as capable of being estimated, as that of personal property in possession; that, therefore, there was no good reason why it should be protected from his just creditors: that the property might well be taken under execution against the remainderman, and sold subject to the rights of the tenant for life or other particular estate; and that, in the present case, the taking of the slaves under the execution against the remainderman, did no injury to the tenant for life, since at the time of seizure, they were actually in the possession of the remainderman.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATM\">*The counsel for the appellee insisted, that an estate in remainder in a personal chattel, could not be taken under a writ of fieri facias, because such an interest was, in its nature, not tangible, not capable of manual seizure and delivery, and could have no locality ; nor could the property itself be taken by the sheriff, in order that the debtor\u2019s remainder in it might be sold, without injury to the particular tenant. He cited 2 Bac. Abr. Execution, C. 4, P. 715 : Bro. Abr. Pledges, 28, Id. Execution, 107; Deyer 67b ; 4 Com. Dig. Execution, C. 4, P. 229, 230, and the notes there in Hammond\u2019s edition. Scott v. Scholey, 8 East 467, 484.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b13-20\">II. The appellant\u2019s counsel contended, that supposing the interest of Neil M\u2019Coul was only an interest in remainder, and not subject to be taken in execution, yet as the sheriff had in fact taken the property, and as his sale of it was made in M\u2019Coul\u2019s pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>ence, to satisfy his just debts, without the least, objection on his part, the transaction was tantamount, in effect, to a sale by the remainderman himself, and neither he nor any other person claiming under him by subsequent conveyance, could be heard to impeach it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b14-3\">To this it was answered, that the sheriff\u2019s sale was made in virtue of his official authority only, and though M\u2019Coul was present, he was, for aught that appeared, merely passive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b14-4\">III. The appellant\u2019s counsel insisted that, in regard to his creditors, M\u2019Coul had an estate in possession in the slaves in question, at the time of the seizure and sale thereof by the sheriff ; for they had been bailed to him by the tenant for life, ten years before, and he had held continual uninterrupted possession ; and upon the principle of the provision of the statute of frauds, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 101, \u00a7 2, p. 373, such a bailment, so long continued, unless evidenced by deed duly recorded, was fraudulent against creditors of the bailee, and as to them the absolute property was in the bailee who had the possession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b14-5\">The appellee\u2019s counsel said, the provision of the statute of frauds applied only to the case of loans of chattels ; and besides, the tenant for life had resumed possession of the ^'slaves in question in 1819, more than five years before this action was brought, and continued to hold them till her death in October 1823.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b14-6\">IV. The counsel for the appellant argued, that the effect of the sheriff\u2019s sale was to vest in Leslie the purchaser, all the rights of Neil M\u2019Coul in the property ; and that so soon as the property of these particular slaves was assigned to him in the division between him and his brother, Leslie\u2019s right to the slaves in question became certain and complete ; so that, if this were a contest between Leslie and M\u2019Coul himself, Leslie must prevail, and Briggs, the assignee of M\u2019Coul, could not justly .claim any right that his assignor could not have asserted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b14-7\">The appellee\u2019s counsel answered, that, at the time of the sheriff\u2019s sale, Neil M\u2019Coul had no right to any particular slaves ; he was entitled to an undivided moiety of a parcel of slaves including those which were sold ; the sale was irregular; and no legal right to any particular slaves of the undivided property, could pass thereby, or even by a sale of M\u2019Coul himself, if he had made one. Leslie\u2019s executor could not avail himself of the division that had since been made, to which he was not a party.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b12-16\">See monographic <em>note </em>on \u201cExecution\u201d appended to Paine v. Tutwiler, 27 Gratt. 440. The principal case is cited in Lewis v. Adams, 6 Leigh 332.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b14-8\">TUCKER, P.</author>\n<p id=\"AqD\">I do not think ic necessary in this case, to decide the question so much argued at the bar, as to the levy of an execution on a remainder in personal estate. Admitting the levy in this case to have been valid, and the sale to have passed to Leslie the interest of M\u2019Coul, it did not pass that interest in severalty ; but, on the contrary, it constituted him a tenant in common with the other legatee in remainder, and gave him an undivided moiety in the whole of the slaves, instead of a title in severalty to the particular slaves demanded in the declaration. Unless therefore by some subsequent transaction it can be shewn, that partition was made between the parties, so that each had an absolute right in a distinct moiety at the time the action was brought, it seems sufficiently clear, that the present action cannot be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"AC\">* Accordingly, it is attempted to be shewn, that the suit in chancery mentioned in the case agreed, has changed the social rights which were vested in Leslie by his purchase, into a distinct and several title to the identical slaves now demanded, which were set apart and allotted, it is said, as the portion of Neil M\u2019Coul. I do not perceive how this can be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-11\">If the suit for a partition had been instituted by Neil M\u2019Coul against his co-legatee, and a decree rendered for a division and for the delivery of the slaves in question to Neil, there might be some color for the pretension that it enured to the benefit of Leslie, who had become the purchaser of his interest, and that the allotment and delivery of possession under it to Neil M\u2019Coul, was, in effect, a delivery of possession in severalty to the plaintiff\u2019s testator. But that is not so. The suit was brought by Briggs, the defendant here, against the two devisees, seeking possession and claiming the property in question in right of Neil M\u2019Coul. Leslie was no party to that suit, and therefore not entitled, as it seems to me, to invoke its aid, if it would avail him. But be this as it may, the decree, so far from being susceptible of sustaining the plaintiff\u2019s demand or perfecting his title, and reducing his social rights to a right in severalty, is an express decree of the property to Briggs. It directs the property of Neil M\u2019Coul, when allotted, to be delivered over to the plaintiff [the defendant in this suit] holding the right of the defendant Neil; and they were so delivered accordingly by the commissioners in pursuance of the decree. It is impossible to torture this decree, into a decree for partition between John M\u2019Coul and Leslie claiming under Neil M\u2019Coul. The decree, it is obvious, is not binding upon Leslie, as he is no party. Neither is it binding, as between Leslie and John M\u2019Coul, upon the latter, since it must bind both or neither. John M\u2019Coul, therefore, still has an undivided interest in the slaves in the declaration mentioned, if Leslie\u2019s title to Neil\u2019s interest is a valid one. This being the case, it is clear that Leslie could not maintain this action for the recovery, in severalty, of the slaves *in the declaration mentioned ; for if he has title, it is to an undivided moiety not only of these slaves but of those which were allotted by the commissioners to John M\u2019Coul.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-14\">I am, therefore, of opinion, that the judgment is right and should be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b14-15\">BROOKE, J., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b14-16\">CABELL, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5\">The question made by the counsel for the appellant as to the statute of frauds, is one of great importance, and will require grave consideration, whenever it may become necessary to decide it. I do not, however, think that there is any such necessity in this case. Eor, even if it were admitted that the continued possession of Neil M\u2019Coul, under the contract of hiring stated in the case agreed, gave him the absolute property in the negroes, so far as his creditors were concerned, and that that absolute property passed to Leslie by the sale of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>sheriff, yet it cannot avail Leslie\u2019s executor in this action, because the action was barred by the subsequent adversary possession, for more than live years, by those claiming under the will of Neil M\u2019Coul the elder. Lor the rest, I have only to say, that I concur in the opinion of the president.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
