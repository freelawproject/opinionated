On appeal, Marshall argues (i) the trial court erred in its construction and application of the term \u201cknowingly\u201d failed to reregister, as proscribed by the statute; and (ii) based on what he contends to be the statute\u2019s element of specific intent, the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. <em>Id. </em>We reject Marshall\u2019s arguments and affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">It is undisputed Marshall had been previously convicted of aggravated sexual battery, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.3, and twice convicted of failure to register as a sex offender, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-472.1.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is also undisputed Marshall knew that, as a result of those convictions, he was required to reregister every thirty days with the Virginia State Police, as he had done previously for several months, but that he failed to do so in April 2009 when his reregistration was due that month.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">Deborah Mann, manager of Virginia\u2019s Sex Offender and Crimes Against Minors Registry for the Virginia State Police, testified that Marshall\u2019s reregistration form, sent by the Department of State Police to Marshall by certified mail on April 10, 2009, was due on or before April 22, 2009. Because Marshall was not found at his address, the form was undeliverable and returned to the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Virginia State Trooper Tomlin testified that he received a telephone call from Marshall on May 7, 2009, with Marshall stating he missed his April reregistration because he rode with his uncle, a truck driver, to California, and they \u201chad problems [in California] getting loaded.\u201d Trooper Tomlin then met with Marshall on May 14, following Marshall\u2019s return to Virginia, at which time Marshall completed his April reregistration form. According to Trooper Tomlin, Marshall stated at the meeting that he left Virginia with his uncle on April 11th and returned to Virginia on May 8. Trooper Tomlin could not remember if Marshall had called him about this matter prior to May 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Charles Smith testified that he drove a tractor-trailer and took Marshall, a family friend, with him from Virginia to California, leaving \u201cthe first part\u201d of April and returning sometime in May, after being delayed in California \u201c[m]aybe seven or eight days\u201d in receiving his return load. Before leaving Virginia, Marshall advised Smith of his registration requirements. In response, Smith said to Marshall, \u201cwell, if it\u2019s not going to get you in trouble or nothing you can go and I\u2019ll do what I can.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Marshall, testifying in his own defense, stated that when he left Virginia for California in April 2009 he expected to be back by April 22, the deadline for his reregistration. When in California, according to Marshall, he actually thought the due date was April 28. So on that date, Marshall stated, \u201cI called Officer Tomlin to tell him that I\u2019m stuck in California, trouble with the load. Can I do it out there? And [Tomlin] said he had to check with Richmond.... [C]all him back in three days.\u201d Marshall stated that when he called Tomlin back, Tomlin told him that he could reregister when he got back to Virginia.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Marshall further testified that his return trip from California to Virginia took five days.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>The trial court found Marshall guilty under Code \u00a7 18.2-472.1(B) as charged, explaining from the bench as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aht\">[TJhere may not have been bad purpose, but Mr. Marshall didn\u2019t register. This is his third time. And he certainly knows that he is supposed to register. And he went to California. He voluntarily went. It\u2019s a direct violation. He didn\u2019t register. He wasn\u2019t there to receive the packet and had been registering by the 23rd for four months previously. By the 28th when he called Trooper Tomlin, I think he did call Trooper Tomlin, he was already late----And so I think he\u2019s clearly guilty again.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">Code \u00a7 18.2-472.1(B) provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person convicted of a sexually violent offense ... who <em>knowingly </em>fails to register or reregister ... is guilty of a Class 6 felony. A second or subsequent conviction for an offense under this subsection is a Class 5 felony.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">The statute does not define the term \u201cknowingly.\u201d Marshall argues the term should be interpreted to require \u201cspecific intent\u201d or \u201cbad purpose\u201d on the part of the accused in failing to register. Based on his interpretation, Marshall asserts the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction because he had no such purpose or intent when he failed \u201cto satisfy his duty to register.\u201d This is evidenced, according to Marshall, by the fact that he intended to be back in Virginia to reregister on or before his April due date, but was prevented from doing so when he got \u201cstuck\u201d in California. In finding him guilty under Code \u00a7 18.2-472.1(B) in the absence of such purpose or intent to violate the statute, the trial court, Marshall argues, misconstrued the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">A. Construction of Code \u00a7 18.2-472.1(B)</p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">The trial court\u2019s interpretation and application of the term \u201cknowingly\u201d in Code \u00a7 18.2-472.1(B) is subject to <em>de </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number><em>novo </em>review. <em>See Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>57 Va.App. 381, 390, 702 S.E.2d 582, 586 (2010) (\u201cIn its review, this Court will give deference to the trial court\u2019s findings of fact, but review the trial court\u2019s \u2018statutory interpretations and legal conclusions <em>de novo.\u2019 \u201d </em>(quoting <em>Sink v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 655, 658, 507 S.E.2d 670, 671 (1998))). Thus, our task, as always with issues of statutory construction, is to \u201c \u2018search out and follow the true intent of the legislature, and to adopt that sense of the words which harmonizes best with the context, and promotes in the fullest manner the apparent policy and objects of the legislature.\u2019\u201d <em>Colbert v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 390, 394, 624 S.E.2d 108, 110 (2006) (quoting <em>Jones v. Rhea, </em>130 Va. 345, 372, 107 S.E. 814, 823 (1921)). As a corollary to this principle, \u201cwe must assume that \u2018the legislature chose, with care, the words it used when it enacted the relevant statute, and we are bound by those words as we interpret the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rasmussen v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 233, 238, 522 S.E.2d 401, 403 (1999) (quoting <em>Frazier v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 131, 135, 497 S.E.2d 879, 881 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Guided by these principles, we reject Marshall\u2019s argument that Code \u00a7 18.2-472.1(B) requires specific intent or purpose, and hold that an accused \u201cknowingly fails to register or reregister\u201d in violation of the statute if he has knowledge of the fact that he has a duty to register or reregister, but does not do so, as occurred here. That is to say, we hold that Code \u00a7 18.2-472.1(B) is not a specific intent law. <em>See Winston v. Commonwealth, </em>268 Va. 564, 600, 604 S.E.2d 21, 41 (2004) (defining specific intent as the \u201cintent to accomplish the precise criminal act that one is later charged with\u201d); <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 634, 640, 561 S.E.2d 1, 4 (2002) (\u201cSpecific intent is not an implicit element of every statutory crime, but instead must be explicitly found in the statute\u2019s language in order to establish such intent as an element of an offense.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">First, in setting forth the mental state required for a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2^72.1(B), the legislature specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>used only the word \u201cknowingly\u201d to modify \u201cfails to register or reregister.\u201d Thus, we must assume the legislature deliberately omitted additional modifiers found in other criminal statutes under Title 18.2 of the Code denoting specific intent or purpose as an element of the crime. <em>See, e.g., </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-49.1 (\u201cknowingly, wrongfully and intentionally\u201d withholding child from parents in violation of court order); Code \u00a7 18.2-119.1 (\u201cknowingly and intentionally\u201d posting no trespass signs on land of another without permission); Code \u00a7 18.2-308.1:1, Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2, Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2:01 and Code \u00a7 18.2-308.7 (prohibiting various classes of individuals from, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cknowingly and intentionally\u201d possessing or transporting firearms); Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4 (prohibiting individual unlawfully in possession of controlled substance from \u201csimultaneously with knowledge and intent\u201d possessing firearms); Code \u00a7 18.2-369 (abuse of incapacitated adult means \u201cknowing and willful conduct\u201d causing physical injury or pain); Code \u00a7 18.2-370 (\u201cknowingly and intentionally\u201d taking indecent liberties with children); Code \u00a7 18.2-386.1 (\u201cknowingly and intentionally\u201d videotaping, photographing, or filming nonconsenting person in certain situations).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">There is accordingly no indication in the wording of Code \u00a7 18.2-472.1(B) that evidence of specific intent or purpose to violate the registration requirement is an element of the offense. As the United States Supreme Court noted in <em>Bryan v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 184, 193, 118 S.Ct. 1939, 1946, 141 L.Ed.2d 197 (1998), \u201cunless the text of the statute dictates a different result, the term \u2018knowingly\u2019 merely requires proof of knowledge of the facts that constitute the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">Second, we find support for our reading of Code \u00a7 18.2-472.1(B) from other provisions of the Code where the term \u201cknowingly\u201d is defined. In the context of certain prohibited transactions with minors, Code \u00a7 18.2-390 defines \u201c[kjnowingly\u201d as \u201chaving general knowledge of, or reason to know, or a belief or ground for belief which warrants further inspection or inquiry of [certain information].\u201d The term is also similarly defined under the Virginia Fraud Against Taxpayers Act (Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-216.1 to 8.01-216.19) at Code \u00a7 8.01-216.3(0, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>which provides that the terms \u201cknowing\u201d and \u201cknowingly\u201d mean \u201cthat a person, with respect to information (i) has actual knowledge of the information; (ii) acts in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the information; or (iii) acts in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information, and no proof of specific intent to defraud is required.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">These definitions reflect the most commonly accepted meaning of the terms \u201cknowing\u201d and \u201cknowingly,\u201d which, like these two statutory definitions, do not encompass specific intent or purpose to accomplish a result, whether by act or omission. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary\u2019s primary definition of \u201cknowing\u201d is \u201c[hjaving or showing awareness or understanding.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>950 (9th ed.2009). The primary definitions of \u201cknowing\u201d and \u201cknowingly\u201d in Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary are, respectively: \u201chaving or reflecting knowledge, information, or insight,\u201d and \u201cin a knowing manner.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1252 (1993). Similarly, The American Heritage Dictionary\u2019s primary definition of \u201cknowing\u201d is \u201c[possessing knowledge, information, or understanding.\u201d <em>The American Heritage Dictionary </em>971 (4th ed.2006).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In these and other dictionary definitions of \u201cknowing\u201d upon which Marshall relies, the term is defined as \u201cintentional\u201d or \u201cdeliberate\u201d in only the second, third or fourth definition given. <em>See </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th ed.2004); Merriam-Webster\u2019s Online Dictionary; Dictionary.com; Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard Desk Dictionary (5th ed.1980) (sources cited by Marshall).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Third, our construction of Code \u00a7 18.2-472.1(B) \u201c\u2018promotes\u2019 \u201d the express purpose of Virginia\u2019s Sex Offender and Crimes Against Minors Registry Act (Code \u00a7\u00a7 9.1-900 to 9.1-920), which establishes the underlying sex offender registration requirements\u2014the violation of which is a crime under Code \u00a7 18.2-472.1(B). <em>Colbert, 47 </em>Va.App. at 394, 624 S.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>at 110 (quoting <em>Jones, </em>130 Va. at 372, 107 S.E. at 823). As stated in Code \u00a7 9.1-900, the purpose of the Act is \u201cto assist the efforts of law-enforcement agencies and others to protect their communities and families from repeat offenders.\u201d This is accomplished by the Act\u2019s requirement of having convicted sex offenders regularly provide the Virginia State Police current residency information through registration, and the Act\u2019s establishment of a mechanism for compiling that information in the Registry for dissemination. Code \u00a7 18.2-472.1(B) then incentivizes offenders to register by criminalizing non-compliance, i.e., \u201cknowingly failfing] to register or reregister.\u201d This incentive would be significantly diminished, however, if this statutory provision were construed as requiring a specific intent to constitute a violation. Under such a construction, a convicted sex offender subject to the Act\u2019s registration requirements would be exempt from criminal liability for failure to register if the offender, for example, simply forgot to register. <em>See Smith v. Florida, </em>968 So.2d 1054, 1056-57 (Fla.App.2007) (citing this example as a reason for rejecting argument that Florida\u2019s criminal statute for violation of sex offender registration law should require a showing of specific intent). We do not believe the legislature intended such a result by its use of the term \u201cknowingly\u201d in Code \u00a7 18.2-472.1(B), but instead intended the term to be given the construction we have placed upon it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">Finally, we note that the criminal enforcement provision of the federal Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16901 <em>et seq.) </em>is nearly identical to Code \u00a7 18.2-472.1(B) in requiring proof that the accused \u201cknowingly fail[ed] to register or update a registration,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2250(a)(3); and every federal circuit that has considered the matter has held that this criminal enforcement provision of SORNA is not a specific intent law. <em>United States v. Fuller, </em>627 F.3d 499, 507 (2d Cir.2010) (citing <em>United States v. Gould, </em>568 F.3d 459, 468 (4th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Shenandoah, </em>595 F.3d 151, 159 (3d Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Vasquez, </em>611 F.3d 325, 328-29 (7th Cir.2010)); <em>see also United States v. Whaley, </em>577 F.3d 254, 262 n. 6 (5th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Voice, </em>622 F.3d 870, 876 (8th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Griffey, </em>589 F.3d 1363, 1367 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">B. Evidentiary Sufficiency</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Under the trial court\u2019s correct construction of Code \u00a7 18.2-472.1(B) as a non-specific-intent law, the Commonwealth\u2019s burden in this case was to establish that Marshall had knowledge of the fact that he had a duty, as a convicted sex offender, to reregister with the Virginia State Police in April 2009, but failed to do so. Those facts are undisputed. Thus, contrary to Marshall\u2019s contention on appeal grounded on an erroneous construction of the statute, the evidence was sufficient to support his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">For these reasons, we conclude the trial court did not err in its construction of Code \u00a7 18.2-472.1(B), and in finding, based on the undisputed evidence, that Marshall knowingly failed to reregister as a sex offender, in violation of the statute. Accordingly, we affirm Marshall\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b258-9\">. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 9.1-900 to 9.1-920 (setting forth provisions of Virginia\u2019s Sex Offender and Crimes Against Minors Registry Act, which establishes a comprehensive system for the registration of convicted sex offenders).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b258-10\">. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 9.1-904(B) (imposing thirty-day reregistration requirement following conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-472.1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b259-7\">.
