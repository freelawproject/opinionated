Wilson, Jr. (appellant) was convicted in a bench trial of forcible sodomy and animate object sexual penetration, in violation of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-67.1 and 18.2-67.2.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On appeal, appellant argues that the circuit court committed reversible error when it denied his motions (1) to return the matter to the juvenile and domestic relations district court (JDR court) prior to trial for a hearing on the appropriateness of counseling or therapy for appellant, and (2) to place appellant on probation pending the completion of counseling or therapy after the circuit court made its finding of guilt. Because we disagree with appellant\u2019s arguments, we affirm his convictions for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">The magistrate issued warrants against appellant charging him with committing forcible sodomy against his wife and charging him with committing object sexual penetration against his wife. When appellant was then arrested, the charges were placed on the docket of the JDR court for a preliminary hearing. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-241(J). Based on his wife\u2019s testimony at appellant\u2019s preliminary hearing,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the JDR court made a finding of probable cause and certified the charges to a grand jury for indictment. Appellant did not request at the preliminary hearing (or at any other time while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>his charges were pending before the JDR court) that the JDR court consider authorizing a report to address the feasibility of counseling or therapy for appellant and to assess whether such treatment would be successful. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-218.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The grand jury found \u201c[a] true bill\u201d for the indictment on both charges, and the charges were set on the docket of the circuit court. Prior to trial before the circuit court, appellant moved that court to return the matter to the JDR court \u201cfor a hearing to determine whether counseling or therapy is appropriate.\u201d Appellant argued that Code \u00a7 19.2-218.2 required returning the matter to the JDR court for that purpose because counseling or therapy was not discussed during appellant\u2019s preliminary hearing in the JDR court. In response, the Commonwealth argued that Code \u00a7 19.2-218.2 was inapplicable because appellant had already received a preliminary hearing pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-218.1. The circuit court denied appellant\u2019s motion to return the matter to the JDR court.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">After the circuit court found appellant guilty, appellant moved the court to \u201cdefer further proceedings\u201d and to place appellant \u201con probation pending completion of counseling or therapy\u201d under Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-67.HC) and 18.2-67.2(C). However, the attorney for the Commonwealth opposed appellant\u2019s motion\u2014and appellant acknowledged that such relief was unavailable to him under those statutes unless the complaining witness <em>and </em>the Commonwealth both consented. Thus, the circuit court denied appellant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">At appellant\u2019s sentencing hearing, appellant\u2019s trial counsel asked the victim, appellant\u2019s wife, if she had anticipated that the prosecution of appellant \u201cwas going to play out as it has\u201d and if she would \u201chave been satisfied if you-all had gone to counseling\u201d when she first reported her allegations against appellant to the police. In response to the prosecutor\u2019s objection to this questioning, appellant\u2019s trial counsel asserted that these questions were relevant because they explored \u201cwhat [appellant\u2019s wife\u2019s] attitude was toward the prosecution\u201d and whether she was aware of \u201cany [sentencing] alternatives that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>are allowed by statute.\u201d However, the circuit court ruled that any responses to these questions were irrelevant, given that the Commonwealth did not consent to appellant\u2019s receiving counseling or therapy under Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-67.1(0 and 18.2-67.2(C).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellant did not proffer any expected responses that the wife would have given to these questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">A. APPELLANT\u2019S PRE-TRIAL MOTION TO RETURN THE MATTER TO THE JDR COURT</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Appellant argues that the circuit court erred under Code \u00a7 19.2-218.2 when it declined to return the matter to the JDR court for a hearing on the appropriateness of appellant receiving counseling or therapy. That statute states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-8\">In any case involving a violation of \u00a7 18.2-61, 18.2-67.1, or 18.2-67.2 where the complaining witness is the spouse of the accused, <em>where a preliminary hearing pursuant to \u00a7 19.2-218.1 has not been held prior to indictment or trial, </em>the [circuit] court shall refer the case to the appropriate juvenile and domestic relations district court for a hearing to determine whether counseling or therapy is appropriate prior to further disposition unless the hearing is waived in writing by the accused. The court conducting this hearing may order counseling or therapy for the accused in compliance with the guidelines set forth in \u00a7 19.2-218.1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">Code \u00a7 19.2-218.2(A) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant contends that his preliminary hearing in the JDR court was not held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>\u201cpursuant to [Code] \u00a7 19.2-218.1\u201d because the appropriateness of counseling or therapy was not discussed at that time; thus, appellant asserts that Code \u00a7 19.2-218.2 required the circuit court to return the case to the JDR court for a hearing on that subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">This assignment of error involves the meaning of two statutes\u2014Code \u00a7 19.2-218.1 and Code \u00a7 19.2-218.2. As an appellate court, we review such issues of statutory interpretation <em>de novo. Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 121, 124, 661 S.E.2d 412, 414 (2008). \u201c \u2018[U]nder basic rules of statutory construction, we determine the General Assembly\u2019s intent from the words contained in the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Baker v. Commonwealth, </em>278 Va. 656, 660, 685 S.E.2d 661, 663 (2009) (quoting <em>Elliott v. Commonwealth, </em>277 Va. 457, 463, 675 S.E.2d 178, 182 (2009)). \u201c \u2018When the language of a statute is unambiguous, courts are bound by the plain meaning of that language and may not assign a construction that amounts to holding that the General Assembly did not mean what it actually has stated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Elliott, </em>277 Va. at 463, 675 S.E.2d at 182). \u201cCourts cannot \u2018add language to the statute the General Assembly has not seen fit to include.\u2019 \u201d <em>Washington v. Commonwealth, </em>272 Va. 449, 459, 634 S.E.2d 310, 316 (2006) (quoting <em>Holsapple v. Commonwealth, </em>266 Va. 593, 599, 587 S.E.2d 561, 564-65 (2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">In addition, \u201cwhenever \u2018a given controversy involves a number of related statutes, they should be read and construed together in order to give full meaning, force, and effect to each.\u2019 \u201d <em>Boynton v. Kilgore, </em>271 Va. 220, 229, 623 S.E.2d 922, 927 (2006). Accordingly, we must read and construe Code \u00a7 19.2-218.1 and Code \u00a7 19.2-218.2 together in order to give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>both statutes their full meaning, force, and effect as intended by the General Assembly. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Code \u00a7 19.2-218.1(A) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-5\">In <em>any preliminary hearing </em>of a charge for a violation under \u00a7 18.2-61,18.2-67.1, or 18.2-67.2 where the complaining witness is the spouse of the accused, upon a finding of probable cause the court <em>may </em>request that its court services unit, in consultation with any appropriate social services organization, local board of mental health and mental retardation, or other community mental health services organization, prepare a report analyzing the feasibility of providing counseling or other forms of therapy for the accused and the probability such treatment will be successful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">(Emphasis added).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">Here, appellant was charged under Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-67.1 and 18.2-67.2, and the JDR court held a preliminary hearing on those charges. Appellant\u2019s wife was the complaining witness, and she testified during the preliminary hearing. Under Code \u00a7 19.2-218.1(A), the JDR court was permitted\u2014but not required\u2014at the preliminary hearing to authorize the preparation of a report analyzing the feasibility of providing counseling or other forms of therapy for appellant and assessing the probability that such treatment would be successful. However, appellant did not request at the preliminary hearing\u2014or at any other time before the charges were certified to the grand jury\u2014that the JDR court even consider authorizing such a report in this case (and the JDR court certainly was not required to request such a report <em>sua </em>sponte).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">Given appellant failed to request that the JDR court authorize the preparation of a report addressing the appropriateness of counseling or therapy before the JDR court found probable cause for the charges and certified the matter to the grand jury, Code \u00a7 19.2-218.2 certainly did not require that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>circuit court then return the case to the JDR court for consideration of whether counseling or therapy was appropriate in this case. Code \u00a7 19.2-218.2 was not enacted to provide such relief to a defendant, such as appellant, who had already had a preliminary hearing in the JDR court.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Instead, the provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-218.2 apply \u201c[i]n any case involving a violation of \u00a7 18.2-61, 18.2-67.1, or 18.2-67.2 where the complaining witness is the spouse of the accused, <em>where a preliminary hearing pursuant to \u00a7 19.2-218.1 has not been held prior to indictment or trial </em>----\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-218.2(A) (emphasis added). A preliminary hearing is unnecessary, of course, when a defendant has been directly indicted. <em>Wright v. Commonwealth, </em>52 Va.App. 690, 700, 667 S.E.2d 787, 792 (2008) (en banc); <em>see Britt v. Commonwealth, </em>202 Va. 906, 907, 121 S.E.2d 495, 496 (1961). Construing Code \u00a7 19.2-218.2 together with Code \u00a7 19.2-218.1, therefore, it is clear that the General Assembly enacted Code \u00a7 19.2-218.2 to ensure that defendants who have been <em>directly indicted </em>for the commission of certain offenses against their spouses will have an opportunity to request a hearing in the JDR court to address the appropriateness of counseling or therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">Therefore, Code \u00a7 19.2-218.2 ensures that a directly indicted defendant has <em>the same opportunity </em>to receive a hearing in the JDR court addressing the appropriateness of counseling or therapy as a defendant who is charged by a warrant and thus automatically receives a preliminary hearing in the JDR court where he can simply raise this subject pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-218.1. To interpret Code \u00a7 19.2-218.2 as requiring the circuit court to return the matter to the JDR court, when a defendant has already appeared before the JDR court for a preliminary hearing, would give some defendants <em>a second opportunity </em>to raise the subject of counseling or therapy in the JDR court. Such an interpretation would eviscerate the clear legislative purpose for enacting Code \u00a7 19.2-218.2\u2014to give defendants <em>the same opportunity </em>to raise the issue of counseling and therapy. As an appellate court, we cannot and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>should not interpret Code \u00a7 19.2-218.2 (or any statute) \u201cin a manner that will make a portion of it useless, repetitious, or absurd.\u201d <em>Porter v. Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 203, 230, 661 S.E.2d 415, 427 (2008) (quoting <em>Jones v. Conwell, </em>227 Va. 176, 181, 314 S.E.2d 61, 64 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Accordingly, we hold that the circuit court did not err under Code \u00a7 19.2-218.2 when it declined to return the matter to the JDR court, given appellant <em>could have </em>asked (but <em>did not </em>ask) the JDR court to address the appropriateness of counseling or therapy at his preliminary hearing pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-218.1.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">B. APPELLANT\u2019S MOTION TO DEFER ENTRY OF JUDGMENT PENDING COUNSELING OR THERAPY</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Appellant also argues that the circuit court abused its discretion under Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-67.1(C) and 18.2-67.2(0 by, upon finding appellant guilty, declining to place him on probation pending the completion of counseling or therapy. Instead, the circuit court proceeded to enter a judgment of guilt and sentence him to a total of 88 years, with 74 years suspended, for committing forcible sodomy and animate object sexual penetration (and other offenses that are not before this Court on appeal) against his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-67.1(C) and 18.2-67.2(C) both include the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-9\">Upon a finding of guilt under this section, when a spouse is the complaining witness in any case tried by the court without a jury, the court, without entering a judgment of guilt, upon motion of the defendant who has not previously had a proceeding against him for violation of this section dismissed pursuant to this subsection <em>and with the consent </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number><em>of the complaining witness and the attorney for the Commonwealth, </em>may defer further proceedings and place the defendant on probation pending completion of counseling or therapy, if not already provided, in the manner prescribed under \u00a7 19.2-218.1. If the defendant fails to so complete such counseling or therapy, the court may make final disposition of the case and proceed as otherwise provided. If such counseling is completed as prescribed under \u00a7 19.2-218.1, the court may discharge the defendant and dismiss the proceedings against him if, after consideration of the views of the complaining witness and such other evidence as may be relevant, the court finds such action will promote maintenance of the family unit and be in the best interest of the complaining witness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">(Emphasis added). Simply put, the provisions of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-67.1(0) and 18.2-67.2(0 are inapplicable without \u201cthe consent of the complaining witness and the attorney for the Commonwealth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Here, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney clearly <em>did not </em>consent to the circuit court placing appellant on probation pending the completion of counseling or therapy. Since the consent of appellant\u2019s wife <em>and </em>the consent of the Commonwealth were required for appellant to obtain relief under Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-67.1(C) and 18.2-67.2(0, the circuit court certainly did not err in finding that the Commonwealth\u2019s refusal to consent to counseling or therapy was dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Appellant claims that the Commonwealth\u2019s position <em>might </em>have changed if his trial counsel had been permitted to ask his wife various questions exploring her views on what punishment she considered appropriate for appellant. However, appellant concedes that \u201cit is impossible to determine\u201d now on appeal if the Commonwealth\u2019s position would have changed if appellant\u2019s trial counsel had been permitted to ask such questions because no proffer was made regarding the answers that these questions would have elicited. It was <em>appellant\u2019s </em>responsibility to proffer his wife\u2019s expected testimony so as to create a sufficient record for this Court to consider his argument on appeal. <em>See Tynes v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 17, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>21, 635 S.E.2d 688, 690 (2006). Appellant\u2019s failure to proffer his wife\u2019s expected testimony \u201cis fatal to his claim on appeal.\u201d <em>Molina v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 338, 368, 624 S.E.2d 83, 97 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The circuit court did not err when it declined to return the matter to the JDR court prior to trial, and the circuit court did not err when it declined to place appellant on probation pending the completion of counseling or therapy after finding him guilty. Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we affirm appellant\u2019s convictions for forcible sodomy and animate object sexual penetration.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b562-11\">. In addition, appellant was convicted of abduction with the intent to defile, domestic assault and battery, and threatening to bomb a dwelling. Those convictions are not before this Court on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b562-12\">. The preliminary hearing was transcribed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b564-10\">. Appellant\u2019s trial counsel asked the wife a similar question during cross-examination at trial. The circuit court found that the question was premature at that point in the proceedings because Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-67.1(C) and 18.2-67.2(C) apply only \"[u]pon a finding of guilt\u201d\u2014and the circuit court had not yet reached its verdict in appellant\u2019s bench trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b564-11\">. Code \u00a7 19.2-218.2(B) also provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-12\">After such hearing pursuant to which the accused has completed counseling or therapy and upon <em>the recommendation </em>of the juvenile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>and domestic relations district court judge conducting the hearing, the judge of the circuit court <em>may </em>dismiss the charge with the consent of the attorney for the Commonwealth and if the court finds such action will promote maintenance of the family unit and be in the best interest of the complaining witness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b566-9\">. Authorizing the preparation of such a report is the opening step of a multi-step process outlined in Code \u00a7 19.2-218.1(A)\u2014a process that ultimately requires the consent of both \"the complaining witness and the attorney for the Commonwealth.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b568-10\">. Given our holding, we need not address the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that Code \u00a7 19.2-218.2(A) is directory and not mandatory. <em>See Jamborsky v. Baskins, </em>247 Va. 506, 511, 442 S.E.2d 636, 638 (1994) (explaining that \"the use of \u2018shall\u2019 in a statute requiring action by a public official, is directory and not mandatory unless the statute manifests a contrary intent\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
