Code \u00a7 65.2-500 <em>et seq. </em>The issue here for resolution is whether a furlough from work of predefined and limited duration, applicable to all manufacturing employees, both those with and without restricted work capacity, justifies an award for lost wages to a worker with restricted capacity, in the absence of evidence demonstrating a causal relationship between that restriction and the wage loss. We conclude such an award under these circumstances is not authorized by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b521-12\">The facts may be succinctly stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b521-13\">As a result of an industrial accident he had as an hourly employee in the manufacturing line at Utility Trailer Manufacturing Company (\u201cUtility\u201d) on January 9, 2006, Joshua Tester-man (\u201cclaimant\u201d) was awarded medical benefits, temporary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>total disability benefits, and permanent partial disability. Claimant thereafter resumed his work as an hourly employee at Utility that same year in a manufacturing line position commensurate with his restricted work capacity. He has worked in that capacity at all times here relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">The plant manufacturing line was shut down from January 5 to January 9, 2009. All employees on that line were furloughed for this period. On March 11, 2009, claimant filed an application seeking \u201cCompensation for total wage loss ... [f]rom January 5, 2009 [t]o January 9, 2009.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">William Weaver, the human resources manager who had worked at Utility for twenty years, testified that the manufacturing line was shut down that week for an annual \u201cphysical inventory count.\u201d He testified that the inventory count is usually held \u201cthe first full week in January,\u201d because \u201cyou cannot run manufacturing while we\u2019re doing physical inventory. You\u2019ve got to stop everything and do accounts.\u201d He further testified that every employee was informed verbally of that week-long shutdown, specifically the \u201cstart and end date,\u201d and notice of the same was posted in the factory hallway. That posted notice is part of the record before us. He further testified, \u201c[w]e told them [the manufacturing employees] we were shut down for one week only.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In short, since the need for manufacturing production traditionally slowed in January, it was in that month that the annual inventory was held.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">At the hearing before a deputy commissioner, claimant testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-7\">Attorney: And after January 9th did you return back to your light duty job?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-9\">Claimant: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-10\">Q.: And have you continued to work it since that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>A.: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-4\">$$$$$$</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\">Q.: ... you understood when you went out that it was for this period of time, a limited defined period of time, and that you\u2019d be brought back right in at the end of that week?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ave\">A.: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">In addition to the foregoing, claimant testified he thought the week work stoppage developed because: \u201c[W]e was [sic] slow on work.\u201d Claimant acknowledged there had been an annual inventory during the first week of January every year of the five years he had worked for Utility. Nonetheless he claimed, in contradiction to the testimony of William Weaver, that he had worked production during those prior inventories.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Finally, narrowing our inquiry: (1) the parties have stipulated that claimant adequately marketed his residual work capacity during the week of January 5-9, 2009;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (2) upon inquiry by the deputy commissioner as to whether the shutdown resulted from \u201can economic downturn,\u201d counsel for employer replied: \u201cYes, just the plant closed for inventory. It\u2019s a combination of those two things. I think they both really come under the guise of the causation defenses.\u201d; and (3) claimant returned to work following the shutdown at his same salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>By opinion dated July 29, 2009, a deputy commissioner rejected employer\u2019s defense that the wage loss \u201cwas not causally related to\u201d claimant\u2019s restricted capacity. Rather, relying upon <em>Metro Mach. Corp. v. Sowers, </em>33 Va.App. 197, 532 S.E.2d 341 (2000), she awarded lost wage benefits because claimant\u2019s \u201cability to compete economically ... with co-workers ... attempting to find work during a lay-off, is permanently impaired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">By opinion dated June 9, 2010, a majority of the commission affirmed, specifically adopting the deputy\u2019s reasoning. <em>Testerman v. Utility Trailer Mfg. Co., </em>226-77-65, 2010 VA Wrk. Comp. Lexis 290 (Jun. 9, 2010). Dissenting, Commissioner Williams noted that the claimant \u201cdid not lose wages because of his impaired capacity, but he lost wages, as did his coworkers, because of the employer\u2019s shut-down.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *12. He continued: \u201cA period of one week is simply of insufficient duration to reasonably conclude that the claimant\u2019s ability to obtain other light duty work was the result of his disability as opposed to some other cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *12-13. He concluded that the effect of the commission\u2019s decision placed claimant <em>\u201cin a better position than his co-workers </em>because of his disability without any showing that his disability had made him any less likely to find employment than his co-workers during the same period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *13 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Our analysis begins with a review of our cases relevant to the inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">In <em>Metro Mach. Corp., </em>33 Va.App. at 202, 532 S.E.2d at 343-44, \u201cthe majority of the company\u2019s work force was laid off <em>solely </em>for economic reasons,\u201d on March 28, 1997. (Emphasis added.) This included Sowers, a restricted capacity employee. The layoff was of then undefined duration.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cClaimant sought and received unemployment benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 202, 532 S.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>at 344. He further sought temporary total and temporary partial disability benefits under the Act. We rejected, as had the commission, the employer\u2019s defense that \u201cbecause the layoff was plant wide and economic in nature, claimant was not entitled to disability benefits because his lack of work was unrelated to his injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 208, 532 S.E.2d at 347. We found a causal relationship because claimant\u2019s opportunity to engage in work was limited by his restricted capacity and \u201c[t]hus, he did not have the same ... ability as other [not restricted capacity] employees to find other employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 209, 532 S.E.2d at 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">In <em>Carr v. Va. Elec. &amp; Power Co., </em>25 Va.App. 306, 309, 487 S.E.2d 878, 880 (1997), the commission had denied the claimant benefits, finding that he, a restricted capacity lineman, had lost overtime because of \u201cpurely economic factors unrelated to the accident.\u201d We reversed, holding that business or economic conditions did not diminish employer liability for lost wages when other non-restricted capacity linemen \u201ccontinue[d] to receive overtime\u201d wages during \u201cthe [time] period in question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 312, 487 S.E.2d at 881. Thus, we concluded there was a causal relationship between the overtime wage loss and the earlier injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">In <em>Consol. Stores Corp. v. Graham, </em>25 Va.App. 133, 486 S.E.2d 576 (1997), the injured hourly employee, formerly a stocker, returned to light-duty work as a sales person. Her hours were reduced as a sales person, according to Consolidated, because of a down turn in business. In affirming a wage differential award, we held that \u201cthe employer\u2019s financial condition and the availability of alternative work do not affect the claimant\u2019s right to compensation due to an impaired capacity to perform his pre-injury duties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 137, 486 S.E.2d at 578.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Three factors are common to each of the foregoing cases: (1) the suspension or reduction of work for each claimant began or continued for an <em>undefined duration; </em>(2) by comparison with non-restricted employees, wages were lost; that is, Carr lost overtime compared with non-restricted linemen, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Graham had fewer hours as a sales person than as a stocker, and Sowers\u2019 physical restrictions diminished his ability to find work compared to non-restricted co-workers; and (3) the causal relationship between the wage loss and the injury was established by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">The commission has also considered cases similar to the instant case, but in each of the following cases, one or more of the three above-noted factors are absent.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">In <em>Jones v. Genie Co., </em>No. 166-97-76, 1998 VA Wrk. Comp. Lexis 4046 (Dec. 3, 1998), employer\u2019s plant closed from December 23, 1997 to January 8, 1998 for annual maintenance and repairs. All employees, including the restricted work claimant, were furloughed for that period. In denying the claim for lost wages, the commission wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4U\">In this case, the claimant, like all of the ... other employees, did not work for two weeks because of the annual closing for repairs and maintenance. She did not lose wages because of her impaired capacity, but she lost wages, as did her coworkers, because of the shutdown and would have lost the wages in her pre-injury job. If the claimant were to receive benefits for the brief shutdown period, she would be in a better position than her coworkers because of her disability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-7\"><em>Id. </em>at *4.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">The commission continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-9\">While two weeks is not considered to be a long enough period to require marketing, it is also not a sufficiently long period to make a finding that a partially disabled worker is disadvantaged when all other employees are also out of work. This differs from a case where the shutdown is long-term and the employee, after a reasonable marketing effort, shows that the disability restricted alternative employment opportunities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b526-11\">The commission was faced with similar circumstances in <em>Rodriguez v. Stouffer Concourse Hotel, </em>No. 160-73-71, 2005 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>VA Wrk. Comp. Lexis 3984 (Dec. 21, 1998). On December 14, 1997, Stouffer, a restricted worker, and all other employees, were told that the hotel would be closed for six weeks for renovation and that he, and all other employees, would be rehired when the renovation was complete. He was rehired on January 31, 1998. In denying the claim, the commission \u25a0wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-4\">Here, the claimant suffered a wage loss because the employer undertook a renovation project. The project ... was for a definite, relatively fixed period. The employees in <em>[Con-sol. Stores Corp.] ... </em>and <em>Graham, </em>however, suffered wage loss for an indefinite period. These cases, therefore, stand for the proposition that an employer may not escape liability for a partial wage loss by indefinitely eliminating a light-duty assignment for \u201ceconomic reasons.\u201d ... Here the claimant was out of work for approximately six weeks because of the renovation project. The claimant was not singled out by the employer, but was treated similarly to all employees whose work was affected by the renovation. Thus, we find that the claimant did not lose wages because of any impaired capacity, but because of the renovation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-5\"><em>Id. </em>at *3, 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Commentators have noted the issue here for resolution. In 4 Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, <em>Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, </em>\u00a7 84.03 (2004), that commentator writes, \u201c[i]t is not difficult to phrase a plausible rule: Loss of employment should not be deemed due to disability if a worker without the disability would lose employment or suffer a reduction in earnings under the same economic conditions\u2014but whether this formula can be applied with any precision may be open to question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Any attempt at precision requires a delineation of factors for consideration in establishing those \u201csame economic conditions.\u201d We find they include: (1) the length of any furlough from work; (2) whether that furlough included <em>all </em>employees, restricted or not, of the same class; (3) the reason for the furlough; (4) whether the term of the furlough was pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>determined by the employer; and (5) whether employees were offered employment at the termination of the furlough. These factors address the fundamental issue in these cases: is any wage loss causally related to the injury?</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">In this case, the furlough was for one week, based upon a combination of an annual slow down in manufacturing needs and an annual physical plant inventory. All workers in the manufacturing line, with or without restricted work capacities, were furloughed. The furlough was pre-determined as to length. All employees, with or without restricted work capacities, were advised they could return to work at the end of the furlough, as did claimant. There was no confluence of all of these factors in <em>Metro, Graham, </em>or <em>Carr. </em>Here, claimant was off for one week. As the dissenting commissioner wrote, \u201c[a] period of one week is simply of insufficient duration to reasonably conclude that the claimant\u2019s ability to obtain other light duty work was the result of his disability____\u201d This was the same conclusion reached by the commission in <em>Jones, </em>where the furlough was for <em>two </em>weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">As noted above, claimant\u2019s efforts to obtain work on January 5, 2009, were unsuccessful, as would have been the efforts of his fellow furloughed employees without work-restricted capacity, because the potential employers contacted simply were not hiring. Accordingly, it was not claimant\u2019s limited work capacity, when compared -with non-restricted fellow employees, that caused his lack of employment. And it was claimant\u2019s burden to demonstrate the causal relationship between his loss of wages and his injury. Moreover, as noted by the dissenting commissioner, if claimant were awarded benefits for lost wages, he would be \u201cin a better position than his [non-restricted] co-workers.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">We do not believe the dissent properly addresses our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">We hold only that during a furlough a condition precedent for an award to a partially incapacitated employee for lost wages (or diminution in earning power) is a <em>causal relationship </em>between that incapacity and that loss. We do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>assert that a partially incapacitated employee must prove an actual loss of wages during a period of furlough. We do assert that the loss of actual or potential wages must be <em>the result </em>of the partial incapacity. Indeed, the language of Code \u00a7 65.2-502 (\u201cwhen the incapacity for work resulting from the injury is partial ....\u201d) admits of no interpretation but that a causal relationship is required. <em>See Great Atlantic &amp; Pac. Tea Co. v. Bateman, </em>4 Va.App. 459, 461, 859 S.E.2d 98, 99 (1987) (\u201cCompensation for loss of earnings due to an injury is governed by Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.1-54 and 65.1-55. Benefits under these sections for total and partial incapacity compensate the employee for loss of earnings resulting from the injury\u201d), <em>quoted with approval in Twenty-First Century Concrete v. Giacchina, </em>20 Va.App. 826, 831, 457 S.E.2d 379, 381 (1995); <em>Crystal Oil Co. v. Dotson, </em>12 Va.App. 1014, 1020-1021, 408 S.E.2d 252, 255 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">Our decision is limited in scope; it addresses only those cases where a partially incapacitated employee is <em>furloughed. </em>The five factors we developed are not rules. They are suggestions for analyzing, as we wrote above, \u201cthe fundamental issue in these cases: is any wage loss causally related to the injury?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">In <em>Vega v. Jwayyed, </em>218 Va. 1026, 1032, 243 S.E.2d 228, 231 (1978), the Virginia Supreme Court wrote, \u201calthough we have repeatedly held that the provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act are to be liberally construed, the Commission\u2019s ruling would engraft upon the Act a provision for unemployment insurance which could not be sustained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">That reasoning applies in this case. Claimant has not demonstrated that his lost wages were causally related to his injury. Accordingly, he may not look to the provisions of the Act for recompense. For these reasons, the decision of the commission is reversed and the claim for lost wages is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b522-11\">. The record reflects that some salaried non-production line employees were not furloughed, as they were needed to conduct the inventory. In past years, but not in the furlough period here under consideration, some hourly wage manufacturing employees, like claimant, were used in the physical inventory process. However, when so used, they were chosen to participate on the basis of seniority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b523-8\">. We note that a claimant is required to prove not just that he made reasonable efforts to market his residual capacity, but further, that his disability rendered him \"unable to market his remaining capacity for work.\" <em>Pocahontas Fuel Co., Inc. v. Agee, </em>201 Va. 678, 681, 112 S.E.2d 835, 837 (1960) <em>(cited with approval in Washington Metro. Transit Auth. v. Harrison, </em>228 Va. 598, 600, 324 S.E.2d 654, 655 (1985)); <em>see also County of James City Fire Dep\u2019t. v. Smith, </em>54 Va.App. 448, 454, 680 S.E.2d 307, 310 (2009). The record in this case shows that claimant went to five places on January 5, 2009 (the first day off during the shutdown). Three were not hiring anyone, one was hiring only management, and the other did not have any job applications available. <em>See </em>App. at 36. No other efforts were made. That said, those efforts do not show that claimant was unable to obtain employment because of his restricted work capacity; rather, they show that even those also laid off during the shutdown, without any restricted work capacity, would likewise have been unable to obtain employment from the same potential employers claimant contacted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b524-8\">. In November 1997, eight months later, all laid-off employees, including Sowers, were recalled to work, apparently because of improved economic conditions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b530-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>PETTY, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AA3\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">An injured employee is entitled to receive compensation when his \u201cincapacity for work resulting from [an] injury is partial ... during such [period of] incapacity.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-502. Today the majority has appended an additional prerequisite to the receipt of compensation\u2014the employee must also establish that his loss of wages was not due to economic conditions that similarly impacted able-bodied employees. It then proceeds to announce, out of whole cloth, five factors to consider in applying its \u201csame economic conditions\u201d test.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In doing so, the majority, in my opinion, ignores both existing precedent and legislative intent and effectively alters both the spirit and the letter of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">I believe that this case is primarily a question of statutory interpretation. This Court reviews such a question <em>de novo. Town of Waverly Law Enforcement v. Owens, </em>51 Va.App. 277, 280, 657 S.E.2d 161, 163 (2008). When interpreting a statute, this Court must consider the statute\u2019s language \u201cto determine the General Assembly\u2019s intent from the plain and natural meaning of the words used.\u201d <em>Alcoy v. Valley Nursing Homes, Inc., </em>272 Va. 37, 41, 630 S.E.2d 301, 303 (2006). \u201c[W]ords are to be given their ordinary meaning, unless it is apparent that the legislative intent is otherwise.\u201d <em>Phelps v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 139, 142, 654 S.E.2d 926, 927 (2008). And, \u201c[this Court] must assume that \u2018the legislature chose, with care, the words it used when it enacted the relevant statute, and we are bound by those words as we interpret the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rasmussen v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 233, 238, 522 S.E.2d 401, 403 (1999) (quoting <em>Frazier v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., Div. of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number><em>Child Support Enforcement ex rel. Sandridge, </em>27 Va.App. 131, 135, 497 S.E.2d 879, 881 (1998)). Moreover, it is this Court\u2019s \u201c \u2018duty ... to interpret the several parts of a statute as a consistent and harmonious whole so as to effectuate the legislative goal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Oraee v.

Supervisors, </em>226 Va. 382, 387-88, 309 S.E.2d 308, 311 (1983)). \u201cThus, [this Court] \u201cwill look to the whole body of [a statute] to determine the true intention of each part.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ford Motor Co. v.

Instead, the majority dwells upon what it perceives as factual similarities in several relevant cases without analyzing what those cases have to say precisely about Code \u00a7 65.2-502. As with any question of statutory interpretation, this Court\u2019s inquiry should begin with the plain language of the statute itself. <em>Surles v. Mayer, </em>48 Va.App. 146, 163, 628 S.E.2d 563, 571 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Under Code \u00a7 65.2-502, a claimant receives a payment designed to offset his <em>\u201cincapacity for work </em>resulting from [his] injury\u201d by paying him two thirds of the difference between his pre-injury average weekly wage and \u201cthe average weekly wage which he is <em>able to earn </em>thereafter.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Emphasis added). This compensation is to be paid <em>\u201cduring such incapacity.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). In lieu of these payments, however, the employer may provide his employee with selective employment\u2014that is, a job the employee can perform even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>though partially disabled, at wages equal to his previous wage. <em>See Metro Mach. Corp. v. Lamb, </em>33 Va.App. 187, 196-97, 532 S.E.2d 337, 341 (2000). In such a case, the employee is not entitled to compensation\u2014not because he is no longer suffering a disability, but because the difference between his preinjury wages and the amount he is able to earn subsequent to the injury is zero. <em>See id. </em>However, once the employer ceases\u2014for whatever reason\u2014to take advantage of this accommodation, it must return to paying benefits to the worker so that he continues to receive payment for his pre-existing diminished earning capacity. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">This Court has already recognized these principles in <em>Metro Mach. Corp. v. Lamb. </em>There, this Court addressed an argument very similar to that presented by the employer in this case\u2014that an employee, who was laid off from his light-duty employment as the result of a plant shutdown, and not as the result of a work-related injury, was not entitled to benefits due to the shutdown. <em>Id. </em>at 196, 532 S.E.2d at 341. This Court firmly rejected that argument, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-5\">The employer\u2019s reasons for the layoff should not diminish the employee\u2019s entitlement to benefits. The employee was injured on the job and his <em>capacity to work reduced. </em>The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act \u201cis highly remedial and should be liberally construed to advance its purpose ... [of compensating employees] for accidental injuries resulting from the hazards of the employment.\u201d <em>See Henderson v. Central Tel. Co., </em>233 Va. 377, 382, 355 S.E.2d 596, 599 (1987) (citations omitted). <em>Until the employee can perform at his pre-injury capacity, he is protected from the economic vicissitudes of the market place.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 196-97, 532 S.E.2d at 341 (emphases added). Accordingly, \u201c[a]fter an economic layoff from selective employment, an employee remains entitled to benefits until he either fully recovers and is released to pre-injury work, or until the employer offers him other selective employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 196, 532 S.E.2d at 341. Thus, this Court held that \u201cthe employee\u2019s layoff due to the employer\u2019s economic downturn does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>preclude his entitlement to disability benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 197, 532 S.E.2d at 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">Given our decision in <em>Lamb, </em>I can see no reason why we ought to do anything but affirm the commission\u2019s award of benefits in this case. The majority acknowledges the fact that Testerman is a \u201cpartially incapacitated employee,\u201d <em>supra </em>at 483, 711 S.E.2d at 236, but simply does not think it a good policy to give what it views as a windfall payment for wages to an employee that the employee would not have otherwise earned even if he had not suffered an industrial injury. The entire purpose of the majority\u2019s new test is to give effect to this policy decision. Yet, the legislature made a certain policy choice, and it is that decision we must honor. That policy compensates an injured employee for his diminished earning capacity. <em>See, e.g., J.A. Foust Coal Co. v. Messer, </em>195 Va. 762, 765-66, 80 S.E.2d 533, 535 (1954) (stating that an employer must pay benefits for partial incapacity to compensate a worker for his \u201closs of <em>earning power,\u201d </em>or \u201cthe impairment of the claimant\u2019s <em>earning capacity\u201d </em>(emphases added)); <em>Bay Concrete Constr. Co. v. Davis, </em>43 Va.App. 528, 539, 600 S.E.2d 144, 150 (2004) (explaining that partial incapacity benefits are calculated by considering the average weekly wage the claimant \u201cis <em>able to earn </em>\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>Pilot Freight Carriers v. Reeves, </em>1 Va.App. 435, 441, 339 S.E.2d 570, 573 (1986) (stating that benefits under Code \u00a7 65.1-55 (now Code \u00a7 65.2-502) cover \u201closses occasioned by the impairment of the claimant\u2019s <em>earning capacity </em>\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">By paying an injured employee for his diminished earning capacity, the legislature necessarily chose not to make the worker whole for wages that his industrial injury otherwise prevented him from earning, as the majority\u2019s theory suggests, but instead chose to pay him for a more abstract loss. <em>See Pilot Freight Carriers, </em>1 Va.App. at 440, 339 S.E.2d at 572. This Court explained this distinction in <em>Pilot Freight Carriers. </em>It first recognized that \u201c[t]he degree of disability under Code \u00a7 65.1-55 [now Code \u00a7 65.2-502] is determined by comparing average weekly wages which the employee actually earns before the injury and the average weekly wage that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>is able to earn after the injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Quoting an earlier version of the same treatise cited by the majority, this Court then stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-4\">\u201cIt is at once apparent that the two items in the comparison are not quite the same. Actual earnings are a relatively concrete quantity.... Earning capacity, however, is a more theoretical concept. It obviously does not mean actual earnings, since the legislature deliberately chose a different phrase for the post-injury earnings factor.... But the concept of wages he \u2018is able\u2019 to earn cannot mean definite actual wages alone, especially in the absence of a fixed period of time within which post-injury wages are to be taken as controlling.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-5\"><em>Id. </em>(alterations in original) (quoting 2 A. Larson, <em>The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation </em>\u00a7 57.21 (1980)).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Indeed, the cases cited by the majority acknowledge that economic conditions do not prevent a claimant from receiving compensation for his diminished earning capacity, even if those economic conditions result in the claimant\u2019s unemployment. <em>Metro Mach. Corp. v. Sowers, </em>33 Va.App. 197, 210, 532 S.E.2d 341, 347 (2000) (stating that \u201c \u2018the employer\u2019s financial condition and the availability of alternative work do not affect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>the claimant\u2019s right to compensation due to an impaired capacity to perform his pre-injury duties\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Consol. Stores Corp. v. Graham, 25 </em>Va.App. 133, 137, 486 S.E.2d 576, 578 (1997))); <em>Carr v. Va. Elec. &amp; Power Co., 25 </em>Va.App. 306, 487 S.E.2d 878 (1997) (stating that \u201c \u2018[t]he threshold test for compensability is whether the employee is <em>able </em>fully to perform the duties of his pre-injury employment\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Celanese Fibers Co. v. Johnson, </em>229 Va. 117, 120, 326 S.E.2d 687, 690 (1985)) (emphasis added)).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The majority asserts that these cases stand for the proposition that an unemployed claimant\u2019s entitlement to benefits under Code \u00a7 65.2-502 depends upon the causal relationship between the unemployment and the claimant\u2019s industrial injury, as determined by the wage loss suffered by the claimant in relation to similarly situated non-restricted employees. <em>Supra </em>at 482-83, 711 S.E.2d at 235-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">The majority misunderstands these cases. These cases make such a comparison not because such a causal relationship is required under the statute, but because such a comparison appropriately demonstrated the extent of the claimant\u2019s incapacity for work, or his inability to earn wages, in those particular cases. <em>See Sowers, </em>33 Va.App. at 208-09, 532 S.E.2d at 347; <em>Graham, 25 </em>Va.App. at 136-37, 486 S.E.2d at 577-78; <em>Carr, 25 </em>Va.App. at 310-12, 487 S.E.2d at 880-81. In every one of those cases, this Court affirmed the commission\u2019s award of benefits to the claimant despite the fact that, due to economic conditions, the injured employee suffered no wage loss over and above the wage loss of other employees; rather, the injured employee in each of those cases had a diminished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>earning capacity as the result of his industrial injury, and that is what entitled him to benefits. <em>See Sowers, </em>33 Va.App. at 208-09, 532 S.E.2d at 347; <em>Graham, </em>25 Va.App. at 136-37, 486 S.E.2d at 577-78; <em>Carr, </em>25 Va.App. at 310-12, 487 S.E.2d at 880-81. Because we affirmed the awards of benefits in those cases, precedent directs that we do the same in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">I am further persuaded that today\u2019s decision by the majority is in error because it is inconsistent with our case law interpreting Code \u00a7 65.2-500. This is significant because Code \u00a7 65.2-500 pays benefits based on <em>total </em>\u201cincapacity for work,\u201d just as Code \u00a7 65.2-502 pays benefits based on <em>partial </em>\u201cincapacity for work.\u201d Thus, these two sections differ only in the degree of incapacity for which they compensate the claimant, not the policy upon which the award is based. <em>See, e.g., Pilot Freight Carriers, </em>1 Va.App. at 441, 339 S.E.2d at 573 (explaining that partial incapacity benefits and total incapacity benefits both \u201ccover losses occasioned by the impairment of the claimant\u2019s earning capacity\u201d). This Court has already held that a claimant is entitled to benefits for total incapacity even though it could not be said that, but for his injury, the claimant lost wages. <em>Allegheny Airlines v. Merillat, </em>14 Va.App. 341, 344-45, 416 S.E.2d 467, 469-70 (1992). In <em>Allegheny Airlines, </em>this Court explicitly rejected an employer\u2019s contention \u201cthat Code \u00a7 65.1-54 [ (now Code \u00a7 65.2-500) ] requires wage loss [as the result of an industrial injury],\u201d holding that the statute \u201ccontains no such requirement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 344-45, 416 S.E.2d at 469-70. Instead, \u201ccompensation under [Code] \u00a7 65.2-500 is predicated upon the effect of the injury on the [claimant\u2019s] capacity to earn wages.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Lawrence J. Pascal, <em>Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation, Law and Practice </em>\u00a7 5.05 (3d ed.2000) (citing to <em>Allegheny Airlines </em>generally).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Since the theory for payment under Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-500 and 65.2-502 is the same, we should read the two sections in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>harmony. Indeed, by holding as it does today, the majority creates a peculiar scheme. If a claimant has absolutely no ability to work, he is entitled to benefits even if he cannot prove that, but for his injury, he would have continued to earn the same (or any) wages after his injury. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-500; <em>Allegheny Airlines, </em>14 Va.App. at 344-45, 416 S.E.2d at 469-70. However, if a claimant has a partial incapacity for work resulting from an industrial injury, he is not entitled to benefits for that partial incapacity unless he can prove that, but for his injury, he would have otherwise continued to receive wages. This inconsistency, of course, never arises if Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-500 and 65.2-502 are read harmoniously, as this Court is obligated to do. <em>See Oraee, </em>270 Va. at 498, 621 S.E.2d at 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">For these reasons, I cannot adopt the majority\u2019s view. Therefore, I must also reject the majority\u2019s additional rule that a claimant must prove his disability was the reason he was unable to market his remaining capacity for work.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Instead of the rule espoused by the majority today, I would consider the commission\u2019s award of benefits in light of its well-established role as fact-finder to \u201ccompare the claimant\u2019s preinjury average weekly wage to the wage he is <em>able to earn </em>after the injury to determine whether he is entitled to total or partial disability benefits and, if so, at what rate.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Bay </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number><em>Concrete Constr. Co., </em>43 Va.App. at 539, 600 S.E.2d at 150. Finally, in reaching this conclusion, I am ever mindful of the fact that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-4\">the purpose of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is to provide compensation to an employee for the loss of his opportunity to engage in work, when his disability is occasioned by an injury suffered from an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment. The Act should be liberally construed in harmony with its humane purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-5\"><em>Sowers, </em>33 Va.App. at 209, 532 S.E.2d at 347 (quoting <em>USAir, Inc. v. Joyce, </em>27 Va.App. 184, 189, 497 S.E.2d 904, 906 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Here, the commission determined that Testerman was incapable of performing his original duties due to a work-related injury, resulting in a diminished earning capacity. Accordingly, he was entitled to compensation. The employer was permitted to terminate that compensation when it provided him selective employment consistent with his incapacity at his previous wage. The employer then, for its own economic benefit, ended that selective employment. However, \u201c[a]fter an economic layoff from selective employment, [such] an employee remains entitled to benefits until he either fully recovers and is released to pre-injury work, or until the employer offers him other selective employment.\u201d <em>Lamb, </em>33 Va.App. at 196, 532 S.E.2d at 341. Because neither alternative is the case here, I conclude that Testerman was entitled to a reinstatement of compensation for his injury. Therefore, I would affirm the commission.</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b530-6\">. The majority has announced five specific factors to consider in the application of its newly minted wage loss test. <em>Supra </em>at 481-82, 711 S.E.2d at 235. Significantly, however, it fails to point to any portion of the Act to support these factors, leaving one to conclude that they must have been gleaned from the \" 'penumbras and emanations' of [the Act].\u201d <em>Carpenter v. Commonwealth, </em>51 Va.App. 84, 96, 654 S.E.2d 345, 351 (2007) (quoting <em>LaRoche v. Wainwright, </em>599 F.2d 722, 726 (5th Cir.1979)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b531-6\">. The section goes on to describe a process for calculating the claimant\u2019s average weekly wage after the injury under certain special circumstances. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-502(A) (setting forth an elaborate formula for calculating the average weekly wage after the injury in the presence of potentially volatile income earned by or from \"commissioned employees, self-employed income, and income derived from an employer in which the injured worker or their immediate family has an ownership interest\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b534-7\">. Other states with statutes similar to Code \u00a7 65.2-502 have recognized this same distinction between lost wages and loss of earning capacity. <em>See, e.g., Hendricks v. Am. Stores, </em>809 P.2d 1076, 1078 (Colo.App.1990) (stating that Colorado pays temporary partial disability benefits based on a worker\u2019s \"impairment of his earning capacity,\u201d which \"means the loss of ability to earn, not simply lost wages\u201d); <em>Harle v. Work. Comp. App. Bd., </em>540 Pa. 482, 658 A.2d 766, 769 (1995) (stating that Pennsylvania pays partial disability benefits based on the \"earning power\u201d of the employee after his injury, which may be different than the amount \"the employee is receiving in actual wages after the injury\u201d); <em>see also West Point Pepperell v. Green, </em>148 Ga.App. 625, 252 S.E.2d 55, 56 (1979) (holding that compensation should not be denied based on a plant shutdown in light of the fact that Georgia determines partial disability benefits based on \"the difference between [a worker's] average weekly wage before the injury and the average weekly wage she was able to earn thereafter\u201d); <em>cf. Shaw Indus., Inc. v. Shaw, </em>262 Ga.App. 586, 586 S.E.2d 80, 82 (2003) (suggesting that the worker\u2019s \"actual post-injury wages\u201d are relevant, although not necessarily dispositive, to determine the amount a worker is \"able to earn\u201d after being injured).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b535-5\">. The majority also cites <em>Rodriguez v. Stouffer Concourse Hotel, </em>No. 160-73-71, 1998 VA Wrk. Comp. LEXIS 3984 (Dec. 21, 1998), in support of its conclusion. My response is two-fold. First, we are not bound by opinions of the commission. <em>NiSource, Inc. v. Thomas, </em>53 Va.App. 692, 711, 674 S.E.2d 581, 591 (2009). Second, and more importantly, the commission itself, in this very case, has abandoned the reasoning expressed in <em>Rodriguez </em>in light of our more recent controlling opinions in <em>Sowers </em>and <em>Lamb. See Testerman v. Util. Trailer Mfr. Co., </em>No. 226-77-65, 2010 VA Wrk. Comp. LEXIS 290, at *3-4 (June 9, 2010) (analyzing this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Sowers </em>in making its decision).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b536-6\">. At oral .argument, the employer agreed that had Testerman been receiving temporary total disability benefits instead of working a light-duty job, he. would have been entitled to receive compensation throughout the layoff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b537-5\">. I must note that a claimant's initial entitlement to benefits under Code \u00a7 65.2-502, despite economic conditions that preclude actual wage loss, should not be confused with the separate question as to whether the claimant has subsequently lost his entitlement to those benefits by failing to take reasonable efforts to market his residual work capacity. <em>See Herbert Bros., Inc. v. Jenkins, </em>14 Va.App. 715, 717, 419 S.E.2d 283, 284 (1992) (\"In order to continue to receive benefits under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, a claimant who has been injured in a job-related accident must market his remaining capacity to work.\u201d) Of course, since the parties stipulated that the claimant here had reasonably marketed his residual capacity, there is no need to analyze this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b537-6\">. Here, the claimant testified that he had continued to work while the plant was shut down during prior inventories and that some of his coworkers remained employed during this shutdown. The majority, however, has chosen to adopt those facts that support its conclusion by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>accepting the competing testimony of the claimant's manager, <em>supra </em>at 476-77, 711 S.E.2d at 232-33, despite this Court's obligation to examine the facts in the light most favorable to the claimant, who prevailed below. <em>Crisp v. Brown's Tysons Corner Dodge, Inc., </em>1 Va.App. 503, 504, 339 S.E.2d 916, 916 (1986). Nevertheless, the facts, as they are, seem to require further examination by the fact-finder to evaluate the new factors listed by the majority. Thus, even if I were to agree with the rule set by the majority, I would still remand for further proceedings because of the fact-finding necessarily required by that rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
