We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">At trial, Pitts stipulated that the evidence was sufficient to prove he stole an item with a value of less than $200. He conceded that he had suffered a prior conviction for grand larceny and a prior conviction for attempted petit larceny under Code \u00a7 18.2-27, but he argued that the attempted petit larceny conviction was not a predicate offense, operating under Code \u00a7 18.2-104 to enhance the petit larceny offense to a felony. The trial court convicted Pitts of petit larceny, third or subsequent offense, a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-9\">Code \u00a7 18.2-96 defines \u201cpetit larceny\u201d as the \u201ccom-mi[ssion] of simple larceny not from the person of another of goods and chattels of the value of less than $200.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-104 provides for the punishment for petit larceny and states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-10\">When a person is convicted of an offense of larceny or any offense deemed to be or punished as larceny under any provision of the Code ... he shall be confined in jail not less than thirty days nor more than twelve months; and for a third, or any subsequent offense, he shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-11\">Code \u00a7 18.2-27 states: \u201cEvery person who attempts to commit an offense which is a misdemeanor shall be punishable by the same punishment prescribed for the offense the commission of which was the object of the attempt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b789-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>Relying on <em>Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 311, 477 S.E.2d 3 (1996), <em>aff'd on reh\u2019g en banc, </em>24 Va.App. 613, 484 S.E.2d 170 (1997), Pitts argues that his prior attempted petit larceny conviction was not a larceny conviction within the contemplation of Code \u00a7 18.2-104, because Code \u00a7 18.2-27 does not expressly state that offense is deemed to be or is punishable as larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">The issue thus presented raises a question of law. Therefore, we employ a <em>de novo </em>standard of review. <em>Rollins v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 73, 79, 554 S.E.2d 99, 102 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">\u201cWhile penal statutes must be strictly construed against the Commonwealth, \u2018[t]he plain, obvious, and rational meaning of a statute is always preferred to any curious, narrow or strained construction; a statute should never be construed so that it leads to absurd results.\u2019 \u201d <em>Newton v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 86, 89, 462 S.E.2d 117, 119 (1995) (quoting <em>Branch v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 836, 839, 419 S.E.2d 422, 424 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">In <em>Harris, </em>the defendant was convicted of felony petit larceny based upon a prior petit larceny conviction and a prior robbery conviction. <em>Harris, </em>23 Va.App. at 312, 477 S.E.2d at 4. We held that a prior robbery conviction was not a predicate offense for enhancement purposes under Code \u00a7 18.2-104. <em>Id. </em>at 313, 477 S.E.2d at 4. In reaching that holding, we discussed the 1994 amendment to Code \u00a7 18.2-104 made in response to our holding in <em>Snead v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 643, 400 S.E.2d 806 (1991),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and stated that \u201c[p]rior to the amendment of Code \u00a7 18.2-104, the scope of predicate offenses that would enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence was narrow.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>23 Va.App. at 313, 477 S.E.2d at 4. Based upon the legislative history of the amendment, we held that under amended Code \u00a7 18.2-104 \u201cpredicate offenses now include: (1) \u2018any offense of larceny;\u2019 (2) \u2018any offense deemed ... larceny;\u2019 (3) \u2018any offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>... punishable as larceny;\u2019 and (4) \u2018any substantially similar offense in any other jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 314, 477 S.E.2d at 5 (quoting Code \u00a7 18.2-104).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-104 includes crimes that are \u201cpunished as larceny under any provision of the Code.\u201d Because Code \u00a7 18.2-27 provides that attempts \u201cshall be punishable by the same punishment prescribed for the offense the commission of which was the object of the attempt,\u201d Pitts\u2019 attempted petit larceny conviction was punishable as a petit larceny conviction and was a predicate conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-104. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in holding that Pitts\u2019 prior conviction for attempted petit larceny was a predicate offense, raising his current petit larceny offense to a felony, and in convicting appellant of petit larceny, third or subsequent offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b789-9\">. In <em>Snead, </em>this Court held that prior convictions for passing bad checks were not proper predicate offenses to support a conviction for felony petit larceny under Code \u00a7 18.2-104. <em>Snead, </em>11 Va.App. at 647-48, 400 S.E.2d at 808.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
