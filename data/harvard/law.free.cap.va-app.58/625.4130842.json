On appeal, Johnson challenges the sufficiency of the evidence and claims the trial court erred in admitting certain exhibits. We affirm Johnson\u2019s convictions, finding his arguments either lacking in merit or procedurally defaulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">On appeal, we review the evidence in the \u201clight most favorable\u201d to the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth v. Hudson, </em>265 Va. 505, 514, 578 S.E.2d 781, 786 (2003). This principle requires us to \u201cdiscard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences to be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Parks v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 492, 498, 270 S.E.2d 755, 759 (1980) (emphasis and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">In addition, \u201can appellate court\u2019s \u2018examination is not limited to the evidence mentioned by a party in trial argument or by the trial court in its ruling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Perry v. Commonwealth, </em>280 Va. 572, 580, 701 S.E.2d 431, 436 (2010) (quoting <em>Bolden v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 144, 147, 654 S.E.2d 584, 586 (2008)). Instead, \u201can appellate court must consider all the evidence admitted at trial that is contained in the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Bolden, </em>275 Va. at 147, 654 S.E.2d at 586); <em>see also Hamilton v. Commonwealth, </em>279 Va. 94, 103, 688 S.E.2d 168, 173 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Viewed from this perspective, the record shows a fight broke out at a club in Hampton one night in April 2009. One of the combatants, a young man known as \u201cAkeem,\u201d was known to be a member of the \u201cthree-six\u201d gang. When club security sprayed mace to break up the fight, Akeem and several fellow gang members fled outside.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Clyde Bell was with one of the young men who had fought against Akeem. As the group dispersed, he also went outside. Standing outside the club, Bell overheard one of the gang members ask, \u201cWhere them bitches at?\u201d Bell called a friend inside the club and said, \u201cI\u2019m about to get jumped.\u201d Moments later, Akeem and approximately six other gang members approached Bell. Johnson was one of them. Bell asked, \u201cSo you-all going to jump me, right?\u201d As Akeem advanced toward Bell, Bell struck Akeem in an effort to defend himself. The effort failed. As Akeem began to beat Bell, the three-six gang members in the group joined one by one in the beating, which lasted about five minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>During the sustained assault, Bell heard several of the attackers say, \u201cthree-six, bitch.\u201d A witness who knew Johnson saw him \u201cin the middle of the fight\u201d and \u201cthrowing punches\u201d at Bell during the m\u00e9l\u00e9e. The witness said he was \u201ca hundred-percent sure\u201d Johnson was \u201cinvolved in the fight.\u201d After the beating ended, the three-six gang members walked away. Bell heard them say \u201cWho next?\u201d and \u201cWhere the rest of them at?\u201d The beating left Bell with two broken vertebrae in his lumbar spine.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">A grand jury indicted Johnson for participating in a criminal street gang, maiming by mob, conspiracy to maim by mob, and robbery. At trial, a detective trained in investigating criminal street gangs testified as an expert concerning the 36th Street Bang Squad\u2014known colloquially as the \u201cthree-six\u201d gang. The detective described the unique hand signs and symbols associated with the three-six gang. He also explained in detail the gang\u2019s violent reputation and its association with other criminal street gangs like the \u201cBloods\u201d and the \u201cG-Shine\u201d organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Over Johnson\u2019s objection, the trial court admitted into evidence a 2009 conviction order finding Johnson guilty of two violent felonies. The trial court also admitted into evidence a plea agreement and sentencing order showing Jumar A. Turner, one of the participants in the beating, was found guilty of committing a violent felony earlier in 2009. Earlier in the trial, Johnson\u2019s counsel stated he would object to the Turner conviction, but when the prosecutor offered it into evidence, Johnson\u2019s counsel raised no objection. Upon the close of the evidence, the trial court denied Johnson\u2019s motion to strike and found him guilty of maiming by mob, conspiracy to maim by mob, and participating in a criminal street gang. The court acquitted Johnson of the robbery charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">On appeal, Johnson challenges the sufficiency of the evidence for each of the convicted offenses. He also argues that, even if the evidence is sufficient, the case must still be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>remanded for a new trial because the trial court erroneously admitted into evidence his prior conviction and Turner\u2019s plea agreement and sentencing order.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">A. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">We examine a trial court\u2019s factfinding \u201cwith the highest degree of appellate deference.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va.App. 605, 608, 633 S.E.2d 229, 231 (2006). An appellate court does not \u201cask itself whether <em>it </em>believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>278 Va. 190, 193, 677 S.E.2d 280, 282 (2009) (emphasis in original) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-19, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)). Instead, the only \u201crelevant question is, after reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, whether <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Sullivan v. Commonwealth, </em>280 Va. 672, 676, 701 S.E.2d 61, 63 (2010) (emphasis added) (citing <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. at 2789). We are \u201cnot permitted to reweigh the evidence,\u201d <em>Nusbaum v. Berlin, </em>273 Va. 385, 408, 641 S.E.2d 494, 507 (2007), because appellate courts have no authority \u201cto preside <em>de novo </em>over a second trial,\u201d <em>Haskins v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 1, 11, 602 S.E.2d 402, 407 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">In a bench trial, a trial judge\u2019s \u201cmajor role is the determination of fact, and with experience in fulfilling that role comes expertise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). If the evidence passes the sufficiency test, \u201cthe reviewing court is not permitted to substitute its own judgment, even if its opinion might differ from the conclusions reached by the finder of fact at the trial.\u201d <em>Courtney v. Commonwealth, </em>281 Va. 363, 368, 706 S.E.2d 344, 347 (2011) (citation omitted); <em>see also Holloway v. Commonwealth, </em>57 Va.App. 658, 664, 705 S.E.2d 510, 513 (2011) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">1. <em>Maiming by Mob</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">Code \u00a7 18.2-41 provides that any \u201cperson composing a mob which shall maliciously or unlawfully shoot, stab, cut or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>wound any person, or by any means cause him bodily injury with intent to maim, disable, disfigure or kill him, shall be guilty of a Class 3 felony.\u201d The statutory text makes clear</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AoV\">malicious wounding by mob, as set out in Code \u00a7 18.2-41, is a different offense from malicious wounding as codified in Code \u00a7 18.2-51. Malicious wounding by mob does not require the Commonwealth to prove malice because it defines the crime as \u201cmaliciously or unlawfully [wounding] any person ... with intent to maim, disable, disfigure or kill him____\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-41. The disjunctive term \u201cor,\u201d which separates the terms \u201cmaliciously\u201d and \u201cunlawfully,\u201d indicates that Code \u00a7 18.2-41 only requires proof that the wounding was unlawful. Code \u00a7 18.2-41 therefore criminalizes different conduct from malicious wounding under Code \u00a7 18.2-51.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-7\"><em>Paiz v. Commonwealth, </em>54 Va.App. 688, 698, 682 S.E.2d 71, 76 (2009) (alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">Under Code \u00a7 18.2-38, \u201c[a]ny collection of people, assembled for the purpose and with the intention of committing an assault or a battery upon any person or an act of violence as defined in \u00a7 19.2-297.1, without authority of law, shall be deemed a \u2018mob.\u2019 \u201d Thus,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeR\">to sustain a conviction of maiming by mob under Code \u00a7 18.2-41, the evidence must establish that the accused was a member of a group composing a mob; that the mob caused the victim bodily injury; and that the mob acted with the malicious [or unlawful] intent \u201cto maim, disable, disfigure or kill\u201d the victim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-9\"><em>Commonwealth v. Leal, </em>265 Va. 142, 146, 574 S.E.2d 285, 287-88 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">An otherwise lawful assembly of people can become a \u201cmob\u201d simply by adopting an unlawful intent to commit violence. <em>See Harrell v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 1, 7-8, 396 S.E.2d 680, 683 (1990). \u201cWhether a group of individuals has been so transformed into a \u2018mob\u2019 depends upon the circumstances; no particular words or express agreements are required to effect a change in a group\u2019s purpose or intentions.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number><em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>58 Va.App. 303, 320, 709 S.E.2d 175, 184 (2011) (quoting <em>Harrell, </em>11 Va.App. at 7-8, 396 S.E.2d at 683). \u201cEvents or emotionally charged circumstances suddenly may focus individuals toward a common goal or purpose without an express or stated call to join forces.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the \u201cimpulsive and irrational forces that may exist to transform peaceable assembly into mob violence are to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis,\u201d <em>id., </em>the determination is a question of fact for the factfinder.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">The evidence showed a mob formed outside the club with the specific intent of committing violence. One of the mob\u2019s members voiced its collective question, \u201cWhere them bitches at?\u201d\u2014thereby signaling the mob\u2019s intent to find and assault those associated with the earlier fray. They found Bell, who had accompanied one of the men who had fought against Akeem. Apparently aware of what was about to happen, Bell asked rhetorically, \u201cSo you-all going to jump me, right?\u201d The group then beat Bell for about five minutes, leaving him with two fractured vertebrae. As they walked away, Bell heard them say \u201cWho next?\u201d and \u201cWhere the rest of them at?\u201d\u2014 further confirming the collective violent intent of the mob.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Johnson claims the evidence, at most, shows he merely threw a few punches. This assertion, whether true or not, misses the point. \u201cEvery person composing a mob \u2018becomes criminally culpable even though the member may not have actively encouraged, aided, or countenanced the act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Leal, </em>265 Va. at 147, 574 S.E.2d at 288 (quoting <em>Harrell, </em>11 Va.App. at 8, 396 S.E.2d at 683); <em>Abdullah v. Commonwealth, </em>53 Va.App. 750, 759, 675 S.E.2d 215, 219-20 (2009) (citation omitted). \u201cIn other words, the statute imposes \u2018individual liability based on collective act and intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Paiz, </em>54 Va.App. at 697, 682 S.E.2d at 75 (quoting Ronald J. Bacigal, <em>Virginia Practice: Criminal Offenses and Defenses </em>523 (2008-09 ed.)). The duration of the beating and the \u201cgravity of the victim\u2019s injuries inflicted by the mob,\u201d <em>Leal, </em>265 Va. at 147, 574 S.E.2d at 288, demonstrate that the mob, which included Johnson, intended to seriously injure and maim Bell.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>2. <em>Conspiracy to Maim by Mob</em></p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">In his sufficiency argument, Johnson addresses in detail his challenge to the maiming-by-mob conviction, <em>see </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 28-32, but makes no argument specific to his conspiracy-to-maim-by-mob conviction, except for a single statement that he did not strike Bell and \u201cnever agreed,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 29, to do so. With respect to the conspiracy conviction, Johnson implies, without expressly stating, that his conspiracy conviction should be overturned for the same reasons he advanced for overturning his maiming-by-mob conviction. Having rejected Johnson\u2019s challenge to the maiming-by-mob conviction, we thus limit our review of his conspiracy conviction to his claim that he \u201cnever agreed\u201d to strike Bell or anyone else. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">\u201cIt is a rare case where any \u2018formal agreement among alleged conspirators\u2019 can be established.\u201d <em>James v. Commonwealth, </em>53 Va.App. 671, 678, 674 S.E.2d 571, 575 (2009). Because \u201cmost conspiracies are \u2018clandestine in nature,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting 2 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Substantive Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 12.2(a), at 266 (2d ed.2003)), conspiracy law does not require proof of an \u201cexplicit agreement,\u201d <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>279 Va. 295, 301, 687 S.E.2d 738, 741 (2010). A conspiratorial agreement \u201coften may only be established by circumstantial and indirect evidence including the overt actions of the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Floyd v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 575, 580-81, 249 S.E.2d 171, 174 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Here, a reasonable factfinder could infer from the circumstances and the \u201covert actions of the parties,\u201d <em>id., </em>that the mob did not form spontaneously, but rather, as a result of a collective, agreed upon effort to punish anyone involved in the earlier fight inside the club. One member of the group all but announced the group\u2019s purpose by asking, \u201cWhere them bitches at?\u201d After the five-minute beating of Bell, another member of the mob confirmed the group\u2019s continuing purpose by asking, \u201cWho next?\u201d and \u201cWhere the rest of them at?\u201d Because one eyewitness placed Johnson \u201cin the middle of the fight,\u201d the trial court could reasonably infer Johnson fully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>joined in the collective decision to target the participants in the club fray and anyone who may have accompanied them.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">8. <em>Participating in a Criminal Street Gang</em></p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">At trial, Johnson challenged the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the gang charge on the ground that the evidence did not prove the beating of Bell was \u201cpart of, or for the benefit of a street gang.\u201d Counsel specifically disclaimed any challenge to the existence of the gang. \u201cI\u2019m not going to go into the evidence,\u201d counsel advised the court, \u201cas to whether or not it may rise to the level of a criminal street gang.\u201d Counsel limited his argument to the assertion that the beating was \u201cnot for the benefit of, or at the direction of, or in association with that gang.\u201d \u201cThat is a requirement for this,\u201d counsel concluded, \u201cand this is where the prosecution\u2019s evidence falls down with respect to this particular crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">On appeal, Johnson raises for the first time a sufficiency challenge to the existence of a \u201ccriminal street gang\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-46.1. We do not address this question. Applying Rule 5A:18, an \u201cappellate court, in fairness to the trial judge, should not ... put a different twist on a question that is at odds with the question presented to the trial court.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Shifflett, </em>257 Va. 34, 44, 510 S.E.2d 232, 237 (1999). Under settled principles, the \u201csame argument must have been raised, with specificity, at trial before it can be considered on appeal.\u201d <em>Correll v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 311, 324, 591 S.E.2d 712, 719 (2004); <em>see also Riner v. Commonwealth, </em>268 Va. 296, 325, 601 S.E.2d 555, 571 (2004). \u201cMaking one specific argument on an issue does not preserve a separate legal point on the same issue for review.\u201d <em>Edwards v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 752, 760, 589 S.E.2d 444, 448 (2003) <em>(en banc), aff'd by unpublished order, </em>No. 040019 (Va. Oct. 15, 2004).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>Johnson claims he should be excused for not raising the point at trial because the best authority supporting it, <em>Taybron v. Commonwealth, </em>57 Va.App. 470, 703 S.E.2d 270 (2011), was decided after his conviction and either effected a \u201cchange in the law\u201d or created \u201cnew law\u201d in the Commonwealth. <em>See </em>Oral Argument Audio at 5:07 to 5:09, 9:49 to 9:56. We do not believe <em>Taybron </em>changed existing law or created new law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But even if it did, the \u201cperceived futility of an objection does not excuse a defendant\u2019s procedural default at trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Jerman, </em>263 Va. 88, 94, 556 S.E.2d 754, 757 (2002) (\u201cOur conclusion is not altered by the fact that the [old rule] was still in effect on the date of [defendant\u2019s] trial.\u201d); <em>see also McGhee v. Commonwealth, </em>280 Va. 620, 625, 701 S.E.2d 58, 60-61 (2010); <em>Riner v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 440, 456, 579 S.E.2d 671, 679 (2003), <em>aff'd, </em>268 Va. 296, 601 S.E.2d 555 (2004); <em>Snurkowski v. Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va.App. 532, 536, 348 S.E.2d 1, 2 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">B. EVIDENTIARY ERRORS</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">On appeal, Johnson contends the trial court erred in admitting into evidence Turner\u2019s plea agreement and sentencing order. At trial, however, Johnson did not object to the evidence at the time of its admission and, thus, the trial court never ruled on the issue. \u201cTo be timely, an objection to the admissibility of evidence must be made when the occasion arises\u2014that is, when the evidence is offered, the statement made or the ruling given.\u201d <em>Zook v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 560, 568, 525 S.E.2d 32, 35-36 (2000) (quoting <em>Harward </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number><em>v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 468, 473, 364 S.E.2d 511, 513 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">Johnson seeks to excuse the default because, earlier in the trial, his trial counsel stated he would object when the evidence was later presented. Counsel never did object, however, and the trial court properly refrained from <em>sua sponte </em>raising the objection for him. Johnson also seeks to apply the \u201cends of justice\u201d exception of Rule 5A:18 by asserting the court probably would have sustained the objection under the reasoning we later adopted in <em>Taybron. </em>We find neither assertion sufficient to excuse the default.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">No explanation is given for counsel\u2019s failure to object at the time the trial court admitted the evidence. Therefore, no \u201cgood cause\u201d under Rule 5A:18 has been proffered, much less proven. With respect to Johnson\u2019s <em>Taybron </em>argument, the ends-of-justice exception to waiver does not apply simply because an appellant asserts a winning argument on the waived issue. If that were so, procedural default \u201cwould never apply, except when it does not matter.\u201d <em>Delaney v. Commonwealth, </em>55 Va.App. 64, 69, 683 S.E.2d 834, 836 (2009). Considerably more must be shown before that narrow exception comes into play. Nothing in the circumstances of this case rises to that level.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>Johnson also contends the trial court erred by admitting evidence of his own 2009 conviction order finding him guilty of malicious wounding and maiming by mob.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because these convictions did not relate to \u201cgang activity or the activities of the 36th Street Bang Squad,\u201d Johnson argues, \u201cthe evidence was irrelevant and should have been excluded.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 37. We disagree. Code \u00a7 18.2-46.2(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-4\">Any person who actively participates in or is a member of a criminal street gang and who knowingly and willfully participates in any predicate criminal act committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with any criminal street gang shall be guilty of a Class 5 felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AaG\">The crime thus involves two elements\u2014status and conduct. While in the status of either an active participant <em>or </em>a member in a criminal street gang, the defendant must participate in the predicate criminal conduct related to any criminal street gang. A criminal street gang includes</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AF0\">any ongoing organization, association, or group of three or more persons, whether formal or informal, (i) which has as one of its primary objectives or activities the commission of one or more criminal activities; (ii) which has an identifiable name or identifying sign or symbol; and (iii) whose members <em>individually or collectively </em>have engaged in the commission of, attempt to commit, conspiracy to commit, or solicitation of two or more <em>predicate criminal acts, </em>at least one of which is an act of violence, provided such acts were not part of a common act or transaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-46.1 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">The Commonwealth offered Johnson\u2019s prior felony conviction order to prove the predicate criminal \u201cacts of violence\u201d committed \u201cindividually or collectively\u201d by members of the putative gang under Code \u00a7 18.2-46.1. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1(A)(i) (identifying malicious wounding and maiming by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>mob as \u201cacts of violence\u201d). Unlike the conduct element of the offense, the status element\u2014active participation or membership in a criminal street gang\u2014requires the application of Code \u00a7 18.2-46.1, which conspicuously omits any requirement that the predicate criminal acts be gang related.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Faithful to the textualist approach to statutory interpretation, we presume \u201cthe legislature \u2018chose, with care,\u2019 the specific words of the statute.\u201d <em>Va.

Szymczak, </em>41 Va.App. 365, 371, 585 S.E.2d 349, 352-53 (2003)). \u201cWorking from the statutory text, we strive to give that language a \u2018literal construction\u2019 unless doing so \u2018would involve a manifest absurdity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Cent.

And we are unwilling to \u201cjudicially graft\u201d such a requirement into the statute, <em>Whitfield, </em>42 Va.App. at 280, 590 S.E.2d at 640, under the subtle \u201cguise of judicial interpretation,\u201d <em>Holly Hill Farm Corp. v.
