Scott contends that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>court denied her an impartial jury by refusing to strike one of the potential jurors for cause.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">BACKGROUND<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">On the day of trial, during <em>voir dire, </em>defense counsel moved to strike potential juror Brightwell for cause. While outside of the presence of the rest of the venire, defense counsel and the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney conducted further <em>voir dire of </em>Brightwell regarding his impartiality, during which the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-7\">[Defense Counsel]: Do you think you may have a hard time listening to just what happened ... in this case and listen to the evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-8\">[Brightwell]: I have another friend who works for the Sheriffs Office in the county where I teach. And they made a comment one time about if you go to court\u2014and I guess in this particular county\u2014that you\u2019re pretty much guilty. And I guess because of my respect for her, I think that kind of may have put a preconceived notion in my head, I guess.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-9\">[Defense Counsel]: So when you heard the charges against Miss Scott, in your head, the fact that she was charged, it made you think that she was guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-10\">[Brightwell]: Potentially, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-11\">[Defense Counsel]: Potentially, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-12\">[Brightwell]: I\u2019m not saying that that\u2019s definitely where it is. But I\u2019m saying that there is a possibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-13\">[Defense Counsel]: Without hearing any of the evidence, just because she is charged?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>[Brightwell]: (Nodding head in the affirmative.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-5\">[Commonwealth]: I just want to make sure I understand your answer. That when you heard what the charges were, you felt that there was a possibility that she did it? Is that what you\u2019re saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">[Brightwell]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-7\">[Commonwealth]: Are you saying that there is a possibility that you wouldn\u2019t be fair or it\u2019s possible that she did the crime?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-8\">[Brightwell]: Can you explain the difference?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-9\">[Commonwealth]: You understand that everyone who comes into court is presumed to be innocent under the law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-10\">[Brightwell]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-11\">[Commonwealth]: Is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-12\">[Brightwell]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-13\">[Commonwealth]: Do you think that the fact that Miss Scott is charged means she did do it or do you think it\u2019s just possible that she did it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-14\">[Brightwell]: It\u2019s possible that she did it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-15\">[Commonwealth]: Okay, thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-16\">[Defense Counsel]: You\u2019re saying you have a problem with the presumption of innocence because she is charged\u2014 because of what that sheriff told you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-17\">[Brightwell]: Say that again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-18\">[Defense Counsel]: You would have a problem with the presumption of innocence because of what\u2014because of what that sheriff told you about the charges?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-19\">[Brightwell]: Probably.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-20\">[Defense Counsel]: Probably. I don\u2019t have any other questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-21\">[Commonwealth]: Sir, if the Judge instructed you as to what the law is\u2014I mean, he tells you that the Defendant is presumed to be innocent under the law, are you able to follow that law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>[Brightwell]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Brightwell was then returned to the venire.- After hearing argument on the matter, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-6\">The Court\u2019s going to deny the motion to strike this individual. He said that there was a possibility the person was guilty. And he also said that he would be able to follow the Judge\u2019s instruction on the law. So the issue is not just whether or not the person has a bias but whether or not the person\u2019s willing to set aside that bias and follow the judge\u2019s instructions with regard to the law. So I note your exception.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">\u25a0 Scott was subsequently found guilty of all three counts and sentenced to twenty-five years in prison. Scott appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">A defendant has \u201ca fundamental right to a trial by an impartial jury.\u201d <em>McGill v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 237, 241, 391 S.E.2d 597, 599 (1990). In recognition of this fundamental right, we have recognized that \u201ca prospective juror \u2018must be able to give [the accused] a fair and impartial trial. Upon this point nothing should be left to inference or doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bradbury v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 176, 180, 578 S.E.2d 93, 95 (2003) (quoting <em>Wright v. Commonwealth, </em>73 Va. (32 Gratt.) 941, 943 (1879)). Thus, \u201c[a] prospective juror who is biased, prejudiced, or who \u2018persists in a misapprehension of law that will render him incapable of abiding the court\u2019s instructions and applying the law, must be excluded for cause\u2019 because such a juror cannot be impartial.\u201d <em>Griffin v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 619, 621, 454 S.E.2d 363, 364 (1995) (quoting <em>Sizemore v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 208, 211, 397 S.E.2d 408, 410 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">\u201cTrial courts, as the guardians of this fundamental right, have the duty to procure an impartial jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he test of impartiality is whether the venireperson can lay aside the preconceived views and render a verdict based solely on the law and evidence presented at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]rial courts must examine the \u2018the nature and strength of the opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>formed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hopson v. Commonwealth, </em>52 Va.App. 144, 152, 662 S.E.2d 88, 92 (2008) (quoting <em>Briley v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 180, 185, 279 S.E.2d 151, 154 (1981)). A juror who entertains an \u201copinion of that fixed character which repels the presumption of innocence in a criminal case, and in whose mind the accused stands condemned already\u201d must be disqualified. <em>Justus v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 971, 976, 266 S.E.2d 87, 91 (1980) (citation omitted). Indeed, if there is <em>any </em>reasonable doubt as to whether a juror is impartial, \u201cthat doubt is sufficient to insure his exclusion.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>73 Va. (32 Gratt.) at 943.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">\u201cWhether a juror is impartial is a pure question of historical fact.\u201d <em>David v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 77, 81, 493 S.E.2d 379, 381 (1997). We recognize that \u201cthe trial judge is in a unique position to observe the demeanor of the challenged juror and to evaluate all aspects of her testimony.\u201d <em>Educational Books, Inc. v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 384, 390, 349 S.E.2d 903, 908 (1986). As such, the decision to exclude or retain a potential juror \u201crests within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent manifest error.\u201d <em>McGill, </em>10 Va.App. at 242, 391 S.E.2d at 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">However,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-6\">Determination of a prospective juror\u2019s impartiality differs from the usual factual finding. It is not the determination of a past fact; instead, it is a determination of [the prospective juror\u2019s] present state of mind, a prediction of future behavior. For this reason, the method of the <em>voir dire </em>examination may affect the trial court\u2019s ability to determine a prospective juror\u2019s impartiality.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-7\"><em>Id. </em>Thus, in reviewing the decision of the trial court, we must consider not only a juror\u2019s responses during <em>voir dire </em>but also the methodology used to obtain those responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">Our jurisprudence is clear that we review \u201c[j]urors\u2019 responses during the entire <em>voir dire </em>... to determine their impartiality to the case.\u201d <em>Bradbury, </em>40 Va.App. at 180, 578 S.E.2d at 95 (citing <em>Vinson v. Commonwealth, </em>258 Va. 459, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>467-68, 522 S.E.2d 170, 176 (1999)). Examining the content of Brightwell\u2019s <em>voir dire, </em>it is clear that Brightwell held an opinion of a fixed character that repelled the presumption of Scott\u2019s innocence. Brightwell initially acknowledged that he had a preconceived notion that \u201cif you go to court ... you\u2019re pretty much guilty.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> During the lengthy question and answer period that followed, Brightwell recognized that \u201ceveryone who comes into court is presumed to be innocent under the law,\u201d but conceded that he still would \u201cprobably\u201d have a problem with the presumption of Scott\u2019s innocence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At this point, Brightwell should have been precluded from serving on the jury unless he was properly rehabilitated.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Rehabilitation of a juror who has demonstrated bias requires more than just an assertion by the juror that he can be impartial. <em>See Gosling v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 642, 646, 876 S.E.2d 541, 544 (1989) (\u201cA [potential] juror\u2019s subsequent statement that he can give the defendant a fair and impartial trial ... is not dispositive when preceded by positive, unequivocal testimony of bias.\u201d). Proper rehabilitation begins by instructing the potential juror on the correct principle of the law (in this case, the presumption of inno<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>cence). <em>Bradbury, </em>40 Va.App. at 183, 578 S.E.2d at 96. Once the potential juror acknowledges that he can apply this principle of law, the juror must then be allowed to reconcile it with his previous views. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn this fashion, the juror could be rehabilitated using [his] own words to clarify [his] views rather than responding to the suggestions and influence of others.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">Furthermore, \u201c[p]roof of a prospective juror\u2019s impartiality \u2018should come from him and not be based on his mere assent to persuasive suggestions.\u2019 \u201d <em>McGill, </em>10 Va.App. at 242, 391 S.E.2d at 600 (quoting <em>Breeden v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 297, 300, 227 S.E.2d 734, 736 (1976)). \u201cUsing or permitting the use of leading questions, those which suggest a desired answer, in the <em>voir dire </em>of a prospective juror may taint the reliability of the juror\u2019s responses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cMere assent to ... counsel\u2019s leading inquiry, is not enough to rehabilitate a prospective juror who has initially demonstrated a prejudice or partial predisposition.\u201d <em>Griffin, </em>19 Va.App. at 625, 454 S.E.2d at 366. \u201cWhen asked by the court, a suggestive question produces an even more unreliable response,\u201d because of a juror\u2019s \u201cdesire to \u2018say the right thing\u2019 or to please the authoritative figure of the judge.\u201d <em>McGill, </em>10 Va.App. at 242, 391 S.E.2d at 600. It logically follows that a suggestive question invoking the authority of the trial court would result in a similarly unreliable response, as the question would necessarily invoke the juror\u2019s desire to please the authoritative figure of the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The Commonwealth\u2019s efforts to rehabilitate Brightwell in this case do little to assuage our concern about his lack of impartiality. The Commonwealth\u2019s single rehabilitative question, as phrased, allowed for only two possible responses: \u201cYes, I will follow the law\u201d or \u201cNo, I will not follow the law.\u201d By invoking the authority of the trial court, the Commonwealth clearly relied upon Brightwell\u2019s desire to say the right thing, and thus guaranteed that he would answer in the affirmative. While there is nothing wrong with the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>itself,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it cannot, without more, serve to fully rehabilitate Brightwell. Nothing in Brightwell\u2019s affirmative answer to this question explains how he resolved the contradiction between his professed problem with the presumption of innocence and his ability to follow the law. Accordingly, Brightwell should have been struck for cause as he was not shown to be free from prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">As we find the trial court should have granted Scott\u2019s motion to strike potential juror Brightwell for cause and the failure to strike was inherently prejudicial, we do not consider Scott\u2019s other assignments of error. <em>See DeHart v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 213, 216, 456 S.E.2d 133, 134 (1995) (holding that the \u201cdenial of [the] right to a jury chosen from a statutorily prescribed panel of twenty free from exception cannot be deemed non-prejudicial\u201d). For the foregoing reasons, we reverse Scott\u2019s convictions and remand the case for retrial, should the Commonwealth be so inclined.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b314-14\">. Scott further contends that the trial court erred by allowing an expert witness for the Commonwealth to provide testimony on the ultimate issue of fact before the jury and by denying her motion for a mistrial due to comments made by the Commonwealth during its closing argument. However, for reasons explained below, we need not address these arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b314-15\">. We cite only those facts necessary to the analysis of the <em>voir dire </em>issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b318-6\">. We recognize that he did attempt to qualify the statement by limiting it to the county where he teaches. However, his later responses on this matter contained no such qualifications.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b318-7\">. Brightwell also stated that Scott was possibly and/or potentially guilty. Without more, these equivocal statements about possible or potential guilt would not concern us. The presumption of innocence is not mutually exclusive of a defendant's potential guilt; indeed, the fact that a person is presumed innocent <em>until </em>proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt demonstrates that a person may be both presumed innocent and potentially guilty at the same time. However, when viewed in the context of Brightwell\u2019s entire <em>voir dire, </em>these statements serve to further indicate that Brightwell was not impartial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b318-8\">. We note that this case differs from other cases such as <em>Hopson, </em>52 Va.App. at 156-57, 662 S.E.2d at 94-95, where the challenged venire members were confused by misleading questions during <em>voir dire </em>and therefore did not require rehabilitation. Here, there is no evidence that the relevant questions were confusing or misleading.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b320-15\">. Indeed, we recognize that this question properly instructs Brightwell on the correct principle of law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
