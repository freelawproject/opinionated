On appeal, appellant raises the following assignments of error: (1) the trial court erred in allowing a witness to testify regarding a victim\u2019s out-of-court statements under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule; (2) the trial court erred in allowing a witness to testify regarding a victim\u2019s out-of-court statements, on the grounds that this ruling violated appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confront his accuser; and (3) the trial court erred in denying appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>lant\u2019s motion for a mistrial, on the grounds that a juror fell asleep during the cross-examination of one of the victims. Upon review of the record, we find no error and affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">\u201cOn appeal, \u2018we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Archer v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 1, 11, 492 S.E.2d 826, 881 (1997) (quoting <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">On September 1, 2009, sixteen-year-old Quamon Wilson (Wilson) was \u201changing out\u201d with his cousin, Courtney Murray (Murray),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> at Bowling Park Elementary School. The cousins had been sitting on the swings and talking for about an hour when Wilson noticed appellant, who was also sixteen years old at the time, an individual known as \u201cQuan,\u201d and a boy that Wilson did not know standing together on the playground. Appellant approached Wilson and Murray and asked them where they were from. Appellant then told the cousins that Quan wanted to fight Wilson. To that end, appellant claimed Quan had called Wilson a \u201cbitch.\u201d Wilson responded that he did not want to fight and that \u201cthere was no reason to fight him.\u201d Thereafter, Quan approached appellant, Wilson, and Murray. Wilson, who knew Quan from having previously lived in the same neighborhood as him, asked Quan why he had called him a \u201cbitch.\u201d Quan denied calling Wilson any name.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">Appellant then backed away, pulled a \u201c9 millimeter\u201d black, automatic handgun from his waistband, pointed it at Wilson and Murray, and asked Wilson and Murray, \u201cWhat you got?\u201d When Wilson and Murray stated that they did not have anything, appellant told Wilson \u201cto stop playing or he [was] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>going to hit [Wilson] in the head.\u201d Making good on the threat, appellant walked behind Wilson and hit him on the left side of his head with the gun. The impact left a \u201cknot that was swollen\u201d on Wilson\u2019s head.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Appellant backed away from Wilson and Murray, still pointing the gun at them. Fearful that appellant was planning on shooting him, Wilson attempted to hide behind the playground equipment. Appellant, still pointing the gun at the cousins and accompanied by Quan and the unidentified boy, then ran away from Wilson and Murray.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Scared, Wilson and Murray left the playground and ran to Wilson\u2019s house. At trial, Wilson estimated that it took \u201cfive, almost ten minutes\u201d for the cousins to reach Wilson\u2019s home. When the cousins arrived, they \u201crushed in\u201d and told Wilson\u2019s father, John Adams (Adams), what had occurred. After listening to the boys, Adams decided that he wanted to talk to appellant and the other boys involved in the incident. He, Wilson, and Murray drove in Adams\u2019 truck \u201caround the community\u201d until Murray spotted appellant and the other boys standing on the porch of a house on East Virginia Beach Boulevard. Adams pulled into a driveway adjacent to the house, opened his car door, and yelled to appellant, asking appellant to speak with him. Rather than replying, appellant and his companions ran away. Adams then called 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Norfolk Police Officer J. Williams was dispatched in response to Adams\u2019 call. Upon arrival, he spoke with Wilson, who reported what had occurred at the playground. Officer Williams could clearly see a \u201cswollen lump\u201d on Wilson\u2019s head, which appeared to be the result of a recent injury. After Wilson identified appellant as his attacker, Officer Williams detained appellant. Officer Williams did not recover a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">Appellant was charged with and eventually indicted on two counts of attempted robbery and two counts of use of a firearm in the commission of an attempted robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">Appellant\u2019s two-day jury trial began on January 28, 2010. On behalf of the Commonwealth, Wilson testified regarding the events at the playground and his family\u2019s subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>successful efforts to locate appellant. At the conclusion of appellant\u2019s cross-examination of Wilson, the Commonwealth stated that it wished to conduct a redirect examination, but that it would like to bring a matter to the trial court\u2019s attention outside the presence of the jury. Once the trial court excused the jury from the courtroom, the following dialogue occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-5\">[COMMONWEALTH]: ... I would ask the Court to admonish the jury to let us know if they need a break. The juror sitting on the very end here appears to be nodding off and [the Commonwealth\u2019s co-counsel] believes that she heard him snoring, which would create an issue since we don\u2019t have an alternate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-6\">H4 \"I* \u00abi*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-7\">THE COURT: All right. Well, with respect to the attentiveness of jurors, it\u2019s always an issue. We will certainly remind them, not with any specific direction to any particular juror, but we\u2019ll remind all jurors of what their oath is and that they are obligated to pay attention. If it continues to be an issue, we may have to deal with it specifically, but for right now, I\u2019m satisfied it\u2019s going to be dealt with as just a generalized admonition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">Appellant raised no objection to the trial court\u2019s resolution of the circumstances and requested no other instruction or relief. When the jury returned, the trial court admonished the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-9\">[L]adies and gentlemen of the jury, it\u2019s very important that we all pay very careful attention to everything that\u2019s being said. I know that you\u2019ve had a long day already, but I do need to remind you to pay very close attention. Sometimes our attention can wane or be distracted and we can be preoccupied, but the trial is very important to those parties involved in it. And so, we need to make sure that everybody is paying very close attention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">Once again, appellant neither raised an objection nor requested another instruction or alternative relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>The Commonwealth subsequently called Adams to testify. In response to the Commonwealth\u2019s question regarding the date of the offense, September 1, 2009, Adams testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6y\">September 1st, I had came [sic] home from work and I wasn\u2019t in the house but a couple minutes. So, I try to wind down, put my keys, and cell phone down, and everything. My nephew was visiting. At that point he had come in and my son was with him. They rushed in the house and told me\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">At this time, appellant\u2019s trial counsel interposed a hearsay objection. The following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I would object on the grounds of hearsay\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-6\">[COMMONWEALTH]: Your Honor, at this point it\u2019s not being offered for the truth of the matter, and I think possibly it can be established as an excited utterance as exception to hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, with regard to excited utterance, this is happening, at minimum, ten minutes and at least one mile away from something else. I don\u2019t know why the individuals would remain so excited that the statement isn\u2019t responsive to something they are seeing immediately.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-8\">THE COURT: Having heard the testimony of the previous witness, I\u2019m going to overrule your objection. You may answer the question, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-9\">[COMMONWEALTH]: You were telling us what happened when your son and nephew came into the house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-10\">[ADAMS]: As I was mentioning, my son and my nephew had come in the house and they had mentioned that they had been at Bowling Park and they had some altercation with some young guys.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-11\">[COMMONWEALTH]: Now, when you say \u201caltercation,\u201d what did they tell you happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-12\">[ADAMS]: Specifically, he said that one of the guys had a pistol, and he had been hit upside the head, and they had been robbed, and this type of nature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>[COMMONWEALTH]: Who had been hit by the gun? [ADAMS]: My son Quamon Wilson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-4\">[COMMONWEALTH]: Did you have a chance to look at your son when he came in the house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-5\">[ADAMS]: I didn\u2019t examine him as far as looking at his head for any injuries or anything because at that point I didn\u2019t notice any type of blood or anything. If he had any kind of injuries, they were, I guess internal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-6\">[COMMONWEALTH]: After they told you about that, what did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-7\">[ADAMS]: Well, just being a parent, my instinct was to go and look for these guys, because they said they were in this location. And so we all got in my truck, my Jeep, and we rode around to the site, the playground where they were at, all this time, apparently, where this happened and we went around, just drove around the community there until, you know, we ran\u2014I drove upon these young guys about a quarter\u2014a couple blocks away from the playground where this all started at.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-8\">[COMMONWEALTH]: So, who is in the car with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-9\">[ADAMS]: At this point, myself, my son, and my nephew Courtney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-10\">[COMMONWEALTH]: When you got to the house, what did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-11\">[ADAMS]: We arrived to [sic] the house. At that point, I had asked my son, I said, \u201cThese guys on this porch look familiar to you?\u201d And they was pointing and said, \u201cYes, Daddy[\u201d]\u2014My son said, \u201cYes, Daddy, that is the guy there.\u201d And then pointed out the two or three guys that were sitting right there at this house on the porch.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-12\">Appellant\u2019s counsel offered no further objections or discussion of the context of Adams\u2019 testimony. During cross-examination of Adams, appellant\u2019s trial counsel elicited from Adams that both Wilson and Murray identified appellant as the individual who had attempted to rob them.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>At the conclusion of the first day of the two-day trial, the trial court expressly asked the parties, \u201cAnything else to be said or done today?,\u201d to which appellant\u2019s trial counsel responded, \u201cNo, Your Honor.\u201d Furthermore, the record does not reflect that either party raised any additional concerns regarding the jury during the remainder of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case and again at the conclusion of all the evidence, appellant moved to \u201cstrike the indictments\u201d on the ground that appellant had not had the opportunity to confront his accuser, Murray,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution of Virginia. The trial court denied both of appellant\u2019s motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">On the second day of the trial, January 29, 2010, the jury convicted appellant of all four of the charged offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">On March 10, 2010, appellant filed a motion requesting the trial court set aside the jury\u2019s verdict, or in the alternative, declare a mistrial. Appellant asserted that the evidence was insufficient to convict appellant and that juror misconduct entitled him to a mistrial. The trial court held a hearing on appellant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict on May 4, 2010. At the hearing, appellant\u2019s trial counsel stated that she also wished to challenge Adams\u2019 testimony under the Sixth Amendment and pursuant to <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). The trial court took appellant\u2019s challenges to Adams\u2019 testimony under advisement. It did not specifically rule on appellant\u2019s challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence and juror misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">On June 4, 2010, prior to the sentencing hearing, the trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict. In doing so, the trial court specifically held that appellant\u2019s Confrontation Clause-based challenge to Adams\u2019 testimony was not timely made; however, the trial court specifically found that even if the objection was timely made, appellant\u2019s argument was without merit because Adams\u2019 testimony was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>not testimonial. Finally, according to the trial court, assuming it was error to admit Adams\u2019 testimony, such error was harmless because Adams\u2019 testimony was cumulative.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The trial court subsequently sentenced appellant to a total of eighteen years imprisonment with ten years suspended. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">One of the tenets of Virginia\u2019s jurisprudence is that trial counsel must timely object with sufficient specificity to an alleged error at trial to preserve that error for appellate review. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18; <em>Redman v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 215, 220, 487 S.E.2d 269, 272 (1997); <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 126, 131, 380 S.E.2d 8, 10 (1989). This requirement is codified in Rule 5A:18, which, at the time of appellant\u2019s trial, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-8\">No ruling of the trial court ... will be considered as a basis for reversal unless the objection was stated together with the grounds therefor at the time of the ruling, except for good cause shown or to enable the Court of Appeals to attain the ends of justice. A mere statement that the judgment or award is contrary to the law and the evidence is not sufficient to constitute a question to be ruled upon on appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">\u201cThe laudatory purpose behind Rule 5A:18 ..., frequently referred to as the contemporaneous objection rule[], is to require that objections be promptly brought to the attention of the trial court with sufficient specificity that the alleged error can be dealt with and timely addressed and corrected when necessary.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>8 Va.App. at 131, 380 S.E.2d at 10. \u201c <em>\u2018A </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>specific, contemporaneous objection also provides the opposing party an opportunity to address an issue at a time when the course of the proceedings may be altered in response to the problem presented.\u2019 \u201d <em>Murillo-Rodriguez v. Commonwealth, </em>279 Va. 64, 79, 688 S.E.2d 199, 207 (2010) (quoting <em>Shelton v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 121, 126, 645 S.E.2d 914, 916 (2007)); <em>accord West v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 327, 337, 597 S.E.2d 274, 278 (2004) (\u201c[A] specific, contemporaneous objection gives the opposing party the opportunity to meet the objection at that stage of the proceeding.\u201d (citing <em>Weidman v. Babcock, </em>241 Va. 40, 44, 400 S.E.2d 164, 167 (1991))). When objections are timely raised, \u201corderly and efficient justice\u201d may be accomplished, for \u201c[ejrrors usually can be corrected in the trial court ... without the necessity of appeal.\u201d <em>Brown, 8 </em>Va.App. at 131, 380 S.E.2d at 10. Furthermore, when corrective action is timely made by the trial court, mistrials may also be avoided. <em>Neal v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 416, 422, 425 S.E.2d 521, 525 (1992) (citing <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 524, 530, 414 S.E.2d 401, 404 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Rule 5A:18 is not an altogether static rule in that it does provide two exceptions to the contemporaneous objection rule. This Court may invoke the \u201cgood cause\u201d or \u201cends of justice\u201d exceptions \u201cwhere error has resulted in manifest injustice.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>8 Va.App. at 131, 380 S.E.2d at 10. The Court may only invoke the \u201cgood cause\u201d exception where an appellant did not have the opportunity to object to a ruling in the trial court; however, when an appellant \u201chad the opportunity to object but elected not to do so,\u201d the exception does not apply. <em>Luck v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 827, 834, 531 S.E.2d 41, 44 (2000) (citing <em>Ohree v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 299, 308, 494 S.E.2d 484, 488 (1998)). \u201c \u2018The ends of justice exception is narrow and is to be used sparingly.\u2019\u201d <em>Bazemore v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 203, 219, 590 S.E.2d 602, 609 (2004) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting <em>Redman, </em>25 Va.App. at 220, 487 S.E.2d at 272). To invoke the \u201cends of justice\u201d exception, an appellant \u201cmust \u2018affirmatively show[ ] that a miscarriage of justice has occurred not ... that a miscarriage <em>might </em>have occurred.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 219, 590 S.E.2d at 610 (alterations in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>original) (quoting <em>Mounce v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 433, 436, 357 S.E.2d 742, 744 (1987)). To meet this burden, an appellant must \u201c \u2018affirmatively show [that] ... the error [was] clear, substantial and material.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(alterations in original) (quoting <em>Brown, </em>8 Va.App. at 132, 380 S.E.2d at 11).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">In the instant case, appellant properly preserved the first assignment of error challenging the admissibility of a witness\u2019 testimony regarding the victim\u2019s out-of-court statements under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule, but neglected under any objective review of the record to make timely objections to preserve his second and third assignments of error. For the following reasons, we affirm appellant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">A. The admission of Courtney Murray\u2019s out-of-court statements under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Appellant argues in his first assignment of error on appeal that it was error for the trial court to allow Adams to testify regarding statements attributed to Murray. Appellant argues that Murray\u2019s statements were not admissible under the excited utterance exception to the rule against hearsay, because five to ten minutes had elapsed since Murray had experienced a startling event. Additionally, appellant argues that the Commonwealth did not \u201cproffer any non-hearsay purpose for which the statement was otherwise being proffered into evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">During the trial appellant timely objected to Adams\u2019 testimony on hearsay grounds, specifically arguing in response to the Commonwealth\u2019s rejoinder that the statements were not excited utterances. Thus, this assignment of error is preserved for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">\u201cThere is no fixed rule by which the question whether the statement is admissible as an excited utterance can be decided. Resolution of the issue depends upon the circumstances of each case and \u2018rests within the sound judicial discretion and judgment of the trial court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Clark v. Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number><em>monwealth, </em>235 Va. 287, 292, 367 S.E.2d 483, 486 (1988) (quoting <em>Huffman v. Commonwealth, </em>168 Va. 668, 681, 190 S.E. 265, 271 (1937)). \u201c \u2018A statement comes within the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule and is admissible to prove the truth of the matter stated, when the statement is spontaneous and impulsive, thus guaranteeing its reliability.\u2019 \u201d <em>Esser v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 520, 525, 566 S.E.2d 876, 879 (2002) (quoting <em>Braxton v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 176, 184, 493 S.E.2d 688, 691 (1997)). \u201cThe statement must be prompted by a startling event and be made at such time and under such circumstances as to preclude the presumption that it was made as the result of deliberation.\u201d <em>Goins v. Commonwealth, </em>251 Va. 442, 460, 470 S.E.2d 114, 126 (1996) (citing <em>Goins v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 285, 287, 237 S.E.2d 136, 138 (1977)). Finally, \u201cthe declarant must have firsthand knowledge of the startling event.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing John W. Strong, <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 272 (4th ed.1992)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-5\">Whether a hearsay statement is an excited utterance is not determined solely by the lapse of time between the startling event and the declaration. Instead, the lapse of time is but one circumstance to consider when determining whether the declarant\u2019s statement was prompted by a startling event, and not the product of premeditation, reflection, or design.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A17\"><em>Braxton, </em>26 Va.App. at 184, 493 S.E.2d at 691 (citations omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted) (holding a child-witness\u2019 hearsay statement was admissible under the excited utterance exception when there had been an undetermined period of time of up to twelve hours between the startling event and the child-witness\u2019 statement). The distance the declarant travels between the location of the startling event and where he actually speaks is also not conclusive. <em>Clark, </em>235 Va. at 292, 367 S.E.2d at 486 (citing <em>Upton v. Commonwealth, </em>172 Va. 654, 657, 2 S.E.2d 337, 339 (1939)) (holding a victim\u2019s hearsay statement, which he made after walking 492 feet away from the location where he received a mortal wound, was admissible). Additionally, the \u201cphysical condition and emotional stability\u201d of the declarant are factors that \u201cmust be considered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 293, 367 S.E.2d at 486. In summary, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>\u201c[t]he test is whether the statement is the transaction speaking through the declarant or the declarant speaking about the transaction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 292, 367 S.E.2d at 486 (citing <em>Upton, </em>172 Va. at 657-58, 2 S.E.2d at 339).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Prehminarily, we must note that in the context of this issue on appeal, appellant challenges the admission of only Murray\u2019s out-of-court statements. Accordingly, we need examine only those statements that were attributed to Murray during Adams\u2019 testimony. Rule 5A:12(c)(l)(i) (\u201cOnly assignments of error assigned in the petition for appeal will be noticed by this Court.\u201d). In this regard, Adams testified that Murray and his son entered Adams\u2019 home, and <em>\u201cthey </em>had mentioned that they had been at Bowling Park and they had some altercation with some young guys.\u201d (Emphasis added). Thereafter, Adams testified, \u201cSpecifically, he said that one of the guys had a pistol, and he had been hit upside the head, and they had been robbed, and this type of nature.\u201d Because Adams did not refer to the speaker by name, it is not clear to whom Adams was referring when he used the pronoun \u201che\u201d to identify the speaker.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Subsequently, Adams discussed how he, Wilson, and Murray attempted to find appellant.

Adams testified that both Wilson and Murray informed him of the \u201caltercation\u201d and that both boys identified appellant as the perpetrator. While it is not clear from Adams\u2019 testimony who told him the specific details of the attempted robbery and subsequent assault, Wilson testified to substantially the same facts during his direct examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>In any event, the totality of the circumstances surrounding the statements (notwithstanding who may have actually made the statements) satisfies the requirements of the excited utterance exception. The record contains sufficient evidence to establish that Wilson and Murray were still acting under the agitation of the startling event, which had occurred minutes prior to their arrival at Adams\u2019 home. The boys had run directly to Adams\u2019 home after appellant assaulted Wilson and pointed his gun at both of the teenage boys. After \u201crush[ing] in\u201d to Adams\u2019 home, they immediately told Adams what had transpired. The statements were not \u201cthe product of premeditation, reflection, or design.\u201d Based on these circumstances, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">Moreover, assuming it was error to admit the challenged testimony, this error constituted nonconstitutional harmless error, for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-5\">\u201c[i]f, when all is said and done, the conviction is sure that the error did not influence the jury, or had but slight effect, the verdict and the judgment should stand----But if one cannot say, with fair assurance, after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error, it is impossible to conclude that substantial rights were not affected____If so, or if one is left in grave doubt, the conviction cannot stand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-10\"><em>Adams v.

Additionally, in situations where \u201cthe evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt is not overwhelming, if the evidence admitted in error was merely cumulative of other, undisputed evidence, we may still conclude that the error did not affect the verdict.\u201d <em>Ferguson v.

We find that even if the statements are properly attributed to Murray, the evidence of Murray\u2019s statements was cumulative because Wilson testified to substantially the same facts <em>and </em>the statements that Adams may have attributed to Murray were the same as those that he attributed to Wilson, which appellant did not challenge on appeal. Therefore, we can say with fair assurance that appellant had a fan-trial and the verdict and the judgment were not substantially affected by the admission of Murray\u2019s out-of-court statements. <em>See Adams v.

The admission of Courtney Murray\u2019s out-of-court statements pursuant to the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">Appellant next argues on appeal that the trial court erred in allowing Adams to testify regarding Murray\u2019s out-of-court statements because they violated appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confront his accusers. At trial, appellant failed to raise any sort of constitutional argument or Sixth Amendment challenge to Adams\u2019 testimony regarding Murray\u2019s out-of-court statements during Adams\u2019 testimony. Instead, appellant argued during both the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence and the conclusion of all the evidence that the trial court should \u201cstrike the charges\u201d against appellant because appellant had not been afforded the right to confront Murray pursuant to the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution of Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">\u201c \u2018Rule 5A:18 applies to bar even constitutional claims.\u2019 \u201d <em>Farnsworth v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 490, 500, 599 S.E.2d 482, 487 (2004) (quoting <em>Ohree, </em>26 Va.App. at 308, 494 S.E.2d at 488), <em>aff'd, </em>270 Va. 1, 613 S.E.2d 459 (2005). The Commonwealth argues that appellant waived appellate review of this assignment of error under Rule 5A:18 because appellant failed to make a specific and timely objection during Adams\u2019 testimony. We agree and hold that appellant\u2019s failure to object during Adams\u2019 testimony constituted a waiver. While appellant timely objected to Murray\u2019s out-of-court statements on hearsay grounds, that objection did not preserve for appellate consideration the question of whether appellant\u2019s right to confront his accuser was violated. <em>See W. Alexandria Prop., Inc. v. First Va. Mortg. and Real Estate Inv.

Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 163, 167, 348 S.E.2d 423, 426 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">Appellant argues that he properly preserved the assignment of error through his motions to strike. We disagree. The Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia and Virginia\u2019s jurisprudence reinforce the maxim that <em>motions to strike the evidence are not the proper vehicles for raising constitutional challenges to the admissibility of hearsay evidence. </em>Motions to strike the evidence challenge \u201cthe evidence ... as a matter of law to sustain a conviction.\u201d Rule 3A:15(a). \u201cThe office of a motion to strike the evidence ... is to challenge the sufficiency, not the admissibility, of the evidence.\u201d <em>Poole v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 258, 260, 176 S.E.2d 821, 823 (1970). Therefore, \u201c[a] litigant may not, in a motion to strike, raise for the first time a question of admissibility of evidence.\u201d <em>Woodson v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 285, 288, 176 S.E.2d 818, 821 (1970). Thus, appellant\u2019s motions to strike failed to preserve the issue for appellate review pursuant to Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Appellant asks that if this Court finds he did not timely note his objection, that this Court consider his assignment of error under the \u201cends of justice\u201d exception to Rule 5A:18. As noted previously, to invoke the \u201cends of justice\u201d exception, an appellant \u201cmust \u2018affirmatively show[] that a miscarriage of justice has occurred not ... that a miscarriage <em>might </em>have occurred.\u2019\u201d <em>Bazemore, </em>42 Va.App. at 219, 590 S.E.2d at 610 (alterations in original) (quoting <em>Mounce, 4 </em>Va.App. at 436, 357 S.E.2d at 744). \u201cIn examining a case for miscarriage of justice, we ... determine whether the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>contains affirmative evidence of innocence or lack of criminal offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tooke v.

Commonwealth, </em>241 Va. 244, 251, 402 S.E.2d 678, 681 (1991) (reversing Jimenez\u2019s conviction and finding Jimenez was convicted of a non-offense when the granted jury instruction omitted some essential elements of the offense and no evidence was produced relating to those elements).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Because appellant failed to show that a miscarriage of justice occurred, we decline to apply the \u201cends of justice\u201d exception to Rule 5A:18. <em>Bazemore, </em>42 Va.App. at 224, 590 S.E.2d at 612.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">C. The trial court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s motion for a mistrial based on a juror\u2019s alleged misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">Finally, appellant argues that the trial court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion for a mistrial on the grounds that a juror allegedly fell asleep during the testimony of Wilson, the Commonwealth\u2019s first witness. Appellant argues that juror inattentiveness is a form of juror misconduct and the trial court\u2019s failure to determine whether the juror\u2019s misconduct prejudiced appellant\u2019s case was an abuse of discretion. Again, we hold that appellant failed to properly preserve this assignment of error pursuant to Rule 5A:18.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>At the close of appellant\u2019s cross-examination of Wilson, <em>the Commonwealth </em>alerted the trial court to the possibility that one of the jurors had fallen asleep. In response, the trial court admonished the entire jury that it needed to \u201cpay very careful attention to everything that\u2019s being said.\u201d Not once did appellant raise any objection or request any other instruction or relief from the trial court despite at least two separate invitations from the trial court to do so. The record does not reflect that either appellant or the Commonwealth raised any additional concerns regarding any juror during the remainder of the trial. It was not until appellant had been convicted of all four charged offenses that appellant moved for a mistrial based on the juror\u2019s alleged misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">The Supreme Court of Virginia has \u201crepeatedly held that if a defendant wishes to take advantage on appeal of some incident he regards as objectionable enough to warrant a mistrial, he must make his motion timely or else be deemed to have waived his objection.\u201d <em>Yeatts v. Commonwealth, </em>242 Va. 121, 137, 410 S.E.2d 254, 264 (1991) (citing <em>Cheng v. Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 26, 38-39, 393 S.E.2d 599, 605-06 (1990); <em>Price v. Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 113, 121, 189 S.E.2d 324, 330 (1972); <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>208 Va. 512, 518-19, 158 S.E.2d 663, 668-69 (1968); <em>Russo v. Commonwealth, </em>207 Va. 251, 257, 148 S.E.2d 820, 825 (1966)). More particularly, when a defendant learns of alleged juror misconduct during the trial, but fails to move for a mistrial at the time the misconduct is discovered, the defendant waives appellate review of the juror\u2019s misconduct. <em>Riner v. Commonwealth, </em>268 Va. 296, 318, 601 S.E.2d 555, 567 (2004) (citing Rule 5:25, the Rule of the Virginia Supreme Court that articulates the contemporaneous objection rule); <em>see also Yeatts, </em>242 Va. at 137, 410 S.E.2d at 264 (holding a motion for mistrial was untimely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>when it was made the day after the alleged objectionable incident occurred).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">Appellant argues that pursuant to <em>Mayo v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 335, 391 S.E.2d 888 (1990), this Court should disregard his failure to timely object to the trial court\u2019s handling of the allegedly sleeping juror and consider whether it was error for the trial court to deny his motion for mistrial. In <em>Mayo, </em>the defendant asserted that the trial court erred by failing to remove a juror who was allegedly sleeping, because the sleeping juror denied the defendant his right to a fair and competent jury. 10 Va.App. at 337, 391 S.E.2d at 890. During the presentation of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, the trial court <em>sua sponte </em>instructed the jury members to keep then-eyes open. <em>Id. </em>The record did not reflect that the defendant ever requested the juror\u2019s removal, and the trial court held that because the defendant failed to \u201crequest that the juror be removed at the time when he was allegedly sleeping[,] ... his objection was not timely.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The precise holding in <em>Mayo </em>reiterates Virginia\u2019s longstanding rule requiring a contemporaneous objection when a defendant demands a mistrial. <em>See, e.g., Yeatts, </em>242 Va. at 137, 410 S.E.2d at 264; <em>Cheng, </em>240 Va. at 38-39, 393 S.E.2d at 605-06; <em>Price, </em>213 Va. at 121, 189 S.E.2d at 330; <em>Brown, </em>208 Va. at 518-19, 158 S.E.2d at 668-69; <em>Russo, </em>207 Va. at 257, 148 S.E.2d at 825. However, appellant argues that the <em>Mayo </em>Court\u2019s decision to comment on whether the juror was actually asleep during the trial required the trial court to investigate the alleged juror misconduct in the instant case. To the contrary, the <em>Mayo </em>Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-6\">Furthermore, we cannot conclude from the record that the juror was, in fact, asleep or that the court abused its discretion in failing to remove him. The record reflects that the court did not agree with defense counsel\u2019s observations that the juror appeared to be asleep during most of the trial. Defense counsel conceded at oral argument that just because a juror\u2019s eyes were closed did not mean that the juror was inattentive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>10 Va.App. at 337, 391 S.E.2d at 890. From this reference appellant contends that this Court in <em>Mayo </em>based its decision to affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction not only on the defendant\u2019s failure to comply with the contemporaneous objection rule, but also on the trial court\u2019s finding that the juror in <em>Mayo </em>was not actually asleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">We disagree. While the <em>Mayo </em>Court suggested a supplementary rationale as to why the trial court\u2019s decision to deny the defendant\u2019s request for mistrial was not error, the defendant\u2019s failure to timely object standing alone was deemed sufficient to deny the defendant\u2019s request for a mistrial. <em>Id. </em>Specifically, the <em>Mayo </em>Court found, \u201cMayo did not request that the juror be removed at the time when he allegedly was sleeping. Thus, his objection was not timely.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Also instructive is this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Green v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 394, 402-03, 494 S.E.2d 888, 891 (1998), a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>case involving a post-trial challenge to a juror\u2019s alleged impartiality, which was brought to counsel\u2019s attention during the <em>voir dire </em>portion of the trial. Recognizing trial tactics associated with the presentation of any trial, this Court noted that the record in <em>Green </em>disclosed that the defendant therein made no effort to pursue relief when the issue first arose during trial. This Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-5\">\u201cTo permit prisoners to avail themselves, after verdict, of pre-existing objections to the competency of jurors, as a matter of right, would not only be unreasonable, but most mischievous in its consequences----A prisoner knowing, or <em>willfully remaining ignorant </em>of the incompetency of a juror, would take the chances of a favorable verdict ...; and if the verdict should be adverse, would ... [seek to] avoid its effect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 402, 494 S.E.2d at 892 (quoting <em>Allen v. Commonwealth, </em>122 Va. 834, 845-46, 94 S.E. 783, 787 (1918)). The <em>Green </em>Court concluded that the \u201cdefendant\u2019s \u2018conscious decision to find out what the jury was going to do ... in hopes that [it] might acquit\u2019 constituted a waiver of his right to further inquiry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 403, 494 S.E.2d at 892 (quoting <em>Gray v. Hutto, </em>648 F.2d 210, 211 (4th Cir.1981)) (citing <em>United States v. Breit, </em>712 F.2d 81, 82 (4th Cir.1983); <em>Robertson v. Metro. Wash.

Instead, he chose to wait until the jury had delivered its verdict of guilty and the trial court had discharged the jury to raise his objection to the juror\u2019s conduct. We choose not to speculate as to the reasons for appellant\u2019s forbearance in objecting to the juror\u2019s alleged inattentiveness; but we hold that appellant\u2019s failure to object or request relief when the juror\u2019s alleged inattention was brought to his attention at trial constituted both a failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>timely demand a mistrial, <em>see Yeatts, </em>242 Va. at 137, 410 S.E.2d at 264; <em>Cheng, </em>240 Va. at 38-39, 393 S.E.2d at 605-06; <em>Price, </em>213 Va. at 121, 189 S.E.2d at 330; <em>Brown, </em>208 Va. at 518-19, 158 S.E.2d at 668-69; <em>Russo, </em>207 Va. at 257, 148 S.E.2d at 825, and a failure to preserve the assignment error for appellate review pursuant to Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Additionally, for the reasons stated in Section 11(B), we find no reason to apply the \u201cends of justice\u201d exception to Rule 5A:18 as requested by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">III.

As appellant failed to preserve this question for appellate review, we refrain from addressing this question in the instant case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b724-6\">. We note that the instant case and <em>Mayo </em>are distinguishable from those cases where defendants timely object at trial to alleged juror misconduct that is discovered during the trial. In those circumstances, the trial court must conduct an investigation to \u201cdetermine whether such misconduct probably resulted in prejudice. And the burden of establishing that probability is upon the party moving for a mistrial.\u201d <em>Robertson v. Metro. Wash. Airport Auth., </em>249 Va. 72, 76, 452 S.E.2d 845, 847 (1995) (citing <em>Haddad v. Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 325, 330, 329 S.E.2d 17, 20 (1985)). The instant case and <em>Mayo </em>are also different from those situations where the alleged misconduct is discovered after the jury is discharged. Under those circumstances, if \"the allegations are sufficient to require investigation, a trial court abuses its discretion in ruling upon a motion for a mistrial without investigating the alleged misconduct to ascertain whether it prejudiced the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Moorefield, </em>231 Va. 260, 266-67, 343 S.E.2d 329, 333-34 (1986); <em>Kearns </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>197 Va. 736, 743, 91 S.E.2d 648, 653 (1956)). When an investigation is conducted by the trial court, if the defendant\u2019s rights are prejudiced, the trial court abuses its discretion by failing to grant the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial. <em>Haddad, </em>229 Va. at 330, 329 S.E.2d at 20 (citing <em>Hood v. Kelly, </em>285 Ala. 337, 231 So.2d 901, 903 (1970); <em>State v. Allen, 4 </em>Kan.App.2d 534, 609 P.2d 219, 223 (1980); <em>State v. Day, </em>414 So.2d 349, 350 (La.1982); <em>State v.
