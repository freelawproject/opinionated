On appeal, appellant argues that the trial court committed manifest error when it denied his motion to exclude all but seven of the remaining prospective jurors during <em>voir dire. </em>Disagreeing with appellant\u2019s argument, we affirm the convictions for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">At the outset of <em>voir dire, </em>the trial court asked the prospective jurors several questions. Their responses indicated that they had no personal interest in the trial, that they had obtained no information about the alleged offenses, that they had not expressed any opinion about appellant\u2019s guilt or innocence, and that they were unaware of any bias they would have toward appellant or the Commonwealth. The prospective jurors indicated that they understood that appellant was presumed innocent, that appellant did not have to produce any evidence or testify in his own behalf, and that the Commonwealth had to prove appellant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. With the exception of one prospective juror, who was excluded from the venire by the trial court, all of the prospective jurors indicated that they knew of no reason why they could not be fair and impartial to the parties or why they could not decide the case based solely on the court\u2019s legal instructions and the evidence that would be presented during the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Next, the prosecutor asked whether any of the prospective jurors, or their family members or Mends, had been sexually assaulted. Several of the prospective jurors responded in the affirmative. These persons were then asked individually whether they could render a fair and impartial verdict in light of their past experiences with sexual assaults. Some of these prospective jurors said that they could not render a fair and impartial verdict\u2014and, consequently, were stricken for cause\u2014while others indicated that they could be fair and impartial.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Appellant\u2019s trial counsel then examined the prospective jurors. Noting that some of the prospective jurors had children and others had young relatives, defense counsel asked, \u201c[WJould it be fair to say that if your cousin, child, niece, nephew, came up to you, tugged on your arm, and said that person did something to me, you would automatically believe the child?\u201d According to the trial transcript, \u201cseveral jurors\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>answered in the affirmative, while five prospective jurors indicated that they would not \u201cautomatically\u201d believe the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Rephrasing the question, defense counsel asked, \u201c[I]f an unknown child came to you and said that person did something to me, and that person happens to be an adult, would you be prone to believe that child?\u201d Again, \u201cseveral jurors\u201d answered in the affirmative. One prospective juror responded in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Defense counsel then asked, \u201c[W]ould you be partial in believing the child and even to the point where if the adult comes up and says it didn\u2019t happen that you would not believe the adult?\u201d This question received no response from the prospective jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">Finally, defense counsel asked, \u201cWould you believe the child\u2014and this is the unknown child\u2014even in a situation where the adult says it didn\u2019t happen?\u201d According to the trial transcript, \u201cseveral jurors\u201d again responded in the affirmative, while seven prospective jurors responded in the negative\u2014 Juror Numbers 36, 14, 20, 1, 8, 11, and 48. Defense counsel asked no more questions on this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">At the conclusion of <em>voir dire, </em>appellant moved to strike \u201cthe entire venire with the exception of\u2019 Juror Numbers 36, 14, 20,1, 8,11, and 48. Defense counsel explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-9\">The specific issue [is] counsel asked the question if your child came up to you and said this, would you believe the child, predominantly all of them answered yes. I asked if an unknown child came up to you and said this happened and the adult later said it did not happen, would you be prone to believe the child, and the answer, again, for the most part was yes. I asked them the followup question of would you be partial to the child, and, again, the answer was yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-10\">The only ones who answered in the negative were thirty-six, fourteen, twenty, one, eight, forty-eight, and eleven.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">The trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion, noting that the venire \u201chas stated that it can be fair and impartial, that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>clearly stated its understanding that Mr. Lovos-Rivas stands not guilty at this stage of the proceeding, [and] that the Commonwealth carries the burden of proof to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The trial court found that the venire, as it was constituted at that point in the proceeding, \u201ccan indeed be fair and impartial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Appellant argues that the trial court committed reversible error when, near the conclusion of <em>voir </em>dire, it denied his motion to strike for cause the vast majority of the remaining prospective jurors. Appellant contends that these prospective jurors (all but seven of the remaining members of the venire) \u201cdisclosed their bias in being partial toward the testimony of a child over that of an adult.\u201d Consequently, appellant claims, he was denied his right to a fair and impartial jury. <em>See Breeden v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 297, 300, 227 S.E.2d 734, 736-37 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">\u201cIt is the duty of the trial court, through the legal machinery provided for that purpose, to procure an impartial jury to try every case.\u201d <em>Salina v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 92, 93, 225 S.E.2d 199, 200 (1976). Therefore,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-8\">[t]he court and counsel for either party shall have the right to examine under oath any person who is called as a juror therein and shall have the right to ask such person or juror directly any relevant question to ascertain whether he is related to either party, or has any interest in the cause, or has expressed or formed any opinion, or is sensible of any bias or prejudice therein; and the party objecting to any juror may introduce any competent evidence in support of the objection; and if it shall appear to the court that the juror does not stand indifferent in the cause, another shall be drawn or called and placed in his stead for the trial of that case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">Code \u00a7 8.01-358; <em>see </em>Rule 3A:14. If a prospective juror \u201cdoes not stand indifferent to the cause, he is not competent. If he has any interest in the cause, or is related to either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>party, or has expressed or formed any opinion, or is sensible of any bias or prejudice, he is excluded by the law.\u201d <em>Spangler v. Ashwell, </em>116 Va. 992, 996-97, 83 S.E. 930, 931 (1914).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">However, \u201c \u2018[i]t is not uncommon to discover during <em>voir dire </em>that prospective jurors have preconceived notions, opinions, or misconceptions about the criminal justice system, criminal trials and procedure, or about the particular case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cressell v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 744, 761, 531 S.E.2d 1, 9 (2000) (quoting <em>Griffin v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 619, 621, 454 S.E.2d 363, 364 (1995)). \u201cThe opinion entertained by a juror, which disqualifies him, is an opinion of that <em>fixed character </em>which repels the presumption of innocence in a criminal case, and in whose mind the accused stands condemned already.\u201d <em>Justus v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 971, 976, 266 S.E.2d 87, 91 (1980) (citation omitted and emphasis added). Thus, \u201c \u2018the test of impartiality is whether the venireperson can lay aside the preconceived views and render a verdict based solely on the law and evidence presented at trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cressell, </em>32 Va.App. at 761, 531 S.E.2d at 9 (quoting <em>Griffin, </em>19 Va.App. at 621, 454 S.E.2d at 364).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Given that the trial court is \u201c \u2018able to see and hear each member of the venire respond to questions posed\u2019\u201d during <em>voir dire, </em>it \u201c \u2018is in a superior position to determine whether a prospective juror\u2019s responses during <em>voir dire </em>indicate that the juror would be prevented <em>from or </em>impaired in performing the duties of a juror as required by the court\u2019s instructions and the juror\u2019s oath.\u2019 \u201d <em>Townsend v. Commonwealth, </em>270 Va. 325, 329, 619 S.E.2d 71, 73 (2005) (quoting <em>Green v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 105, 115-16, 546 S.E.2d 446, 451 (2001)). Juror impartiality is a question of fact, <em>see Wainwright v. Witt, </em>469 U.S. 412, 428, 105 S.Ct. 844, 854, 83 L.Ed.2d 841 (1985), and a trial court\u2019s decision to seat a juror is entitled to great deference on appeal, <em>see McGill v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 237, 241, 391 S.E.2d 597, 600 (1990). Accordingly, the decision to retain or exclude a prospective juror \u201cwill not be disturbed on appeal unless there has been manifest error amounting to an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Barrett </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number><em>v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 823, 826, 553 S.E.2d 731, 732 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">In determining whether the trial court should have excluded the prospective jurors challenged by appellant, this Court must consider the \u201c \u2018entire <em>voir dire, </em>not just isolated portions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Juniper v. Commonwealth, </em>271 Va. 362, 401, 626 S.E.2d 383, 408 (2006) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Commonwealth, </em>267 Va. 178, 191, 590 S.E.2d 520, 527 (2004)). However, in this case, appellant relies on an isolated portion of <em>voir dire </em>in making his argument that the trial court should have excluded all but seven remaining prospective jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">During this portion of <em>voir dire, </em>defense counsel posed a few questions about the prospective jurors\u2019 inclination to believe a child\u2019s complaint of sexual abuse. Defense counsel\u2019s final question on this subject asked if the prospective jurors would believe the claim of an \u201cunknown child\u201d even if an adult denied that sexual abuse occurred. Seven prospective jurors responded in the negative to this question. The trial transcript reflects that \u201cseveral jurors\u201d responded in the affirmative. However, the transcript does not reflect that <em>all </em>of the prospective jurors who did not respond in the negative to defense counsel\u2019s question <em>actually </em>responded in the affirmative to this question. It is certainly possible\u2014and appears likely\u2014that some of the prospective jurors did not respond to this question at all, especially since <em>none </em>of the prospective jurors responded to the previous question from defense counsel. Nevertheless, after posing this final question about the \u201cunknown child,\u201d defense counsel broadly moved to strike for cause <em>all </em>of the prospective jurors (except for the seven prospective jurors who responded in the negative to this question).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">Not only does the record fail to establish that <em>all </em>of these prospective jurors actually responded in the affirmative to defense counsel\u2019s question about an unknown child, but the \u201cseveral jurors\u201d who did respond in the affirmative were not questioned any further on this subject.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, we certainly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>cannot conclude from this brief and isolated portion of <em>voir dire </em>that <em>any </em>of these prospective jurors actually held \u201ca preconceived view that is inconsistent with an ability to give [appellant] a fair and impartial trial\u201d in this case. <em>Sizemore v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 208, 211, 397 S.E.2d 408, 410 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">In <em>Mullis v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 564, 351 S.E.2d 919 (1987) , this Court addressed a similar situation. There, Mullis\u2019s trial counsel asked the following question during <em>voir dire: </em>\u201c[I]f a police officer gives some testimony and a private citizen gives testimony that differs from what the police officer said\u2014are there any of you who would believe or have a tendency to believe the police officer as opposed to the private citizen? ... This is if all things are equal.\u201d Four of the veniremen answered \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cprobably.\u201d The trial court denied Mullis\u2019s motion to strike these four jurors for cause. <em>Id. </em>at 569-70, 351 S.E.2d at 922-23. On appeal, this Court affirmed that ruling, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-7\">The general abstract question put to the jurors, without more, made it difficult for them to give a meaningful answer and is a poor indication of the manner in which they would serve as jurors and evaluate any particular police testimony. Certainly their responses did not indicate to the trial judge who heard the entire <em>voir dire </em>and observed the prospective jurors that they would give unqualified credence to the testimony of a police officer. <em>At most, their responses indicated that as an abstract proposition they would probably or would have a tendency to give some weight to the fact that a witness was a police officer in resolving credibility issues if all else were equal.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 571-72, 351 S.E.2d at 924 (emphasis added); <em>see O\u2019Dell v. Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 672, 694, 364 S.E.2d 491, 503 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>As in <em>Mullis, </em>the record here does not establish that the prospective jurors whom appellant sought to exclude held firm opinions of such \u201cfixed character which repel[] the presumption of innocence in a criminal case, and in whose mind the accused stands condemned already.\u201d <em>Justus, </em>220 Va. at 976, 266 S.E.2d at 91. At most, \u201cseveral\u201d prospective jurors in this case, like the jurors in <em>Mullis, </em>expressed agreement with an \u201cabstract proposition\u201d raised by defense counsel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Mu<em>llis, </em>3 Va.App. at 572, 351 S.E.2d at 924. The prospective jurors appellant sought to exclude perhaps indicated a tendency to believe an abstract \u201cunknown child,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but the record below simply does not reveal \u201cthe nature and strength of the opinion formed\u201d by these prospective jurors. <em>Briley v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 180, 185, 279 S.E.2d 151, 154 (1981). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>Because defense counsel did not ask any further questions of the venire as a whole or seek to question the prospective jurors individually, we cannot determine whether <em>any </em>of these prospective jurors indicated a \u201ccasual impression\u201d or held a \u201cdeep and abiding conviction.\u201d <em>Hopson v. Commonwealth, </em>52 Va.App. 144, 152, 662 S.E.2d 88, 98 (2008) (quoting <em>Briley, </em>222 Va. at 185, 279 S.E.2d at 154). Consequently, the isolated portion of <em>voir dire </em>appellant relies upon does not reveal that any of the prospective jurors were unable to decide the facts of this case fairly and impartially.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">In addition, considering the entire <em>voir dire, </em>not just isolated portions, <em>Juniper, </em>271 Va. at 401, 626 S.E.2d at 408, we note that the prospective jurors in this case indicated that they had no pre-existing opinions about appellant\u2019s guilt or innocence, that they had not obtained any information about the offenses charged against appellant, that they were not biased toward either appellant or the Commonwealth, and that they could give appellant a fair and impartial trial based on the applicable law and the facts of the case. <em>See Mullis, </em>3 Va.App. at 572, 351 S.E.2d at 924 (noting that the prospective jurors in that case made the same assurances).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Observing the venire from its \u201csuperior position\u201d for determining the fitness of each prospective juror, <em>Townsend, </em>270 Va. at 329, 619 S.E.2d at 73, the trial court found that the prospective jurors remaining on the venire at the time of appellant\u2019s motion to strike most of those jurors would \u201cindeed be fair and impartial.\u201d This finding is entitled to great deference on appeal. <em>See McGill, </em>10 Va.App. at 241, 391 S.E.2d at 600. Therefore, the trial court\u2019s decision to retain the remaining members of the venire\u2014and not just the seven prospective jurors appellant did not seek to exclude\u2014certainly did not amount to manifest error. <em>See Barrett, </em>262 Va. at 826, 553 S.E.2d at 732.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">The trial court did not commit manifest error when it denied appellant\u2019s motion to strike for cause all but seven of the remaining prospective jurors. Therefore, we will not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>disturb the trial court\u2019s decision on appeal. Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we affirm appellant\u2019s convictions for forcible sodomy and aggravated sexual battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b103-16\">. The jury acquitted appellant on a second count of forcible sodomy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b108-8\">. We note that the decision to question prospective jurors individually is within the trial court\u2019s discretion. <em>Fisher v. Commonwealth, </em>236 Va. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>403, 410-11, 374 S.E.2d 46, 50 (1988). Here, appellant's counsel never even sought the trial court\u2019s permission to question any of the prospective jurors individually.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b110-5\">. We observe that the prospective jurors' responses during <em>voir dire </em>in this case did not even raise the possibility of jurors giving \"unqualified credence to the testimony of a law enforcement officer\u201d and deciding credibility issues \"solely on that basis\u201d\u2014which was the issue addressed (and rejected) by this Court in <em>Mullis. </em>3 Va.App. at 571, 351 S.E.2d at 923. As this Court stated in <em>Mullis, </em>\"For a juror to give unqualified credence to the testimony of a law enforcement officer and to decide credibility issues solely on that basis is an impermissible basis for resolving credibility and would constitute bias.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Chavez v. United States, </em>258 F.2d 816, 819 (10th Cir.1958) (\"A defendant cannot be fairly tried by a juror who would be inclined to give unqualified credence to a law enforcement officer simply because he is an officer.\u201d). Unlike in <em>Mull\u00eds, </em>therefore, the issue raised on appeal here does not involve the grave concern of jurors allegedly giving unqualified credence to the testimony of a police officer simply because of the officer's official status.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b110-6\">. Here, the <em>voir dire </em>questions posed by appellant's counsel did not even concern <em>trial testimony. Contra Mullis, </em>3 Va.App. at 569-70, 351 S.E.2d at 922-23 (where the prospective jurors were asked if they would believe a police officer or a private citizen \"if a police officer gives some <em>testimony </em>and a private citizen gives <em>testimony </em>that differs from what the police officer said\u201d (emphasis added)). Appellant's counsel in this case asked the prospective jurors to imagine a child relative \"tuggfing] on your arm\u201d or an unknown child \"c[oming] to you\u201d\u2014situations that do not at all concern assessing the credibility of witnesses at a trial. Therefore, the venire\u2019s responses to appellant's counsel\u2019s questions shed even less light here than in <em>Mull\u00eds </em>on the question of whether members of the venire had formed fixed opinions concerning the credibility of trial witnesses that are inappropriate for jurors at a criminal trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
