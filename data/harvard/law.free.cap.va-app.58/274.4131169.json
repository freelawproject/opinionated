He maintains the trial court erroneously admitted lay witness testimony on the value of the stolen property and convicted him on insufficient evidence. We disagree with both assertions and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-12\">II. <em>Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-13\">On May 2, 2009, Richard Dabney died in his home. The same day, his brother, Jesse Dabney, found his body. Jesse entered the home that afternoon by punching through some glass on the front door. Jesse screwed a piece of plywood over the hole prior to his departure. When Jesse returned to Richard\u2019s home on May 4, he noticed the roll-up garage door was open, the walk-in garage door had pry bar markings on it, and Richard\u2019s motorcycle and rifle were missing from the garage. The house was in complete disarray, and nearly all of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>the screws Jesse used to attach plywood to the front door were missing. After calling the police, Jesse surveyed the house for additional missing items. He noticed several clear coin jars he had put in his brother\u2019s kitchen, including a few half-gallon and two gallon-sized jars, were empty. Jesse testified one of the two gallon-sized jars had been more than \u201cthree fourths\u201d full, and the other had been \u201creally full.\u201d Both gallon containers \u201chad [contained] no pennies, just quarters, dimes, and nickels.\u201d The smaller jars had contained \u201cpennies and nickels and dimes.\u201d Over Burton\u2019s objection, Jesse estimated the coins were worth over $200.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">On May 4, the same day Jesse discovered the missing items, Ryan Burton took Richard\u2019s Harley Davidson motorcycle to a friend\u2019s home to have it appraised. Burton left the motorcycle there, where police seized it two days later. Also on May 4, Burton cashed in $385.80 worth of coins through a cash machine inside a Food Lion store. He \u201cput so much change\u201d in the cash machine that a store clerk \u201chad to unjam it\u201d so he could finish inserting the coins. Two days later, Burton was arrested at his home where police recovered Dabney\u2019s missing rifle and a jacket that had belonged to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Burton was charged with grand larceny.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the conclusion of the bench trial, the court took under advisement Burton\u2019s motion to strike. The trial court ultimately found Burton guilty of grand larceny of Dabney\u2019s coins.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">III. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">A. <em>Lay testimony on the value of the stolen property</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">Burton argues on appeal that Jesse Dabney\u2019s \u201ctestimony as to the value of the coins ... was speculative and therefore inadmissible.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 5. He contends that since no evidence established <em>\u201cwhen </em>[Jesse] put those [coin] jars in the floor,\u201d it is \u201cpossible the jars had been partially or completely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>emptied\u201d well before Jesse discovered and reported them stolen. <em>Id. </em>at 5-6. Accordingly, Burton concludes, the trial court abused its discretion by admitting Jesse Dabney\u2019s speculative testimony on the coins\u2019 value.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">On appeal, admissibility of evidence arguments are governed by two principles. \u201cFirst, we do not review such decisions <em>de novo.\u201d Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 741, 753, 607 S.E.2d 738, 743, <em>adopted upon reh\u2019g en banc, </em>45 Va.App. 811, 613 S.E.2d 870 (2005). Trial courts are given broad discretion over the admissibility of evidence, and its decisions will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. <em>See Michels v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 461, 465, 624 S.E.2d 675, 678 (2006); <em>Seaton v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 739, 752, 595 S.E.2d 9, 15 (2004). Only when \u201c \u2018reasonable jurists could not differ\u2019\u201d do we say an abuse of discretion occurred. <em>Tynes v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 17, 21, 635 S.E.2d 688, 689 (2006) (quoting <em>Thomas, </em>44 Va.App. at 753, 607 S.E.2d at 743).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The second governing principle accepts that every fact \u201cthat tends to establish the probability or improbability of a fact in issue is relevant.\u201d <em>Va. Elec. &amp; Power Co. v. Dungee, </em>258 Va. 235, 260, 520 S.E.2d 164, 179 (1999) (citation omitted). In other words, \u201cevidence has relevance if it \u2018tends to cast any light\u2019 on any material point.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>44 Va.App. at 753, 607 S.E.2d at 743 (citing <em>Seaton, </em>42 Va.App. at 752, 595 S.E.2d at 15). The \u201cgeneral rule that \u2018the admissibility of evidence is within the discretion of the trial court and we will not reject the decision of the trial court unless we find an abuse of discretion\u2019 ... is particularly true with respect to an appellate \u2018challenge to the reliability of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Joyce v. Commonwealth, </em>56 Va.App. 646, 663 n. 4, 696 S.E.2d 237, 245 n. 4 (2010) (quoting <em>Midkiff v. Commonwealth, </em>280 Va. 216, 219, 694 S.E.2d 576, 578 (2010)).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">It is well established that \u201cthe opinion testimony of the owner of personal property is competent and admissible on the question of the value of such property, regardless of the owner\u2019s knowledge of property values.\u201d <em>Walls v. Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number><em>monwealth, </em>248 Va. 480, 482, 450 S.E.2d 363, 364 (1994). Opinion \u201ctestimony of a nonexpert, who is not the owner of the personal property in question, is [also] admissible upon the subject of property value, provided the witness possesses sufficient knowledge of the value of the property or has had ample opportunity for forming a correct opinion as to value.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 483, 450 S.E.2d at 365 (citing <em>Haynes v. Glenn, </em>197 Va. 746, 750, 91 S.E.2d 433, 436 (1956)); <em>see also Kerr v. Clinchfield Coal Corp., </em>169 Va. 149, 155-56, 192 S.E. 741, 743 (1937). No \u201c \u2018special training or experience is necessary for a witness to value,\u2019 \u201d familiarity with the property is all that is required. <em>Id. </em>at 155, 192 S.E. at 743 (quoting 1 Greenleaf on Evidence \u00a7 430, at 532 (16th ed. 1899)); <em>see also </em>Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 17-8 (5th ed. 1999) (\u201cFirsthand knowledge is required,\u201d for a witness to testify about value.).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Here, it is unclear who owned the coin jars: Jesse or Richard Dabney. <em>See </em>Oral Argument Audio at 5:30 (Mar. 29, 2011). Nonetheless, counsel stipulated Jesse had been the person who had filled the jars with coins and put them in Richard\u2019s house. <em>Id. </em>at 5:36. In his testimony, Jesse described the number and size of the containers, the type of coins that were housed in each, and how full each jar had been prior to the theft.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He testified there were two gallon-sized jars\u2014one \u201cthree fourths\u201d full and the other \u201creally full\u201d\u2014 containing quarters, dimes, and nickels, and several half-gallon jars containing pennies, nickels, and dimes. Valuation of currency, with its representative value denominated upon its face, or as here, by its color and size, is fundamentally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>different than valuation of any other item. By its nature, currency\u2019s valuation is not subject to injudicious estimation. Given the specific knowledge Dabney had about the size and contents of each container, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting his valuation testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">B. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Under settled principles, we review a trial court\u2019s factfinding \u201cwith the highest degree of appellate deference.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va.App. 605, 608, 633 S.E.2d 229, 231 (2006). An appellate court does not \u201cask itself whether <em>it </em>believes that the. evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>278 Va. 190, 193, 677 S.E.2d 280, 282 (2009) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-19, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (emphasis in original)). \u201cRather, the relevant question is whether <em>\u2018any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted and emphasis in original). We are \u201cnot permitted to reweigh the evidence,\u201d <em>Nusbaum v. Berlin, </em>273 Va. 385, 408, 641 S.E.2d 494, 507 (2007), because appellate courts have no authority \u201cto preside <em>de novo </em>over a second trial,\u201d <em>Haskins v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 1, 11, 602 S.E.2d 402, 407 (2004). In a bench trial, a trial judge\u2019s \u201cmajor role is the determination of fact, and with experience in fulfilling that role comes expertise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). \u201cIf reasonable jurists could disagree about the probative force of the facts, we have no authority to substitute our views for those of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Campbell v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 180, 186, 571 S.E.2d 906, 909 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Code \u00a7 18.2-95(ii) defines grand larceny as \u201csimple larceny not from the person of another of goods or chattels of the value of $200 or more.\u201d An individual commits larceny by wrongfully taking the \u201cgoods of another without the owner\u2019s consent and with the intention to permanently deprive the owner of possession of the goods.\u201d <em>Scott v. Commonwealth, </em>36 Va.App. 276, 282, 549 S.E.2d 624, 626 (2001); <em>see also Tarpley v. Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 251, 256, 542 S.E.2d 761, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>763-64 (2001); <em>Stanley v. Webber, </em>260 Va. 90, 96, 531 S.E.2d 311, 315 (2000). The value of the goods is an element of the crime that the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Walls, </em>248 Va. at 481, 450 S.E.2d at 364; <em>Knight v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 85, 88, 300 S.E.2d 600, 601 (1983); <em>Dunn v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 704, 705, 284 S.E.2d 792, 792 (1981). The face value of currency in circulation is prima facie evidence of its value.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Wright v. Commonwealth, </em>196 Va. 132, 139, 82 S.E.2d 603, 607 (1954) (interpreting substantially similar statute) (citing <em>Whalen v. Commonwealth, </em>90 Va. 544, 549, 19 S.E. 182, 183 (1894)); <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-98; <em>United States v. Kroesser, </em>731 F.2d 1509, 1517 (11th Cir.1984) (stating face value of authentic circulating currency is its <em>per se </em>value).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Burton contends the evidence was insufficient on three grounds. First, he argues no evidence proved the coins were taken without permission of the owner. Second, he claims the evidence fell short of proving the coins he cashed in at Food Lion were the same ones that went missing from the victim\u2019s house. Finally, he asserts the evidence of the coins\u2019 value was insufficient to show the missing coins were worth $200 or more.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">In this case, the evidence amply supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the missing coins were taken without permission of the owner. It \u201cis within the province of the [trier of fact] to determine what inferences are to be drawn from proved facts, provided the inferences are reasonably related to those facts.\u201d <em>Beck v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 170, 176, 342 S.E.2d 642, 645 (1986). Here, when Jesse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Dabney went to his brother\u2019s home the first time, there was no evidence of unlawful entry and the contents of the home appeared undisturbed. Richard Dabney was found deceased. When Jesse returned two days later, the house was in complete disarray. He noticed pry-bar markings on the garage door and several items missing, including a Harley Davidson motorcycle, a rifle, and the contents of several money jars. Jesse reported the stolen items to police. Considering this evidence together, the trial court reasonably concluded the coins were taken without permission of the owner, whether the owner was Jesse or Richard Dabney. The trial court could determine from Jesse\u2019s decision to file a police report that he did not give anyone permission to disturb the coins. And Richard was deceased prior to the forced entry and the coins\u2019 taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">After establishing a larceny has occurred, \u201cthe unexplained possession of recently stolen goods permits an inference of larceny by the possessor,\u201d <em>Winston v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 746, 757, 497 S.E.2d 141, 147 (1998) (citation omitted), and \u201cthrows upon the accused the burden of accounting for that possession,\u201d <em>Hope v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 381, 385, 392 S.E.2d 830, 833 (1990) <em>(en </em>banc) (citing <em>Fout v. Commonwealth, </em>199 Va. 184, 190-91, 98 S.E.2d 817, 821-22 (1957)). Standing alone, this larceny inference is sufficient to support a finding of guilt. <em>Winston, </em>26 Va.App. at 757, 497 S.E.2d at 147; <em>Lew v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 353, 358, 457 S.E.2d 392, 394-95 (1995).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">To raise this inference, the Commonwealth must show that the goods in question match the general description of the recently stolen items. <em>See Wright v. Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va.App. 743, 747, 348 S.E.2d 9, 12 (1986). \u2018When an accused is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>found in possession of goods of a type recently stolen, strict proof of identity of the goods is not required.\u201d <em>Henderson v. Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 811, 812-13, 213 S.E.2d 782, 783 (1975); <em>see also Bunch v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 423, 437, 304 S.E.2d 271, 279 (1983) (\u201cstrict proof of identity\u201d is not required). In other words, it is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AG\">\u201cnot necessary that the identity of stolen property should be invariably established by positive evidence. In many such cases identification is impracticable, and yet the circumstances may render it impossible to doubt the identity of the property, or to account for the possession of it by the accused upon any reasonable hypothesis consistent with his innocence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-5\"><em>Reese v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 671, 673, 250 S.E.2d 345, 346 (1979) (quoting <em>Gravely v. Commonwealth, </em>86 Va. 396, 402, 10 S.E. 431, 433 (1889)).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Burton claims there is no proof the coins he traded in at Food Lion were the same coins taken from Richard Dabney\u2019s home. The evidence shows that the very same day the coins were discovered missing, Burton was seen with Dabney\u2019s missing motorcycle and showed up at a Food Lion store with $385 worth of coins to cash in for paper currency. Two days later, the remainder of Dabney\u2019s missing belongings, including his rifle and jacket, were discovered in Burton\u2019s home. This evidence considered in tandem\u2014namely the time frame and that Burton had recently possessed every other item reported stolen from Dabney\u2019s home\u2014was sufficient for the trial court to conclude that the coins Burton cashed in at Food Lion were the same coins taken from Dabney\u2019s home and thus were worth more than $200.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Moreover, Burton presented to the trial court in closing argument his hypothesis that the coins he cashed in at Food Lion were not Dabney\u2019s missing coins. The trial court rejected this theory and found Burton guilty of grand larceny. While a factfinder may not arbitrarily disregard a reasonable doubt, whether \u201cthe hypothesis of innocence is reasonable is itself a \u2018question of fact,\u2019 subject to deferential appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>review.\u201d <em>Clanton v. Commonwealth, </em>53 Va.App. 561, 572-73, 673 S.E.2d 904, 910 (2009) <em>(en </em>banc) (citation omitted). \u201cMerely because defendant\u2019s theory of the case differs from that taken by the Commonwealth does not mean that every reasonable hypothesis consistent with his innocence has not been excluded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, \u201cthe question is not whether \u2018some evidence\u2019 supports the hypothesis, but whether a rational factfinder could have found the incriminating evidence renders the hypothesis of innocence unreasonable.\u201d <em>James v. Commonwealth, </em>53 Va.App. 671, 682, 674 S.E.2d 571, 577 (2009) (citing indirectly <em>Commonwealth v. Hudson, </em>265 Va. 505, 513, 578 S.E.2d 781, 785 (2003)). Based on the evidence, the trial court was entitled to conclude Burton stole Dabney\u2019s coins and cashed them in for $385.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">IV. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">In sum, the trial court did not err in permitting a lay witness to testify about the value of coins and there is sufficient evidence to support Burton\u2019s grand larceny conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b325-10\">. He was also charged with two counts of breaking and entering, another count of grand larceny, one count of larceny of a firearm, and one count of assaulting a police officer. Only the grand larceny charge related to the taking of Richard Dabney\u2019s coins is before us on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b327-6\">. Burton claims on appeal \"there is no basis on which to conclude Burton took possession of the coins after [as opposed to before] Richard Dabney's death, and any such conclusion would be mere speculation.\" Appellant's Br. at 10. Contrary to appellant\u2019s contention, Jesse Dabney testified the coins were missing shortly after he was asked \"what was <em>different </em>inside the house\u201d on May 4th as compared with May 2nd. A reasonable factfinder could conclude from this evidence that Jesse Dabney had observed the coin jars in his brother\u2019s house on May 2nd, after Richard\u2019s death, and subsequently noticed their absence on May 4th.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b329-7\">. Evidence can nonetheless be presented to prove that money has an extrinsic value different than its redeemable value as legal tender. The true value of coins is affected both by their market value to numismatics and \u201cthe tangible (i.e.intrinsic) value of the coins\u2019 precious metal content.\u201d <em>Sanders v. Freeman, </em>221 F.3d 846, 855-56 (6th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b329-8\">. While <em>Wright, </em>196 Va. at 139, 82 S.E.2d at 607, addresses the face value of paper currency, the law \"knows no difference between\u201d coin and paper currency. <em>See Thompson v. Butler, </em>95 U.S. 694, 696, 24 L.Ed. 540 (1878). Thus in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the face value of coin currency is prima facie evidence of its value.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b330-7\">. \"At least since 1872 Virginia juries have been instructed that the defendant's exclusive possession of recently stolen goods, if he offers no reasonable explanation, permits a presumption or inference that the defendant stole the goods.\u201d Ronald J.
