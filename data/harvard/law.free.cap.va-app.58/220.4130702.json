Hayes (claimant), a former employee, is entitled to ongoing benefits under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (the Act), Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-100 to -1310. On appeal, employer contends the commission erroneously found claimant did not materially aggravate his compensable traumatic brain injury in a subsequent automobile accident and erroneously held that claimant\u2019s settlement of his third-party cause of action arising out of the automobile accident, without notice to the employer, did not prejudice employer as related to claimant\u2019s compensable brain injury. We hold evidence of prejudice from the settlement as to injuries other than the compensable brain injury does not justify termination of the award for that injury. We hold further the evidence supports the commission\u2019s finding that claimant\u2019s 2006 auto accident did not materially aggravate his compensable 2004 brain injury and, thus, that the commission correctly concluded employer has failed to establish prejudice as to that injury. Accordingly, we affirm the commission\u2019s refusal to terminate benefits for claimant\u2019s traumatic brain injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">On April 5, 2004, claimant, a computer technician for employer, sustained injuries to several body parts, including his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>head and brain, when some steel shelving fell on him. He was diagnosed with a closed head trauma with cerebral concussion and post-concussive syndrome. He came under the care of neurologist Harmeet Singh, who saw him on three occasions and referred him to a hospital head injury center for further evaluation and management. Claimant was hospitalized for almost four weeks and underwent treatment during which he reported he \u201chad to [re-]learn how to walk and talk.\u201d Upon his discharge, he continued with an outpatient program. Claimant also experienced severe pain in his lower back, left arm, and left knee and received treatment for those injuries, as well. While hospitalized for his brain injury, claimant came under the care of psychiatrist Nooreddin Mirmirani, who continued to oversee claimant\u2019s care for the traumatic brain injury following his release from the hospital. Employer accepted the brain injury as compensable, and the commission later held the injuries to his lower back, left arm, and left knee were compensable, as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">On April 18, 2006, a little over two years after sustaining his compensable industrial injuries, claimant was in an automobile accident when he was hit from behind while stopped at a traffic light. About thirteen months later, without consulting employer or its third party administrator, claimant settled all claims arising out of the 2006 auto accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">On February 15, 2008, employer filed an application for hearing seeking to terminate claimant\u2019s compensation award, contending claimant\u2019s 2006 auto accident aggravated his 2004 compensable lower back injury and that he settled the claim in a manner that prejudiced employer\u2019s right of subrogation. The deputy commissioner agreed and terminated the award. On request for review, claimant conceded he forfeited workers\u2019 compensation rights as to his back injury but contended that because he suffered ongoing temporary total disability causally related to the work-related injuries to his brain, left arm, and left knee, employer was not entitled to terminate his benefits. The commission noted it appeared employer had claimed only that the auto accident aggravated the compensable back injury and, thus, that the deputy did not address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>whether the auto accident aggravated claimant\u2019s brain, knee, and arm injuries. The commission also noted a gap in some of the relevant medical records filed with the commission. It remanded the matter to the deputy to take additional evidence in order to determine whether the 2006 auto accident \u201csufficiently aggravated the claimant\u2019s brain injury, left arm injury and left knee injury resulting in a material change in the claimant\u2019s symptoms related to the original work accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">On remand, the deputy concluded claimant\u2019s settlement of his third-party suit defeated employer\u2019s subrogation rights as to claimant\u2019s left arm and leg injuries. However, the deputy found the 2006 motor vehicle accident did not materially aggravate claimant\u2019s 2004 brain injury. The deputy said claimant was \u201cdiagnosed following the accident as having a closed head injury/concussion,\u201d but that Dr. Mirmirani, who treated claimant throughout the relevant period and reviewed the emergency room records, testified \u201cthere was no significant change in the claimant\u2019s condition as a result of the accident.\u201d The deputy also noted that Dr. Mirmirani\u2019s was \u201cthe only opinion proffered on the issue\u201d of claimant\u2019s mental status and that his opinion was entitled to great weight. The deputy concluded claimant\u2019s settlement of his third-party claim did not support termination of his workers\u2019 compensation benefits because claimant sustained \u201cvery distinct and separate injuries\u201d and the auto accident aggravated only some of those injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Employer filed a request for review, and the commission affirmed the deputy\u2019s decision with modifications. Although one commissioner concurred to express his opinion regarding the credibility of some of the evidence, the commission unanimously agreed that Code \u00a7 65.2-309 \u201cmean[s] that [the commission] can determine forfeiture on a body part basis\u201d and rejected employer\u2019s argument that \u201cany unauthorized compromise of a third-party claim means forfeiture of all compensation benefits.\u201d The commission affirmed the deputy\u2019s finding, based on the opinion of claimant\u2019s treating physician, that the motor vehicle accident did not materially aggravate claimant\u2019s brain injury or change his disability status. The commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>agreed with the deputy that the third-party accident materially aggravated claimant\u2019s left arm injury, such that the third-party settlement impaired employer\u2019s subrogation rights as to that injury. However, the commission modified the deputy\u2019s decision as to claimant\u2019s left knee injury, finding claimant did not injure his left knee in the 2006 auto accident and, thus, that the third-party settlement did not prejudice employer\u2019s rights as to that injury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Commissioner Williams concurred, agreeing that regardless of the credibility of claimant and Dr. Mirmirani, the record did not contain sufficient evidence to support a finding that claimant\u2019s brain injury was aggravated by the 2006 auto accident. Commissioner Williams opined further that although claimant may have been only partially disabled as a result of his brain injury, because claimant was under an award for temporary total disability and because \u201cno basis has been shown which would justify termination of that award, even partial disability related to the brain injury is sufficient to support reinstatement of [disability] benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">On appeal, we are guided by the principle that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act \u201cis highly remedial,\u201d <em>Henderson v. Cent. Tel. Co., </em>233 Va. 377, 382, 355 S.E.2d 596, 599 (1987), and \u201cshould be liberally construed in favor of the injured employee,\u201d <em>E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. Eggleston, </em>264 Va. 13, 17, 563 S.E.2d 685, 687 (2002). \u201cAlthough \u2018we are not bound by the commission\u2019s legal analysis in this or prior cases,\u2019 we give great weight to the commission\u2019s construction of the Act ..., and we defer to the commission\u2019s factual findings if supported by credible evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Bay Concrete Constr. Co. v. Davis, </em>43 Va.App. 528, 538-39, 600 S.E.2d 144, 150 (2004) (quoting <em>USAir, Inc. v. Joyce, </em>27 Va.App. 184, 189 n.1, 497 S.E.2d 904, 906 n.1 (1998)) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>A. IMPACT OF SETTLEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY SUIT</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Employer contends the commission erred in determining that, in the event a claimant settles a third-party claim without notice to the employer, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act permits forfeiture of benefits on a piecemeal, \u201cbody part by body part\u201d basis. Employer argues the commission should instead have concluded that proof of prejudice to employer\u2019s rights from claimant\u2019s settlement of his claim as to one body part was sufficient prejudice to justify terminating the award as to all body parts. Employer also contends the commission should have considered the prejudice that resulted from its loss of the ability to investigate the third-party accident and the issue of causation in a timely fashion after that accident. Our examination of the structure and function of the applicable statute and case law leads us to reject these contentions and to affirm the commission\u2019s unanimous interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">Code \u00a7 65.2-309 provides in relevant part as follows: A claim against an employer under this title for injury ... shall create a lien on behalf of the employer against any verdict or settlement arising from any right to recover damages which the injured employee ... may have against any other party for such injury ..., and such employer also shall be subrogated to any such right and may enforce, in his own name or in the name of the injured employee ..., the legal liability of such other party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Code \u00a7 65.2-309(A). In short, \u201can employer is subrogated to the rights of an employee against any other party causing an injury ... for which the employer is required to provide compensation under the [Act].\u201d <em>Green v. Warwick Plumbing &amp; Heating, </em>5 Va.App. 409, 411, 364 S.E.2d 4, 6 (1988). The purpose of the statute is to give the injured employee \u201can opportunity to obtain one full recovery [while preventing] him from receiving a double recovery for his injuries.\u201d <em>Noblin v. Randolph Corp., </em>180 Va. 345, 359, 23 S.E.2d 209, 214 (1942). \u201cThe right of subrogation here does not depend upon equita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>ble principles____ It is purely statutory and arises when the conditions specified in the statute are met.\u201d <em>Stone v. George W. Helme Co., </em>184 Va. 1051, 1059-60, 37 S.E.2d 70, 73 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">In determining the subrogation rights of the employer, \u201c[n]o distinction is made between the liability of a third [party] who causes an original injury and one who causes an aggravation of that injury.\u201d <em>Green, </em>5 Va.App. at 411, 364 S.E.2d at 6. This is so because \u201c[a]n employee is entitled to continued compensation, in spite of an intervening accident, if the intervening accident exacerbates the original injury.\u201d <em>Id. Compare id. with Celanese Fibers Co. v. Johnson, </em>229 Va. 117, 120, 326 S.E.2d 687, 690 (1985) (noting that \u201c[w]here ... causal connection between an industrial accident and disability has been established by the entry of an award, an employer has a right to apply for termination of benefits upon an allegation that the effects of the injury have <em>fully </em>dissipated and the disability is the result of another cause\u201d (emphasis added)). Because \u201can employee is entitled to compensation from his or her employer [for the exacerbation], ... [the] employer is subrogated to the rights of its employee against a third party who injures the employee.\u201d <em>Green, </em>5 Va.App. at 411-12, 364 S.E.2d at 6. Just as in the case of a single, \u201cunitary\u201d accident, this principle assures the claimant will receive compensation for his injury but will not receive a double recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">\u201c[T]o protect the employer who may be required to provide ... workers\u2019 compensation- benefits [to the employee injured due to third-party negligence], [the Supreme Court has held that] the employee may not pursue his common law remedy [in the third-party matter] in such a manner or settle his claim to the prejudice of the employer\u2019s subrogation right and thereafter continue to receive worker\u2019s compensation benefits.\u201d <em>Wood v. Caudle-Hyatt, Inc., </em>18 Va.App. 391, 397, 444 S.E.2d 3, 7 (1994); <em>see Stone, </em>184 Va. at 1058, 37 S.E.2d at 73 (citing <em>Noblin, </em>180 Va. at 359, 23 S.E.2d at 214); <em>see also Safety-Kleen Corp. v. Van Hoy, </em>225 Va. 64, 69-71, 300 S.E.2d 750, 753-54 (1983). \u201cThe penalty for impairing the employer\u2019s right may be loss of the employee\u2019s right to compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>benefits. But, where impairment is claimed, to successfully be relieved of its liability to pay compensation benefits, the burden is upon the employer to show that the employee prejudiced the employer\u2019s right.\u201d <em>Overhead Door Co. v. Lewis, </em>22 Va.App. 240, 243, 468 S.E.2d 700, 701 (1996). Whether the employer has shown prejudice is a question of fact. <em>White Elec. Co. v. Bak, </em>22 Va.App. 17, 24, 467 S.E.2d 827, 830 (1996); <em>Newport News v. Blankenship, </em>10 Va.App. 704, 708, 396 S.E.2d 145, 147 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Where the compensable injury and the third party claim arise out of a single, \u201cunitary\u201d accident, manifestly the injuries incurred are the same. Where a claimant injured under such circumstances accepts a sum of money \u201cin consideration of which he execute[s] a full and complete release of all of his claims against [the third-party tortfeasor]\u201d without the knowledge or participation of the employer, \u201cthe employee ... completely destroy[s] by his own voluntary act\u201d the employer\u2019s \u201cstatutory right of subrogation,\u201d thereby constituting the required showing of prejudice to the employer. <em>Stone, </em>184 Va. at 1060, 37 S.E.2d at 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Where, as here, the third-party negligence occurs at a separate time from the original compensable industrial accident, the calculus changes. As set out above, the employer must pay continuing compensation for the original injury and any exacerbation, and to the extent the original injury and the subsequent injury are the same \u201cinjury\u201d for purposes of Code \u00a7 65.2-309, employer is subrogated to the claimant\u2019s rights against the third-party tortfeasor in order to prevent the claimant from receiving a double recovery. <em>Green, </em>5 Va.App. at 411-12, 364 S.E.2d at 6. However, because the injuries occurred at separate times, the employer is not entitled to an inference that the new injury and the original injury are the same injury, and the burden remains on the employer to show the settlement prejudiced the employer\u2019s right of subrogation, if any, <em>see Lewis, </em>22 Va.App. at 243, 468 S.E.2d at 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Where the evidence supports a finding that an original compensable injury was exacerbated by a third-party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>injury, the commission does not err in concluding that because \u201cthe employer\u2019s right to subrogation [is] limited to benefits arising as a result of the exacerbation of the original injury and [does] not include benefits attributable only to the original injury,\u201d the unauthorized settlement compels termination \u201conly [of] those benefits arising as a result of the exacerbation of the original injury.\u201d <em>Green, </em>5 Va.App. at 413 &amp; n. 1, 364 S.E.2d at 7 <em>&amp; </em>n. 1. In addition, where an original injury is exacerbated but the commission finds the exacerbation was \u201cshort-lived,\u201d the evidence supports a finding that the employer has failed to establish the prejudice necessary to compel termination of benefits even for the exacerbation. <em>Blankenship, </em>10 Va.App. at 708-09, 396 S.E.2d at 147-48 (involving the commission\u2019s finding that an eleven-day exacerbation did not prejudice the employer); <em>see Bak, </em>22 Va.App. at 23, 467 S.E.2d at 830 (applying <em>Blankenship </em>to a brief exacerbation where the commission found the employer faded to prove prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">Finally, we conclude, as claimant reasons, that if settlement of a third-party claim involving what has been shown to be merely a temporary aggravation of an original compensable industrial injury is insufficient to show prejudice justifying termination of the underlying award, <em>see Green, </em>5 Va.App. at 413 &amp; n. 1, 364 S.E.2d at 7 <em>&amp; </em>n. 1; <em>see also Bak, </em>22 Va.App. at 23, 467 S.E.2d at 830; <em>Blankenship, </em>10 Va.App. at 708-09, 396 S.E.2d at 147-48, settlement of a third-party claim for an injury never shown to be any type of aggravation has not been proven to prejudice the employer as to employer\u2019s liability for the original injury. Any other conclusion would subvert the principle that the Act is to be construed liberally to benefit injured employees. <em>See, e.g., Eggleston, </em>264 Va. at 17, 563 S.E.2d at 687. Thus, the statutory framework, which refers to \u201csuch injury,\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-309(A), as well as the case law interpreting it, supports the commission\u2019s implicit conclusion that we must examine the impact of the third-party settlement on each originally injured body part individually; the language does not support aggregating all injured body parts and concluding the settlement of a subsequently arising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>third-party claim involving injury to one of those body parts prejudices employer as to all of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">Employer contends it was prejudiced as to the entire ongoing award for claimant\u2019s compensable 2004 brain injury because it did not receive notice of the 2006 auto accident at a time allowing it to investigate the impact of that accident on his compensable brain injury before claimant executed the settlement. This argument begs the question, for employer was prejudiced, as that term is used in the context of Code \u00a7 65.2-309, by the lack of opportunity to investigate prior to the third-party settlement and to participate in that settlement only if the 2006 auto accident caused more than a temporary aggravation of claimant\u2019s 2004 compensable traumatic brain injury. <em>See Green, </em>5 Va.App. at 413 &amp; n. 1, 364 S.E.2d at 7 &amp; n.1; <em>see also Bak, </em>22 Va.App. at 23, 467 S.E.2d at 830; <em>Blankenship, </em>10 Va.App. at 708-09, 396 S.E.2d at 147-48. Employer was equally free to investigate the question of causation of claimant\u2019s ongoing brain problems after claimant settled the auto accident claim. If employer could prove settlement prejudiced its right of subrogation as to some or all of the ongoing award, it was entitled under Code \u00a7 65.2-309(D) to seek (a) termination of the award and/or (b) credit or a civil judgment for any excess compensation claimant received.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Further, to the extent employer contends the delay itself constituted sufficient constructive prejudice to its rights, without proof that it suffered actual prejudice in the form of an affirmative impairment of any subrogation rights it may have had, we disagree. The notice Code \u00a7 65.2-309 has been held to require is notice prior to entering into a settlement, <em>see Stone, </em>184 Va. at 1058-60, 37 S.E.2d at 73-74; <em>Wood, </em>18 Va.App. at 397-98, 444 S.E.2d at 7-8, not notice within any particular period of time following the happening of the accident or the occurrence of a new injury or aggravation. Here, although employer bore the burden of proving prejudice, it failed to allege or offer any evidence intended to show when it or its third-party claims administrator became aware of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>2006 motor vehicle accident, and as detailed below, the record supports a finding that employer, through its third party administrator, had at least constructive notice of the accident within ten weeks of when it occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">Pursuant to the Act, an employer is entitled to receive copies of all relevant records of a medical provider before paying the bill for a particular treatment or office visit. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-604 (providing an employer is entitled to reports for compensable treatment upon request); Workers\u2019 Comp. Comm\u2019n Rule 4.2 (providing that a medical care provider attending an injured employee shall, upon request, furnish a copy of \u201c[a]ll medical reports relevant to a claim,\u201d including \u201c[c]umulative progress notes\u201d and \u201creports\u201d); <em>see also Wiggins v. Fairfax Park Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>22 Va.App. 432, 442-43, 470 S.E.2d 591, 596-97 (1996) (recognizing the statutory duty of medical providers to produce a claimant\u2019s records upon request of the employer and noting a claimant may be required to select a new health care provider if an existing provider refuses to comply with a valid request); <em>Hassell v. Arlington Co. Human Servs., </em>79 O.W.C. 141, <em>available at </em>2000 WL 1517897 (Va. Workers\u2019 Comp. Comm\u2019n June 29, 2000) (holding an employer is released from the responsibility of paying a provider for medical treatment if the provider fails to provide medical reports within a reasonable time); <em>Smith v. Mullins Coal Co., </em>78 O.W.C. 202, <em>available at </em>1999 WL 1006903 (Va. Workers\u2019 Comp. Comm\u2019n Oct. 19, 1999) (holding pursuant to Commission Rule 4.2 \u201cthat the parties have a right to receive and review all medical documents which are <em>or may be </em>related to the claimant\u2019s condition\u201d (emphasis added)). Here, when claimant saw Dr. Mirmirani on May 17, 2006, for his compensable 2004 head injury, claimant told Dr. Mirmirani about his April 18, 2006 auto accident. Dr. Mirmirani included information about the auto accident in his office note of that date. On June 23, 2006, about nine weeks after claimant\u2019s auto accident, employer paid Dr. Mirmirani\u2019s bill for that office visit. Further, an affidavit from employer\u2019s third party administrator indicates it paid this particular bill, as well as numerous others, \u201c[on employer\u2019s behalf] for the claimant\u2019s \u2018necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>medical attention\u2019 that was causally related to the claimant\u2019s lifetime medical Award on this claim.\u201d This evidence supports a finding that as of June 23, 2006, employer\u2019s agent had reviewed Dr. Mirmirani\u2019s office note of May 17, 2006, and, thus, had at least constructive notice of claimant\u2019s April 18, 2006 auto accident and claimant\u2019s reports to Dr. Mirmirani indicating his head and back may have been involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Even assuming employer lacked constructive notice of the 2006 motor vehicle accident until shortly before it filed its February 2008 application for change in condition (based on its allegation that claimant sustained additional injury to his compensable lower back problem) or lacked actual notice of the possibility that claimant reinjured his brain in the 2006 motor vehicle accident until the commission pointed this out in its opinion rendered in April 2009, employer still had constructive notice of the auto accident and related injuries within two years and actual notice within three years. If claimant had waited this same period of time, until 2008 or 2009, to settle his auto accident claim and had consulted employer immediately prior to entering into the settlement, he would have acted in compliance with the statute as interpreted to date by the Supreme Court, and yet employer would be no better off than it is here for purposes of investigating causation. Employer cites no authority, beyond the general principle that a claimant may not settle a third-party claim in a manner that prejudices an employer\u2019s subrogation rights, in support of its argument that it was entitled to actual notice of a subsequent accident that the commission found did not, in fact, impair its subrogation rights, and we are aware of no such authority. <em>Compare </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-711 (requiring a claimant to report to the commission any change in his residential address); Code \u00a7 65.2-712 (requiring a claimant to report, <em>inter alia, </em>a return to employment or increase in earnings); Code \u00a7 65.2-1206 (providing that where benefits are being paid by the Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund (the fund), \u201c[a]ny payment to a claimant ... which is later determined by the Commission to have been procured by fraud, mistake or an unreported change in condition, shall be recovered from the claimant and credited to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>[the fund]\u201d). The right, upon proof of prejudice, to seek termination of an award or credit or a civil judgment for benefits paid under it, rather than the guarantee of an opportunity to investigate in advance of any settlement, is the remedy the Supreme Court has determined is provided by the Act. <em>See Stone, </em>184 Va. at 1058, 37 S.E.2d at 73; <em>Lewis, </em>22 Va.App. at 243, 468 S.E.2d at 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">Furthermore, to the extent employer claims its investigation was prejudiced because Dr. Mirmirani learned claimant\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation benefits were in jeopardy and thereafter slanted his medical opinion to benefit claimant, neither the Act nor the case law provides that a medical provider\u2019s mere knowledge of the status of a workers\u2019 compensation claim is a bar to a claimant\u2019s receipt of ongoing benefits. The statutory scheme provides, instead, that the commission determines the credibility of the parties\u2019 witnesses as a finding of fact, <em>see, e.g., Dep\u2019t of Corr. v. Powell, </em>2 Va.App. 712, 714, 347 S.E.2d 532, 533 (1986), which the commission did in this case, <em>see </em>discussion <em>infra </em>Part II.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Thus, we turn to the question of the sufficiency of the evidence to support the commission\u2019s factual findings underlying its conclusion that employer failed to prove the third-party settlement itself, rather than any right to contemporaneous notice of the accident, prejudiced employer\u2019s subrogation rights as to his brain injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">IMPACT OF CLAIMANT\u2019S AUTO ACCIDENT ON HIS BRAIN INJURY</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">As previously indicated, whether employer has shown it was prejudiced by claimant\u2019s settlement of his 2006 auto accident claim is a question of fact. <em>See Bak, </em>22 Va.App. at 24, 467 S.E.2d at 830; <em>Blankenship, </em>10 Va.App. at 708, 396 S.E.2d at 147. A determination regarding the causation, nature, and extent of disability is also a question of fact. <em>See, e.g., Ga. Pac. Corp. v. Dancy, </em>17 Va.App. 128, 133-34, 435 S.E.2d 898, 901 (1993). Such determinations need not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>based solely on medical evidence. <em>See Dollar Gen\u2019l Store v. Cridlin, </em>22 Va.App. 171, 176, 468 S.E.2d 152, 154 (1996) (applying principle in context of determining causation). Such facts may be proved by either direct or circumstantial evidence, including medical evidence or \u201cthe testimony of a claimant.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">\u201c \u2018As the factfinder, the commission is charged with the responsibility of resolving questions ... of controverted facts,\u2019 \u201d including questions of witness credibility. <em>Metro. Wash. Airports Auth. v. Lusby, </em>41 Va.App. 300, 312, 585 S.E.2d 318, 323 (2003) (quoting <em>Va. Empl. Comm\u2019n v. Gantt, </em>7 Va.App. 631, 635, 376 S.E.2d 808, 811 (1989)). Decisions of the commission as to questions of fact are conclusive and binding upon this Court if supported by credible evidence. Code \u00a7 65.2-706(A); <em>see Manassas Ice &amp; Fuel Co. v. Farrar, </em>13 Va.App. 227, 229, 409 S.E.2d 824, 826 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The opinion of the treating physician is entitled to great weight, although the commission is not required to accept it, <em>Pilot Freight Carriers, Inc. v. Reeves, </em>1 Va.App. 435, 439, 339 S.E.2d 570, 572 (1986), and \u201cif it is in conflict with other medical evidence, the Commission is free to adopt that view \u2018which is most consistent with reason and justice,\u2019 \u201d <em>Georgia-Pacific Corp. v. Robinson, </em>32 Va.App. 1, 5, 526 S.E.2d 267, 269 (2000) (quoting <em>C.D.S. Constr. Servs. v. Petrock, </em>218 Va. 1064, 1070, 243 S.E.2d 236, 240 (1978)). In determining the credibility of any witness, the fact finder may accept the parts of a witness\u2019 testimony it finds believable and reject other parts as implausible. <em>Moyer v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 8, 28, 531 S.E.2d 580, 590 (2000) (en banc). \u201cThe fact that a witness makes inconsistent statements ... does not render his testimony ... unworthy of belief.... It is firmly imbedded in the law of Virginia that the credibility of a witness who makes inconsistent statements ... on the stand is a question ... for the ... trier of the facts.... \u201d <em>Swanson v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 376, 378-79, 382 S.E.2d 258, 259 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Here, the record supports the commission\u2019s finding that employer failed to prove it was prejudiced by the third-party settlement because the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to claimant, established that claimant (1) suffered no exacerbation of his compensable 2004 brain injury in the 2006 auto accident and (2) continued to be temporarily and totally disabled as a result of the 2004 brain injury after the 2006 auto accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">Dr. Mirmirani, claimant\u2019s treating physician for his compensable 2004 traumatic brain injury (TBI), was uniquely suited to render an opinion about claimant\u2019s condition both before and after the 2006 auto accident. Dr. Mirmirani began treating claimant in 2004 while he was hospitalized and undergoing extensive rehabilitation for his TBI. He saw claimant almost monthly for more than a year preceding the 2006 auto accident, including conducting an office visit with claimant just a week before the auto accident occurred. He also saw claimant regularly after the accident, including three months in succession beginning about four weeks after the accident, and then, after a ten-week break during which claimant traveled out-of-state to see his ailing mother, ten to twelve times per year for the next three years thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Dr. Mirmirani reviewed his own records and examined the records of claimant\u2019s treatment in the emergency room immediately following his 2006 auto accident before opining \u201cthere was no substantiation that [claimant] suffered from an additional head injury\u2019 in the 2006 auto accident. He also noted claimant\u2019s \u201cpsychiatric and intellectual\u201d condition and symptoms had undergone no substantial change during his more than five years of treating claimant and that those symptoms remained consistent with claimant\u2019s 2004 TBI.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Dr. Mirmirani opined shortly before the 2006 auto accident that claimant\u2019s \u201cmental energy [was] adequate\u201d but noted \u201che still complain[ed] of tiredness during the daytime,\u201d still required medication to sleep at night, and continued to suffer from memory dysfunction and cognitive impairment, for which he also took medication. Claimant was continuing to experi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>enee intermittent headaches, as well. Dr. Mirmirani also explained that having had a TBI adversely affects one\u2019s ability to cope with any sort of stress.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">Although the record contained conflicting evidence concerning whether claimant said he hit his head during the auto accident, Dr. Mirmirani explained that even if claimant had experienced \u201ca little bang\u201d in the accident, that \u201clittle bang,\u201d standing alone, would have been insufficient to aggravate his 2004 TBI. Dr. Mirmirani explained that to constitute a new head injury of a caliber sufficient to aggravate his 2004 TBI, claimant would have to have had at least a concussion or a period of amnesia. To the contrary, opined Dr. Mirmirani, the emergency room records\u2014which showed no contusions or abrasions to the head and included an MRI of the head that also showed \u201cnothing\u201d\u2014contained \u201cno clinical presentation that [claimant] suffered any type of injury to the brain\u201d in the 2006 auto accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The emergency room records themselves, viewed in the light most favorable to claimant, also do not substantiate such an injury. The emergency medical technician who responded to the scene detected \u201cno marks or swelling\u201d on claimant\u2019s forehead and determined his pupils, although one was slightly larger than the other, were reactive to light. The hospital nursing record and physician\u2019s record both indicated claimant suffered no visible head trauma. The nurse recorded claimant had a history of \u201cTBI 2 yrs ago,\u201d giving him a \u201c[questionable] baseline.\u201d Although the nurse indicated claimant exhibited some \u201cconfus[ion]\u201d or \u201cmemory loss\u201d as to time \u201c[secondary to] TBI,\u201d the nurse did not indicate that the TBI referenced was a new one rather than the TBI of \u201c2 yrs ago\u201d noted under past history. Finally, the physician\u2019s record indicates claimant was fully alert and oriented and contains no diagnosis of a concussion or other head injury requiring medical attention. Although claimant apparently reported head pain to both the nurse and examining physician, he also testified he had a headache that began to develop that day shortly <em>before </em>the accident occurred. Thus, nothing in the emergency room record compels the conclusion that the commission erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>accepting Dr. Mirmirani\u2019s opinion that claimant did not aggravate his 2004 TBI in the 2006 auto accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">Finally, claimant reported to Dr. Singh, whom he saw about six weeks after the accident, that his symptoms from his post-concussion syndrome \u201cremained] the same without any change\u201d following his 2006 auto accident, and claimant gave testimony to the same effect at the hearing before the deputy commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Dr. Mirmirani opined that \u201c[wjithin the first two years, up to two years [after a TBI] you have a good chance\u201d of \u201crecovery\u201d but that claimant \u201cnever intellectually and emotionally recovered\u201d from the 2004 TBI \u201cto the level that he could be gainfully employed.\u201d Mirmirani wrote, \u201cIt is my professional opinion that all of his current residual intellectual and emotional difficulties and deficiencies are related to his original traumatic brain injury in 2004,\u201d and he stated further, \u201c[ojverall from my observation, his clinical presentation, current mental status and failure to pass even a simple test to become a volunteer, in my opinion he remains totally disabled and unable to be gainfully employed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Employer contends the evidence in the record of claimant\u2019s employment and job search history before and after the 2006 auto accident impeaches Dr. Mirmirani\u2019s opinion that claimant\u2019s condition remained substantially unchanged after the auto accident. It points to evidence that before the 2006 accident, claimant had \u201cadequate\u201d energy; was \u201ccontinuing to improve\u201d; had returned to work for employer with only a minimal restriction preventing him from working evenings or weekends; and was seeking, with Dr. Mirmirani\u2019s encouragement, a new job as a private detective. After the 2006 auto accident, posits employer, claimant\u2019s condition worsened; Dr. Mirmirani first opined that, as of October 18, 2006, claimant\u2019s combined disabilities rendered him totally disabled; and claimant was unable to pass a simple test to work as a volunteer. Employer\u2019s argument fails because it views the evidence in the light most favorable to employer rather than to claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>The evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to claimant, established that Dr. Mirmirani never opined claimant was intellectually or cognitively capable of returning to his preinjury employment or any other job. A neuropsychologist, who examined claimant on only one occasion, rather than treating physician Dr. Mirmirani, released claimant to return to his pre-injury job. While claimant worked in his pre-injury position for about six months from December 2004 to June 2005, he testified his cognitive and memory deficits were an ongoing problem and that his co-workers gave him only the easiest tasks and \u201ccovered for him.\u201d Also, Dr. Mirmirani never released claimant to be on call for night and weekend work as his employer had desired, because of both claimant\u2019s problems with fatigue and his need to have close supervision in order to perform even the easiest tasks from his pre-injury work. Finally, the evidence established claimant was terminated from that employment in June 2005 \u201cbecause he [did] not fit his job description,\u201d at which time employer resumed paying temporary total disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Claimant remained eager and optimistic when he began working with the vocational rehabilitation company hired by employer, but he reported finding it \u201cquite difficult\u201d to learn new technology in his field, and Dr. Mirmirani \u201csuggested\u201d that claimant might seek training \u201cin a less complicated field.\u201d When claimant also \u201cfound it extremely difficult\u201d to comprehend \u201csimpler\u201d \u201cmaterials in electronics,\u201d they discussed the field of private detection. When employer questioned why claimant could not work as a computer technician or electrician, Dr. Mirmirani emphasized claimant\u2019s cognitive impairment. He recommended employer obtain additional psychological testing to confirm claimant\u2019s cognitive impairment, but the records contain no indication that employer ever approved or sought such testing. Thereafter, although claimant completed a two-week course to become a private detective, successfully passed the open-book test prior to his 2006 traffic accident, and was motivated to try to obtain such a job, the evidence supported a finding that he simply was not capable of working as a private detective before or after his 2006 auto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>accident. Claimant explained that he was able to pass the open-book test because the day before it was given, his instructor dictated detailed notes to his students, including the page numbers in the book on which information about various topics could be found. Claimant testified that when he checked with potential employers, he learned available positions would require work early in the morning or late at night, times he was not able to work due to his medication and sleep issues. Finally, claimant testified that the problems he exhibited with poor spelling and sentence structure on a volunteer test he took early in 2008 had existed since the 2004 compensable industrial injury. He stated further that the symptoms from his 2004 TBI did not change in any way following the 2006 auto accident and that he had the same problems functioning at the time of the November 2009 hearing before the deputy that he had when he tried to return to work with employer in late 2004 and 2005. Dr. Mirmirani also expressly opined that claimant \u201cnever intellectually and emotionally recovered to the level that he could be gainfully employed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">To the extent employer argues claimant and Dr. Mirmirani made inconsistent statements, none of these claimed contradictions rendered their testimony inherently incredible. Thus, it was within the province of the commission, as the finder of fact, to determine whether to credit their testimony and, if so, which aspects of it. The testimony of claimant and opinion of Dr. Mirmirani that claimant\u2019s symptoms from his traumatic brain injury did not change in any way following the 2006 auto accident were not inherently incredible, and the commission\u2019s decision to credit those opinions was not plainly wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">For these reasons, we hold the evidence supports the commission\u2019s finding that claimant\u2019s 2006 auto accident did not materially aggravate his compensable 2004 brain injury and, thus, that the commission correctly concluded employer has failed to establish prejudice as to that injury. Accordingly, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>affirm the commission\u2019s refusal to terminate benefits for claimant\u2019s traumatic brain injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b275-8\">. The commission\u2019s determinations as to claimant\u2019s left arm and left knee are not contested in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
