On appeal, appellant contends the evidence was insufficient to sustain each of his convictions. For the following reasons, we affirm appellant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">\u201cOn appeal, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party in the [trial] court, and we accord the Commonwealth the benefit of all reasonable inferences deducible from the evidence.\u201d <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>278 Va. 523, 527, 685 S.E.2d 43, 45 (2009). The evidence presented at trial proved the following. On August 16, 2009, appellant met Juan Lebr\u00f3n,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Damon Turner,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Leon Hunt, and appellant\u2019s girlfriend, Stephanie Jarmillo.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> During the day, Jarmillo drove the group around in appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s van. They went to a convenience store in Rockbridge County several times during that day. While they drove around in the van, the group discussed their need for money to buy marijuana. Hunt was the only individual in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>van with any money. Hunt saw two handguns laying \u201c[bjarrel to butt\u201d in the front of the van, in between the driver\u2019s and front passenger\u2019s seats.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Prior to his leaving the group in the van around 9:30 p.m.,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Hunt heard appellant tell Turner to \u201cman up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">On that same day, just prior to closing time at the convenience store, Sadie Claytor, a relative of the store\u2019s owner, was sitting on a bench outside the store. A man wearing clothing to conceal his face ran up to her, put a gun to her face, and said, \u201cthis is a stick up.\u201d He then ran inside the store. Claytor immediately ran to a man in a nearby vehicle and asked him to call 911. As Claytor proceeded back toward the store, she saw the same masked man leave the store and run through a field toward two individuals. She saw the masked man and the men in the field speak to each other, but was unable to hear what they were saying.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Eva Moore, an employee of the convenience store, testified that at approximately 11:00 p.m. that day, an armed man, -with clothing concealing his face, entered the store, put a gun to her head, and demanded money. That man then took the cash drawer and a change bag, and quickly left the store.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Rockbridge County Sheriffs Deputy Steve Funkhouser responded to the 911 call at the convenience store and found a trail of cash, receipts, checks made out to the convenience store, the store\u2019s bank bag, black gloves, and a BB gun. He found those items along the path where Claytor saw the masked man run from the store toward a nearby field. Funkhouser also found a blue shirt, a red shirt, and additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>receipts from the convenience store scattered along Route 130.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Turner\u2019s DNA was found on the black gloves.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The surveillance videotape from the convenience store showed the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-6\">\u2022 At 5:40 p.m., a van belonging to appellant\u2019s mother entered the parking lot of the store. Appellant, Lebr\u00f3n, and Turner entered the store. The three men left the store.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-7\">\u2022 At 6:48 p.m., Lebr\u00f3n and Turner re-entered the store.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-8\">\u2022 At 9:20 p.m., appellant, Lebr\u00f3n, and Turner re-entered the store.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-9\">\u2022 At 10:42 p.m., appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s van was parked at the rear of the store.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-10\">\u2022 At 10:49 p.m., appellant again entered the store.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-11\">\u2022 At 11:03 p.m., a person with clothing concealing his face, meeting Turner\u2019s height and physical characteristics, armed with a firearm, entered the convenience store, placed a gun to the head of the cashier, and took the cash register drawer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-12\">Appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s van was not in the store\u2019s parking lot at the time the robbery occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-13\">On August 17, 2009, the day following the robbery, Hunt, who had been in the van the day before, called the sheriffs department after hearing about the robbery at the convenience store. He told the officers that he had been with \u201cChino\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and \u201cBlaze\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the day before and that they had BB guns, no money, and were riding around looking for marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-14\">During his investigation of the convenience store robbery, Investigator Funkhouser discovered an unrelated outstanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>misdemeanor warrant for appellant charging possession of marijuana. He proceeded to appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s residence and there arrested appellant on the outstanding warrant.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Officers arrested Turner and Lebr\u00f3n later that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Lieutenant Timothy Hickman, a Rockbridge County Sheriff\u2019s Deputy, searched appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s residence, pursuant to a search warrant. Hickman seized multiple gang-related items, as well as seven computers belonging to appellant. Hickman described the colors, items, and tattoos associated with the Latin Kings. He testified appellant had tattoos associated with the Latin Kings. Numerous photographs were found on appellant\u2019s computer depicting appellant, Lebr\u00f3n, and others wearing gang colors, black and yellow \u201cthree-sixty\u201d beads, and making Latin Kings hand gestures. Over five thousand items containing some indicia of gang affiliation were found on the seized computers, including documents listing \u201cKing Ceazan\u201d as the \u201cInca\u201d of the \u201cPennsylvania State Golden Crown Lion Tribe Almighty Latin King [and] Queen Nation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">At trial, Virginia State Police Special Agent Eric Vega, qualified as an expert in criminal street gangs, testified as to the history of the Almighty Latin King and Queen Nation (\u201cLatin Kings\u201d) and the structure of the gang. He told the trial court that the Latin Kings are known to engage in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>criminal activity, including money laundering and narcotics trafficking. The colors for the gang were black and gold or yellow, and the members wore black and yellow \u201cthree-sixty\u201d beads as part of their uniform. Vega identified color photographs, obtained during the search of appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s home, showing appellant wearing the black and yellow gang beads, wearing the colors for the gang, and giving a Latin Kings salute. Vega identified a photo of a tattoo on appellant\u2019s arm, depicting the name \u201cKing Ceazan.\u201d Vega told the trial court that \u201c[e]very [Latin King] has a [K]ing name and [this tattoo] is telling me that [appellant\u2019s] name is King Ceazan.\u201d Vega identified another of appellant\u2019s tattoos, depicting an individual wearing a five-pointed crown where the points on the crown were diamonds. Vega stated that the diamonds signified a person of \u201chigh\u201d rank in the Latin Kings. Vega noted that the convenience store\u2019s surveillance tape showed appellant wearing gang beads when he was inside the convenience store during one of the group\u2019s earlier visits prior to the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Special Agent Vega testified that \u201ctribes\u201d in each state represent the national Latin Kings organization and that each state or tribe has an assigned \u201cInca.\u201d The \u201cInca\u201d is the \u201ctop of the line, the boss,\u201d and \u201c[the Inca\u2019s] orders are not to be questioned.\u201d The Inca \u201censure[s] that the rules, regulations, [and] policies that they have within the structure are adhered to\u201d and that punishment for failure to adhere to gang rules can result in \u201canything from monetary fines to physical discipline[,] up to and including death.\u201d Special Agent Vega testified that within the Latin Kings, the phrase \u201cman up\u201d challenges a person\u2019s bravado, and \u201cmeans ... that person has to come through with what they said they were going to do.\u201d When used by a high-ranking gang member, the phrase is \u201cbasically an order, you know, what you have to do, you\u2019ve got to do it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Turner testified as a defense witness for both appellant and Lebr\u00f3n during the joint trial. He admitted he robbed the convenience store while armed with a BB gun. He told the trial court that appellant and Lebr\u00f3n were not involved in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>robbery and that appellant did not tell him to \u201cman up.\u201d He also testified that he was not a member of the Latin Kings and he could not remember whether he had ever seen appellant and Lebr\u00f3n wearing black and yellow beads. Turner, who was a juvenile at the time of the robbery, had known appellant for six or seven years. Appellant\u2019s mother and Turner\u2019s father had been friends before Turner\u2019s birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Dimitri Dunn, appellant\u2019s friend of four years, testified that Turner wore black and yellow beads and used Latin Kings hand signs. Deputy Sheriff C.J. Blaylock identified a photograph taken at the time of Turner\u2019s arrest, depicting a tattoo of a crown on Turner\u2019s body. Special Agent Vega testified that Turner had gang symbols on the jeans he wore to court for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Testifying in his defense at the joint trial, appellant admitted that he was a member of the Latin Kings, that his title was King Ceazan, and that he was at one time the \u201cInca\u201d for the Golden Crown Lion Tribe of Pennsylvania.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> He also stated that Lebr\u00f3n was on the Latin Kings council. Appellant admitted to the trial court that his first two statements to Investigator Funkhouser were not accurate. In his third statement, appellant stated he, Lebr\u00f3n, and Turner stopped at Turner\u2019s house and there Turner retrieved items of clothing that he later wore during the robbery. Appellant denied telling Turner to \u201cman up\u201d the day of the robbery and denied that Turner was a member of the Latin Kings. Appellant testified he did not know Turner planned to rob the convenience store and did not realize Turner had done so until he reentered appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s van after committing the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">At the conclusion of the trial, the trial court found the evidence established that appellant was an active participant in the robbery, that the Latin Kings was a criminal street gang, and that the robbery was committed \u201cin association <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>with\u201d the Latin Kings. It found that appellant\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with the statements he gave to Investigator Funkhouser and that appellant failed to explain his presence in the store ten to fifteen minutes before Turner committed the robbery. The trial court further found that appellant entered the store ten to fifteen minutes before Turner committed the robbery to \u201ccas[e]\u201d the store. It noted that appellant and Lebr\u00f3n wore gang colors on the day of the robbery. The trial court also found that Hunt\u2019s testimony that the firearms were clearly visible in appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s van was credible, that appellant, Turner, and Lebr\u00f3n went to Turner\u2019s house so Turner could obtain additional clothing, and that appellant heard Turner state prior to the robbery that he wanted money.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"A-8\">Sufficiency</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Appellant contends the evidence was not sufficient to convict him as a principal in the second degree of robbery, use of a firearm in the commission of robbery, and participating in a criminal act for the benefit of a criminal street gang.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">\u201cWhen a defendant challenges on appeal the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain his conviction, this Court \u2018has a duty to examine all the evidence that tends to support the conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hamilton v. Commonwealth, </em>279 Va. 94, 103, 688 S.E.2d 168, 173 (2010) (quoting <em>Bolden v. Commonwealth, 275 </em>Va. 144, 147, 654 S.E.2d 584, 586 (2008)). After viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the question is whether <em>\u201cany </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); <em>accord Corado v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 315, 337, 623 S.E.2d 452, 463 (2005). \u201cIf there is evidence to support the conviction, the reviewing court is not permitted to substitute its judgment, even if its view of the evidence might differ from the conclusions reached by the finder of fact at the trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Taylor, </em>256 Va. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>514, 518, 506 S.E.2d 312, 314 (1998). \u201cThe credibility of the witnesses and the weight accorded the evidence are matters solely for the fact finder who has the opportunity to see and hear that evidence as it is presented.\u201d <em>Sandoval v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 133, 138, 455 S.E.2d 730, 732 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">\u201c \u2018Circumstantial evidence [presented during the course of the trial] is as competent and is entitled to as much weight as direct evidence, provided it is sufficiently convincing to exclude every reasonable hypothesis except that of guilt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Holloway v. Commonwealth, </em>57 Va.App. 658, 665, 705 S.E.2d 510, 513 (2011) (quoting <em>Coleman v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 31, 53, 307 S.E.2d 864, 876 (1983)). \u201cThe statement that circumstantial evidence must exclude every reasonable theory of innocence is simply another way of stating that the Commonwealth has the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Hudson, </em>265 Va. 505, 513, 578 S.E.2d 781, 785 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">A. Robbery and Use of a Firearm in the Commission of Robbery</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Appellant contends the trial court erred in finding him guilty as a principal in the second degree of robbery and use of a firearm in the commission of robbery. He asserts there was no direct evidence that he participated in the robbery or knew that Turner was going to rob the convenience store.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">\u201cIt is a well-settled rule that a defendant is guilty as a principal in the second degree if he is guilty of some overt act done knowingly in furtherance of the commission of the crime, or if he shared in the criminal intent of the principal committing the crime.\u201d <em>McMorris v. Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 500, 505, 666 S.E.2d 348, 351 (2008).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In order to convict an accused as a principal in the second degree, the Commonwealth must prove \u201cthat the defendant procured, encouraged, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>countenanced, or approved the criminal act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 505, 666 S.E.2d at 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Here, the evidence presented at trial proved that throughout the day of August 16, 2009, appellant, Lebr\u00f3n, and Turner repeatedly entered the convenience store. Each wore gang colors and the black and yellow \u201cthree-sixty\u201d beads associated with the Latin Kings. Hunt, who was present for most of the day, saw two guns laying \u201c[b]arrel to butt\u201d in the van in which the men were riding, and heard appellant, Lebr\u00f3n, and Turner discuss that they needed money to buy marijuana. At some point during the evening prior to his departure from the group, Hunt heard appellant tell Turner that he needed to \u201cman up.\u201d Appellant permitted Lebr\u00f3n to drive appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s van to Turner\u2019s home so Turner could obtain additional clothing. Lebr\u00f3n was the driver of the van when the men returned to the area of the convenience store at approximately 11:00 p.m. Lebr\u00f3n parked the van where he was told to park it, out of sight from the convenience store. Appellant entered and surveyed the store prior to Turner\u2019s committing the robbery. Appellant was present when Turner came running back with a shirt on his head, carrying the cash register drawer he took from the convenience store. Appellant was present in the van when Lebr\u00f3n drove it away from the crime scene. He saw Turner throw the shirt covering his head out of the van window, and was present when Lebr\u00f3n stopped the van at a dumpster where Turner threw out the cash register drawer.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">From the record presented on appeal, we conclude that the trial court did not err in finding the evidence sufficient to prove appellant was guilty of robbery and use of a firearm in the commission of robbery as a principal in the second degree. <em>See Kelly v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 250, 257, 584 S.E.2d 444, 447 (2003) <em>(en </em>banc) (holding appropriate sufficiency of evidence question is whether \u201cany rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d (quoting <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. at 2789)).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>B. Criminal Street Gang</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Appellant contends the Latin Kings gang is not a criminal street gang as defined by Code \u00a7 18.2-46.1. He also contends that, even if the evidence was sufficient to show that the Latin Kings was a criminal street gang, the evidence was insufficient to show that the robbery was committed for the benefit of, in association with, or at the direction of the gang in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2^16.2.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-6\">\u201cCriminal street gang\u201d is defined by Code \u00a7 18.2-46.1 as: any ongoing organization, association, or group of three or more persons, whether formal or informal, (i) which has as one of its primary objectives or activities the commission of one or more criminal activities; (ii) which has an identifiable name or identifying sign or symbol; and (iii) whose members individually or collectively have engaged in the commission of, attempt to commit, conspiracy to commit, or solicitation of two or more predicate criminal acts, at least one of which is an act of violence, provided such acts were not part of a common act or transaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Code \u00a7 18.2-46.2(A) states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-8\">Any person who actively participates in or is a member of a criminal street gang and who knowingly and willfully participates in any predicate criminal act committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with any criminal street gang shall be guilty of a Class 5 felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJl\">The term \u201cpredicate criminal act\u201d is defined as, among other things, an \u201cact of violence\u201d as described in Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1(A), including first and second degree murder, robbery, and manufacturing, selling, giving, distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture, sell, give, or distribute a controlled substance as defined by Code \u00a7 18.2-248.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">1. Code \u00a7 18.2-46.1</p>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">We conclude from the record on appeal that the trial court did not err in finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the Latin Kings was, at the time of the robbery, a criminal street gang as defined by Code \u00a7 18.2-46.1. Special Agent Vega, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>qualified as an expert in criminal street gangs, testified that Latin Kangs gang members engage in criminal enterprises, including money laundering and narcotics trafficking, that the Latin Kings have adopted black and gold as the gang\u2019s identifying colors, that they wear the symbol of the \u201csacred crown\u201d and colored beads as part of their clothing attire, and that they use particular identifiable hand signs to identify themselves as gang members. Special Agent Vega also testified that, as required by Code \u00a7 18.2-46.1, members of the Latin Kings had engaged in at least two \u201cpredicate criminal acts\u201d that were not part of a common transaction, at least one of which was violent.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not err in finding the evidence presented was sufficient beyond a reasonable doubt to prove that the Latin Kings was a criminal street gang as defined by Code \u00a7 18.2-46.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">2. Code \u00a7 18.2-46.2</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">We further conclude from the record on appeal that the trial court did not err in finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the robbery was committed in association with and at the direction of the Latin Kings in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-46.2. In order to obtain a conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-46.2(A), the Commonwealth must prove three elements. First, the Commonwealth must prove that an accused \u201cactively participate^] in or [is] a member of a criminal street gang. Second, the [accused] must knowingly and willfully participate in the predicate criminal act. Third, the [predicate criminal] act must be committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with the gang.\u201d <em>Hamilton, </em>279 Va. at 108, 688 S.E.2d at 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">The record on appeal demonstrates that appellant, a high-ranking gang member, told Turner to \u201cman up,\u201d a command <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>used by the Latin Kings. In the Latin Kings gang language, the term \u201cman up\u201d is a command from a higher-ranking gang member to a lower-ranking gang member to engage in conduct as directed. Throughout the day of the robbery, appellant was seen on the surveillance video from the convenience store wearing the black and yellow \u201cthree-sixty\u201d beads associated with the Latin Kings. Additionally, the surveillance video showed Turner wearing the colors of the Latin Kings when he committed the robbery. The Commonwealth\u2019s gang expert witness testified that members of the Latin Kings only show their beads when they want others to know they are part of that street gang. We cannot say, based on the record before us on appeal, that \u201cno rational factfinder,\u201d <em>Haskins v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 1, 9, 602 S.E.2d 402, 406 (2004), would have come to the conclusion that the robbery was committed \u201cfor the benefit of, in association with, or at the direction of\u2019 a criminal street gang in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-46.2. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not err in finding the evidence sufficient to convict appellant of robbery \u201cfor the benefit of, in association with, or at the direction of\u2019 a criminal street gang in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-46.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm appellant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b574-9\">. Appellant and Lebr\u00f3n were convicted of identical crimes following a joint bench trial. Lebr\u00f3n also appealed his convictions to this Court. <em>See Lebron v.
