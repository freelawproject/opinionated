On appeal, Cole concedes he was already married to one woman when he married another, but argues he nonetheless should be acquitted as a matter of law. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-18\">Cole married Tammy Taylor in 1995. Without first divorcing Taylor, Cole went through a marriage ceremony with Donna Vincent in 2005. On the marriage license application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>form, Cole claimed he had not been previously married. A grand jury indicted Cole for bigamy. At his jury trial, Cole offered no factual defense to the charge and argued only a series of purely legal defenses. The trial court found the defenses meritless and entered a conviction order after the jury returned a guilty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">A. BIGAMY AS A \u201cLEGAL IMPOSSIBILITY\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Cole argues it is \u201clegally impossible\u201d for him to be convicted of bigamy under Code \u00a7 18.2-362. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 4. With respect to bigamy, Code \u00a7 18.2-362 makes it a criminal offense for any \u201cmarried\u201d person to \u201cmarry another person\u201d in the Commonwealth. Because bigamous marriages are legally void, Cole reasons, he did not \u201cmarry another person\u201d when he married his second wife. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 4. Under Cole\u2019s construct, therefore, Code \u00a7 18.2-362 is simply a legislative oxymoron\u2014an attempt to criminalize something (bigamous marriage) that does not legally exist. Neither he nor anyone else can be prosecuted under it.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">Cole\u2019s argument hinges on his interpretation of Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-38.1, 20-43, and 20-45.1, which declare bigamous \u201cmarriages\u201d void.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These statutes, Cole contends, \u201cmake it clear that no <em>legal </em>relationship can result from a ceremony of purported marriage where one of the parties is already married.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 5 (emphasis added). This observation, however, misses the point: Cole was prosecuted for entering into an <em>illegal, </em>not a legal, marital relationship. None of the statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>in Title 20 declaring bigamy void can fairly be read to decriminalize bigamy under Code \u00a7 18.2-362. To be sure, Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-38.1, 20-43, and 20-45.1 are all part of Chapter 3 of Title 20\u2014\u201centitled Unlawful Marriages Generally\u201d\u2014which includes its own criminal statute, Code \u00a7 20-40, making both bigamy and knowingly marrying a bigamist a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">Under settled principles, \u201cstatutes dealing with a specific subject must be construed together in order to arrive at the object sought to be accomplished.\u201d <em>Alston v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 759, 769, 652 S.E.2d 456, 462 (2007) (citation omitted). We interpret statutes not as \u201cisolated fragments of law\u201d but as part of a harmonious whole to \u201cmake the scheme consistent in all its parts and uniform in its operation, unless a different purpose is shown plainly or with irresistible clearness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We also presume the legislature did not intend to enact a \u201cmanifest absurdity,\u201d <em>Va. Emp\u2019t v. Cmty. Alts., </em>57 Va.App. 700, 706, 705 S.E.2d 530, 533 (2011) (citation omitted), and we interpret statutes to avoid such an anomalous conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Cole\u2019s interpretation of Code \u00a7 18.2-362, rather than explaining or giving meaning to the statutory text, would simply render it a nullity. Underlying Cole\u2019s argument is the unstated assumption that the law is conceptually inconsistent because it criminalizes bigamous marriage while simultaneously declaring it legally void. We disagree and conclude the law condemns bigamy as both illegal <em>and </em>void. By declaring a bigamous marriage void, the General Assembly did not preclude itself from also deeming the marriage criminally illegal. In other words, the fact \u201cthat Virginia does not recognize bigamous marriages,\u201d <em>Murphy v. Holland, </em>237 Va. 212, 219, 377 S.E.2d 363, 367 (1989), does not justify the <em>non sequitur </em>that such marriages cannot be criminalized.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">For centuries, the crime of bigamy has been understood in these terms. Virginia\u2019s statute closely tracks the bigamy statute of King James I, which provided: \u201cIf any person or persons ... being married, do at any time after marry any person or persons, the former husband or wife being alive, that then every such offense shall be felony, &amp; c.\u201d 3 Sir <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>Edward Coke, <em>Institutes of the Laws of England, </em>ch. 27, at 88 (4th ed. 1669) (modern spelling used); <em>see also </em>1 Jac., e. 11 (1603-04) (Eng.). The phrase \u201cdo at any time marry\u201d has historically been understood to mean that the \u201csecond marriage is merely void, <em>and yet </em>it maketh the offender a felon.\u201d 3 Coke, <em>supra, </em>ch. 27, at 88 (emphasis added and modem spelling used); <em>see also </em>4 William Blackstone, <em>Commentaries on the Laws of England </em>*163 (1769) (\u201cSuch second marriage, living the former husband or wife, is simply void, and a mere nullity, by the ecclesiastical law of England; <em>and yet </em>the legislature has thought it just to make it felony.\u201d (emphasis added)). In other words,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-4\">the validity of the second marriage does not affect the question. It is the appearing to contract a second marriage, and the going through the ceremony which constitutes the crime of bigamy, otherwise it could never exist in the ordinary cases, as a previous marriage always renders null and void a marriage that is celebrated afterwards by either of the parties during the lifetime of the other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-5\"><em>Regina v. Brawn, </em>174 Eng. Rep. 751 (N.P.) 752, 1 Car. &amp; K. 144, 145 (1843) (Denman, C.J.) (quoted in part by Rollin M. Perkins &amp; Ronald N. Boyce, <em>Criminal Law </em>456 n. 29 (3d ed.1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Historically \u201can offense of ecclesiastical cognizance,\u201d bigamy has been defined in Virginia as the \u201cstate of a man who has two wives, or of a woman who has two husbands, living at the same time.\u201d <em>Farewell v. Commonwealth, </em>167 Va. 475, 478, 189 S.E. 321, 323 (1937) (citation omitted). \u201cThe act of ceremoniously marrying one person when already legally married to another\u201d constitutes bigamy. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-7\">From these definitions and from like definitions given by the courts in numerous cases, it will be seen that the essential of the offense consists of a <em>second marriage </em>of a person who already has a living consort. <em>The overt act is entering into the second marriage. </em>Bigamy is committed whenever and wherever such <em>second marriage </em>is performed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVG\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 478-79, 189 S.E. at 323 (emphasis added) (applying Code of 1936, \u00a7 4538, which contained essentially the same statutory text now codified in Code \u00a7 18.2-362); <em>accord Adkins v. Commonwealth, </em>175 Va. 590, 598, 9 S.E.2d 349, 352 (1940). Thus, Virginia follows the traditional view that \u201ca bigamous marriage is void <em>ab initio </em>\u201d and yet \u201cpersons who engage in such a marriage may be subject to criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>Hager v. Hager, </em>3 Va.App. 415, 416-17, 349 S.E.2d 908, 909 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">B. CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Cole also raises several constitutional challenges to his bigamy conviction, claiming violations of \u201chis due process and equal protection rights, as well as his right against cruel and unusual punishment\u201d under the United States Constitution. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 9. We find these arguments unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">\n<em>Du# Process\u2014Statute Void for Vagueness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">Cole\u2019s due process argument contends the bigamy statute, Code \u00a7 18.2-362, should be declared void for vagueness. \u201cAn enactment may be found void for vagueness ... if [it] \u2018fails to provide people of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits\u2019 ... [or] if \u2018it authorizes or even encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Boyd v. Cnty. of Henrico, </em>42 Va.App. 495, 517, 592 S.E.2d 768, 779 (2004) <em>(en </em>banc) (citation omitted); <em>see also Tjan v. Commonwealth, </em>46 Va.App. 698, 707-08, 621 S.E.2d 669, 673 (2005). Neither prong of the void-for-vagueness doctrine is implicated in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">Code \u00a7 18.2-362 provides persons of \u201cordinary intelligence,\u201d <em>Boyd, </em>42 Va.App. at 517, 592 S.E.2d at 779 (citation omitted), fair warning of the unlawful conduct. The \u201cunambiguous language of Code \u00a7 18.2-362,\u201d <em>Stuart v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 216, 218, 397 S.E.2d 533, 534 (1990), prohibits bigamous marriage. We do not believe a person of ordinary intelligence would adopt the circular thesis that \u201ca marriage while married is not a marriage,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 10, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>thereafter find himself hopelessly confused about the criminality of bigamy.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">Nor do we believe Code \u00a7 18.2-362 \u201cauthorizes or even encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201d <em>Boyd, </em>42 Va.App. at 517, 592 S.E.2d at 779 (citation omitted). What the vagueness doctrine \u201cforbids is a law that, by its expansive sweep of language, enacts an elastic definition of illegality\u2014 one that authorizes an officer to define for himself what is and is not legal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 521, 592 S.E.2d at 781. Cole, however, does not argue the text of Code \u00a7 18.2-362 oscillates between legality and illegality. He contends the statute very clearly criminalizes nothing. What he finds objectionable is not the arbitrary enforcement of the bigamy statute against some but not others, but rather the enforcement of the statute against anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">\n<em>Equal Protection\u2014Alternative Charge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-362 violates equal protection principles, Cole asserts, because another statute, Code \u00a7 20-38.1, also criminalizes bigamy. The former constitutes a felony, the latter a misdemeanor. No rational distinction, Cole contends, exists between the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">We disagree. Several factors distinguish Code \u00a7 18.2-362, the felony, from Code \u00a7 20-38.1, punished as a misdemeanor under Code \u00a7 20-40. Code \u00a7 18.2-362 prohibits a married person, \u201cduring the life of the husband or wife,\u201d from \u201cmarry[ing] another person.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-38.1(1) prohibits a \u201cmarriage entered into prior to the dissolution of an earlier marriage of one of the parties.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-8\">While the felony, Code \u00a7 18.2-362, applies only to a person who, while already married, marries again, the misdemean- or, Code \u00a7 20-38.1, is broader in scope and applies to any person, whether married or not, who enters into a marriage before the dissolution of an earlier marriage of one of the parties. However, the mere fact that the defendant may also have committed a lesser offense does not preclude the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>Commonwealth from charging a greater offense arising out of the same act or transaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-5\"><em>Stuart, </em>11 Va.App. at 218-19, 397 S.E.2d at 534 (citing <em>Bradshaw v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 484, 492, 323 S.E.2d 567, 572 (1984)). Thus, Code \u00a7 18.2-362, the felony, applies only to bigamists; Code \u00a7 20-38.1, the misdemeanor, applies to bigamists and those who marry bigamists.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The available defenses are also different, thus providing the prosecution with different paths to a conviction depending on the circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-7\">The defenses found in \u00a7 18.2-364 do not apply to a bigamy prosecution under \u00a7\u00a7 20-38.1 and 20-40. Since both parties to the prohibited conduct have equally violated \u00a7 20-40, and since the Commonwealth need not prove knowledge of the earlier marriage on the part of the formerly unmarried party, \u00a7 20-40 might be preferred in prosecuting that party. Where the defendant\u2019s conduct violates both \u00a7 18.2-362 and \u00a7 20-38.1, the Commonwealth may select either charge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">Ronald J. Bacigal, <em>Criminal Offenses &amp; Defenses </em>290 (2010-11 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">Because bigamists \u201ccannot claim membership in any insular and discrete suspect class or assert a violation of any fundamental right,\u201d <em>Lilly v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 173, 181, 647 S.E.2d 517, 521 (2007), bigamy statutes can be invalidated only if they offend principles of minimum rationality. Minimum rationality affords statutes a \u201cstrong presumption of validity\u201d and requires courts to uphold them \u201cif there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.\u201d <em>Gray v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 290, 308, 645 S.E.2d 448, 459 (2007) (citations omitted). \u201c[T]he Commonwealth \u2018has no obligation to produce evidence to sustain the rationality\u2019 of the challenged classification because the \u2018burden is on the one attacking the legislative arrangement to negative every conceivable basis which might support it.\u2019\u201d <em>Lilly, </em>50 Va.App. at 182, 647 S.E.2d at 521 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>Because the scope of Code \u00a7 18.2-362 differs from Code \u00a7 20-38.1, the statutes do not facially criminalize the same conduct in all of their applications. That they overlap in some cases does not render them constitutionally invalid. As a general rule, the fact that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-4\">separate statutes may overlap in their proscription of specific conduct does not detract from their independent enforcement except when double jeopardy concerns are implicated. [W]hen an act violates more than one criminal statute, the Government may prosecute under either so long as it does not discriminate against any class of defendants. Whether to prosecute and what charge to file or bring before a grand jury are decisions that generally rest in the prosecutor\u2019s discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-5\"><em>George v. Commonwealth, </em>51 Va.App. 137, 143, 655 S.E.2d 43, 46 (2008) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>McDonald v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 249, 259, 645 S.E.2d 918, 923 (2007)). We thus see no reason, constitutional or otherwise, why an \u201cattorney for the Commonwealth may [not] elect to proceed under either statute.\u201d John L. Costello, <em>Virginia Criminal Law &amp; Procedure </em>\u00a7 5.12, at 121 (4th ed.2008) (addressing felony and misdemeanor bigamy statutes).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">\n<em>Cruel and Unusual Punishment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Cole asserts his two-year sentence violates the Eight Amendment\u2019s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">The Eighth Amendment \u201cprohibits the imposition of inherently barbaric punishments under all circumstances.\u201d <em>Graham v. Florida, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 130 S.Ct. 2011, 2021, 176 L.Ed.2d 825 (2010). The United States Supreme Court, however, has never found a non-life \u201csentence for a term of years within the limits authorized by statute to be, by itself, a cruel and unusual punishment\u201d in violation of the Eighth Amendment. <em>Hutto v. Davis, </em>454 U.S. 370, 372, 102 S.Ct. 703, 704, 70 L.Ed.2d 556 (1982) <em>(per </em>curiam) (quoting with approv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>al <em>Davis v. Davis, </em>585 F.2d 1226, 1229 (4th Cir.1978)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And for good reason: \u201c[T]he excessiveness of one prison term as compared to another is invariably a subjective determination, there being no clear way to make \u2018any constitutional distinction between one term of years and a shorter or longer term of years.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hutto, </em>454 U.S. at 373, 102 S.Ct. at 705 (citation omitted).
