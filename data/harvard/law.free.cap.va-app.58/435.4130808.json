She does not claim she was wrongly convicted or innocent of the crime. Instead, Taylor argues the trial court erred by not using its \u201cinherent discretion and authority\u201d to acquit her of grand larceny and substitute in its place a lesser crime of petit larceny. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 4. The trial court held it had no such power. We agree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-13\">A grand jury indicted Taylor for grand larceny. The evidence at Taylor\u2019s bench trial proved she stole more than $200 of merchandise from a Sears store. After hearing closing arguments, the trial court pronounced Taylor guilty of grand larceny. Taylor\u2019s counsel asked if the court would \u201centertain a motion at the time of sentencing to find her guilty of a misdemeanor versus a felony.\u201d App. at 106. The court did not answer the question directly but stated it would \u201chear whatever evidence you have at sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Shortly after the trial, the court entered an order reciting that \u201c[a]t the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>conclusion of the evidence\u201d presented at trial, the court found Taylor guilty of grand larceny and continued the case for sentencing. <em>See </em>Order (May 18, 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">At the sentencing hearing, Taylor\u2019s counsel made a \u201cmotion to reduce this to a misdemeanor.\u201d App. at 110-11. Counsel conceded, however, there was \u201cno legal basis\u201d for the motion given that the court had already concluded Taylor was \u201cinvolved\u201d in the theft and the property stolen \u201cexceeded $200.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 113. Nevertheless, counsel argued, Taylor had assisted law enforcement in another matter. For that reason, counsel said, \u201cwe\u2019re asking the Court to consider reducing the ultimate charge to a misdemeanor, perhaps even deferring findings for a year\u2019s worth of probation and then deciding whether to reduce the charge, and I do believe the Court has the discretion to do that whether or not\u2014the Commonwealth objects or not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 115. The prosecutor opposed Taylor\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">The trial court pointed out the $200 threshold for grand larceny and the court\u2019s ability to defer and dismiss criminal charges were \u201clegislative decisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 116. Taylor\u2019s counsel then suggested the court could \u201crevisit\u201d its earlier factfinding and declare the stolen property\u2019s value to be less than $200. <em>Id. </em>The court rejected the suggestion as a pretextual effort to call a \u201cduck a dog.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cI would be happy to do that if that was provided for in the law,\u201d the trial judge explained, \u201cbut I think what I would have to do is create a fiction to go outside, and when the Commonwealth\u2014it is their role in the system to determine the charge, and then it\u2019s my role to determine whether the evidence meets the charge. If it didn\u2019t, I would have found the defendant not guilty, but I\u2019ll have to deny your motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 116-17.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">On appeal, Taylor argues the court \u201cerred by concluding that it did not have the inherent discretion and authority to find appellant guilty of a misdemeanor <em>despite </em>its finding that the value of the stolen property was $200.00 or more.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 4 (emphasis added). Put another way, Taylor contends the trial court erred by not using its inherent discretion to acquit her of grand larceny\u2014a crime the evidence proved beyond a reasonable doubt she committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">We reject Taylor\u2019s argument as inconsistent with first principles of judicial power. A Virginia court\u2019s authority comes from one of three sources: (i) the express and implied powers invested in the judiciary by the Virginia Constitution; (ii) the inherent common law authority inherited from England at the time of our Commonwealth\u2019s founding; and (iii) specific legislative enactments by the General Assembly. None of these sources of power authorized the trial court in this case to acquit Taylor of grand larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">A. <em>THE VIRGINIA CONSTITUTION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Adopted over a decade before the United States Constitution, the 1776 Virginia Declaration of Rights provided that \u201cthe legislative and executive powers of the State should be separate and distinct from the judiciary.\u201d Va. Decl. of Rights \u00a7 5 (1776); <em>see also </em>Va. Const. \u00b6 2 (1776). The original principle has endured to this day, ensuring that the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government \u201cshall be separate and distinct\u201d and that no one branch could \u201cexercise the powers properly belonging to the others.\u201d Va. Const. art. III \u00a7 1 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">The separate and independent status of the judiciary in the Commonwealth\u2019s tripartite system of government implies certain inherent powers \u201cincident to the exercise of judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>power\u201d vested in the courts. 2 A.E. Dick Howard, <em>Commentaries on the Constitution of Virginia </em>718-20 (1974) (citation omitted). Such powers include, for example, the \u201cauthority to discipline attorneys,\u201d <em>In re Moseley, </em>273 Va. 688, 697, 643 S.E.2d 190, 195 (2007), the power of summary contempt, <em>Robinson v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 137, 145, 583 S.E.2d 60, 64 (2003), and the power to continue a case for a lawful disposition at a later date, <em>Hernandez v. Commonwealth, </em>281 Va. 222, 226, 707 S.E.2d 273, 275 (2011); <em>Moreau v. Fuller, </em>276 Va. 127, 137, 661 S.E.2d 841, 846-47 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">But nothing in the separation-of-powers doctrine suggests a court has the inherent power to acquit a defendant of a crime that the evidence proved beyond a reasonable doubt she committed. To be sure, just the opposite is true. The assertion of a power to acquit the guilty rests upon the fallacy \u201cthat the power to enforce begets inherently a discretion to permanently refuse to do so.\u201d <em>Ex parte United States, </em>242 U.S. 27, 42, 37 S.Ct. 72, 74, 61 L.Ed. 129 (1916); see <em>also Ex parte United States, </em>287 U.S. 241, 250, 53 S.Ct. 129, 132, 77 L.Ed. 283 (1932). The asserted power stands in defiance of, not in conformity with, the separation-of-powers doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">As the United States Supreme Court has explained, the constitutional \u201cdistribution of powers\u201d is unbalanced when the judiciary relies on \u201celements of consideration which would be otherwise beyond the scope of judicial authority\u201d under statutes governing matters of crime and punishment. <em>Ex parte United States, </em>242 U.S. at 42, 37 S.Ct. at 74.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">[T]he disregard of the Constitution which would result from sustaining the proposition is made if possible plainer by considering that, if it be that the plain legislative command fixing a specific punishment for crime is subject to be permanently set aside by an implied judicial power upon considerations extraneous to the legality of the conviction, it would seem necessarily to follow that there could be likewise implied a discretionary authority to permanently refuse to try a criminal charge because of the conclusion that a particular act made criminal by law ought not to be treated as criminal. And thus it would come to pass that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>possession by the judicial department of power to permanently refuse to enforce a law would result in the destruction of the conceded powers of the other departments and hence leave no law to be enforced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-5\"><em>Id.; see also Sorrells v. United States, </em>287 U.S. 435, 449-50, 53 S.Ct. 210, 215-16, 77 L.Ed. 413 (1932); <em>accord </em>The Federalist No. 78 (Alexander Hamilton) (\u201cThe courts must declare the sense of the law; and if they should be disposed to exercise WILL instead of JUDGMENT, the consequence would equally be the substitution of their pleasure to that of the legislative body.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">For this reason, a court simply has no \u201cauthority to free guilty defendants,\u201d <em>Sorrells, </em>287 U.S. at 449, 53 S.Ct. at 215, whose guilt was proved in a lawful trial. When a \u201cdefendant has been duly indicted for an offense found to be within the statute, and the proper authorities seek to proceed with the prosecution, the court cannot refuse to try the case in the constitutional method because it desires to let the defendant go free.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 450, 53 S.Ct. at 215-16. Such a practice \u201cis inconsistent with the Constitution, since its exercise <em>in the very nature of things </em>amounts to a refusal by the judicial power to perform a duty resting upon it and, as a consequence thereof, to an interference with both the legislative and executive authority as fixed by the Constitution.\u201d <em>Ex parte United States, </em>242 U.S. at 50-52, 37 S.Ct. at 78 (emphasis added) (declaring unlawful the practice then called \u201claying the case on file\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">We agree with the reasoning of the United States Supreme Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Virginia Constitution vests the General Assembly with the final authority to define the elements of a crime and, by negative implication, to identify the host of impermissible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>judicial \u201cconsiderations extraneous to the legality of the conviction,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 37, 37 S.Ct. at 72, which have nothing to do with the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence. Virginia courts have no authority to \u201cevaluate the \u2018propriety, wisdom, necessity and expediency\" of legislation.\u201d <em>Laurels of Bon Air, LLC v. Med. Facilities of Am. LIV Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>51 Va.App. 583, 599, 659 S.E.2d 561, 569 (2008) (citation omitted). Faithful to this tradition of judicial self-restraint, a Virginia court cannot refuse to convict a guilty defendant merely because it questions the category of offense assigned by the legislature, considers the range of statutory punishment too harsh, or believes certain guilty offenders undeserving of a criminal conviction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cJudicial nullification\u201d of a constitutionally valid criminal statute \u201chas, happily, no place in our system.\u201d <em>Sorrells, </em>287 U.S. at 450, 53 S.Ct. at 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Equally important, the Virginia Constitution vests Commonwealth Attorneys with \u201cthe discretion to decide under which of several applicable statutes the charges shall be instituted.\u201d <em>In re Horan, </em>271 Va. 258, 264, 634 S.E.2d 675, 679 (2006) (citation omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Absent an unconstitutional abuse of that discretion, Virginia judges have no authority to substitute their judgment for the prosecutor\u2019s on such matters. <em>See Boyd v. Cnty. of Henrico, </em>42 Va.App. 495, 522, 592 S.E.2d 768, 781 (2004) <em>(en banc </em>).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>The Governor, moreover, has the exclusive constitutional power to \u201cgrant reprieves and pardons\u201d after conviction. <em>See </em>Va. Const. art. V \u00a7 12. The Virginia judiciary \u201cmay not assume a power of clemency or pardon which is a unique function of executive power.\u201d <em>Moreau, </em>276 Va. at 136, 661 S.E.2d at 846; <em>see also Sorrells, </em>287 U.S. at 449, 53 S.Ct. at 215 (\u201cClemency is the function of the Executive.\u201d). The claim that the judiciary shares these powers \u201clacks historical justification\u201d and seeks to justify an indirect, but effectual, \u201cinfringement upon the pardoning power.\u201d Note, <em>The Inherent Power of Criminal Courts to Control Their Sentences, </em>12 Colum. L.Rev. 543, 544 (1912).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">B. <em>THE COMMON LAW</em></p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Taylor also contends our analysis would be incomplete if we failed to consider the common law. Under common law principles, Taylor argues, a trial court has the discretion to make a \u201creduction of charges without regard to the facts proven at trial,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 9, and, in essence, acquit a defendant of a crime that the evidence proved beyond a reasonable doubt she committed. We agree with Taylor\u2019s opening premise\u2014that we should consult the common law\u2014 but find no support for her conclusion that the common law authorized a trial court to acquit a criminal defendant after finding the evidence proved her guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">\u201cThe common law of England, insofar as it is not repugnant to the principles of the Bill of Rights and Constitution of this Commonwealth, shall continue in full force within the same, and be the rule of decision, except as altered by the General Assembly.\u201d Code \u00a7 1-200 (recodifying former Code \u00a7 1-10); <em>see Satterwhite v. Commonwealth, </em>56 Va.App. 557, 560, 695 S.E.2d 555, 556-57 (2010). This principle is older than the Commonwealth itself. <em>See </em>W. Hamilton Bryson, <em>Virginia Civil Procedure </em>47 (3d ed.1997) (tracing Virginia\u2019s adoption of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>common law to the royal instructions to the Virginia Company which planted the colony at Jamestown).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">In Virginia, \u201cour adoption of English common law, and the rights and benefits of all writs in aid of English common law, ends in 1607 upon the establishment of the first permanent English settlement in America, Jamestown.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Morris, </em>281 Va. 70, 82, 705 S.E.2d 503, 508 (2011). As many courts have noted, Sir William Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries on the Laws of England were accepted by the Founders \u201cas the most satisfactory exposition of the common law of England.\u201d <em>Schick v. United States, </em>195 U.S. 65, 69, 24 S.Ct. 826, 827, 49 L.Ed. 99 (1904). Nowhere in his four-volume work does Blackstone describe any common law judicial power to acquit the guilty. To the contrary, the common law does \u201cnot permit, that in criminal cases a power should be lodged in any judge, to construe the law otherwise than according to the letter.\u201d 1 William Blackstone, <em>Commentaries </em>*92. When a defendant contends the letter of the law \u201cinduces any apparent hardship,\u201d Blackstone explained, \u201cthe crown has the power to pardon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under such circumstances, a common law court\u2019s only authority was to offer the defendant a temporary \u201creprieve\u201d of judgment while he sought an executive pardon. 4 Blackstone, <em>Commentaries </em>*394. This limited common law power, the United States Supreme Court has emphasized, cannot be converted \u201cinto the existence of an arbitrary judicial power to permanently refuse to enforce the law.\u201d <em>Ex parte United States, </em>242 U.S. at 44, 37 S.Ct. at 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">So strong was this principle that it precluded common law courts from suspending any portion of a criminal sentence absent express statutory authorization:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\">The power of courts to suspend sentence, this phrase being frequently employed as meaning either delay in the imposition of a sentence for crime or the staying of execution of the sentence imposed, has been much discussed. <em>The weight of authority appears to be that, under the common law, courts do not possess the power to delay the imposition or execution of sentences for crime, except temporarily, as for instance, in order to give time for motions for new trial, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number><em>writs of error, or to determine the precise sentence to be imposed.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-5\"><em>Richardson v. Commonwealth, </em>131 Va. 802, 808, 109 S.E. 460, 461-62 (1921) (emphasis added) (relying on <em>Ex parte United States, </em>242 U.S. at 51-52, 37 S.Ct. at 78-79).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">If the common law precluded trial courts from suspending a criminal sentence without express statutory authority, then, <em>a fortiori, </em>it is inconceivable the common law would nonetheless authorize courts to refuse to convict a criminal defendant (for reasons wholly unrelated to guilt or innocence) where the defendant\u2019s guilt was proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Under English common law, only the crown had the prerogative power of pardon. There simply was no such thing as a judicial pardon. <em>See Ex Parte United States, </em>242 U.S. at 43-52, 37 S.Ct. at 74-79.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">On appeal, Taylor concedes she has no legal authority for asserting common law courts had the power to acquit a guilty defendant. <em>See </em>Oral Argument Audio at 3:20 to 4:13. Undeterred by this admission, however, Taylor contends we should simply declare by <em>ipse dixit </em>that the power is within our common law authority. The assumption underlying this request, however, presupposes the common law is not merely a library of discrete legal principles honed over centuries of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>judicial application\u2014but is instead a metaphor of judicial lawmaking power, one which we may rely upon to enact improvements in the unwritten law or to justify innovations on topics not specifically addressed by statutes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We do not share this view of the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">In his 1808 edition of Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries, St. George Tucker acknowledged a certain elasticity in the incorporation of English common law into the <em>corpus </em>of our law at the time of the 1776 Virginia Constitutional Convention. English common law, Tucker explained, governed Virginians only \u201cso far as the same were applicable to the nature of their situation and circumstances____\u201d 1 St. George Tucker, <em>Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries, </em>Editor\u2019s App. Note E at 432 (1803). As heirs of this tradition, Virginia jurists are free to trim off or excise altogether those aspects of English common law which \u201care repugnant to the nature and character of our political system, or which the different and varied circumstances of our country render inapplicable to us,\u201d <em>Weishaupt v. Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 389, 400, 315 S.E.2d 847, 852 (1984) (citation and emphasis omitted), as those aspects \u201care either not in force here, or must be so modified in their application as to adapt them to our condition,\u201d <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Unless a common law maxim fails the repugnancy test, Tucker continued, it \u201cremained in full force ... until repealed, altered, or amended by the <em>legislative authority </em>of the colonies, respectively; or by the constitutional acts of the same, when they became sovereign and independent states.\u201d 1 Tucker, <em>Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries, </em>Editor\u2019s App. Note E at 432 (emphasis added). From 1776 until today, Virginia law has recognized this distinction. Unless \u201crepugnant\u201d to the principles of our constitutional republic, English common law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>governs \u201cexcept as altered by the General Assembly.\u201d Code \u00a7 1-200.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Framed from this perspective, simply restating Taylor\u2019s request should be sufficient to refute it. She asks us to recognize\u2014for the first time\u2014a common law power of a Virginia court to acquit a criminal defendant whose guilt has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Nothing in English common law or, for that matter, the \u201ccommon law developed in Virginia\u201d after Jamestown, <em>Morris, </em>281 Va. at 82, 705 S.E.2d at 508-09, authorizes the assertion of such an anomalous judicial power.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">C. <em>STATUTORY AUTHORITY</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">In various contexts, the General Assembly has authorized trial courts in Virginia to acquit a defendant of a criminal offense for reasons unrelated to guilt or innocence if certain statutory conditions are met. The General Assembly \u201cis presumed to have known and to have had the common law in mind\u201d when enacting statutes. <em>Jenkins v. Mehra, </em>281 Va. 37, 44, 704 S.E.2d 577, 581 (2011) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The enactment of these statutes demonstrates the General Assembly correctly concluded no common law precedent authorized such extraordinary relief and that, if Virginia courts were to have this power, it must be granted by statute.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Because statutes in derogation of the common law must be \u201cstrictly construed\u201d and not \u201cenlarged\u201d beyond their \u201cexpress terms,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 45, 704 S.E.2d at 581 (citation omitted), the trial court correctly refused to apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>any of these statutes to Taylor\u2019s grand larceny charge\u2014a crime none of the statutes specifically address.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, the trial court had no statutory authority to grant the relief she requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">D. <em>MOREAU &amp; HERNANDEZ</em></p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Finally, Taylor argues our reasoning cannot be reconciled with <em>Moreau v. Fuller, </em>276 Va. 127, 661 S.E.2d 841 (2008), and <em>Hernandez v. Commonwealth, </em>281 Va. 222, 707 S.E.2d 273 (2011). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">Neither <em>Moreau </em>nor <em>Hernandez </em>addressed the issue before us. In <em>Moreau, </em>a Commonwealth Attorney sought a mandamus remedy to preclude a district court judge from continuing a case and to compel the judge to issue a final decision. The Virginia Supreme Court denied the relief because continuing a case for purposes of \u201crendering judgment\u201d involves a discretionary, not ministerial, act outside the scope of mandamus. <em>Moreau, </em>276 Va. at 138, 661 S.E.2d at 847.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">But \u201c[w]hat may in a proper case be reasonably subject to challenge,\u201d <em>Moreau </em>clarified, \u201cis whether the judge may decline to render judgment and continue the case with or without terms akin to probation status with the promise from the court of a particular disposition at a later date.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 137, 661 S.E.2d at 847. \u201cHowever, the case before us does <em>not </em>present such questions,\u201d <em>Moreau </em>held, because the record did not show the district court employed this practice. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). To further underscore the point, three justices in <em>Moreau </em>emphasized the authority of a trial court to defer and dismiss criminal charges without statutory authority \u201cis the precise question that the Court does not answer today <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>because it is not properly before us. The Court\u2019s inability to address this issue should <em>not </em>be viewed as a tacit approval of the practice.\u201d <em>Moreau, </em>276 Va. at 140, 661 S.E.2d at 848 (Kinser, J., concurring) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\"><em>Hernandez </em>did little more than \u201crevisit\u201d <em>Moreau </em>in \u201ca different factual context.\u201d <em>Hernandez, </em>281 Va. at 223, 707 S.E.2d at 273. Holding only that a trial court had the discretionary authority to continue a case on its docket for a future decision, <em>Hernandez </em>left unresolved the question unaddressed in <em>Moreau. </em>\u201cIn <em>Moreau, </em>we left open the question whether a court may defer judgment and continue a case with a <em>promise </em>of a particular disposition at a later date. That question was not before the Court in <em>Moreau </em>and <em>is not before us here, </em>as neither case involved such a promise.\u201d <em>Hernandez, </em>281 Va. at 225, 707 S.E.2d at 274 (citation omitted and second emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">If anything, <em>Hernandez </em>supports our reasoning. \u201cWe agree with the Court of Appeals\u2019 observation in the present case,\u201d <em>Hernandez </em>acknowledges, \u201cthat once a court has entered a judgment of conviction of a crime, the question of the penalty to be imposed is entirely within the province of the legislature, and the court has no inherent authority to depart from the range of punishment legislatively prescribed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 225, 707 S.E.2d at 275. In our case, Taylor\u2019s request went beyond merely questioning the penalty and asking the trial court to depart from the range of punishment authorized by statute. Taylor wanted a downward departure in the <em>charge itself. </em>If a trial court lacks the inherent authority to reduce a sentence below the statutory range, it likewise has no inherent authority to reduce or dismiss the criminal charge altogether when the evidence proves guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">In short, <em>Moreau </em>and <em>Hernandez </em>merely hold a trial court has the discretion to continue a case for a future disposition. Neither case addresses what future disposition the court has authority to impose. In other words, neither <em>Moreau </em>nor <em>Hernandez </em>addressed whether the decision ultimately made by the trial court, after the discretionary continuance, could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>one acquitting a criminal defendant whose guilt was proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Cf. Ex parte United States, </em>242 U.S. at 46, 37 S.Ct. at 76 (recognizing the inherent power of a court to order a \u201cmere postponement\u201d in the entry of a final order but denying any such power exists as a pretext for granting a criminal defendant \u201ca pardon for his crime\u201d (citation omitted)). Given the limited scope of <em>Moreau </em>and <em>Hernandez, </em>we disagree with Taylor\u2019s claim that either case supports her challenge to the trial court\u2019s decision in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">In sum, the trial court correctly held it had no authority\u2014 constitutional, common law, or statutory\u2014to acquit Taylor of grand larceny after finding the evidence proved her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. We thus affirm her conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b484-7\">. For our purposes, it is inconsequential that the trial court entered the written conviction order a few days after orally pronouncing Taylor guilty at the conclusion of the trial. \"The rendition of a judgment must be distinguished from its entry on the court records. The rendition of a judgment duly pronounced is the judicial act of the court, and the entry or recording of the instrument memorializing the judgment 'does not constitute an integral part of, and should not be confused with, the judgment itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jefferson v.
