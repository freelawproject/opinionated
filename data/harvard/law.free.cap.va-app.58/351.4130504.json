On appeal, Dickerson argues the evidence was insufficient to convict him of this crime. Because Dickerson did not properly preserve this argument, we affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>In early April of 2009, a police officer for the City of Hampton arrested Dickerson for public intoxication after finding him passed out in a car blocking the driveway of a private residence. As the officer removed Dickerson from the car to arrest him, the officer noticed a scale with what appeared to be marijuana residue on it near Dickerson\u2019s left thigh. The officer searched Dickerson incident to his arrest and discovered marijuana and cocaine in his pockets.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The officer testified to these facts at a bench trial. At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, Dickerson made a motion to strike the evidence \u201cbased on the insufficiency of the evidence,\u201d but argued only that the police unlawfully searched him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Subsequently, Dickerson testified that he had no idea where the cocaine came from, that it was not in his pockets, and that it was not his. Dickerson never made a motion to strike after the close of all the evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Instead, Dickerson\u2019s counsel made a one-sentence closing argument, saying, \u201cYour Honor, my client indicates clearly under oath that that was not his cocaine, that he never possessed that cocaine and I would submit it to the Court with that.\u201d Evidently choosing to believe the officer and disbelieve Dickerson, the trial court found Dickerson guilty of cocaine possession. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Rule 5A:18 states<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>: \u201cNo ruling of the trial court ... will be considered as a basis for reversal unless the objection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>was stated together with the grounds therefor at the time of the ruling----\u201d \u201cNot just any objection will do. It must be both <em>specific </em>and timely\u2014so that the trial judge would know the particular point being made in time to do something about it.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 741, 750, 607 S.E.2d 738, 742, <em>adopted upon reh\u2019g en banc, </em>45 Va.App. 811, 613 S.E.2d 870 (2005). \u201cThe goal of the contemporaneous objection rule is to avoid unnecessary appeals, reversals and mistrials by allowing the trial judge to intelligently consider an issue and, if necessary, to take corrective action.\u201d <em>Campbell v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 476, 480, 405 S.E.2d 1, 2 (1991) (en banc) (citing <em>Head v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 163, 167, 348 S.E.2d 423, 426 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">In <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 412, 368 S.E.2d 293 (1988), a divided panel of this Court held that while a motion to strike made at the close of all the evidence could preserve a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence in a bench trial, a closing argument could not. <em>Id. </em>at 413-14, 368 S.E.2d at 293-94. However, this Court subsequently reversed that holding in <em>Campbell, </em>12 Va.App. 476, 405 S.E.2d 1, holding that an appellant has preserved a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence in a bench trial when he makes an appropriate argument in a motion to strike at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence and then renews this argument in closing. <em>Id. </em>at 478, 405 S.E.2d at 1-2. We have therefore held since <em>Campbell </em>that an appropriate argument made during closing, or \u201csummation,\u201d will preserve a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence in a bench trial. <em>E.g., Delaney v. Commonwealth, </em>55 Va.App. 64, 66, 683 S.E.2d 834, 835 (2009) (citing <em>Howard v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 473, 478, 465 S.E.2d 142, 144 (1995)); <em>Howard, </em>21 Va.App. at 478, 465 S.E.2d at 144 (citing <em>Campbell, </em>12 Va.App. at 478-81, 405 S.E.2d at 1-3).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>However, not every argument made in summation is an argument attacking the sufficiency of the evidence. As the Court explained in <em>Campbell, </em>a \u201cclosing argument may address other issues,\u201d such as \u201ca statute of limitations, an affirmative defense or <em>the weight of the evidence.\u201d Campbell, 12 </em>Va.App. at 481, 405 S.E.2d at 3 (emphasis added). Generally, a closing argument focused only on the factual persuasiveness of the evidence, that is, the credibility of the witnesses or the weight of the evidence, is distinct from a challenge to the legal sufficiency of the evidence. A sufficiency challenge requires the trial court to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. <em>Cf. Cooper v. Commonwealth, </em>54 Va.App. 558, 562, 680 S.E.2d 361, 363 (2009) (discussing the sufficiency standard of review employed by an appellate court). \u201cViewing the [evidence] through this evidentiary prism requires [the trial court] to \u2018discard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences to be drawn therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Parks v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 492, 498, 270 S.E.2d 755, 759 (1980)). An argument <em>on the merits, </em>however, employs a very different evidentiary prism. This argument asks the trial court to reject any of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence that is inconsistent with the accused\u2019s theory of the case and to accept instead the accused\u2019s interpretation of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">In light of the different arguments that the accused could present to the trial court, Rule 5A:18 requires the accused to <em>specifically </em>raise a legal challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence in order to preserve that issue for appeal. Generally, this is easily achieved when the accused makes a motion to strike the evidence. By utilizing that device, the accused has a better opportunity to adequately alert the trial court to both the relief being sought and, as importantly, the basis for that relief.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, when the accused elects to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>forgo a motion to strike and proceed directly to closing argument, it is incumbent on him to make the trial court aware that he is challenging something other than the veracity of the evidence that supports the Commonwealth\u2019s theory. As <em>Campbell </em>points out, the sufficiency challenge must be clear enough for the trial court to discern its presence and to be able to distinguish it from an argument on the merits. <em>Campbell, </em>12 Va.App. at 481, 405 S.E.2d at 3 (holding that if \u201cthe issue of sufficiency is <em>clearly </em>presented to the trial court ... in a closing argument,\u201d the issue is preserved for appeal (emphasis added)). \u201cNot every closing argument accomplishes this objective.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>An argument focused only on which witness is more worthy of belief fails to achieve this objective, and therefore the argument does not properly preserve a sufficiency challenge for appellate review.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id.; see </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-384.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Here, Dickerson made no motion to strike at the close of all the evidence in his bench trial. Accordingly, he must rely upon his closing argument to preserve his challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. In his brief closing argument, Dickerson\u2019s counsel did nothing more than ask the trial court, sitting as the fact-finder, to disbelieve the police officer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>testimony and believe Dickerson\u2019s testimony. This argument merely asked the court to believe his denial that he possessed the cocaine. Dickerson never asked the court to rule that the testimony of the officer was legally insufficient to support any element of the charge. Accordingly, Dickerson failed to preserve his challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence in the trial court, and we are therefore precluded from considering that argument on appeal. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Thus, we affirm Dickerson\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b401-7\">. Generally, \u201ca motion to strike can never be a .proper vehicle to argue suppression of illegally obtained evidence since the questions of legal sufficiency and constitutional compliance are fundamentally different questions requiring different analyses.\u201d <em>Arrington v. Commonwealth, </em>53 Va.App. 635, 642 n. 12, 674 S.E.2d 554, 558 n. 12 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b401-8\">. \" \u2018[W]hen a defendant elects to present evidence on his behalf, he waives the right to stand on his motion to strike the evidence made at the conclusion of the Commonwealth's case.\u2019 \" <em>McQuinn v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 753, 755, 460 S.E.2d 624, 625 (1995) (quoting <em>White v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 231, 233, 348 S.E.2d 866, 867 (1986)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b401-9\">. Effective July 1, 2010, Rule 5A:18 was revised to state that \"[n]o ruling of the trial court ... will be considered as a basis for reversal unless an objection was stated with reasonable certainty at the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>the ruling....\u201d Because the proceedings below were completed prior to this revision taking effect, we will rely on the language of Rule 5A:18 that was then in effect. <em>See Fails v. Va. State Bar, </em>265 Va. 3, 5 n. 1, 574 S.E.2d 530, 531 n. 1 (2003) (applying the Rule of Court in effect at the time of the proceedings below).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b403-5\">. For instance, on appeal Dickerson argues that \"[t]he Commonwealth failed to exclude the reasonable hypothesis that appellant truly had no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>knowledge of the cocaine.\u201d He then cited <em>Young v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 587, 659 S.E.2d 308 (2008), in support of that argument. Had this argument been presented to the trial court, it would have alerted the court to his challenge that the officer\u2019s testimony and the reasonable inferences to be drawn from that testimony were insufficient to prove one of the requisite elements of the offense. At trial, however, he simply restated his own testimony, which, unless incriminating, is quite frankly irrelevant to a legal sufficiency analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b404-7\">. Nor does every motion to strike accomplish this objective. <em>See, e.g., Scott v. Commonwealth, </em>58 Va.App. 35, 44-45, 707 S.E.2d 17, 22 (2011) (holding that an argument made in a motion to strike challenging only the sufficiency of the evidence to support first-degree murder failed to preserve a sufficiency challenge to the lesser-included charge of involuntary manslaughter).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b404-8\">. If arguments of this sort were adequate, the rule would be rendered meaningless, since every closing argument in a criminal case (short of a concession of guilt) would permit a defendant to raise a sufficiency challenge on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b405-7\">ELDER, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AnH\">concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">The majority properly affirms Dickerson\u2019s conviction for cocaine possession in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-250. However, I would reach this conclusion on the merits of the case because, unlike the majority, I believe the issue of whether Dickerson knew of the presence and character of the cocaine found in his pants pockets was properly preserved. Therefore, I write separately to concur in the judgment only.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">The majority holds that counsel\u2019s \u201cone-sentence closing argument\u201d \u201cdid nothing more than ask the trial court, sitting as fact-finder, to disbelieve the police officer\u2019s testimony and believe Dickerson\u2019s testimony.\u201d The majority believes this falls short of a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, which asks the trial court to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and discard the <em>appellant\u2019s </em>evidence, because it instead asked the trial court to discard the <em>Commonwealth\u2019s </em>evidence. The majority reasons that because an argument on the merits \u201cemploys a very different evidentiary prism\u201d than the sufficiency challenge Dickerson argues on appeal, <em>supra </em>at 857-59, 709 S.E.2d at 720, Rule 5A:18 bars our consideration of the merits of Dickerson\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">In my view, however, distinguishing a \u201cclosing argument [that] focuse[s] only on the factual persuasiveness ... or the weight of the evidence\u201d from \u201ca challenge to the legal sufficiency of the evidence\u201d draws a distinction without a differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>ence, particularly in this case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Counsel argued that the cocaine \u201cwas not his\u201d and \u201cthat he never possessed th[e] cocaine.\u201d Counsel based this argument on Dickerson\u2019s testimony and therefore \u201casked the court to disbelieve the police officer\u2019s testimony and believe Dickerson\u2019s testimony\u201d; i.e., evaluate the case on the merits by discerning the probative value of the evidence. <em>Supra </em>at 358, 709 S.E.2d at 720. In response, the trial court held that it was \u201cconvinced beyond a reasonable doubt that [Dickerson] [was] guilty of [cocaine possession].\u201d By disbelieving Dickerson\u2019s testimony, the trial court necessarily found the remaining evidence to be sufficient. In other words, the probative value of that evidence\u2014 the police officer\u2019s testimony versus Dickerson\u2019s testimony\u2014 was sufficient to convict so, therefore, the legal sufficiency of the evidence was also met. Counsel argued, albeit briefly, that Dickerson did not know the cocaine was in his pocket, which is the argument he raises now on appeal. So despite the phrasing of the closing argument, Dickerson \u201craised the issue of the sufficiency of the evidence of [constructive possession]\u201d and gave \u201cthe trial court ... an opportunity to ... resolve the issue now raised on appeal.\u201d <em>Campbell v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 476, 481, 405 S.E.2d 1, 3 (1991) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">On the merits of Dickerson\u2019s appeal, I believe the evidence is sufficient to support a finding that Dickerson had the requisite awareness of the nature and character of the cocaine because the police officers found the contraband in his pants pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">\u201cIn a prosecution for possession of a controlled substance, the Commonwealth must produce evidence sufficient to support a conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\u2019s possession of the drug was knowing and intentional.\u201d <em>Young v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 587, 591, 659 S.E.2d 308, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>310 (2008). \u201cThe Commonwealth must also establish that the defendant intentionally and consciously possessed it with knowledge of its nature and character.\u201d <em>Burton v. Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 711, 713, 213 S.E.2d 757, 758 (1975). Such knowledge may be shown by evidence of the acts, statements or conduct of the accused. <em>See Garland v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 182, 184, 300 S.E.2d 783, 784 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">In <em>Young, </em>ambiguous circumstantial evidence cast doubt on whether the defendant knew of the nature and character of the contraband found in her purse. 275 Va. at 592, 659 S.E.2d at 311. Specifically, the arresting officer found a prescription bottle labeled \u201cOxyContin,\u201d a controlled substance. The officer could not determine the nature of the pills without the use of forensic testing, which revealed the pills contained neither OxyContin nor its generic equivalent. <em>Id. </em>at 589, 659 S.E.2d at 309. Further, the pills were prescribed to an individual other than the defendant. From this evidence, the Supreme Court of Virginia held it could envision \u201ccountless scenarios\u201d in which the defendant could have possessed the contraband without fully knowing the character and nature of the pills and it reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 592, 659 S.E.2d at 310-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Such evidence is lacking in the present case to support any reasonable hypothesis of innocence that does not spring from Dickerson\u2019s imagination. The suspected crack cocaine was wrapped in a clear plastic baggie, allowing the police officer to immediately suspect the true nature of the substance. No evidence existed that another individual was identifiably implicated in the ownership of Dickerson\u2019s vehicle, contraband, or pants. Dickerson never contended that the pants belonged to someone else. <em>See Horne v. Commonwealth, </em>No. 1247-09-2, 2010 WL 2160225, at *3, 2010 Va.App. LEXIS 220, at *9 (June 1, 2010) (\u201cThe jury, as the trier of fact and determiner of witness credibility, could reject appellant\u2019s story that the pants were not his and conclude that the velour pants, and any item in the pockets of those pants, belonged to appellant.\u201d). Dickerson offered no explanation concerning how a substance could enter his pants without his knowledge. Indeed, Dicker<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>son testified that he was aware of the marijuana found in his left rear pants pocket. The trial court therefore reasonably discounted Dickerson\u2019s claim that he did not know about the cocaine and concluded he was lying to conceal his guilt. <em>See Cordon v. Commonwealth, </em>280 Va. 691, 695, 701 S.E.2d 803, 805 (2010) (\u201c[I]f a defendant\u2019s denial of circumstances relating to an illegal act is inconsistent with previous statements or facts, it is fair to infer that such denial was for the purposes of concealing guilt.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Dickerson\u2019s actual possession of the cocaine in his pants pockets, combined with facts that contradicted his disclaimer of ownership of the crack cocaine, provide sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he knowingly possessed the cocaine. Accordingly, I would affirm his conviction for possession of cocaine on that ground rather than applying Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b406-6\">. Of course, I do not suggest that any closing argument may properly preserve a sufficiency challenge for appellate review. Rather, I believe that in <em>this particular case, </em>counsel\u2019s brief closing argument highlighted the precise issue that is now before this Court: whether or not appellant possessed the contraband.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
