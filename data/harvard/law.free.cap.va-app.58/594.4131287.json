On appeal, Rushing asserts a single assignment of error challenging the sufficiency of the evidence and requesting we reverse his conviction and dismiss the charge. Finding the evidence sufficient, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-13\">On appeal, we review the evidence in the \u201clight most favorable\u201d to the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth v. Hudson, </em>265 Va. 505, 514, 578 S.E.2d 781, 786 (2003). This principle requires us to \u201cdiscard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>inferences to be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Parks v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 492, 498, 270 S.E.2d 755, 759 (1980) (emphasis and citation omitted). In determining whether there is sufficient evidence to sustain a conviction, moreover, an appellate court must consider \u201call the evidence\u201d admitted at trial that is contained in the record. <em>Hamilton v. Commonwealth, </em>279 Va. 94, 103, 688 S.E.2d 168, 173 (2010) (quoting <em>Bolden v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 144, 147, 654 S.E.2d 584, 586 (2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">From this perspective, the evidence at trial proved Rushing and an accomplice, William Travis Newton, went to the Hampton home of a person they believed to be a drug dealer, intending to rob him. Rushing targeted the victim after learning from his friend \u201cSnails\u201d (a member of the \u201cCrips\u201d gang) that the intended victim had $15,000 in cash inside the home. Armed with handguns, Rushing and Newton broke into the home wearing bandannas over their faces while the getaway car (driven by Newton\u2019s grandmother) waited a block away. Inside the home, they did not find the expected drug dealer but rather a 75-year-old man who owned the home. One of the intruders exclaimed, \u201clet\u2019s get out of here; we got the wrong house.\u201d Newton shot the man, and both he and Rushing fled the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Hampton police officers later arrested Newton and Rushing. At the time of his arrest, Rushing had in his pockets a set of brass knuckles, a straight razor, and several bandannas with blue, black, and white coloring. During a search of Newton\u2019s home, police found extensive evidence of gang activity, including gang notebooks, rules, graffiti, and eighteen blue, black, and white bandannas. Officers also found at Newton\u2019s address the two handguns Newton and Rushing used during the break-in.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">At the joint jury trial of Newton and Rushing, the trial court admitted into evidence the gang notebooks, writings, drawings, and bandannas found in Newton\u2019s home. Over Rushing\u2019s objection, the court also admitted a photograph of Rushing making a pitchfork hand sign. Rushing\u2019s counsel argued no foundation had been laid for admitting the photo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>graph. The prosecution\u2019s main witness was a police detective with expertise in identifying criminal gangs. Testifying as an expert, the detective stated the gang materials found in Newton\u2019s home were those of a street gang called the Gangsta Disciples. The pitchfork hand sign and the gang affiliating colors of blue and black, the detective explained, identified the gang as the Gangsta Disciples.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The detective testified he spoke with Newton prior to trial. The detective used the secret greeting for the Gangsta Disciples (asking Newton if he was \u201cFolk\u201d) and received from Newton the appropriate reply (\u201call is one\u201d). Additional questions by the detective further confirmed Newton\u2019s membership in the gang. Newton also used the pitchfork hand sign, among others, to identify his gang membership.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The Gangsta Disciples, the detective testified, originated in Chicago and had twenty-three known members in Hampton. The detective stated Gangsta Disciples are \u201cinvolved in all sorts of criminal activities, from robberies to burglaries, stolen cars, narcotics distribution.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what Larry Hoover is incarcerated for,\u201d the detective added, \u201cone of the leaders.\u201d Advancement within the hierarchy of the gang, the detective added, required a member to commit various crimes escalating in seriousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">The detective identified Deanthony Clark as a local member of the Gangsta Disciples. During the detective\u2019s testimony, the trial court admitted into evidence a conviction order showing Clark had pled guilty to carjacking and using a firearm during a felony. Over Rushing\u2019s objection, the trial court also admitted into evidence a sentencing order, plea agreement, and stipulation of facts showing Darryl Brandon Lollis had been convicted of gang participation and robbery. In the stipulation of facts, Lollis admitted to being a member of the Gangster Disciples\u2014a phrase used at trial and on appeal interchangeably with Gangsta Disciples.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>The jury convicted Rushing of participating in a criminal street gang. Rushing moved to set aside the gang participation verdict on the ground that no evidence proved his \u201cmembership in a gang, his active membership in a gang, or any transaction showing he participated in something for a gang.\u201d The trial court denied the motion and entered final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">A. THE SCOPE OF APPELLATE REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">After reciting the standard of review governing sufficiency claims, the argument section of Rushing\u2019s brief opens with this assertion: \u201cThe Circuit Court erred by finding the evidence sufficient to convict appellant of gang participation.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 6. The argument then proceeds to challenge individual items of evidence, claiming they were either inadmissible or insufficient to prove guilt. The brief ends with exactly the same point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-8\">The <em>evidence was insufficient </em>to convict appellant of gang participation <em>because </em>there was no evidence that he had any knowledge of writings, drawings or gang paraphernalia found at 40 Deep Creek Road, the prior felony convictions of Mr. Clark and Mr. Lollis were improperly admitted, and the photo of appellant was improperly admitted and failed to prove any membership in Gangsta Disciples.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 10-11 (emphasis added). On this ground, Rushing contends we should \u201creverse\u201d his conviction and \u201cdismiss the charge against him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11; <em>see generally </em>Rule 5A:20(f) (requiring appellant\u2019s brief to state \u201cthe precise relief sought\u201d on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>At oral argument, Rushing\u2019s counsel clarified that the evidentiary issues are \u201csubsets\u201d of the sufficiency assignment of error. Oral Argument Audio at 00:50. In other words, counsel explained, the argument on appeal was \u201ctwo-pronged\u201d\u2014challenging the sufficiency of the <em>properly admitted </em>evidence, and, alternatively, challenging the sufficiency of <em>all </em>the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 2:25 to 2:34, 6:26 to 6:28. When asked at oral argument how counsel could \u201cmeld and blend\u201d the arguments together to \u201cmake one argument,\u201d she replied that \u201ceven if\u2019 the improperly admitted exhibits are considered, the evidence \u201cremains insufficient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6:14 to 6:50.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">In his brief, the Attorney General accurately restates Rushing\u2019s argument on appeal: \u201cThe defendant contends in his Assignment of Error that the <em>evidence was insufficient </em>to prove the charge of gang participation <em>because </em>prior felony convictions of gang members and a photograph of the defendant were improperly admitted.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. at 12 (emphasis added). Realizing Robinson\u2019s conflated argument can be defeated in either one of two ways, the Attorney General argues</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-6\">(i) our sufficiency review on appeal should take into account <em>\u201call </em>the evidence at trial, including evidence alleged to have been <em>erroneously admitted,\u201d id. </em>at 11 (citations omitted and emphasis added), and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-7\">(ii) the evidence challenged by Rushing \u201cwas <em>properly admitted </em>and was <em>sufficient </em>to sustain the conviction for gang participation,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 14 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-8\"><em>See also </em>Oral Argument Audio at 14:03 to 14:11 (Assistant Attorney General pointing out that sufficiency of the evidence is the \u201coverriding question\u201d presented by this case).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">We present in detail Rushing\u2019s argument on appeal to clarify the scope of our review. When a \u201creversal is for mere trial error, and not for evidentiary insufficiency, we will remand the case for a new trial.\u201d <em>Gray v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 943, 946, 265 S.E.2d 705, 706 (1980) (citations omitted). In this case, however, Rushing does not ask whether the claimed evidentiary errors warrant a remand for a new trial. \u201cWe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>thus do not answer this unasked question.\u201d <em>Lay v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 330, 336 n. 3, 649 S.E.2d 714, 716 n. 3 (2007). Under the adversarial model of adjudication, the litigants\u2014not the judges\u2014determine the issues to be decided, the facts to be presented, and the range of remedies to be sought. By necessity, the adversarial model \u201cis designed around the premise that the parties know what is best for them, and are responsible for advancing the facts and arguments entitling them to relief.\u201d <em>Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 386, 124 S.Ct. 786, 794, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003) (Scalia, J., concurring in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">For these reasons, we address only the sufficiency argument Rushing makes on appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under his \u201ctwo-pronged\u201d argument, Rushing contends we must limit our sufficiency review to the properly admitted evidence, and \u201ceven if\u2019 we consider the improperly admitted evidence, we should nevertheless find the evidence, in its entirety, insufficient to support the jury verdict. Oral Argument Audio at 2:25 to 2:34, 6:14 to 6:50; <em>see also </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 7-8 (arguing the court \u201cerred by admitting certified copies of prior convictions of alleged gang members\u201d because \u201cthe evidence was insufficient to show that Mr. Clark was a [gang] member\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 9-10 (arguing the \u201cphotograph of appellant ... was insufficient to prove his [gang] membership\u201d because \u201cno foundation was laid for the photo\u201d). As Rushing frames the debate, the evidentiary issues are merely \u201csubsets\u201d of the sufficiency analysis. <em>See </em>Oral Argument Audio at 00:50.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">B. EVIDENTIARY ERRORS AND SUFFICIENCY</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">We begin our analysis by disagreeing with Rushing\u2019s assumption that we must first segregate the admissible evidence from the inadmissible before conducting a sufficiency review. Under settled principles, an appellate court reviewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>the sufficiency of the evidence in a criminal case\u2014with its concomitant double jeopardy implications\u2014must consider all of the evidence actually admitted at trial without regard to whether it was properly admitted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-5\">An \u201cappellate court\u2019s reversal for insufficiency of the evidence is in effect a determination that the government\u2019s case against the defendant was so lacking that the trial court should have entered a judgment of acquittal.\u201d <em>Lockhart v. Nelson, </em>488 U.S. 33, 39, 109 S.Ct. 285 [290], 102 L.Ed.2d 265 (1988). Because reversal for insufficiency of the evidence is equivalent to a judgment of acquittal, such a reversal bars a retrial. <em>See Burks v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 1, 18, 98 S.Ct. 2141 [2150-51], 57 L.Ed.2d 1 (1978). To \u201cmake the analogy complete\u201d between a reversal for insufficiency of the evidence and the trial court\u2019s granting a judgment of acquittal, <em>Lockhart, </em>488 U.S., at 42 [109 S.Ct. at 291], <em>\u201ca reviewing court must consider all of the evidence admitted by the trial court,\u201d regardless whether that evidence was admitted erroneously, id., </em>at 41 [109 S.Ct. at 291],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-6\"><em>McDaniel v. Brown, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 130 S.Ct. 665, 672, 175 L.Ed.2d 582 (2010) <em>{per </em>curiam) (emphasis added); <em>see Lockhart, </em>488 U.S. at 39-42, 109 S.Ct. at 290-92; <em>see generally </em>6 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7 25.4(c), at 652 (3d ed. 2007) (\u201cAs one court put it, the appellate court applying <em>Burks </em>is \u2018assessing the legal sufficiency of the evidence not at the trial that will be, but at the trial that was.\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)); 26 <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice\u2014Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7 629.30[2], at 629-62 (3d ed. 2007) (\u201cA trial court ... considers all of the evidence it has admitted, and to make the analogy complete it must be this same quantum of evidence that is considered by the reviewing court.\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>We acknowledge, but do not find controlling on this particular point, <em>Crawford v. Commonwealth, </em>281 Va. 84, 112, 704 S.E.2d 107, 123-24 (2011), which stated a defendant\u2019s \u201cConstitutional protections\u201d forbid an appellate court from considering \u201cevidence illegally admitted\u201d at trial when \u201creviewing the sufficiency of the evidence.\u201d For two reasons, we cannot follow this <em>dictum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">First, <em>Crawford </em>held that, <em>even without </em>the inadmissible evidence, the remaining evidence was sufficient to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt. That conclusion made it logically unnecessary to determine whether the result would be any different <em>even with </em>the inadmissible evidence being considered. In other words, it did not matter whether the challenged evidence was considered for purposes of the sufficiency review\u2014 the unchallenged evidence was alone sufficient. <em>See generally Cent. Green Co. v. United States, </em>531 U.S. 425, 431, 121 S.Ct. 1005, 1009, 148 L.Ed.2d 919 (2001) (characterizing a portion of a prior opinion as \u201cunquestionably dictum because it was not essential to our disposition\u201d); <em>Lofton Ridge, LLC v. Norfolk S. Ry., </em>268 Va. 377, 383, 601 S.E.2d 648, 651 (2004) (noting a \u201cjustification for the ruling\u201d that was \u201cunnecessary to the holding ... is dicta\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>Second, the question whether \u201cConstitutional protections\u201d forbid an appellate court \u201creviewing the sufficiency of the evidence\u201d from considering \u201cevidence illegally admitted\u201d at trial, <em>Crawford, </em>281 Va. at 112, 704 S.E.2d at 123-24, involves an application of the double jeopardy doctrine.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Despite the \u201cunusual and delicate situation,\u201d <em>Wilson v. Taylor, </em>658 F.2d 1021, 1035 (5th Cir.1981), in which we find ourselves, this much is certain: When a state supreme court opinion, whether in <em>dicta </em>or in its holding, conflicts with a holding of the United States Supreme Court on an issue of federal constitutional law, the United States Supreme Court ruling remains the binding precedent\u2014\u201cany state law, decision, or rule to the contrary notwithstanding.\u201d <em>Chesapeake &amp; O.R. Co. v. Martin, </em>283 U.S. 209, 221, 51 S.Ct. 453, 458, 75 L.Ed. 983 (1931). \u201cNeedless to say,\u201d only the United States Supreme Court \u201cmay overrule one of its precedents.\u201d <em>Thurston Motor Lines, Inc. v. Jordan K. Rand, Ltd., </em>460 U.S. 533, 535, 103 S.Ct. 1343, 1344, 75 L.Ed.2d 260 (1983) <em>(per curiam). </em>A \u201cstate supreme court,\u201d of course, \u201chas no discretion to disregard\u201d applicable holdings of the United States Supreme Court. <em>Jaynes v. Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 443, 458, 666 S.E.2d 303, 311 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">In short, under the authority of United States Supreme Court decisions in <em>McDaniel </em>and <em>Lockhart, </em>an appellate court reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence \u201c \u2018must consider all of the evidence admitted by the trial court,\u2019 regardless of whether that evidence was admitted erroneously.\u2019 \u201d <em>McDaniel, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 130 S.Ct. at 672 (quoting <em>Lockhart, </em>488 U.S. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>41, 109 S.Ct. at 291). Given this authority from the United States Supreme Court, our sufficiency analysis must consider, therefore, all of the evidence actually admitted at trial without regard to whether it was properly admitted. We thus do not segregate, as Rushing requests, the allegedly inadmissible evidence from all of the admitted evidence for the purpose of reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">C. APPELLATE REVIEW OF SUFFICIENCY CHALLENGES</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">An appellate court does not \u201cask itself whether <em>it </em>believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>278 Va. 190, 193, 677 S.E.2d 280, 282 (2009) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-19, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)) (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cRather, the relevant question is whether <em>\u2018any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted and emphasis in original). Thus, when a jury has rendered its verdict, \u201cit is not for this court to say that the evidence does or does not establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt because as an original proposition it might have reached a different conclusion.\u201d <em>Cobb v. Commonwealth, </em>152 Va. 941, 953, 146 S.E. 270, 274 (1929). Suffice it to say, an \u201cappellate court is no substitute for a jury.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>Consequently, we are \u201cnot permitted to reweigh the evidence,\u201d <em>Nusbaum v. Berlin, </em>273 Va. 385, 408, 641 S.E.2d 494, 507 (2007), because appellate courts have no authority \u201cto preside <em>de novo </em>over a second trial,\u201d <em>Haskins v. Commonwealth, 44 </em>Va.App. 1, 11, 602 S.E.2d 402, 407 (2004). Instead, we give</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-4\">juries the wide discretion to which a living record, as distinguished from a printed record, logically entitles them. The living record contains many guideposts to the truth which are not in the printed record; not having seen them ourselves, we should give great weight to the conclusions of those who have seen and heard them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-5\"><em>Bradley v. Commonwealth, </em>196 Va. 1126, 1136, 86 S.E.2d 828, 834 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">This deferential appellate standard \u201capplies not only to findings of fact, but also to any reasonable and justified inferences the fact-finder may have drawn from the facts proved.\u201d <em>Sullivan v. Commonwealth, </em>280 Va. 672, 676, 701 S.E.2d 61, 63-64 (2010); <em>see also Clanton v. Commonwealth, </em>53 Va.App. 561, 566, 673 S.E.2d 904, 907 (2009) <em>(en </em>banc). Thus, a factfinder may \u201cdraw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts,\u201d <em>Haskins, 44 </em>Va.App. at 10, 602 S.E.2d at 406 (citation omitted), unless doing so would push \u201cinto the realm of <em>non sequitur\u201d Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va.App. 605, 608, 633 S.E.2d 229, 231 (2006) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">D. CRIMINAL STREET GANG PARTICIPATION</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">The jury convicted Rushing of participating in a criminal street gang in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-46.2(A), which provides: \u201cAny person who actively participates in or is a member of a criminal street gang and who knowingly and willfully participates in any predicate criminal act committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with any criminal street gang shall be guilty of a Class 5 felony.\u201d The crime involves two elements\u2014status and conduct. While either an active participant <em>or </em>member in a criminal street gang, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>the defendant must participate in a predicate criminal act related to any criminal street gang.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">The status element turns on the statutory definition of a criminal street gang, which includes</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AD2\">any ongoing organization, association, or group of three or more persons, whether <em>formal or informal, </em>(i) which has as one of its primary objectives or activities the commission of one or more criminal activities; (ii) which has an identifiable name or identifying sign or symbol; and (iii) whose members individually or collectively have engaged in the commission of, attempt to commit, conspiracy to commit, or solicitation of two or more predicate criminal acts, at least one of which is an act of violence, provided such acts were not part of a common act or transaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-46.1 (emphasis added). The conduct element of the crime requires only proof that the defendant \u201cknowingly and willfully\u201d participated in a \u201cpredicate criminal act committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with any criminal street gang____\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-46.2(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">The evidence at trial amply supports the rationality of the jury verdict finding Rushing guilty of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-46.2(A). Testifying as a gang expert, the detective described the bandannas, colors, hand signs, and other unique indicia of membership associated with the Gangsta Disciples gang. The evidence showed Rushing wore a bandanna in Gangsta Disciples colors during the home invasion. The picture of him flashing the pitchfork hand sign, a symbol unique to the gang, further confirms his status. The evidence also showed Rushing planned and executed the crime with Newton\u2014who also wore a telltale bandanna during the crime, had evidence in his home of the pitchfork and other gang symbols, and used the secret Gangsta Disciples greeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">In addition, the detective identified Deanthony Clark as a local member of the Gangsta Disciples. Clark\u2019s convictions for carjacking and use of a firearm during a felony, and Lollis\u2019s convictions for robbery and gang participation, prove the predicate criminal \u201cacts of violence\u201d committed \u201cindividu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>ally or collectively\u201d by members of the putative gang under Code \u00a7 18.2-46.1. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2~297.1(A)(i)(e) (identifying robbery and carjacking as \u201cacts of violence\u201d). The stipulation of fact executed by Darryl Brandon Lollis, acknowledging his membership in the Gangsta Disciples, similarly satisfied the requirements of Code \u00a7 18.2-46.1.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Rushing argues the evidence fails to establish the status element of Code \u00a7 18.2-46.2(A) because he had no relationship with either Clark or Lollis and did not participate in their respective crimes. Nothing in the governing statutes, however, requires such proof. The status element of Code \u00a7 18.2-46.2(A) requires only that the defendant actively participate in or be a member of a criminal street gang. The definition of a criminal street gang in Code \u00a7 18.2-46.1 includes any \u201cformal or informal\u201d group exhibiting three specified gang-related characteristics. The requirement that members of the group have \u201cindividually or collectively\u201d committed predicate criminal acts, Code \u00a7 18.2-46.1, \u201cpermits proof of individually committed acts to establish a pattern of criminal gang activity.\u201d <em>Corado v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 315, 333, 623 S.E.2d 452, 460 (2005) (construing former Code \u00a7 18.2-46.1). The defendant need not participate in the predicate criminal acts or have any personal relationship with the gang members who committed them.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Citing <em>Taybron v. Commonwealth, </em>57 Va.App. 470, 703 S.E.2d 270 (2011), Rushing argues \u201c[j]ust as in <em>Taybron, </em>the Commonwealth failed to demonstrate the existence of a criminal street gang under Va.Code \u00a7 18.2-46.2.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 9. We disagree. Despite its broad language, <em>Taybron </em>held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number><em>\u201conly that, </em>in this case, the evidence fails to establish that appellant, a member of the 36th Street Bang Squad, was a member of the national Bloods or some other gang organization to which Turner and King also belonged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486 n. 6, 703 S.E.2d at 278 n. 6 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">In other words, <em>Taybron </em>addressed only the question whether the evidence proved the defendant belonged to the same criminal street gang as those who had committed the predicate criminal acts. <em>Taybron </em>did not interpret the statutes to require that the members of the criminal street gang have any specific relationship with one another beyond belonging to the same gang. Nor did <em>Taybron </em>suggest the defendant must participate in the predicate acts used to prove the existence of a criminal street gang under Code \u00a7 18.2-46.1. Neither requirement appears in the statutes or our interpretation of them in <em>Taybron.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">In sum, the evidence before the jury, viewed in its entirety, amply supports the rationality of the jury\u2019s finding that Rushing participated in a criminal street gang in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-46.2(\u00c1). We thus affirm Rushing\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b645-8\">.

However, for reasons I explain below, I believe that the majority\u2019s decision not to address Rushing\u2019s argument regarding the admissibility of a photograph ignores the admonition from the Supreme Court that cases should be decided on the merits unless a violation of a non-jurisdictional rule is \u201cso substantial as to preclude the court\u2019s addressing the merits of the case,\u201d such that it would \u201cinterfer[e] with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>orderly administration of justice.\u201d <em>Moore v.

In my opinion, if the appellant fairly presents the issue and the Commonwealth, without objecting to the scope of the assignment of error or the argument, addresses it on the merits, we should decide that issue. Thus, I would consider Rushing\u2019s argument that the trial court erred in admitting a photograph of Rushing making a hand sign associated with the Gangsta Disciples, conclude that the argument is well-taken, and reverse the conviction. Because the evidence was sufficient to support Rushing\u2019s conviction for participation in a criminal street gang, the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution does not bar a retrial. Thus, I would remand for a new trial if the Commonwealth be so advised.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">I.

He then transitions into an argument that the Commonwealth failed to lay any foundation for the admission of the photograph and that without an adequate foundation the photograph was not admissible under the silent witness theory. Rushing concludes this argument with the statement, \u201c[The photograph] should not have been admitted by the Circuit Court.\u201d Then, Rushing returns to his sufficiency argument by stating, \u201cFurthermore, the picture was insufficient to prove any gang affiliation by appellant.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>The Commonwealth, recognizing that the assignment of error and argument actually address issues of both sufficiency and admissibility, correctly notes in its brief that \u201c[a]rguments concerning the admissibility of evidence and the sufficiency of evidence raise different legal issues.\u201d It then addresses the merits of each issue separately. Under a sub-heading entitled, \u201cPhotograph of Rushing,\u201d the Commonwealth argues that \u201c[t]he trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the photograph for the consideration of the jury.\u201d At no point, either on brief or at oral argument, did the Commonwealth ask us to limit the issues before us as the majority has done. The fact that the \u201c \u2018Attorney General understood the issue ... and went on to address it,\u2019 \u201d <em>Moore, </em>276 Va. at 755, 668 S.E.2d at 154 (quoting <em>Moore v.

I believe that a fair and reasonable reading of both the assignment of error and the argument in this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>permits us to address both the issue of the sufficiency of the evidence and that of the admissibility of the photograph without interfering with the orderly administration of justice. Thus, I believe that the majority wrongly declines to address the admissibility of the photograph.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">II. ADMISSIBILITY OF THE PHOTOGRAPH</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">In order to establish that Rushing was a member of the Gangsta Disciples, the Commonwealth offered as evidence Exhibit Number 24, a photocopy of what appears to be two images of Rushing. One image depicts Rushing making a hand sign unique to the Gangsta Disciples. There is no information on the exhibit indicating where or when the images were made or how they came into the possession of the police. After Detective Gainer identified Rushing as the person depicted in the images, the Commonwealth marked the exhibit for identification and then asked Detective Gainer, \u201cWas this photograph, what\u2019s been marked as Commonwealth\u2019s 24, provided to you or Detective Crouch?\u201d Detective Gainer responded, \u201cIt was not provided to me.\u201d Based on this testimony, the trial court admitted Exhibit 24 into evidence.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">\u201cWe consistently have held that the admission of photographs into evidence rests within the sound discretion of a trial court, and that the trial court\u2019s decision will not be disturbed on appeal unless the record discloses a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Bailey v. Commonwealth, </em>259 Va. 723, 738, 529 S.E.2d 570, 579 (2000). It is well established that \u201c[pjhotographs are generally admitted into evidence for two purposes: to illustrate a witness\u2019 testimony, and as an \u2018independent silent witness\u2019 of matters revealed by the photograph.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the photograph of Rushing making a gang sign was not offered to illustrate a witness\u2019 testimony. No witness testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>that he had observed Rushing making the gang sign, as the photograph portrayed. Rather, the photograph was offered as an independent \u201csilent witness\u201d of this fact. As such, the test for whether the photograph was admissible is \u201cwhether the evidence [was] sufficient to provide an adequate foundation assuring the accuracy of the process producing it.\u201d <em>Ferguson v. Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 745, 747, 187 S.E.2d 189, 191 (1972) (discussing a composite photograph produced by a Regiscope camera \u201cshowing the person who presents the check, the identification presented by that person and the check which is cashed\u201d). Or, as another court explaining the silent witness theory has stated, there must be \u201cproof the photograph has not been altered in any significant respect\u201d for it to be admissible. <em>Buck v. State, </em>453 N.E.2d 993, 996 (Ind.1983) (holding that certain photographs were admissible under the silent witness theory based in part on \u201cuncontroverted evidence that the Polaroid photographs were not altered or retouched\u201d); <em>see also People v. Doggett, </em>83 Cal.App.2d 405, 188 P.2d 792, 795 (1948) (holding that certain photographs were admissible based in part on \u201cunimpeached expert testimony that the pictures themselves contain[ed] physical elements ... which disclose[d] that they [were] not \u2018composite\u2019 or \u2018faked\u2019 photographs but [were] genuine photographs and \u2018contact prints\u2019 made from \u2018straight photograph\u2019 negatives\u201d); <em>People v. Byrnes, </em>33 N.Y.2d 343, 352 N.Y.S.2d 913, 308 N.E.2d 435, 437-38 (1974) (holding that certain photographs were admissible under reasoning essentially identical to the silent witness theory based in part on \u201ctestimony that the negatives from which the positive prints were made had been seized at the [location where the criminal acts depicted in the photographs were alleged to have occurred]\u201d and on \u201cunimpeached testimony by a photographic expert that the negatives had not been altered in any manner and that the prints produced therefrom were accurate reproductions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">Here, there was simply no evidence regarding either the origin of this photograph or the process used to produce it, and the Commonwealth offered no proof whatsoever that the photograph had not been altered or tampered with. While <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>Detective Gainer identified the person shown in the photograph as Rushing, the Commonwealth presented no evidence showing where or how (or even whether) the police obtained the original images, or when and under what circumstances the photocopy exhibit was created. Detective Gainer disclaimed any prior knowledge of the exhibit, and the Commonwealth failed to ask any other witness about its origin or authenticity. Simply put, there was no \u201cevidence of extrinsic circumstances [showing] that the photograph [was] authentic.\u201d Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 13-12(a), at 539 (6th ed.2003). In the complete absence of any such evidence providing a foundation for admitting this photograph as a silent witness, I believe the trial court erred in admitting it into evidence. Accordingly, I would reverse Rushing\u2019s conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b657-6\">. A new trial would permit the hearsay and Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause objections to the admissibility of the judicial records regarding Clark and Lollis to be more thoroughly presented and developed. Therefore, I do not believe it necessary to decide those issues today.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b658-8\">. In the petition for appeal, this assignment of error read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-9\">The Circuit Court erred by finding the evidence sufficient to convict appellant of gang participation because there was no evidence that appellant had any knowledge of gang writings, drawings or paraphernalia found at the co-defendant's home, prior felony convictions of alleged gang members were improperly admitted at appellant\u2019s trial, a photo of appellant allegedly making a gang sign was improperly admitted as evidence, and the photo did not prove appellant was a gang member.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">We rephrased a portion of this assignment when we granted the appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b658-11\">.

The majority correctly points out that sufficiency and admissibility are two separate and distinct legal concepts. As this case demonstrates, conflating disparate issues in a single assignment of error is clearly not an example of effective appellate advocacy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b659-6\">. I agree with the majority that \" 'the parties know what is best for them, and are responsible for advancing the facts and arguments entitling them to relief.\u2019 \u201d <em>Supra </em>at 602, 712 S.E.2d at 45 (quoting <em>Castro v.

This is one reason why I defer to the Commonwealth\u2019s decision not to make the argument advanced by the majority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b660-8\">. Although the Commonwealth referred to the photocopy as a photograph, there was no testimony presented to establish whether this was a print of a digital image from an electronic device or a photocopy of an actual photograph.
