Rahim (\u201cRahim\u201d) for light-duty work from January 17, 2007, and continuing for a period of twenty-four months, qualified as compensation paid pursuant to an award under Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C), and holding that her claim for temporary total disability benefits filed on October 7, 2009, was not barred by the statute of limitations. On appeal, Prince William County alleges that the commission erred in its application and interpretation of Code \u00a7 65.2-708 when a compensation benefits award had not been previously entered in this case. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">\u201cOn appeal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party before the commission.\u201d <em>Cent. Va. Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology Assocs., P.C. v. Whitfield, </em>42 Va.App. 264, 269, 590 S.E.2d 631, 634 (2004) (citing <em>Clinchfield Coal Co. v. Reed, </em>40 Va.App. 69, 72, 577 S.E.2d 538, 539 (2003)). So viewed, the evidence is as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">On January 17, 2007, Rahim sustained a compensable injury by accident to her low back, right knee, and right forearm while she was working for Prince William County. On November 15, 2007, Rahim filed a claim for benefits reporting two separate work accidents that occurred on June 13, 2006, and January 17, 2007, but she did not seek any specific benefits at that time. On September 8, 2008, Rahim filed an amended claim for benefits for the January 17, 2007 accident in which she sought the following benefits: \u201cCompensation for total wage loss for the periods listed below: From: 01/17/2007 To: 09/08/2008[;] Continuing Benefits[;] Payment of lifetime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>medical costs for this injury and/or disease^ and] Other: Get back any personal sick leave days used.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">The commission entered a stipulated order on June 18, 2009, in which the parties stipulated that (1) the injury was compensable; (2) Rahim was receiving an average weekly wage of $423.39 at the time of the accident; (3) Rahim \u201cdid not sustain any wage loss or incur any lost time from work but was partially disabled and provided appropriate light duty work by [Prince William County] at or above the pre-injury average weekly wage from January 17, 2007 to the present and continuing\u201d; and (4) Prince William County agreed \u201cto be responsible for reasonable and necessary medical treatment, including surgery,.... \u201d The commission then concluded, \u201c[a]ccordingly, a medical-only award is entered in favor of [Rahim] against [Prince William County] for as long as necessary pursuant to [ ] Code \u00a7 65.2-603.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">On October 7, 2009, Rahim filed an application for a hearing for a change in condition seeking temporary total disability benefits from August 12, 2009, and continuing. The parties subsequently agreed to submit the issue on the record; and, on February 12, 2010, both parties submitted their position statements. By letter, Rahim specifically sought temporary total disability benefits from August 11, 2009, through October 27, 2009, because her physician removed her from work for a scheduled back surgery, and temporary partial disability benefits from October 28, 2009, through October 30, 2009, based on the loss of eleven hours of work over the three days. Prince William County claimed that Rahim\u2019s claim for compensation was barred by the applicable statute of limitations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> By letter, faxed to the commission on February 24, 2010, pursuant to its request for confirmation, Prince William County stipulated that Rahim was totally disabled from the date of her surgery, August 18, 2009, through October 27, 2009, that she was partially disabled from October 28, 2009, through October 30, 2009, during which time she worked eleven out of eighteen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>hours of work, and that she was paid $236.50 in regular wages, and $150.50 from accrued sick leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">On February 26, 2010, the deputy commissioner found that Rahim\u2019s change-in-condition claim was timely filed based on the commission\u2019s decision in <em>Fountain v. City of Charlottesville, VWC </em>File No. 221-58-12, 2009 Va. Wrk. Comp. Lexis 423 (Aug. 7, 2009), despite earlier caselaw to the contrary.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The deputy commissioner then found that the light-duty wages paid from January 17, 2007, and continuing for twenty-four months are considered compensation paid pursuant to an award under Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A) and (C). The deputy commissioner then entered an award for temporary total disability benefits from August 11, 2009,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> through October 27, 2009, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>did not award compensation for partial work incapacity for October 28\u201430, 2009, due to a lack of information in the record establishing the amount paid per day prior to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Prince William County appealed the decision to the full commission on March 8, 2010. On July 16, 2010, the commission affirmed the deputy commissioner\u2019s decision finding that payment of wages to an injured worker is considered compensation pursuant to an award, a determination that they found was consistent with this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gordon v. Ford Motor Co., </em>55 Va.App. 363, 685 S.E.2d 880 (2009), <em>aff'd, </em>281 Va. 543, 708 S.E.2d 846 (2011), and held that the claim was timely filed on October 7, 2009. In reaching this conclusion, the commission held that <em>Mayberry v. Alcoa Bldg. Prods., </em>18 Va.App. 18, 441 S.E.2d 349 (1994), was inapplicable because no formal award had been entered in that case, and the claimant had not asserted that Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C) was applicable. In addition, the commission held that <em>Augusta Cnty. Sch. Bd. v. Humphreys, </em>53 Va.App. 355, 672 S.E.2d 117 (2009), was also inapplicable because the claimant in that case was awarded compensation for days that she missed work due to medical appointments.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">On August 13, 2010, Prince William County appealed the commission\u2019s decision to a three judge panel of this Court, which summarily affirmed it on December 21, 2010. On January 25, 2011, this Court granted Prince William County\u2019s petition for a rehearing en banc.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">On appeal, Prince William County contends that \u201cthe sole issue before this Court is whether the full Commission ... erred in its application and interpretation of Code \u00a7 65.2-708 and specifically subsection C to this case\u201d in concluding that Rahim\u2019s amended claim for benefits based upon a change in her condition was timely filed. However, Prince William County presented the following six assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>1. The full Commission erred in ruling that payment of wages to Rahim is considered compensation pursuant to an award under [] Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C)[,] and applying that section when previously there had been no award entered for compensation benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-4\">2. The full Commission erred in applying [ ] Code \u00a7 65.2-708, which grants the Commission power on motion or application for change in condition to make an award \u201cending, diminishing, or increasing the compensation previously awarded[,]\u201d to a claim for compensation when there has been no compensation previously awarded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-5\">3. The full Commission erred in finding that the statute of limitations had not expired on compensation benefits and awarding compensation when the claim for compensation was first filed more than two years after the accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-6\">4. The full Commission erred in finding that the statute of limitations had not expired on compensation benefits and awarding compensation when the first lost time from work and/or lost wages incurred by Rahim occurred more than two years after the accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-7\">5. The full Commission erred in ruling that <em>Mayberry v. Alcoa Bldg. Prod[s.], </em>18 Va.App. 18, 441 S.E.2d 349 (1994)[,] was not applicable to the present case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-8\">6. The full Commission erred in ruling that a finding that the statute of limitations had run on compensation in this matter would be \u201cinconsistent with the purpose and the plain words used in the statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">Since all the issues necessarily focus on the commission\u2019s interpretation of Code \u00a7 65.2-708, we address the interpretation of that section of the Code, which in turn answers all of the assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">\u201cAn issue of statutory interpretation is a pure question of law which we review de novo.\u201d <em>Ford Motor Co. v. Gordon, </em>281 Va. 543, 549, 708 S.E.2d 846, 849 (2011) (citing <em>Conyers v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number><em>Martial Arts World of Richmond, Inc., </em>273 Va. 96, 104, 639 S.E.2d 174, 178 (2007)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-4\">As to issues of statutory construction, \u201c[although the practical construction given to a statute by public officials charged with its enforcement is entitled to great weight by the courts and in doubtful cases will be regarded as decisive, when an issue involves a pure question of statutory interpretation, that issue does not invoke the agency\u2019s specialized competence but is a question of law to be decided by the courts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-5\"><em>Diaz v. Wilderness Resort Ass\u2019n, </em>56 Va.App. 104, 114, 691 S.E.2d 517, 522 (2010) (quoting <em>Commonwealth v. Barker, </em>275 Va. 529, 536, 659 S.E.2d 502, 505 (2008)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-6\">\u201cWhen the language of a statute is unambiguous, we are bound by the plain meaning of that language. Furthermore, we must give effect to the legislature\u2019s intention as expressed by the language used unless a literal interpretation of the language would result in a manifest absurdity. If a statute is subject to more than one interpretation, we must apply the interpretation that will carry out the legislative intent behind the statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-7\"><em>Ford Motor Co., </em>281 Va. at 549, 708 S.E.2d at 850 (quoting <em>Conyers, </em>273 Va. at 104, 639 S.E.2d at 178). Furthermore,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-8\">\u201cwe have a duty, whenever possible, to interpret the several parts of a statute as a consistent and harmonious whole so as to effectuate the legislative goal. Generally, the Court will look to the whole body of [a statute] to determine the true intention of each part. [A] statute should be read and considered as a whole, and the language of a statute should be examined in its entirety to determine the intent of the General Assembly from the words contained in the statute. In doing so, the various parts of the statute shall be harmonized so that, if practicable, each is given a sensible and intelligent effect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 549-50, 708 S.E.2d at 850 (quoting <em>Oraee v. Breeding, </em>270 Va. 488, 498, 621 S.E.2d 48, 52-53 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>\u201cThe purpose of the [Workers\u2019 Compensation] Act is to protect employees.\u201d <em>Turf Care, Inc. v.

Commonwealth Dep\u2019t of Highways, </em>182 Va. 293, 303, 28 S.E.2d 730, 734 (1944)). \u201cThus, it is to be \u2018construed liberally and favorably as to\u2019 employees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Ellis, </em>182 Va. at 303, 28 S.E.2d at 734); <em>see also Hospice Choice, Inc. v. O\u2019Quin, </em>42 Va.App. 598, 603, 593 S.E.2d 554, 556 (2004) (\u201c[W]e are guided by the general principle that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is to be construed liberally in favor of the employee.\u201d (citing <em>Creative Dimensions Group v. Hill, </em>16 Va.App. 439, 442, 430 S.E.2d 718, 720 (1993))); <em>7-Eleven, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Quality, </em>42 Va.App. 65, 75, 590 S.E.2d 84, 89 (2003) (en banc) (\u201c \u2018Further, it is a universal rule that statutes ... which are remedial in nature, are to be construed liberally, so as to suppress the mischief and advance the remedy, as the legislature intended.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Bd. of Sup. v. King Land Corp., </em>238 Va. 97, 103, 380 S.E.2d 895, 897-98 (1989))).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">B. Code \u00a7 65.2-708</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">In this case, the parties disagree as to the application of Code \u00a7 65.2-708(0 where an initial award was for medical benefits only, and no initial award for compensation was entered. Prince William County alleges that the commission erred as a matter of law when it held that Code \u00a7 65.2-708 and subsection (C) apply where there was no previous award for compensation. However, Rahim contends that this Court should consider the wages paid to Rahim from January 17, 2007, to January 17, \u25a0 2009, as compensation paid under an award, thus extending the statute of limitations so that her change-in-condition claim filed on October 7, 2009 was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Code \u00a7 65.2-601 provides, \u201c[t]he right to compensation under this title shall be forever barred, unless a claim be filed with the Commission within two years after the accident.\u201d \u201cThe purpose of the claim is to put the employer on notice of the injury sustained and its potential liability.\u201d <em>Keith v. Ball Metal Beverage Container Corp., </em>45 Va.App. 50, 53, 608 S.E.2d 501, 502 (2005). While \u201c[a] claim for compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>must be filed within two years after the accident,\u201d \u201cthe employee is not required to prove the disability during the two-year period.\u201d <em>Metro Mach. Corp. v. Lamb, </em>33 Va.App. 187, 192-93, 532 S.E.2d 337, 339 (2000) (citations omitted). \u201cInstead, the employee\u2019s claim must allege a present and existing disability within two years of the accident, and he must prove that disability to receive benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 193, 532 S.E.2d at 339 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">\u201cPursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A), \u2018a party may ask the commission to review any award of benefits based upon a change of condition.\u2019 \u201d <em>Diaz, </em>56 Va.App. at 115, 691 S.E.2d at 522 (quoting <em>Gordon, </em>55 Va.App. at 369, 685 S.E.2d at 883). Subsection A provides in relevant part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-5\">[u]pon its own motion or upon the application of any party in interest, on the ground of a change in condition, the Commission may review any <em>award </em>and on such review may make an award ending, diminishing, or increasing the compensation previously awarded.... <em>No such review shall be made after twenty-four months from the last day for which compensation was paid, </em>pursuant to an award under this title, except [under certain circumstances not applicable in the instant case].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">(Emphasis added).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">\u201cCode \u00a7 65.2-708(C) operates as a tolling provision that extends subsection A\u2019s limitation by expanding the definition of \u2018compensation\u2019 under subsection A to include wages which meet certain conditions.\u201d <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>281 Va. at 550, 708 S.E.2d at 850. Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C) specifically provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-8\">[a]ll wages paid, for a period not exceeding twenty-four consecutive months, to an employee (i) who is physically unable to return to his pre-injury work due to a compensable injury and (ii) who is provided work within his capacity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>at a wage equal to or greater than his pre-injury wage, shall be considered compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Therefore, \u201cCode \u00a7 65.2-708(C) tolls the operation of the subsection A statute of limitations in the same manner as the payment of compensation pursuant to an award.\u201d <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>281 Va. at 551, 708 S.E.2d at 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">In construing the two sections, the Supreme Court recently held that \u201cthe two subsections \u2018operat[e] in conjunction with each other. Subsection C is not a stand-alone provision\u2014it instead provides a definition for the tolling mechanism applied to subsection A, where a claimant has received wages (rather than compensation) as provided in subsection C.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gordon, </em>55 Va.App. at 373, 685 S.E.2d at 885).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Although Prince William County contends that this Court established in <em>Mayberry, </em>18 Va.App. 18, 441 S.E.2d 349, that Code \u00a7 65.2-708 does not apply where compensation benefits have not been previously awarded that can be \u201cended, diminished or increased,\u201d we find that holding limited to the facts of that case. In <em>Mayberry, </em>this Court held that, \u201c[bjecause Mayberry did not file a timely application or demonstrate any disability during the two year period, Mayberry cannot be awarded compensation for total disability ...,\u201d and further that, \u201cbecause no award for work incapacity was ever entered, Mayberry\u2019s application ... cannot be treated as an application for a change in condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20, 441 S.E.2d at 350. However, the context in which this Court reached this determination was that no claim seeking lost wages was ever filed nor were lost wages incurred, and no formal award was ever entered. <em>Id. </em>at 20-21, 441 S.E.2d at 350-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Mayberry\u2019s initial claim\u2019s application was for medical benefits only. The employer then voluntarily paid the medical expenses, and the commission never entered a formal award for either medical benefits or for work incapacity. This Court then concluded that there was \u201cnothing to review on a change in condition application,\u201d because there had been no formal award entered by the commission, and \u201c \u2018voluntary payment of medical expenses by the [insurer] is not the payment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>compensation which tolls the running of the statute of limitations.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21, 441 S.E.2d at 350-51 (quoting <em>Meade v. Clinchfield Coal Co., </em>215 Va. 18, 19, 205 S.E.2d 410, 411 (1974)). Thus, the conclusion that \u201cCode \u00a7 65.2-708(A) is inapplicable because there was no compensation previously-awarded which could be ended, diminished or increased\u201d was reached because there had been \u201cno <em>formal </em>award [ ] ever entered by the commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21, 441 S.E.2d at 350. In addition, the claimant in <em>Mayberry </em>never raised the issue that Code \u00a7 65.2-708(0 was applicable, and thus this Court did not address it in that case. Therefore, <em>Mayberry </em>does not address the issue presently before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">In <em>Humphreys, </em>this Court in dicta stated, \u201c[t]he school board correctly asserts that, where the commission has entered a \u2018medical benefits only\u2019 award for a compensable injury, any subsequent claim for compensation (i.e. lost wages) arising from that injury must be filed within two years from the date of the injury.\u201d 53 Va.App. at 360, 672 S.E.2d at 119 (citing <em>Keith, </em>45 Va.App. 50, 608 S.E.2d 501; <em>Mayberry, </em>18 Va.App. 18, 441 S.E.2d 349). Yet, this Court held in that case that the claimant\u2019s application for a change in condition was timely filed because even though the award entered was only for medical benefits, she had \u201creceived the equivalent of an award for compensation ...\u201d when she received wages for days she had missed from work for medical appointments. <em>Id. </em>at 366, 672 S.E.2d at 122. Contrary to the situation in <em>Humphreys, </em>a portion of Rahim\u2019s salary in this case was not treated as \u201cpayment of compensation for lost wages under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 361, 672 S.E.2d at 120. Moreover, this Court is not bound by dicta language in a prior holding. <em>See Newman v. Newman, </em>42 Va.App. 557, 566, 593 S.E.2d 533, 538 (2004) (en banc) (\u201cIt is a maxim not to be disregarded, that general expressions, in every opinion, are to be taken in connection with the case in which these expressions are used.

The commission then entered a \u201cmedical-only award\u201d on June 18, 2009, in which the parties stipulated that Rahim had \u201csustained compensable injuries,\u201d had not \u201csustain[ed] any wage loss or incur[red] any lost time from work,\u201d was \u201cpartially disabled\u201d but was \u201cprovided appropriate light duty work ... at or above the pre-injury average weekly wage from January 17, 2007 to the present and continuing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Applying the plain meaning of Code \u00a7 65.2-708 to the facts of this case, the \u201cmedical-only award\u201d\u2014which was predicated on the stipulated fact that Rahim had not lost work and was receiving her pre-injury wages\u2014entered by the commission on June 18, 2009, triggered the \u201cany award\u201d requirement of Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A). Thus, once the award was entered, Rahim had twenty-four months from the last day compensation was paid either pursuant to an award or pursuant to the requirements of subsection C within which to file a change-in-condition claim. Though the commission held that the payment of wages from January 17, 2007, and continuing for twenty-four months, was the compensation pursuant to an award that tolled the statute of limitations, because the June 18, 2009 award is the statutory trigger, the payment of wages must have occurred after June 18, 2009, to be considered compensation pursuant to an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">The record before us is unclear whether Rahim was \u201cprovided work within [her] capacity at a wage equal to or greater than [her] pre-injury wage ...\u201d from June 18, 2009, through August 11, 2009, such that the tolling provision in subsection C applies.

In addition, the order of the commission held that the wages for light duty paid from January 17, 2007, and continuing for twenty-four months\u2014January 17, 2009\u2014was compensation, and did not address whether she was paid wages meeting the requirements of subsection C from June 18, 2009, until August 11, 2009.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, there is no finding by the commission that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>Rahim received wages for light duty from June 18, 2009, until she was out of work for the surgery on August 11, 2009.

On March 31, 2008, the claimant filed a claim for benefits seeking temporary total disability benefits from January 26, 2008, and continuing, permanent partial disability benefits, and medical benefits. <em>Id. </em>The employer stipulated that the claimant had returned to full-duty work, but was subsequently placed on light-duty work with restrictions pursuant to a medical note on April 20, 2006. <em>Id. </em>at *1-2.

To the extent that any disagreement we have with the dissent suggests that the statutory language is not as ''plain\u201d as both we and the dissent believe it to be, the same result would be reached since the statute is remedial in nature, and any ambiguity is to be construed in favor of the employee. \" 'If a statute is subject to more than one interpretation, we must apply the interpretation that will carry out the legislative intent behind the statute.\u2019 \" <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>281 Va. at 549, 708 S.E.2d at 850 (quoting <em>Conyers, </em>273 Va. at 104, 639 S.E.2d at 178).

In her letter statement in opposition to the appeal to the full commission on May 28, 2010, Rahim alleged that \"Rahim has never been able to return to her pre-injury job[,] but was released to light duty after the accident and continued to perform light duty work until August 12, 2009 when her treating physician took her completely out of work and she underwent back surgery.\u201d However, the commission was silent in its order regarding whether she was provided light-duty work until August 12, 2009, and it only addressed the period of twenty-four months after January 17, 2007.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b555-7\">.

To be sure, in granting only these three powers (ending, diminishing, or increasing a prior award of compensation), the General Assembly conspicuously declined to enlarge the scope of Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A) to include a fourth power (making an initial award of compensation).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>were not true, the end-diminish-increase language in the statute would be wholly superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">Equally important, a prior award of medical benefits is not an award of compensation. The \u201c \u2018conventional meaning\u2019 of compensation includes only \u201cwage loss compensation, also commonly known as \u201cindemnity payments.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Uninsured Emp\u2019r\u2019s Fund v.

Thus, Rahim\u2019s award order\u2014which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>expressly declares itself a \u201cmedical-only award\u201d\u2014does not constitute an award of compensation, as the term is ordinarily understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">The majority correctly avoids the temptation of redefining compensation to encompass a medical-only award. Nonetheless, the majority accomplishes the same result by enlarging the scope of \u201csuch review\u201d under Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A). With respect to compensation, \u201csuch review\u201d includes only the statutory power to \u201cmake an award ending, diminishing or increasing the compensation previously awarded.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A). To remedy this omission, the majority amends the statute by adding the power to make an initial award of compensation. In other words, the express statutory power to end, diminish, or increase a <em>prior award </em>of compensation has been judicially expanded to include an implied power to make an award of compensation <em>in the first </em>instance.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">No matter how liberally we construe the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, we cannot \u201cjudicially graft\u201d an unwritten provision into the statute, <em>Cent.

The heavy reliance of the majority on <em>Ford Motor Co. v. Gordon, </em>281 Va. 543, 708 S.E.2d 846 (2011), adds little to the analysis. In that case, there were multiple \"awards of compensation\u201d prior to the commission\u2019s exercise of its award-review authority under Code \u00a7 65.2-708. <em>Id. </em>at 546, 708 S.E.2d at 848. Equally inapt is the majority\u2019s discussion of subsection C of \u00a7 65.2-708, which merely tolls the limitation extension period of subsection A. Nothing in subsection C grants the commission the power to make an initial award of compensation over and above its express statutory power to end, diminish, or increase a prior award of compensation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b559-16\">. For reasons unexplained in the record, Rahim\u2019s counsel did not ask the commission to reserve jurisdiction in its medical-only award to consider anticipated, but unripe, future wage claims. As Professor Larson has explained, the \"ability to reserve continuing jurisdiction can be suitably exercised in cases where the injured worker is, through some fortuity, currently earning wages at least equal to his or her preinjuiy earnings, but it is clear that the worker has indeed suffered a loss in wage earning potential which will manifest itself in the future.\u201d 8 Lex K.
