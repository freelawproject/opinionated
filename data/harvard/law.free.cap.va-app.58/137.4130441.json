Background</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Gary Prizzia (\u201chusband\u201d) and Judit Prizzia (\u201cwife\u201d) were married in Hungary on August 28, 1999. While they were living there, their only child was born on February 3, 2000. In April 2000, the Prizzias moved to Virginia, where they resided until December 15, 2002. On that date, both parties took the child to Hungary for a visit over the Christmas holidays. Husband returned to Virginia on December 25, 2002, and wife and the child remained in Hungary. On February 4, 2003, wife filed for divorce in Hungary, requesting custody of the child. Upon learning of wife\u2019s actions, husband filed for divorce in the Circuit Court of Henrico County on May 6, 2003. Husband\u2019s complaint also requested the court to award him custody of the child and to make an equitable distribution of the marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">On December 30, 2003, the trial court entered an order finding \u201cthat Hungary ha[d] proper jurisdiction over the parties as to divorce, custody, visitation and child support,\u201d and accordingly \u201cdeeline[d] to exercise jurisdiction over [those] matters at [that] time.\u201d Furthermore, the trial court\u2019s order provided that \u201c[a]fter a final decree of divorce is granted in Hungary, this [c]ourt will hear argument on equitable distribution and spousal support.\u201d Finally, the order stated: \u201cIn the future, if spousal support and/or child support is awarded in this [e]ourt, it can be made retroactive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">On March 19, 2005, the Hungarian court granted the parties a divorce and awarded custody of the child to wife, with visitation rights to husband. The Hungarian court did not award child support, nor did it divide the parties\u2019 property. Husband then sought to revive the dormant proceeding in Henrico County in order to address all issues other than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>divorce. Wife did not return to Virginia for the hearings, but was granted permission to present testimony by telephonic deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">On May 24, 2010, the trial court entered a final decree. The final decree addressed the issues of equitable distribution, child support, and spousal support. The trial court declined to enter any order dealing with the issues of divorce or child custody, choosing instead to defer to the Hungarian court\u2019s ruling on those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">On appeal, husband assigns numerous errors to the trial court\u2019s actions, and wife argues three additional assignments of error as well. We discuss additional facts that are relevant to specific assignments of error in our analysis below.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">\n<em>A. Child Custody and Visitation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">Husband first argues that the trial court erred in finding that the Hungarian court had jurisdiction to decide the issues of child custody and visitation. Thus, he posits, the trial court erred in failing to exercise its jurisdiction over those issues.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Where multiple states or foreign countries have potential initial jurisdiction over child custody, the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>dictates where actual jurisdiction shall be exercised. Here, we conclude that the trial court failed to follow the requirements of the UCCJEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">1. Jurisdiction To Make an Initial Child Custody Determination</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">To determine whether a court of this Commonwealth has jurisdiction to make an initial child custody determination,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we look to Code \u00a7 20-146.12:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-7\">A. Except as otherwise provided in \u00a7 20-146.15 [the section providing for temporary emergency jurisdiction], a court of this Commonwealth has jurisdiction to make an initial child custody determination only if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-8\">1. This Commonwealth is the home state of the child on the date of the commencement of the proceeding, or was the home state of the child within six months before the commencement of the proceeding and the child is absent from this Commonwealth but a parent or person acting as a parent continues to live in this Commonwealth;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-9\">2. A court of another state does not have jurisdiction under subdivision 1, or a court of the home state of the child has declined to exercise jurisdiction on the ground that this Commonwealth is the more appropriate forum under \u00a7 20-146.18 or \u00a7 20-146.19, and (i) the child and the child\u2019s parents, or the child and at least one parent or a person acting as a parent, have a significant connection with this Commonwealth other than mere physical presence and (ii) substantial evidence is available in this Commonwealth concerning the child\u2019s care, protection, training, and personal relationships;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>3. All courts having jurisdiction under subdivision 1 or 2 have declined to exercise jurisdiction on the ground that a court of this Commonwealth is the more appropriate forum to determine the custody of the child under \u00a7 20-146.18 or \u00a7 20-146.19; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-5\">4. No court of any other state would have jurisdiction under the criteria specified in subdivision 1, 2, or 3.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">As subsection (B) makes clear, \u201cSubsection A is the exclusive jurisdictional basis for making a child custody determination by a court of this Commonwealth.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-146.12(B). Thus, to determine whether a court of this Commonwealth had jurisdiction to make an initial child custody determination in this case, we must first decide what the \u201chome state\u201d of the child was on May 6, 2003, the date this proceeding was commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">The UCCJEA defines \u201chome state\u201d as \u201cthe state in which a child lived with a parent or a person acting as a parent for at least six consecutive months immediately before the commencement of a child custody proceeding---- A period of temporary absence of any of the mentioned persons is part of the period.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-146.1. Hence, a child\u2019s \u201chome state\u201d is where the child has lived with one or more of his parents for the consecutive six-month period immediately preceding the date on which a child custody proceeding is filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">However, this is not the only six-month period we must consider in analyzing initial jurisdiction over child custody under Code \u00a7 20-146.12(A)(l). Where, as here, the child was not living in Virginia on the date the proceeding was filed, we must determine if Virginia was the child\u2019s home state at any time during the six months before the filing date. If so, Virginia would continue to have initial jurisdiction. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-146.12(A)(l) (prescribing initial custody jurisdiction if the \u201cCommonwealth is the home state of the child on the date of the commencement of the proceeding, <em>or </em>was the home state of the child within six months before the commencement of the proceeding and the child is absent from this Commonwealth but a parent or person acting as a parent continues to live in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>this Commonwealth\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (emphasis added)). This alternate basis for jurisdiction becomes relevant in instances where a child has acquired a new residence less than six months before the commencement of a custody proceeding, thus rendering the child technically without a home state as of the date of the commencement of the proceeding. In such a case, the court must examine whether the child had a home state at any point within the six-month period preceding the date of filing. In other words, the court must ask whether at any point throughout the six months preceding the date of filing, it could be said that on a particular date, the child had lived with a parent in a particular state for at least six consecutive months. The purpose behind this statutory scheme is to extend a state\u2019s home state status throughout the six-month period it would take for another state to become the child\u2019s new home state.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">Thus, if a child lived with a parent in Virginia for six months and then moved to another state (or another country, for that matter), Virginia would continue to have jurisdiction to make an initial child custody determination under Code \u00a7 20-146.12(A)(1) until the child had lived long enough in the other state (i.e., six months) for that state to become the child\u2019s new home state. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-146.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">With this understanding of the UCCJEA\u2019s basic jurisdictional scheme in mind, we need not decide whether the child\u2019s presence in Hungary from December 15, 2002 to May 6, 2003 constituted a \u201cperiod of temporary absence\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 20-146.1, thus rendering Virginia the home state as of the date of filing, or whether the child had actually changed residence from Virginia to Hungary during that time. Even if the child\u2019s residence had permanently changed on December 15, 2002 from Virginia to Hungary, Virginia continued to have initial child custody jurisdiction for six months after that date. Thus, as of May 6, 2003, the date on which husband commenced this custody proceeding, Virginia either was the child\u2019s home state or had been the child\u2019s home state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>within the previous six months. This means that under Code \u00a7 20-146.12(A)(l), Virginia had jurisdiction to make an initial child custody determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">2. Declining To Exercise Jurisdiction Under the UCCJEA</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Having concluded that Virginia had jurisdiction to make an initial child custody determination, we must next analyze whether the trial court properly declined to exercise its jurisdiction under the UCCJEA. In analyzing this issue, we must decide as a subsidiary issue whether Hungary also had jurisdiction under the UCCJEA\u2019s jurisdictional framework. In considering this question, we treat the Hungarian court as we would a court of another state in the United States: \u201cA court of this Commonwealth shall treat a foreign country as if it were a state of the United States for purposes of applying this article and Article 2 (\u00a7 20-146.12 et seq.) of this chapter.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-146.4(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Code \u00a7 20-146.4(B) directs that \u201ca child custody determination made in a foreign country under factual circumstances in substantial conformity with the jurisdictional standards of this act must be recognized and enforced under Article 3 (\u00a7 20-146.22 et seq.) of this chapter.\u201d In other words, a Virginia court must recognize and enforce a foreign custody determination if the facts of the case would have supported a finding of jurisdiction by the foreign court had it applied the jurisdictional standards of the UCCJEA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Here, when we apply the jurisdictional standards of the UCCJEA to the facts before the Hungarian court as of February 4, 2003, when wife first filed her divorce and custody petition, we conclude that the Hungarian court did not exercise jurisdiction \u201cunder factual circumstances in substantial conformity with\u201d the UCCJEA\u2019s jurisdictional standards. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-146.4(13). Essentially, we are faced with the question, \u201cUnder the standards of Code \u00a7 20-146.12, did the Hungarian court have jurisdiction to make an initial child custody determination as of February 4, 2003?\u201d We hold that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">First, Hungary was not the \u201chome state\u201d of the child in February 2003, when wife filed her divorce and custody petition in the Hungarian court. The child had not yet lived in Hungary for six months as of February 4, 2003. Furthermore, Hungary had not been the home state of the child at any time during the six-month period immediately preceding the date of wife\u2019s filing on February 4, 2003.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, Hungary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>did not have jurisdiction under Code \u00a7 20-146.12(A)(1) at the time of wife\u2019s filing. Rather, Virginia continued to have home state jurisdiction at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Second, Hungary did not have jurisdiction pursuant to any of the other potential avenues for obtaining jurisdiction under Code \u00a7 20-146.12(A), viz., subsections (A)(2), (A)(3), and (A)(4). This is for two reasons: (1) Virginia retained home state jurisdiction under Code \u00a7 20-146.12(A)(l); and (2) the Virginia trial court did not decline to exercise jurisdiction on the ground that the Hungarian court was the more appropriate forum in accordance with the requirements of Code \u00a7 20-146.18 or Code \u00a7 20-146.19. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-146.12(A)(2)-(4). We have already discussed the first reason. We will now explain the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Although the trial court said it was \u201cdeclining] to exercise jurisdiction\u201d over child custody matters in this case, the trial court did not decline to exercise its jurisdiction in a manner that conformed either to Code \u00a7 20-146.18 or to Code \u00a7 20-146.19.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Code \u00a7 20-146.18(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">A court of this Commonwealth that has jurisdiction under this act to make a child custody determination may decline to exercise its jurisdiction at any time if it determines that it is an inconvenient forum under the circumstances and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">However, Code \u00a7 20-146.18 does not permit a court simply to declare that it has decided to decline to exercise jurisdiction. Rather, Code \u00a7 20-146.18(B) requires:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-9\">Before determining whether it is an inconvenient forum, a court of this Commonwealth <em>shall </em>consider whether it is appropriate for a court of another state to exercise jurisdiction. For this purpose, the court <em>shall allow the parties to present evidence and shall consider all relevant </em>factors....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdD\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>(Emphasis added.) The statute then lists eight specific factors the court must consider in determining whether to decline to exercise jurisdiction under this section.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Thus, in order for a trial court to decline to exercise jurisdiction under Code \u00a7 20-146.18, it must specifically determine two things: (1) \u201cthat it is an inconvenient forum under the circumstances,\u201d and (2) \u201cthat a court of another state is a more appropriate forum.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-146.18(A). Furthermore, in \u201cconsidering] whether it is appropriate for a court of another state to exercise jurisdiction,\u201d the trial court <em>must </em>both \u201callow the parties to present evidence\u201d and \u201cconsider all relevant factors, including [those listed in the statute].\u201d Code \u00a7 20-146.18(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Here, the trial court failed to do what the statute requires. The trial court made no specific determination that Virginia was an inconvenient forum under the circumstances or that the Hungarian court was a more appropriate forum. Moreover, the trial court did not allow the parties to present all relevant evidence, as husband requested, on the issue of whether it was more appropriate for the Hungarian court to exercise jurisdiction. Because it did not allow the parties to present evidence pertaining to the statutory factors, the trial court could not have based its decision on a proper review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>those factors. Thus, we conclude that by failing to follow the requirements of Code \u00a7 20-146.18, the trial court did not properly decline to exercise its jurisdiction pursuant to that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The second way a trial court can decline to exercise its jurisdiction over child custody is set forth in Code \u00a7 20-146.19, which states that \u201cif a court of this Commonwealth has jurisdiction under this act because a person seeking to invoke its jurisdiction has engaged in unjustifiable conduct, the court shall decline to exercise its jurisdiction unless [one of certain enumerated exceptions is met].\u201d Code \u00a7 20-146.19(A). Here, there is no evidence that Virginia had home state jurisdiction because husband had engaged in unjustifiable conduct. The trial court did not make this finding, nor did it base its decision to decline to exercise jurisdiction on Code \u00a7 20-146.19, Therefore, this second avenue for declining to exercise jurisdiction does not apply to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">Because the trial court did not properly decline to exercise its jurisdiction under Code \u00a7 20-146.18 or Code \u00a7 20-146.19, its vague, unexplained, general decision to decline to exercise jurisdiction was improper under the UCCJEA. Moreover, since Virginia had jurisdiction to make an initial child custody determination under Code \u00a7 20\u2014146.12(A)(1), and since the Virginia trial court did not properly decline to exercise this jurisdiction pursuant to either Code \u00a7 20-146.18 or Code \u00a7 20-146.19, Hungary did not have jurisdiction to make an initial child custody determination under Code \u00a7 20-146.12(A)(2), (A)(3), or (A)(4). Therefore, under the jurisdictional standards of the UCCJEA, Virginia had jurisdiction to make an initial child custody determination, and Hungary did not.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, it was error for the trial court to defer to the Hungarian court on the issue of child custody in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>manner that it did. We thus reverse this decision of the trial court and remand for the trial court to decide whether to exercise its jurisdiction and award custody pursuant to Virginia law. In making that determination, the trial court must allow the parties to present evidence and must consider all relevant factors, including those expressly listed in Code \u00a7 20-146.18(B).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If, based on that consideration, the trial court concludes that Virginia is an inconvenient forum under the current circumstances and that Hungary is currently a more appropriate forum for determination of child custody, the trial court may decline to exercise its jurisdiction under Code \u00a7 20-146.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">\n<em>B. Child Support</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Husband assigns error to the trial court\u2019s award of child support on several grounds, arguing that: (1) the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>did not have jurisdiction to award child support; (2) the trial court erred in applying the wrong standard of proof in its decision not to deviate from the statutory guidelines; and (3) the trial court erred in awarding child support retroactive to the date wife filed her initial pleadings. We disagree with husband\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">1. Jurisdiction over Child Support</p>\n<p id=\"A_1\">Initially, husband argues that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to award child support because it had previously ruled the Hungarian court had proper jurisdiction over child support. In its order of December 30, 2003, the trial court did find that Hungary had proper jurisdiction over child support and accordingly declined to exercise jurisdiction over child support at that time. However, this order did not constitute a finding that the trial court had no jurisdiction over child support. Rather, the trial court was simply declining to exercise jurisdiction over child support at that particular time. <em>See Prizzia v. Prizzia, </em>45 Va.App. 280, 286, 610 S.E.2d 326, 329 (2005) (noting that the language of the trial court\u2019s order in this case \u201cdoes not preclude the possibility that the court would later exercise jurisdiction and rule on the merits of the case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Husband also argues that Code \u00a7 20-107.2 did not give the trial court jurisdiction to award child support in this case. Code \u00a7 20-107.2 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-7\">Upon entry of a decree providing (i) for the dissolution of a marriage, (ii) for a divorce, whether from the bond of matrimony or from bed and board, (iii) that neither party is entitled to a divorce, or (iv) for separate maintenance, the court may make such further decree as it shall deem expedient concerning the custody or visitation and support of the minor children of the parties....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">As husband notes, none of these four prerequisites appear to be present in this case. The trial court did not divorce the parties; the Hungarian court divorced them. Although wife argues that the trial court decreed neither party was entitled to a divorce under Code \u00a7 20-107.2(iii), the trial court did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>deny the parties a divorce on the merits of their case. Rather, the trial court simply declined to exercise jurisdiction over the issue of divorce. An order declining to exercise jurisdiction over divorce is not the same as a decree denying a divorce on the merits, as Code \u00a7 20-107.2(iii) appears to contemplate. Thus, we will assume without deciding that Code \u00a7 20-107.2 did not give the trial court jurisdiction to award child support in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">However, that does not mean that the trial court erred in awarding child support. Husband\u2019s counsel conceded at oral argument that if the trial court had jurisdiction over child custody, it would also have had jurisdiction over child support. We agree. Code \u00a7 16.1\u2014241(A)(3) provides that the juvenile and domestic relations district court has jurisdiction over all cases where the custody, visitation, or support of a child \u201cis a subject of controversy or requires determination.\u201d However, that section also expressly states that \u201c[i]n such cases jurisdiction shall be concurrent with and not exclusive of courts having equity jurisdiction.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A)(3). In this case, the trial court had equity jurisdiction, because the case originally began as a suit for divorce. We hold that where a case is originally filed as a divorce proceeding and includes child custody and child support issues, and where the trial court has jurisdiction to decide child custody<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>\u2014even though it does not end up exercising jurisdiction over the divorce itself\u2014the trial court also retains jurisdiction to award child support as an equitable concomitant to its jurisdiction over child custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Thus, we conclude that the trial court had jurisdiction to award child support in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>2. Failure To Deviate from Statutory Guidelines</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">Husband next argues that the trial court erred in failing to deviate from the statutory guidelines because it did not apply the proper standard of proof. As husband notes, Code \u00a7 20-108.1(B) creates a rebuttable presumption that the amount of child support set forth in the statute is proper. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-108.1(B). To rebut this presumption and deviate from the statutory guidelines, the court must find \u201cthat the application of such guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the trial court found there was \u201cno ostensible reason to deviate\u201d from the statutory guidelines, and accordingly ordered husband to pay child support to wife \u201cpursuant to statutory guidelines.\u201d Husband argues this was not the proper standard for the trial court\u2019s decision not to deviate from the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The problem with husband\u2019s argument is that Code \u00a7 20-108.1(B) does not require a trial court to make any finding at all when it decides to follow the guidelines. A trial court imposing the statutory guideline amount need not specifically find that application of the guideline amount <em>would not </em>be unjust or inappropriate. Rather, this section simply requires a trial court to make a specific finding that application of the guidelines <em>would </em>be unjust or inappropriate when it decides to deviate from those guidelines. <em>See id. </em>Since the trial court here followed the statutory guideline amount, it was not required to make any findings regarding whether that amount was unjust or inappropriate. No finding was necessary to support its decision to follow the guidelines. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s decision to follow the statutory guidelines in determining the amount of child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">3. Retroactive Child Support</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Husband\u2019s third assignment of error related to child support is that the trial court erred in awarding child support retroactive to the date wife filed her initial pleadings. Husband contends the trial court had no jurisdiction to award this retroactive child support because the trial court had already ruled it had no jurisdiction over child support. In reality, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>however, the trial court never so ruled. As we have explained above, <em>supra </em>II.B.1, the trial court\u2019s order of December 30, 2003 did not constitute a finding that the trial court had no jurisdiction over child support. Rather, it was simply a decision to decline to exercise jurisdiction over child support at that particular time.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Because this order is no basis for saying the trial court had no jurisdiction over child support, we affirm the trial court\u2019s award of child support retroactive to the date wife filed her initial pleadings.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">\n<em>C. Equitable Distribution</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Husband next argues that the trial court erred in finding husband gifted his separate interest in the marital residence to wife. Wife challenges, for the first time on appeal, the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction to make an equitable distribution award. We disagree with both of the parties\u2019 contentions. For the sake of logical organization, we will address wife\u2019s jurisdictional challenge first.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">1. Jurisdiction over Equitable Distribution</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">We requested the parties to provide supplemental briefs on the following issues: (1) whether the trial court had jurisdiction under Code \u00a7 20-107.3 to make an equitable distribution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>award; and (2) if the trial court did not have jurisdiction under Code \u00a7 20-107.3, whether this jurisdictional defect was waived by lack of appropriate objection below. We conclude that even if the jurisdictional prerequisites of Code \u00a7 20-107.3 were not met, wife\u2019s failure to object on these grounds below effectively waived any such alleged defects.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Wife contends that if the prerequisites of Code \u00a7 20-107.3 are not met, a court is without subject matter jurisdiction to divide a marital estate. We disagree. As the Supreme Court has recently reiterated, \u201c \u2018subject matter jurisdiction ... is the authority granted through constitution or statute to adjudicate a class of cases or controversies.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ghameshlouy v. Commonwealth, </em>279 Va. 379, 389, 689 S.E.2d 698, 703 (2010) (quoting <em>Bd. of Supervisors v. Bd. of Zoning Appeals, </em>271 Va. 336, 344, 626 S.E.2d 374, 379 (2006)). Significantly, however, the Supreme Court has \u201c \u2018emphasized] the necessary distinction to be drawn ... between the power of a court to adjudicate a specified class of cases, commonly known as \u201csubject matter jurisdiction,\u201d and the authority of a court to exercise that power in a particular case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nelson v. Warden, </em>262 Va. 276, 281, 552 S.E.2d 73, 75 (2001) (omission in original) (quoting <em>Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>259 Va. 431, 437, 527 S.E.2d 406, 409 (2000)). As the Supreme Court has explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Au\">subject matter jurisdiction, perhaps best understood as the \u201cpotential\u201d jurisdiction of a court, is the authority granted to it by constitution or statute over a specified class of cases or controversies, and becomes \u201cactive\u201d jurisdiction, the power to adjudicate a particular case upon the merits, only when various elements are present.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-6\"><em>Ghameshlouy, </em>279 Va. at 388-89, 689 S.E.2d at 702-03. These elements include subject matter jurisdiction, territorial jurisdiction, notice jurisdiction, \u201c \u2018and <em>the other conditions of fact ... which are demanded by the unwritten or statute law as the prerequisites of the authority of the court to proceed to judgment or </em>decree.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 389, 689 S.E.2d at 703 (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Bd. of Supervisors, </em>271 Va. at 344, 626 S.E.2d at 379).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>While \u201c \u2018the lack of subject matter jurisdiction can be raised at any time in the proceedings, even for the first time on appeal by the court <em>sua sponte,\u2019 </em>\u201d <em>Porter v. Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 203, 228, 661 S.E.2d 415, 427 (2008) (quoting <em>Morrison v. Bestler, </em>239 Va. 166, 170, 387 S.E.2d 753, 756 (1990)), \u201c \u2018defects in the other jurisdictional elements generally will be considered waived unless raised in the pleadings filed with the trial court and properly preserved on appeal,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 229, 661 S.E.2d at 427 (quoting <em>Morrison, </em>239 Va. at 170, 387 S.E.2d at 756).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">Code \u00a7 20-96 grants a circuit court subject matter jurisdiction over \u201csuits for annulling or affirming marriage and for divorces.\u201d In a divorce case, Code \u00a7 20-107.3 further provides the trial court with authority to make an equitable distribution of the parties\u2019 marital estate, provided certain prerequisites are met. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A). Before a trial court can make an equitable distribution award under Code \u00a7 20-107.3, it must \u201cdecree[ ] the dissolution of a marriage,\u201d \u201cdecree[ ] a divorce from the bond of matrimony,\u201d or receive a filing \u201cof a certified copy of a final divorce decree obtained without the Commonwealth\u201d as provided in Code \u00a7 20-107.3(J). <em>Id. </em>However, under the Supreme Court\u2019s jurisprudence distinguishing subject matter jurisdiction from the statutory prerequisites to the court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction in a particular case, we conclude that the statutory prerequisites of Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A) can be waived. If a party does not object to the trial court\u2019s authority to make an equitable distribution award based on an alleged failure to satisfy the prerequisites of Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A) in a particular divorce case, that party has waived the right to raise that objection on appeal. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18 (requiring generally that an objection be \u201cstated with reasonable certainty at the time of the ruling\u201d); <em>see also Porter, </em>276 Va. at 228-29, 661 S.E.2d at 426-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Wife had the opportunity below to object to the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction over equitable distribution, and she failed to do so. The Hungarian divorce decree was filed with the trial court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>and if wife had any objection that specific elements of Code \u00a7 20-107.3(J) were not satisfied, she should have raised this objection below, during the equitable distribution proceedings, for the trial court\u2019s consideration. However, wife failed to raise any objection to the trial court\u2019s equitable distribution award on the grounds that the statutory prerequisites of Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A) or (J) were not met.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Therefore, she waived any objection she may have had to the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction over equitable distribution based on failure to comply with the prerequisites of Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A) or (J).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Accordingly, we will not reverse the trial court\u2019s equitable distribution award for alleged failure to satisfy the statutory prerequisites of Code \u00a7 20-107.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">2. Sufficiency of the Evidence To Prove a Gift</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Husband argues that the trial court erred in finding husband gifted his separate interest in the marital residence to the marital estate. We conclude the trial court did not err in making this finding. Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3)(e) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-6\">When marital property and separate property are commingled into newly acquired property resulting in the loss of identity of the contributing properties, the commingled property shall be deemed transmuted to marital property. However, to the extent the contributed property is retraceable by a preponderance of the evidence and was not a gift, the contributed property shall retain its original classification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Here, the trial court found that husband\u2019s separate interest in the marital residence was retraceable. However, the trial court also found that husband gifted this separate interest to the marital estate. As we have noted before with respect to a similar subdivision of \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3), \u201cwhen retraceable separate property is used to purchase a gift, it no longer retains its classification as separate property.\u201d <em>Watts v. Watts, </em>40 Va.App. 685, 701, 581 S.E.2d 224, 232 (2003). Wife here had the burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that husband made a gift to the marital estate of his separate interest in the property. <em>See Utsch v. Utsch, </em>266 Va. 124, 128, 581 S.E.2d 507, 508 (2003) (\u201cThe burden of proof that the transfer was a gift is upon the party seeking to establish the gift.\u201d); <em>Cirrito v. Cirrito, </em>44 Va.App. 287, 303, 605 S.E.2d 268, 275 (2004) (\u201cThe burden of proof that the transfer was a gift is upon the party seeking to establish the gift by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d). Thus, wife had to prove the three elements of a gift: \u201c\u2018(1) the intention on the part of the donor to make the gift; (2) delivery or transfer of the gift; and (3) acceptance of the gift by the donee.\u2019 \u201d <em>Robinson v. Robinson, </em>46 Va.App. 652, 665, 621 S.E.2d 147, 154 (2005) (en banc) (quoting <em>Theismann v. Theismann, </em>22 Va.App. 557, 566, 471 S.E.2d 809, 813, <em>aff'd on reh\u2019g en banc, </em>23 Va.App. 697, 479 S.E.2d 534 (1996)). Husband contends that wife failed to carry her burden of proving husband\u2019s donative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The trial court found that three circumstances in particular supported its finding that husband intended to make a gift to the marital estate. First, the trial court noted that the property was jointly titled. <em>See Rowe v. Rowe, </em>24 Va.App. 123, 137, 480 S.E.2d 760, 766 (1997) (\u201cThe fact that property is jointly titled must be considered by the trial court in determining if a gift was made, but alone, it is insufficient proof of a gift.\u201d). Second, the trial court based its finding on wife\u2019s testimony that husband and wife \u201cused [wife\u2019s separate funds] to pay for several of our expenses, and this way we could save [husband\u2019s] salary and use it to repay our mortgage and pay for other expenses.\u201d Third, the trial court relied on husband\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>testimony that, \u201cBecause we loved the house so much, we decided to pay off the house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">\u201cOn appeal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to ... the party prevailing below.\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>46 Va.App. at 660, 621 S.E.2d at 151. Furthermore, \u201cbecause the trial court\u2019s classification of property is a finding of fact, that classification will not be reversed on appeal unless it is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 661, 621 S.E.2d at 151; <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-680. Based on the multiple factors listed above that the trial court considered, we cannot say the trial court\u2019s finding that husband had donative intent with respect to the marital residence was plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. The residence was jointly titled in husband\u2019s and wife\u2019s names, and the couple agreed together to pay off the mortgage because they \u201cloved the house.\u201d They allocated the way in which they spent their funds to achieve this jointly desired goal.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This evidence is sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding that husband intended to gift to the marital estate his separate interest in the funds that were used to purchase and pay off the mortgage on the marital residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">\n<em>D. The Fugitive Disentitlement Doctrine</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Husband\u2019s next assignment of error is that the trial court erred in failing to apply the fugitive disentitlement doctrine to wife in order to require her to testify in person before the trial court. Husband does not ask for wife\u2019s claims to be dismissed, or for her to be completely barred from participating in this action. Rather, husband simply asks that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>wife be required to appear in person before the trial court, arguing the trial court erred in allowing wife to participate by telephonic deposition as a substitute for live testimony.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">We begin by noting the absolute nature of the remedy afforded by the fugitive disentitlement doctrine. If the fugitive disentitlement doctrine applies in a particular case, the remedy afforded by the doctrine is a dismissal of a litigant\u2019s claims or a complete bar to the litigant\u2019s participation in the action. <em>See Degen v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 820, 826, 828, 116 S.Ct. 1777, 1782-88, 135 L.Ed.2d 102 (1996) (describing the fugitive disentitlement doctrine as \u201ca rule forbidding all participation by the absent claimant\u201d and \u201cforeclosing consideration of claims on the merits\u201d). If a lesser alternative to such an extreme remedy is available, the doctrine does not apply. <em>Id. </em>at 827, 116 S.Ct. at 1782 (reversing a trial court\u2019s application of the fugitive disentitlement doctrine to bar a criminal indictee from participating in a related civil suit, because \u201c[t]he existence of ... alternative means of protecting the Government\u2019s interests [in that ease] show[ed] the lack of necessity for the harsh sanction of absolute disentitlement\u201d); <em>Matsumoto v. Matsumoto, </em>171 N.J. 110, 792 A.2d 1222, 1233 (2002) (observing that the fugitive disentitlement doctrine is to be applied only \u201cso long as nothing less than dismissal will suffice\u201d); <em>see Sasson v. Shenhar, </em>276 Va. 611, 623, 667 S.E.2d 555, 561 (2008) (noting that the fugitive disentitlement doctrine should not be applied to bar an appeal unless \u201cno lesser sanction or remedy is available\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Husband acknowledges that a lesser remedy than dismissal or a complete bar to participation is appropriate in this case. Therefore, he cannot successfully argue that the trial court erred in failing to apply the fugitive disentitlement doctrine to wife. Rather, husband\u2019s argument, as he states it more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>precisely, is that the trial court erred in failing to apply the rationales underlying the fugitive disentitlement doctrine to require wife to appear before the trial court in person instead of permitting her to participate via telephonic deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">We decline to adopt any rule requiring trial courts to impose particular remedies or sanctions in specific cases, apart from the general requirement that a trial court\u2019s decision regarding remedies and sanctions not constitute an abuse of its discretion. <em>See Oxenham v. Johnson, </em>241 Va. 281, 287, 402 S.E.2d 1, 4 (1991) (\u201c[W]e apply an abuse-of-discretion standard in reviewing a trial court\u2019s award or denial of a sanction.\u201d). \u201cFugitive disentitlement is a doctrine that springs out of the inherent power of courts to enforce their judgments and protect their dignity.\u201d <em>Matsumoto, </em>792 A.2d at 1227. The fugitive disentitlement doctrine thus <em>permits </em>radical sanctions against fugitive litigants in extreme circumstances, but it does not serve as the basis for erecting a complex pyramid of varying degrees of particular sanctions and remedies that <em>must </em>be imposed in specific situations. We hold that the fugitive disentitlement doctrine and its various rationales do not grant a non-fugitive party a right to the imposition of any particular lesser remedy in a specific case. If the fugitive disentitlement doctrine <em>per se </em>does not apply\u2014with its extreme remedy\u2014the decision whether to impose any particular lesser remedy against a fugitive litigant in a specific case rests squarely within the sound discretion of the trial court in the case before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The question before us thus becomes whether the trial court abused its discretion in failing to give husband the precise lesser remedy he requested. We cannot say on the facts before us that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to order wife to appear in person to testify. The trial court was within its discretion in deciding what specific measures it did or did not need to take to \u201cenforce [its] judgments and protect [its] dignity.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Matsumoto, </em>792 A.2d at 1227. We therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>affirm the trial court\u2019s decision to permit wife to participate via telephonic deposition instead of requiring her to appear in person.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">\n<em>E. The QDRO and the Trial Court\u2019s Final Decree</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">In his final assignment of error, husband contends that the trial court erred by entering a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) that altered the final decree\u2019s valuation of the marital share of husband\u2019s GE Savings and Security Plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In its final decree, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-7\">Ms. Prizzia shall receive 40% of the marital share of Mr. Prizzia\u2019s GE Savings and Security Plan, namely that which accrued between August 29, 1999 and December 31, 2002, plus any interest, earnings, gains and losses on her share from December 31, 2002 until the date of distribution. The division shall be by a QDRO.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">The QDRO<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> assigned to wife \u201cnine percent (9%) of the current market value of [husband\u2019s] account.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>The trial court arrived at this nine percent figure by utilizing the \u201ccoverture fraction\u201d that is typically applied to defined benefit plans. However, husband\u2019s Plan is not a defined benefit plan, but a defined contribution plan. As we have previously indicated, the coverture fraction is an inappropriate method to determine the marital share of a defined contribution plan. <em>Mann v. Mann, </em>22 Va.App. 459, 465 n. 6, 470 S.E.2d 605, 607 n. 6 (1996) (\u201cApplying [the coverture] fraction to a defined contribution plan could lead to incongruous results, and such an approach is not generally used. Proration of a defined contribution plan is typically accomplished by tracing separately contributed funds.\u201d (citation omitted)); <em>see also </em>Brett R. Turner, <em>Equitable Distribution of Property </em>\u00a7 6:24 (3d ed.2005) (explaining why \u201c[i]t is generally error to classify a defined contribution retirement plan using the time-based coverture fraction used to classify defined benefit plans,\u201d and why \u201c[application of a time-based coverture to defined contribution plans creates a significant risk of reaching unjust results\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">The trial court\u2019s final decree defined the Plan\u2019s marital share as the amount of money that accrued between two specific dates\u2014\u201cthat which accrued between August 29, 1999 and December 31, 2002.\u201d Thus, the final decree was concerned with the amount of money that <em>actually accrued </em>during a certain time period. In contrast, the coverture fraction is concerned solely with proportions of time, completely disregarding what may actually accrue during any particular period of time. Since the coverture fraction is based on temporal proportions rather than on what actually accrued in an account during a particular time, the trial court effectively altered the terms of the final decree when it entered the QDRO. Thus, the trial court\u2019s use of the coverture fraction in its QDRO was not an appropriate method for \u201ceffectuating] the expressed intent\u201d of its final decree. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">\u201c\u2018We have previously held that [QDRO] orders that alter critical terms of the [equitable distribution order], such as timing or amount of payments, exceed the authority granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>under Code \u00a7 20-107.3(K)(4).\u2019 \u201d <em>Turner v. Turner, </em>47 Va.App. 76, 80, 622 S.E.2d 263, 266 (2005) (alterations in original) (quoting <em>Hastie v. Hastie, </em>29 Va.App. 776, 781, 514 S.E.2d 800, 803 (1999)). The method for valuing the marital share of a defined contribution plan is certainly a critical term of an equitable distribution order. Here, the trial court\u2019s use of a coverture fraction in the QDRO altered the final decree\u2019s valuation of the Plan\u2019s marital share. Therefore, we vacate the specific provision of the QDRO assigning nine percent of the Plan\u2019s overall value to wife, and we remand the matter to the trial court for entry of a QDRO reflecting a proper valuation of the marital share of the Plan, as that marital share was defined in the trial court\u2019s final decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">\n<em>F. Deviation from Statutory Child Support Guidelines</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">We turn now to address wife\u2019s additional assignments of error. Wife\u2019s first assignment of error is that the trial court erred in allowing husband a \u201ccredit\u201d against his child support obligation for payment of educational expenses on behalf of the child. The trial court awarded child support according to the statutory guidelines, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 20-108.2, but also granted husband \u201ca credit for private school tuition and English lessons\u201d for which it found husband had already paid certain amounts. Wife contends it was error for the trial court to grant husband this credit, arguing that the trial court failed to make necessary written findings. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Although wife refers to this \u201ccredit\u201d as a credit for non-conforming payments, we note that this was not a credit for non-conforming payments made after a child support award had already been entered.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Rather, the \u201ccredit\u201d here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>functionally altered the amount of child support that had been calculated pursuant to the statutory guidelines. Thus, we determine the validity of this credit by analyzing whether it satisfied the statutory requirements for a deviation from the guideline amount. Code \u00a7 20-108.1(B) requires a trial court that deviates from the guidelines to \u201cmake written findings ... that the application of [the] guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case.\u201d <em>See Mayers v. Mayers, </em>15 Va.App. 587, 592, 425 S.E.2d 808, 811 (1993) (\u201cWe have repeatedly held that whenever a child support award varies from the amount of support set forth in the guidelines, the trial court must make written findings of fact explaining why application of the guidelines would be \u2018unjust or inappropriate.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Here, the trial court failed to make the written findings required by Code \u00a7 20-108.1(B).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Moreover, the final decree recites that the amount of child support \u201cis based on calculations pursuant to the statutory guidelines\u201d and that \u201c[husband\u2019s] request for a deviation from the statutory guidelines is denied.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The trial court was asked to deviate from the guidelines, and it expressly refused to do so. Yet, in awarding husband what it termed a \u201ccredit\u201d for the tuition payments husband had previously made, the trial court effectively reduced the amount of child support as calculated under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>guidelines. Thus, whatever the reduction was called, it amounted to a deviation from the guideline amount. Since the trial court failed to follow the statutory requirements for deviating from the guideline amount, we reverse its decision to reduce the child support award by the \u201ccredit\u201d it granted to husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">\n<em>G. Exclusion of Day-Care Expenses from Child Support Calculation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Wife\u2019s second assignment of error is that the trial court erred in failing to add work-related day-care expenses to the child support calculation. We find no error in the trial court\u2019s ruling on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Code \u00a7 20-108.2(F) provides: \u201cAny child-care costs incurred on behalf of the child or children due to employment of the custodial parent <em>shall be added </em>to the basic child support obligation.\u201d This language is mandatory. However, the trial court here held that the mere testimony of wife as to what her day-care expenses were for the child, without any further evidence, was insufficient proof of the appropriate amount of day-care expenses to be added to the basic child support obligation. The trial court noted the lack of evidence showing that the amount to which \"wife testified was reasonable in comparison to alternative day-care centers. Moreover, the trial court observed that the evidence did not show whether the child was in public school, which provided a free day-care option. The trial court also noted that wife\u2019s testimony indicated she was paying a nanny a higher hourly rate than wife herself was earning. In light of this evidentiary dilemma, the trial court was certainly free to conclude that wife had not carried her burden of production in demonstrating the appropriate amount of day-care expenses that should have been added to the basic support obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">Simply because a statute requires inclusion of certain expenses in a child support award, it does not follow that the party seeking the inclusion of those expenses does not have the burden to produce sufficient credible evidence showing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>appropriate amount of those expenses. <em>Cf. Bowers v. Bowers, 4 </em>Va.App. 610, 617, 359 S.E.2d 546, 550 (1987) (observing that even under a mandatory statute, a litigant still carries \u201cthe burden to present evidence sufficient for the court to discharge its duty\u201d). Thus, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s exclusion of day-care expenses from its child support calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">\n<em>H. Condition Imposed on Wife\u2019s Receipt of Her Equitable Distribution Award</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Wife\u2019s final assignment of error is that the trial court erred in ordering that her equitable distribution award be held in escrow until she complied with the Hungarian court\u2019s visitation order. We agree that this was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">\u201cJurisdiction in divorce suits is purely statutory, and it cannot be acquired by the courts inferentially or through indirection. When the General Assembly confers jurisdiction on divorce courts, it accomplishes the purpose using clear, detailed language.\u201d <em>Stroop v. Stroop, </em>10 Va.App. 611, 616, 394 S.E.2d 861, 864 (1990) (citing <em>Johnson v. Johnson, 224 </em>Va. 641, 645, 299 S.E.2d 351, 353-54 (1983)). Thus, \u201c[a] divorce court\u2019s judgment must not exceed the power given it, nor may it claim inherent power to employ a mode or procedure which is not clearly provided by law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Husband contends that Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E) provides the requisite statutory authority for the trial court\u2019s order imposing a condition on wife\u2019s receipt of her equitable distribution award. Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E) gives the trial court authority to determine \u201c[t]he amount of any division or transfer of jointly owned marital property, and the amount of any monetary award, the apportionment of marital debts, and the method of payment.\u201d Husband argues that the trial court\u2019s order was justified under its authority to determine the \u201cmethod of payment\u201d of wife\u2019s equitable distribution award. However, we note that although the language of Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E) permits a trial court to determine the <em>method </em>of payment of an equitable distribution award, it does not permit a trial court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>set <em>conditions </em>of payment that are unrelated to the award itself. Without express statutory authorization to condition payment of an equitable distribution award upon compliance with child custody and visitation orders, a trial court is without authority to impose such a condition. <em>Cf. Stroop, </em>10 Va.App. at 616, 394 S.E.2d at 863-64 (holding that although Code \u00a7 20-107.3(C) authorizes the transfer of ownership of jointly owned marital property, it \u201cdoes not empower the trial court to require the transferor to await payments at some future date\u201d). Because Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E) does not grant a trial court the authority to impose unrelated conditions on one party\u2019s right to receive her equitable distribution award, we reverse the trial court\u2019s imposition of such a condition in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b192-10\">. Husband also assigns error to the trial court\u2019s finding that the Hungarian court had jurisdiction to enter a decree of divorce and to the trial court\u2019s decision to defer to that court\u2019s jurisdiction. However, since husband has not provided us with any argument or legal support in his brief for why the trial court erred in deferring to the Hungarian court\u2019s jurisdiction over divorce, we will not consider this particular issue. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:20(e) (requiring the argument for each assignment of error in an appellant\u2019s opening brief to include \"principles of law and authorities\u201d); <em>see also Fadness v.

The UCCJEA defines \"child custody determination\u201d as \"a judgment, decree, or other order of a court providing for the legal custody, physical custody, or visitation with respect to a child. The term includes a permanent, temporary, initial, or modification order.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-146.1.

We note that this is essentially the same test one would formulate by reading Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-146.4(A) and 20-146.24(A) together. Code \u00a7 20-146.4(A) requires us to treat a foreign court as if it were a domestic court of another state for purposes of determining jurisdiction under the UCCJEA, and Code \u00a7 20-146.24(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-8\">A court of this Commonwealth shall recognize and enforce a child custody determination of a court of another state if the latter court exercised jurisdiction in substantial conformity with this act or the determination was made under factual circumstances meeting the jurisdictional standards of this act and the determination has not been modified in accordance with this act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">Thus, these two sections, when read together, would require a Virginia court to recognize and enforce a foreign court\u2019s child custody determination if the foreign court would have had jurisdiction under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>standards of the UCCJEA or under a jurisdictional standard \"in substantial conformity\u201d therewith. This test is essentially what Code \u00a7 20-146.4(B) explicitly prescribes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b197-7\">. Counsel for wife contended at oral argument that Hungary had always been the child\u2019s home state because the time the child lived in Virginia constituted a \u201ctemporaiy absence\u201d from Hungary under the UCCJEA\u2019s definition of \"home state.\u201d <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-146.1. She premised this argument on wife\u2019s testimony that the family always intended to return to Hungary to live. We find this argument to be without merit. Even if the trial court believed wife\u2019s testimony that the parties intended to return to Hungary after a two-year period in Virginia, the fact remains that the parties purchased a home and actually <em>lived </em>in Virginia for over two-and-a-half years. The UCCJEA defines \"home state\u201d as \"the state in which a child <em>lived.\u201d </em>Code \u00a7 20-146.1. The intent to live somewhere else in the future does not negate the fact that the parties here <em>lived </em>with the child in Virginia long enough to make Virginia the child\u2019s home state under the UCCJEA. <em>See Powell v. Stover, </em>165 S.W.3d 322, 326, 328 (Tex.2005) (declining \"to apply a test to determine where a child \u2018lived\u2019 based on the parties' subjective intent,\u201d and instead holding \"that in determining where a child lived for purposes of establishing home-state jurisdiction, the trial court must consider the child\u2019s physical presence in a state\u201d). The parties\u2019 voluntary two-and-a-half-year residence in Virginia is simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>not a \"temporary absence\u201d within the meaning contemplated by Code \u00a7 20-146.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b199-7\">.

Because we conclude that Hungary did not have jurisdiction to make an initial child custody determination under the jurisdictional standards of the UCCJEA, wife\u2019s appeal to Code \u00a7 20-146.17(A) is unavailing. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-11\">[A] court of this Commonwealth may not exercise its jurisdiction under this article if, at the time of the commencement of the proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>ing, a proceeding concerning the custody of the child has been previously commenced in a court of another state having jurisdiction substantially in conformity with this act, unless the proceeding has been terminated or is stayed by the court of the other state because a court of this Commonwealth is a more convenient forum under \u00a7 20-146.18.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">Code \u00a7 20-146.17(A). For the reasons we have already explained, the Hungarian court did not have jurisdiction substantially in conformity with the jurisdictional standards of the UCCJEA. Furthermore, the proceedings instituted by husband pursuant to the Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (\u201cHague Convention\u201d) did not constitute \u201ca proceeding concerning the custody of [a] child\u201d under Code \u00a7 20-146.17(A). <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-146.22 (distinguishing between \"an order for return of a child under the Hague Convention\u201d and \"a child custody determination\u201d); Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, art. 19, <em>done </em>Oct. 25, 1980, 1343 U.N.T.S. 89 (providing that \"[a] decision under this Convention concerning the return of the child shall not be taken to be a determination on the merits of any custody issue\u201d).

We note that Code \u00a7 20-146.18(B) simply requires a trial court to consider various factors, and does not require it \" \u2018to quantify or elaborate exactly what weight or consideration it has given to each of the statutory factors.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gottlieb v.

We note that wife has not challenged the trial court's jurisdiction over child custody on the grounds of Code \u00a7 20-107.2. Therefore, we do not address this issue. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:21(d) (requiring that an appellee\u2019s brief contain \"the argument (including principles of law and authorities) relating to each assignment of error\u201d). Rather, our narrow holding here is simply that a trial court having jurisdiction to determine child custody in a proceeding that began as a divorce proceeding also has jurisdiction to make a child support award.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b205-8\">. We also note that the order expressly contemplated a later possible award of retroactive child support: \u201cIn the future, if spousal support and/or child support is awarded in this [c]ourt, it can be made retroactive.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b205-9\">. Although husband stated in his assignment of error that \u201cno evidence was presented upon which to determine any liability for child support prior to the evidentiary hearing,\u201d husband did not explain or develop this argument in his brief.

In fact, wife did not object at all to the trial court's jurisdiction to award equitable distribution.

We express no opinion on whether the prerequisites of Code \u00a7 20-107.3 were actually met. Although the parties dispute on appeal whether all the elements of Code \u00a7 20-107.3(J) were satisfied in this case, we simply note that wife failed to make any objection challenging the trial court's jurisdiction over equitable distribution based on Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A) or (J).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b210-8\">. Husband contends that wife's use of her separate funds is irrelevant to the issue of husband's intent in using his separate funds to purchase and pay off the mortgage on the marital residence. However, the trial court could have believed there was some sort of agreement between husband and wife as to how each of their separate funds was going to be used, so that they could ultimately achieve a common goal\u2014the acquisition of their chosen home, mortgage-free. Such an agreement would certainly be relevant to the issue of whether husband intended to gift his separate interest in the marital residence to the marital estate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b211-7\">. Husband did not argue to the trial court that wife's telephonic deposition was inadmissible as a substitute for her live testimony under Rule 4:7(a). Therefore, we do not address this issue on appeal. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18 (requiring generally that an objection be \"stated with reasonable certainty at the time of the ruling\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b212-6\">. As a relevant matter, we note that wife has not violated any order of the trial court. <em>See Morrison v.

Neither party has assigned any error on appeal to the language of the final decree itself. Therefore, the issue before us is simply whether the QDRO properly effectuated the language of the final decree defining the Plan's marital share. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-107.3(K) (giving the trial court \"the continuing authority and jurisdiction to make any additional orders necessaiy to <em>effectuate and enforce </em>any order entered pursuant to [\u00a7 20-107.3]\u201d (emphasis added)); Code \u00a7 20-107.3(K)(4) (permitting modification of a final decree\u2019s division of a pension plan \"only for the purpose of establishing or maintaining the order as a qualified domestic relations order or to revise or conform its terms so as to <em>effectuate the expressed intent </em>of the order\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b213-11\">. The trial court entered two different QDROs, one for each of husband's two retirement accounts with GE. Husband has assigned error only to the QDRO relating to his GE Savings and Security Plan.

We observe that there can be no non-conforming payments unless there is a child support award already in place. <em>See Jones v.
