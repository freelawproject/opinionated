A divided panel of this Court agreed with Barson and reversed his conviction. <em>See Barson v. Commonwealth, </em>No. 2464-09-1, 2010 WL 4284631 (Va.Ct.App. Nov. 2, 2010). We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for rehearing <em>en banc </em>and stayed the mandate of the panel decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Upon rehearing <em>en banc, </em>we affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">Barson and his wife \u201cA.B.\u201d had been married for eight years at the end of April 2009. At that time, Barson lived in Austin, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Texas, while completing his medical subspecialty training in neurology, and A.B. lived in Virginia Beach with their children. On May 1, 2009, Barson received a phone call from a friend that alerted him to a \u201cCraigslist\u201d advertisement for sex. Barson visited the site and reviewed the posted advertisements. Upon seeing the advertisements, Barson became very angry and embarrassed and tried to call his wife. When his calls went unanswered, Barson began to send e-mail messages to A.B., her friends, and family members. Whenever a friend or family member responded to an e-mail, Barson forwarded the response to A.B. A.B. testified that she received eighty-seven e-mails between May 1, 2009 and May 14, 2009, and she received hundreds more over the span of the next six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">The subject lines of the e-mails included phrases such as, \u201c[A.B.] has sex with anonymous strangers on Craigs [sic] List Ads while husband lives in hotel working 3 jobs,\u201d \u201cI wanted [D] and your cousins to know about your new hobby of soliciting sex on CL,\u201d and \u201cCoke Whore Baby Killer Mom\u2019s Club Needs to Know.\u201d In the e-mails themselves, appellant wrote such things as \u201c[You have] BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER look it up when you get off your knees from CL,\u201d and \u201cI work my ass off and you suck off and fuck strangers on Craigs [sic] List,\u201d and \u201cI told [M] ... how you sucked off [D\u2019s] roommate 3 days in AZ ... wanted to jump [D\u2019s] bones after 10 years killing your baby because it was a bother to you both and then picked [C] the coke dealer up at Rio fucked his brains out and vacuumed his baby to death for an eight ball.\u201d The messages contained phrases such as, \u201cmy dad said you had a job ... or blowjob? Which one do you get paid for and which is free? Not like you didn\u2019t suck off [J.L.] or looney [R] for an eightball!!!! If you didn\u2019t have crooked teeth and huge thighs you might be able to make money spreading your legs and sucking off Joe Pintos (strangers) [sic].\u201d Appellant also sent a couple of messages from his cell phone along those same lines, alleging \u201cSTD[\u2019s] from risky gutter sex,\u201d and stating its \u201ctime to put your big girl pants on and get a job not take them off and give a blowjob.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>On May 14, 2009, A.B. filed a criminal complaint for computer harassment in the General District Court for the City of Virginia Beach. On July 30, 2009, that court found Barson guilty as charged. Barson then appealed the matter to the trial court, which conducted a bench trial <em>de novo </em>on October 8, 2009. At trial, Barson testified that he sent the e-mails because he was angry, hurt, and embarrassed. He was also trying to \u201cget a response\u201d from A.B. Barson additionally testified he assumed that by forwarding the e-mails to her friends and family members, A.B. would be embarrassed.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Upon the conclusion of the evidence, the trial court found Barson guilty and imposed a fine of $250. When Barson asked the court to reconsider, the court responded, \u201cNo. He did it over and over and over again. It\u2019s disgusting. See the clerk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">II. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Barson argues on appeal that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient as a matter of law to support his conviction for computer harassment. Barson concedes the language used in the e-mails he sent to his wife was \u201coffensive and course,\u201d but, relying on our holding in <em>Allman v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 104, 596 S.E.2d 531 (2004), maintains the language contained in his e-mails does not meet the definition of \u201cobscene\u201d for purposes of his conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-152.7:1. Barson also argues that in the event we reject his argument, due process principles prevent affirmance of his conviction in light of his reliance on our holding in <em>Allman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">When the sufficiency of the evidence is challenged on appeal, we view the evidence and all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom in the light most favorable to the party prevailing below to determine whether the evidence presented at trial supports each and every element of the offense charged. <em>Haskins v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 145, 149-50, 521 S.E.2d 777, 779 (1999). \u201c[W]hen we consider the sufficiency of the evidence we do not consider each piece of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>evidence in isolation. Instead, we review the totality of the evidence to determine whether it was sufficient to prove an offense.\u201d <em>Bowling v. Commonwealth, </em>51 Va.App. 102, 107, 654 S.E.2d 354, 356 (2007). \u201cThe judgment of the trial court is presumed to be correct and will be reversed only upon a showing that it is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Goble v. Commonwealth, </em>57 Va.App. 137, 153, 698 S.E.2d 931, 939 (2010) (citation omitted). Thus, our review is limited to the narrow issue of whether \u201c\u2018any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)). That is,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\">[i]n practical terms, a reviewing court does not ask itself whether <em>it </em>believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt---- We ask only whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt____ This familiar standard gives full play to the responsibility of the trier of fact fairly to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts.... Thus, we do not substitute our judgment for that of the trier of fact even if our opinion were to differ.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-10\"><em>Atkins v. Commonwealth, </em>57 Va.App. 2, 21, 698 S.E.2d 249, 258 (2010) (emphasis in original) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-11\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b502-12\">Barson focuses his argument on the single question of whether the evidence was sufficient to permit a reasonable fact finder to conclude that the content of Barson\u2019s e-mails contained \u201cobscene, vulgar, profane, lewd, lascivious, or indecent language,\u201d or that he made \u201cany suggestion or proposal of an obscene nature, or threaten[ed] any illegal or immoral act.\u201d Barson specifically argues that since the content of the e-mails in question does not meet the definition of \u201cobscene,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>the evidence is insufficient as a matter of law to support his conviction for violating Code \u00a7 18.2-152.7:1.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Although this issue has not previously been addressed by this Court with respect to this particular statute, there are several other statutes in the Code containing similar language prohibiting conduct or communications of a similar nature. Accordingly, any analysis of this issue must historically begin with Code \u00a7 18.1-238, the predecessor to current Code \u00a7 18.2-427. Code \u00a7 18.1-238 provided, \u201cif any person shall curse or abuse anyone, or use vulgar, profane, threatening or indecent language over any telephone in this state, he shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d In <em>Walker v. Dillard, </em>523 F.2d 3, 5 (4th Cir.1975), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (\u201cFourth Circuit\u201d) held that Code \u00a7 18.1-238, which \u201cregulate[d] only speech\u201d was unconstitutionally over-broad. Starting \u201cfrom the proposition that the state has a legitimate interest in prohibiting obscene, threatening, and harassing phone calls, none of which are generally thought of as protected by the First Amendment,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 4, the Fourth Circuit found \u201cnevertheless, [that] while such activity may permissibly be punished, the proscription must not be one that unduly impinges on protected expression.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The Fourth Circuit found that while the language Mrs. Walker used over the telephone in that case might be \u201cconstitutionally prohibited under a <em>narrowly and precisely drawn </em>statute,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 4 (emphasis added), the words \u201cvulgar,\u201d \u201cprofane,\u201d and \u201cindecent\u201d in the statute, standing alone, were unconstitutionally overbroad. The court specifically observed that such words are protected speech because they amount to \u201cneither <em>obscenity </em>nor fighting words.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5 (emphasis added). The court then noted that words like \u201cvulgar,\u201d \u201cprofane,\u201d and \u201cindecent\u201d are only ever permissibly prohibited as \u201cobscene\u201d when they have been used in conjunction with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>other, more specific adjectives like \u201cobscene,\u201d \u201clewd,\u201d and \u201clascivious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">In 1976, in response to <em>Walker, </em>the General Assembly amended Code \u00a7 18.1-238 and re-codified it as Code \u00a7 18.2-427. That code section now provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-5\">Any person who uses obscene, vulgar, profane, lewd, lascivious, or indecent language, or makes any suggestion or proposal of an obscene nature, or threatens any illegal or immoral act with the intent to coerce, intimidate, or harass any person, over any telephone or citizens band radio, in this Commonwealth, is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEA\"><em>See </em>1976 Va. Acts ch. 312. <em>See also </em>1984 Va. Acts ch. 592 (amending the statute to include use of such language over citizens band radio); 2010 Va. Acts ch. 565 (amending the verb tenses within the statute). This Court had its first opportunity to consider the constitutionality of the new statute in <em>Perkins v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 7, 402 S.E.2d 229 (1991). In that case, Clinton Perkins challenged, among other things, his conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-427. Relying on <em>Walker, </em>Perkins argued that Code \u00a7 18.2-427, even as currently written, is unconstitutionally overbroad and vague. This Court disagreed, explaining</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atq\">An ordinance is overbroad if it deters constitutionally protected conduct. A challenge of overbreadth is based on the ground that legislation, even if lacking neither clarity nor precision, ... offends the constitutional principle that a governmental purpose to control or prevent activities constitutionally subject to state regulation may not be achieved by means which sweep unnecessarily broadly and thereby invade the area of protected freedoms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 12, 402 S.E.2d at 232 (quotations omitted). This Court further explained, \u201cin view of the legislature\u2019s amendments to the statute following the decision in <em>Walker ... </em>the legislature intended to address <em>harassing conduct </em>as the evil to be proscribed and intended to narrow the scope of the speech phrases to that which is <em>obscene.\u201d Id. </em>at 14, 402 S.E.2d at 233 (emphasis added). In affirming Perkins\u2019s conviction for violat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>ing Code \u00a7 18.2-427, this Court concluded, \u201cthis construction is not strained and removes protected speech from within the statute\u2019s sweep.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Subsequently, in <em>Allman v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 104, 596 S.E.2d 531 (2004), Brian Allman challenged the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction for violating Code \u00a7 18.2-427.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The evidence in that case proved that Allman left a six-minute message on an attorney\u2019s voice mail, referring to him as \u201ca pussy\u201d or \u201cpuss\u201d 20 times, indicating his belief that the attorney was \u201csquatting to pee\u201d in \u201cthe ladies room\u201d of his law firm, and alleging that the attorney needed to \u201c(grow) a set of balls.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 106-07, 596 S.E.2d at 532. Allman argued on appeal that the evidence was insufficient to prove his language was obscene or that he acted with the requisite intent. Because neither Code \u00a7 18.2-427, nor the chapter or article of the Code in which it appeared, contained a definition for the word \u201cobscene,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 109, 596 S.E.2d at 534, this Court applied to Code \u00a7 18.2-427 the definition of \u201cobscene\u201d contained in Code \u00a7 18.2-372, which specifically provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">The word \u201cobscene\u201d where it appears <em>in this article </em>shall mean that which, considered as a whole, has as its dominant theme or purpose an appeal to the prurient interest in sex, that is, a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement, excretory functions or products thereof or sadomasochistic abuse, and which goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters and which, taken as a whole, does not have serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Code \u00a7 18.2-372 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">This statutory definition of <em>obscenity, </em>in actuality, mirrors the three-part <em>pornography </em>test promulgated in <em>Miller v. California, </em>413 U.S. 15, 24, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 2614-15, 37 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>419 (1973), which enunciated the standard by which a statute prohibiting the distribution of pornographic materials might pass constitutional muster for purposes of the First Amendment. <em>See Allman, </em>43 Va.App. at 110 n. 3, 596 S.E.2d at 534 n. 3. While the terms \u201cobseene/obscenity\u201d and \u201cpornographic/pornography\u201d are occasionally used interchangeably, they are not actually interchangeable. In fact, as the United States Supreme Court expressly noted, the <em>Miller </em>test applies, not to obscenity or obscene materials, but \u201cmore accurately\u201d to \u201cpornography\u201d or \u201cpornographic material.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>413 U.S. at 18 n. 2, 93 S.Ct. at 2612 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Applying the <em>Miller </em>\u201cpornography\u201d standard to the language used by Allman in his voice mail, this Court concluded that Allman\u2019s \u201crepeated references to [the attorney] as a pussy, even taken in context, were, as a matter of law, insufficient to permit a reasonable trier of fact to conclude the references were obscene\u201d under the definition set forth in Code \u00a7 18.2-372, <em>Allman, </em>43 Va.App. at 111-12, 596 S.E.2d at 535, because the evidence \u201c[did] not establish that the message, <em>\u2018considered as a whole,\u2019 </em>either (1) <em>\u2018[had] as its dominant theme </em>... an appeal to the prurient interest in sex, that is, a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sexual content, ... excretory functions or products thereof or (2) <em>went \u2018substantially beyond the customary limits of candor </em>in description or representation of such matters,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 113, 596 S.E.2d at 535 (emphasis in original) (quoting Code \u00a7 18.2-372). Rather, this Court found that Allman\u2019s references to the attorney\u2019s purported \u201cexcretory functions or products thereof, though utterly tasteless and rude, merely served to emphasize [Allman\u2019s] belief in [the attorney\u2019s] cowardice,\u201d and his use of the word \u201cpussy\u201d was merely used to characterize the attorney as \u201ca weak, cowardly or ... effeminate man.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 112, 596 S.E.2d at 535. Because Allman\u2019s language did not meet the definition of obscenity contained in Code \u00a7 18.2-372, this Court found Allman did not violate Code \u00a7 18.2-427 and reversed his conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 113, 596 S.E.2d at 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Barson argues that, as in <em>Allman, </em>the language Barson used in his e-mails to A.B. does not meet the definition of obscenity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>set forth in Code \u00a7 18.2-372, because considered as a whole, it does not have \u201cas its dominant theme or purpose an appeal to the prurient interest in sex\u201d that \u201cgoes substantially beyond the customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters.\u201d Barson reasons that because his language was merely \u201coffensive and coarse\u201d rather than \u201cerotic,\u201d no reasonable fact finder could conclude it was obscene. Applying <em>Allman, </em>the panel majority agreed. However, we note that while \u201c[pornographic material which is obscene [or erotic] forms a <em>sub-group </em>of all \u2018obscene\u2019 expression,\u201d it does riot form \u201cthe whole, at least as the word \u2018obscene\u2019 is now used in our language.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>413 U.S. at 18 n. 2, 93 S.Ct. at 2612 n. 2 (emphasis added). In fact, Code \u00a7 18.2-372 by its own terms limits the definition of the word \u201cobscene\u201d to Title 18.2, Chapter 8, Article 5, which addresses \u201ccrimes involving morals and decency\u201d and \u201cobscenity and related offenses.\u201d On its face, Code \u00a7 18.2-372 does not address crimes proscribing harassing conduct or speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Thus, notwithstanding the sweeping comment contained in <em>Perkins, Allman\u2019s </em>application of the definition for the word \u201cobscene\u201d contained in Code \u00a7 18.2-372 to other sections of the Code outside of that Article, such as Code \u00a7 18.2-427, resulted in a statute too \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d for its purpose. Indeed, since <em>Allman, </em>only communications which are essentially \u201cpornographic\u201d could ever be considered obscene for purposes of any statute prohibiting harassing conduct. Such a result clearly contravenes the stated intent of the legislature, found in the specific language of these statutes. In this case, Barson was convicted under Code \u00a7 18.2-152.7:1, which, unlike Code \u00a7 18.2-372, does not reference a statutory definition for the word \u201cobscene.\u201d Setting <em>Allman </em>briefly aside, we note that in cases where no statutory definition applies, courts <em>normally </em>assign a term its \u201c \u2018ordinary and usually accepted meaning....\u2019\u201d <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 337, 341, 649 S.E.2d 717, 719 (2007) (quoting <em>Woolfolk v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 840, 847, 447 S.E.2d 530, 534 (1994)).

As noted by the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Miller, </em>\u201c[d]erived from the Latin obscaenus, ob, to, plus caenum, filth, \u2018obscene\u2019 is defined in the Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary [1557 (3rd ed.1993) ] as T: disgusting to the senses ... 2: offensive or revolting as countering or violating some ideal or principle.\u2019 \u201d 413 U.S. at 18 n. 2, 93 S.Ct. at 2612 n. 2. This definition more accurately encompasses the type of communicative conduct proscribed by the statute, namely, that which is obscene, vulgar, profane, lewd, lascivious, or indecent. Thus, while Barson\u2019s language may or may not be \u201cpornographic,\u201d utilizing the definition of the word \u201cobscene\u201d as commonly understood, a reasonable fact finder could certainly conclude that the language Barson used in his e-mails to A.B. is \u201cobscene.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">We, thus, hold that the application of the ordinary meaning of the word \u201cobscene\u201d to the conduct prohibited by Code \u00a7 18.2-152.7:1 is more consistent with the stated intent of the legislature than the <em>ad hoc </em>definition crafted in <em>Allman. </em>To the extent <em>Allman </em>requires that a different meaning of the word \u201cobscene\u201d be applied to the conduct prohibited in this case, we expressly overrule it.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Applying the appropriate standard of review and assigning the plain and ordinary meaning to the nature of the conduct prohibited by this statute, namely using a computer network to communicate obscene speech or threatening language with the specific intent to harass, we conclude the trial court did not err in finding the evidence sufficient to convict Barson of the offense for which he was charged. The messages Barson sent are replete with explicitly obscene accusations. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>sheer number of messages sent, coupled with their content, adequately supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction for computer harassment. We, thus, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">\n<em>Due Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Barson also contends that if we overrule <em>Allman, </em>due process principles require that we apply any new rule prospectively, rather than retroactively. Relying on <em>Bouie v. City of Columbia, </em>378 U.S. 347, 84 S.Ct. 1697, 12 L.Ed.2d 894 (1964), Barson suggests this Court\u2019s adoption of a new definition for \u201cobscenity\u201d for purposes of Code \u00a7 18.2-152.7:1 would result in \u201can unforeseeable judicial enlargement of a criminal statute, applied retroactively, [which] operates precisely like an <em>ex post facto </em>law,\u201d in violation of his due process rights. <em>Id. </em>at 353, 84 S.Ct. at 1702. Barson contends that even if this Court, in <em>Allman, </em>erred in applying the definition of obscenity contained in Code \u00a7 18.2-372 to criminal harassment statutes, at the time of his trial that was the state of the law, and any change in the law, therefore, should not be applied in his case. We hold that the Virginia Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Armstrong v. Commonwealth, </em>263 Va. 573, 581, 562 S.E.2d 139, 143 (2002), controls our disposition of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">In <em>Armstrong, </em>the Virginia Supreme Court explained, <em>\u201cBouie </em>applies to changes in the interpretation of a criminal statute that are \u2018indefensible by reference to the law that had been expressed <em>prior to the conduct in issue.\u2019 </em>\u201d <em>Armstrong </em>at 581, 562 S.E.2d at 143 (quoting <em>Bouie, </em>at 354, 84 S.Ct. at 1703) (emphasis in original). The principle expressed in <em>Bouie </em>applies when a court of last resort has altered the law in a manner that would operate to punish an individual for conduct not criminal at the time the conduct was engaged in. The criminalization of the conduct which resulted in Barson\u2019s conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-152.7:1 predates this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Allman, </em>which dealt with a different criminal statute and, in any event, remained \u201csubject to review by [this Court] sitting <em>en banc </em>and [by] the [the Virginia Supreme Court] on appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Accordingly, our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>decision today does not impinge on Barson\u2019s due process rights. <em>See id. </em>at 581, 562 S.E.2d at 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">III. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the trial court did not err in finding the evidence sufficient to convict Barson of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-152.7:1, and we further hold that principles of due process do not require that we relieve Barson from accountability under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b499-11\">. Code \u00a7 18.2-152.7:1 is contained in Title 18.2, Chapter 5 (\"crimes against property\u201d), Article 7.1 (\"computer crimes\u201d) and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-12\">If any person, with the intent to coerce, intimidate, or harass any person, shall use a computer or computer network to communicate obscene, vulgar, profane, lewd, lascivious, or indecent language, or make any suggestion or proposal of an obscene nature, or threaten any illegal or immoral act, he shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemean- or.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b499-13\">. Neither party requested rehearing with respect to the panel\u2019s holding that venue for the conviction rested properly in the Virginia Beach Circuit Court. That issue is, therefore, not before this Court <em>en banc.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b503-7\">. Barson concedes that the sheer number and tenor of the e-mails was sufficient to establish the requisite intent to coerce, intimidate, or harass his wife. Indeed, proof of this element of the offense is necessary to elevate the mere boorish use of obscene or vulgar language to a criminal offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b505-9\">. We note that, as here, the constitutionality of the statute was not at issue in <em>Allman. </em>The sole issue was the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b509-7\">. While Barson\u2019s intent to harass A.B. is not at issue in this case, we note that the Commonwealth is required, in cases implicating harassment statutes of the type we have here, to prove the defendant communicated the prohibited language with the <em>specific \u201cintent to coerce, intimidate, or harass any person.\u201d </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-152.7:1. Thus, since the Commonwealth must prove the presence of both harassing conduct <em>and </em>obscene speech in obtaining a conviction under the code sections implicated by this opinion, we note the actual reach of the statute is limited to the more narrow subset of harassing conduct which utilizes obscene speech. <em>Perkins, </em>12 Va.App. at 14, 402 S.E.2d at 233.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b511-7\">ELDER, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"APG\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">Without doubt, as the majority concludes, the record supports the trial court\u2019s finding that appellant acted with the requisite intent to harass his wife. In addition to proving this intent, however, the Commonwealth also was required to establish that appellant\u2019s language was \u201cobscene\u201d as that term is used in Code \u00a7 18.2-152.7:1. Contrary to the view of the majority, I would retain the definition of \u201cobscene\u201d set out in <em>Allman v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 104, 109-11, 596 S.E.2d 531, 534-35 (2004) (interpreting Code \u00a7 18.2-427), as the appropriate definition for use under Code \u00a7 18.2-152.7:1, as well. For the reasons set out in the panel majority opinion, I would conclude appellant\u2019s language here, like the language at issue in <em>Allman, </em>was \u201cutterly tasteless and rude\u201d but did not rise to the level of being \u201cobscene.\u201d <em>Allman, </em>43 Va.App. at 112, 596 S.E.2d at 535. Thus, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
