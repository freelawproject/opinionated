Specifically, appellant argues 1) his MySpace posts are not the type of communication contemplated or prohibited by the statute, and 2) the posted lyrics do not constitute a threat. Because the evidence supports a finding that appellant posted a threat on his MySpace profile that placed the recipient in reasonable apprehension of death or bodily injury, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b388-14\">Appellant and the victim, Miranda Rollman, were previously involved in a romantic relationship that produced a daughter. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>After the relationship dissolved, a custody battle ensued over their child. During this time and prior to appellant\u2019s arrest for the current offense, he began posting incendiary messages on his MySpace profile,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> resulting in his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">At trial, the court admitted into evidence several printouts from appellant\u2019s MySpace profile. One of the blog entries\u2014 titled \u201cUnfinished Bizness God, I Give You the \u2018woodroll\u2019 family. Tell them to \u2018F the F OFF\u2019 and \u2018GET OFF ME,\u2019 read:</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Poof!

After reading them, she \u201cwas scared that [she] was going to be killed, maimed; [her] daughter was going to be kidnapped by [appellant]\u201d due to \u201cthe extent of the details of exactly what [appellant] wanted to do to [her].\u201d Rollman explained she believed these threats were directed toward her and her family because the blog entry addressed \u201cthe \u2018woodroll\u2019 family,\u201d and \u201cWoodroll is my maiden name.\u201d Rollman further testified that one of the posts referenced an incident involving two police officers being called to her house, and the other post referred to a time when her mother passed out flyers with appellant\u2019s picture at Roll-man\u2019s place of employment. Rollman acknowledged she and appellant were going through a custody battle and restraining orders had been issued. Taking these posts seriously, Roll-man moved into her parents\u2019 home because \u201cthey have a security system and cameras.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">On cross-examination, Rollman admitted that appellant\u2019s MySpace profile contained \u201c[p]lenty of different things\u201d in addition to the posts. Rollman confirmed that appellant described himself as a \u201cjuggalo,\u201d which is part of \u201ca big family\u201d that \u201cplay[s] the same kind of music, listen[s] to the same kind of music.\u201d Appellant \u201cconsiders himself to be something of a lyricist of [rap] music,\u201d though \u201che didn\u2019t write demented things\u201d during the course of his relationship with Rollman. Rollman speculated that appellant considered the posts \u201cone long song,\u201d and it was \u201call on the front page for the world to see.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Appellant testified in his own defense. He characterized the compilations of words he composed and posted as \u201cart,\u201d \u201cmeant to be songs\u201d and \u201cjust clever limericks.\u201d Appellant testified he had \u201cbeen writing songs since [he] was eleven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>years old, and they\u2019re on [his] MySpace profile because it\u2019s there to express who you are.\u201d He acknowledged he knew Rollman had a MySpace profile but maintained he did not invite her or her family to view his profile. However, he agreed that he put the material on his profile \u201cfor the express purpose of it being seen by other people.\u201d Appellant knew he had posted material in April that caused Rollman to be in fear. He denied ever intending for Rollman to read his posts and feel threatened, but acknowledged the posts \u201cif [they] were reality ... that would be very horrifying; and to think that I think it just to write it is\u2014you know, could just be as horrifying.\u201d Appellant testified that he attempted to block Rollman\u2019s access to his profile sometime in September 2009 and later deleted his profile altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The trial court found that appellant\u2019s ongoing custody dispute involving his daughter created a \u201cconnection or [a] nexus\u201d between his posts and Rollman\u2019s \u201cindividual situation\u201d such that the posts constituted \u201cvery veiled threats.\u201d The trial court accordingly found appellant guilty of communicating a threat in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-60, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">Appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction for communicating a written threat in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-60(A)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When the sufficiency of the evidence is challenged on appeal, the court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party and draws all reasonable inferences in its favor. <em>See Dunbar </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number><em>v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 387, 393, 512 S.E.2d 823, 826 (1999). \u201c \u2018The judgment of the trial court sitting without a jury is entitled to the same weight as a jury verdict and will not be set aside unless it appears from the evidence that the judgment is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wilkins v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 293, 295, 443 S.E.2d 440, 442 (1994) (en banc) (quoting <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987)). We \u201cmust discard all evidence of the accused that conflicts with that of the Commonwealth and regard as true all credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences reasonably deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Lea v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 300, 303, 429 S.E.2d 477, 479 (1993). \u201cThe weight which should be given to evidence and whether the testimony of a witness is credible are questions which the fact finder must decide.\u201d <em>Bridgeman v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 523, 528, 351 S.E.2d 598, 601 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">COMMUNICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Appellant first argues the evidence fails to establish that he knowingly communicated the posts within the meaning of the statute. Appellant suggests that because his chosen medium was \u201cavailable for everyone to view\u201d on a public website and he did not specifically send the posts to Rollman or direct her to view his posts, he cannot be convicted. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">In 1998, the General Assembly amended Code \u00a7 18.2-60 to criminalize threats contained in \u201celectronically transmitted communicationfs] producing a visual or electronic message.\u201d 1998 Va. Acts ch. 687. Code \u00a7 18.2-60(A)(1) contains no requirement that the accused must communicate the written threat directly to the intended victim. Instead, \u201c[p]roof that [the accused] intended to make and communicate the [alleged] threat and that the [alleged] threat was made and communicated satisfies the statutory requirement.\u201d <em>Summerlin v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 288, 298, 557 S.E.2d 731, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>736 (2002). The statute is concerned with neither the mode of communication nor the number of recipients of the alleged threatening communication. <em>E.g., Keyes v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 294, 298, 572 S.E.2d 512, 514 (2002) (affirming the defendant\u2019s conviction under former Code \u00a7 18.2-60(A) even though his threatening letter had been intercepted in the mail before it reached its intended victim); <em>see also United States v. Morales, </em>272 F.3d 284, 288 (5th Cir.2001) (rejecting the defendant\u2019s argument that his online statements could not constitute a true threat under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875(c) because \u201cthey were made to a random third party who had no connection with\u201d the intended victim).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">In interpreting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875(c),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Second Circuit rejected a similar argument \u201cthat the broadcast of the threat to an indefinite and unknown audience is not a \u2018communication\u2019 of that threat.\u201d <em>United States v. Kelner, </em>534 F.2d 1020, 1023 (2d Cir.1976). The court reasoned that if this argument were taken to its logical conclusion, \u201cany would-be threatener could avoid the statute by seeking the widest possible means of disseminating his threat.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rather, the proper inquiry was whether the accused \u201cintended to communicate a threat of injury through means reasonably adapted to that purpose.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">As applied to this case, posting a message on a MySpace profile plainly falls into the category of an \u201celectronically transmitted communication\u201d because it produces a \u201cvisual or electronic message\u201d that can be viewed by anyone who has access to that person\u2019s MySpace profile. In fact, the Commonwealth was readily able to print out the posts from appellant\u2019s MySpace profile and enter them into evidence at his trial. Appellant further concedes that he knowingly posted the messages on his MySpace profile. If these messages constituted threats, then nothing more is required. <em>Cf. Wise v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 344, 355, 641 S.E.2d 134, 140 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>(2007) (noting that in the context of Code \u00a7 18.2-460(C), \u201c \u2018[t]he speaker need not actually intend to carry out the threat\u2019 to be proscribable\u201d (quoting <em>Virginia v. Black, </em>538 U.S. 343, 359-60, 123 S.Ct. 1536, 1548, 155 L.Ed.2d 535, 552 (2003))).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">It is of no consequence that appellant did not direct Rollman to view his MySpace profile. As explained in further detail below, it is sufficient appellant made numerous references to his history with Rollman that allowed her to identify herself as the subject of the violent fantasies once she did view the profile. Further, appellant knew Rollman had access to his MySpace profile and had in fact viewed it in the past. The fact that Rollman lacked a personal computer from which she could access MySpace does not lessen the threatening nature of appellant\u2019s posts because Rollman could, and did, just as easily access MySpace from her mother\u2019s computer. We thus conclude appellant\u2019s posts on his MySpace profile are electronic communications capable, depending on their content, of constituting threats in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">THREAT</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">Appellant next argues his posts do not constitute threats under Code \u00a7 18.2-60(A)(1). Appellant contends the context of the posts indicates that they are lyrics, notwithstanding the graphic and violent content of the messages. In support of this argument, appellant asserts that he previously used MySpace as a medium for posting other lyrics he had composed, and he has an established history of involvement with that particular style of music.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">\u201cA threat, in the criminal context, is recognized to be a communication avowing an intent to injure another\u2019s person or property.\u201d <em>Perkins v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 7, 16, 402 S.E.2d 229, 234 (1991). We \u201cmust consider a communication in its particular context when determining whether a speaker\u2019s words constitute a true threat.\u201d <em>Wise, </em>49 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>Va.App. at 355, 641 S.E.2d at 140. Thus, we \u201cview the totality of the circumstances under which the statement was made.\u201d <em>DiMaio v. Commonwealth, </em>46 Va.App. 755, 767, 621 S.E.2d 696, 702 (2005). \u201c \u2018Threats of physical harm need not be directly expressed, but may be contained in \u201cveiled statements\u201d nonetheless implying injury to the recipient when viewed in all the surrounding circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Keyes, </em>39 Va.App. at 302, 572 S.E.2d at 516 (quoting <em>State v. McGinnis, </em>243 N.W.2d 583, 589 (Iowa 1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Credible evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding that appellant\u2019s posts on his MySpace profile were threats because the graphic and violent imagery used in the messages specifically referred to Rollman and her family. In one blog entry, appellant referred to Rollman by using her maiden name, Woodroll. Appellant further referenced specific incidents involving Rollman and identified details that were unique to the acrimonious history between appellant and Rollman stemming from the ongoing custody dispute over their daughter. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>(noting the prior history between the victim and the defendant, who was incarcerated for attempting to rape the victim). Appellant referred to the restraining order Rollman had obtained that prevented contact between appellant and his daughter, about which appellant demonstrated significant hostility. Rollman testified that she recognized several of the incidents contained within the posts, including an incident in which two police officers responded to a domestic disturbance involving appellant and another incident in which Rollman\u2019s mother posted flyers bearing appellant\u2019s picture at Rollman\u2019s place of employment. This specificity demonstrates appellant\u2019s hostility towards Rollman, as he coupled each of these references with desires to violently retaliate against Rollman and her family. To the casual observer, the posts may have seemed somewhat innocuous, but the specificity of the posts relating to appellant\u2019s tumultuous history with Rollman and her family makes clear that appellant\u2019s posts were directed towards Rollman and not meant to be mere expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The graphic and violent imagery contained within the posts further indicates the threatening nature of the messages. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>Appellant made frequent proclamations that he \u201cjust had to stab [Rollman]\u201d and \u201cslit [her] neck into a fountain drink.\u201d Appellant explicitly fantasized about \u201c[n]ever lettin\u2019 go ya throat\u201d and \u201c[n]o one hearing your screams from the knife cut sounds,\u201d and concluded \u201cmurder makes me happy so don\u2019t believe I\u2019m nervous.\u201d Appellant clearly targeted Rollman as the victim in these violent fantasies, and even admitted that if taken literally, the posts \u201cwould be very horrifying.\u201d The trial court was not required to accept appellant\u2019s testimony that the posts were \u201cmeant to be songs\u201d or \u201cclever limericks.\u201d Although the evidence suggests appellant had composed and posted lyrics of a similar style in the past, Rollman testified that the subject matter of those lyrics was never as \u201cdemented\u201d prior to the deterioration of their relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Finally, we must consider Rollman\u2019s reaction to appellant\u2019s posts to determine whether they placed her in \u201creasonable apprehension of death or bodily injury.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Code \u00a7 18.2-60(A)(1); <em>see Summerlin, </em>37 Va.App. at 298, 557 S.E.2d at 736 (discussing the victim\u2019s evacuation of the building in response to the defendant\u2019s phone call insinuating that he would detonate a bomb within the organization). In response to reading the posts, Rollman moved into her parents\u2019 home to take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>advantage of their security system and cameras. Rollman further testified she \u201cwas scared that [she] was going to be killed [or] maimed\u201d and that \u201cher daughter was going to be kidnapped.\u201d \u201cThe credibility of the witnesses and the weight accorded the evidence are matters solely for the fact finder who has the opportunity to see and hear that evidence as it is presented.\u201d <em>Sandoval v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 133, 138, 455 S.E.2d 730, 732 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">The record provides sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant wrote a message on his MySpace profile threatening to kill or do bodily injury to Rollman and that the threat placed Rollman in reasonable apprehension of death or bodily injury. Accordingly, we affirm appellants conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b389-14\">. According to Rollman, MySpace is a social networking website that provides a platform for individuals to design and represent to others a unique webpage called a profile. On the profile, users can post, among other things, photographs, writings, URL links, blog entries, and comments. Individual profiles may be accessed by other MySpace account users; however, access may be limited depending on privacy settings placed on each account by the holder. Both appellant and Rollman used MySpace accounts at the time of appellant\u2019s posts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b391-9\"><em>. </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-60(A)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-10\">Any person who knowingly communicates, in a writing, including an electronically transmitted communication producing a visual or electronic message, a threat to kill or do bodily injury to a person, regarding that person or any member of his family, and the threat places such person in reasonable apprehension of death or bodily injury to himself or his family member, is guilty of a Class 6 felony.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b393-7\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875(c) criminalizes the \"transmi[ssion] in interstate or foreign commerce [of] any communication containing any threat to kidnap any person or any threat to injure the person of another.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b396-6\">. The Federal Courts of Appeal have uniformly held that \"evidence of the recipient\u2019s reaction is relevant and admissible\u201d to the inquiry of whether it was reasonable for the victim to believe an individual had a serious intention of inflicting physical harm. <em>United States v. Alaboud, </em>347 F.3d 1293, 1298 (11th Cir.2003); <em>see also United States v. Fulmer, </em>108 F.3d 1486, 1499-1500 (1st Cir.1997) (\"We find that evidence of the recipient's reactions is relevant to that inquiry.\u201d); <em>United States v. Dinwiddie, </em>76 F.3d 913, 925 (8th Cir.1996); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>915 F.2d 889, 890-91 (4th Cir.1990); <em>United States v.

Orozco-Santillan, </em>903 F.2d 1262, 1265 (9th Cir.1990) (considering the \u201creaction of the listeners\u201d). Thus, in determining whether a statement is threatening and places the recipient \"in reasonable apprehension of death or bodily injury\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-60(A)(1), we hold that \u201cproof of the effect of the alleged threat upon the addressee is highly relevant[,]\u201d <em>United States v.
