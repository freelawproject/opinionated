On appeal, English challenges the sufficiency of the evidence offered to convict him of this offense. We find the evidence sufficient and affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">On appeal, we review the evidence in the \u201clight most favorable\u201d to the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth v. Hudson, </em>265 Va. 505, 514, 578 S.E.2d 781, 786 (2003). This principle requires us to \u201cdiscard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences to be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Parks v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 492, 498, 270 S.E.2d 755, 759 (1980) (emphasis and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">In addition, an appellate court\u2019s \u201cexamination is not limited to the evidence mentioned by a party in trial argument or by the trial court in its ruling.\u201d <em>Perry v. Commonwealth, </em>280 Va. 572, 580, 701 S.E.2d 431, 436 (2010) (quoting <em>Bolden v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 144, 147, 654 S.E.2d 584, 586 (2008)). Instead, \u201can appellate court must consider all the evidence admitted at trial that is contained in the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Bolden, </em>275 Va. at 147, 654 S.E.2d at 586); <em>see also Hamilton v. Commonwealth, </em>279 Va. 94, 103, 688 S.E.2d 168, 173 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-11\">So viewed, the evidence at trial established that English and his girlfriend, Lauren Wills, argued one afternoon in a bedroom on the second floor of his home. Both had been using cocaine. English accused Wills of being unfaithful and for allowing the other man to steal money from him. When Wills <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>denied the accusations, English choked her, forced her onto the bed, and punched her several times in the face, ribs, arms, and abdomen, where her liver had previously been lacerated. The beating lasted for \u201cquite some time,\u201d Wills testified, and included twenty-five to thirty blows.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">Wills testified that, in an effort to stop the beating, she falsely admitted to English\u2019s accusations. English then ordered her downstairs. English followed her, stating he would kill the man Wills allegedly had sex with. Working himself into another rage, English struck Wills until she fell off a couch. English then kicked Wills in her back as she lay on the floor. Wills testified the kick caused an \u201cintense shooting pain\u201d through her back, leaving her barely able to move.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">After English allowed Wills to leave, Wills drove to a nearby gas station and met her sister, who arranged for an ambulance to take Wills to a local hospital. Wills, shaking and crying, had red marks covering her face, arms, neck, and head, and her shirt was torn. Her back pain prevented her from exiting her. vehicle unassisted.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">At trial, approximately nine months later, Wills testified she continued to have \u201csevere back pain.\u201d She had sustained \u201ca lot of nerve damage\u201d that caused \u201cnerve pain\u201d to radiate through her back. She had been receiving medical treatment from her primary care physician, was currently scheduled to see \u201ca pain management doctor,\u201d and had been prescribed \u201cnerve medication\u201d for her ongoing pain syndrome. \u201cAny time anything touches my back or at all,\u201d she testified, \u201cI feel intense nerve pain just because it\u2019s so hypersensitive.\u201d \u201cAnd it causes me a lot of pain just to sit,\u201d she added, \u201cjust because anything touching my back just causes my nerve pain to kind of radiate through my back from all the nerve damage that I had.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>Sitting as factfinder, the trial court found English guilty of \u201cmalicious wounding\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-51. The court concluded the evidence did not \u201cmeet the requirements for shoot, cut, stab, or the case law definition of wounding being a breach of the skin or the skin and flesh produced by external violence.\u201d But the evidence did prove, the court held, that Wills sustained a \u201cbodily injury\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-51.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">A. STANDARD OF APPELLATE REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">We examine a trial court\u2019s factfinding \u201cwith the highest degree of appellate deference.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va.App. 605, 608, 633 S.E.2d 229, 231 (2006). An appellate court does not \u201cask itself whether <em>it </em>believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>278 Va. 190, 193, 677 S.E.2d 280, 282 (2009) (emphasis in original) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-19, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)). Instead, the only \u201crelevant question is, after reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, whether <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Sullivan v. Commonwealth, </em>280 Va. 672, 676, 701 S.E.2d 61, 63 (2010) (emphasis added) (citing <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. at 2789).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">In a bench trial, a trial judge\u2019s \u201cmajor role is the determination of fact, and with experience in fulfilling that role comes expertise.\u201d <em>Haskins v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 1, 11, 602 S.E.2d 402, 407 (2004) (citation omitted). On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>appeal, \u201cthe reviewing court is not permitted to substitute its judgment, even if its view of the evidence might differ from the conclusions reached by the finder of fact at the trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. McNeal, 282 </em>Va. 16, 20, 710 S.E.2d 733, 735 (2011) (citation omitted); <em>see Courtney v. Commonwealth, </em>281 Va. 363, 368, 706 S.E.2d 344, 347 (2011). We are \u201cnot permitted to reweigh the evidence,\u201d <em>Nusbaum v. Berlin, </em>273 Va. 385, 408, 641 S.E.2d 494, 507 (2007), because appellate courts have no authority \u201cto preside <em>de novo </em>over a second trial,\u201d <em>Haskins, </em>44 Va.App. at 11, 602 S.E.2d at 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">B. CODE \u00a7 18.2-51\u2014SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">Often labeled the malicious wounding statute, Code \u00a7 18.2-51 makes it a Class 3 felony for any person to \u201cmaliciously shoot, stab, cut, or wound\u201d another person \u201cor by any means cause him bodily injury, with the intent to maim, disfigure, disable, or kill.... \u201d The label is misleading, however, because malicious <em>wounding </em>is only one of several acts violative of the statute. <em>See Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>184 Va. 409, 415-16, 35 S.E.2d 594, 596 (1945). Even if the victim is not shot, stabbed, cut, or wounded, a defendant still violates the statute if he \u201cby any means\u201d causes the victim \u201cbodily injury.\u201d <em>Dawkins v. Commonwealth, </em>186 Va. 55, 64, 41 S.E.2d 500, 505 (1947) (interpreting a predecessor to Code \u00a7 18.2-51).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">Given its disjunctive syntax, the \u201cstatute has been more broadly interpreted to include <em>any </em>bodily injury.\u201d <em>Campbell v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 476, 483, 405 S.E.2d 1, 4 (1991) <em>(en </em>banc) (emphasis added). We give the phrase \u201cbodily injury\u201d its \u201ceveryday, ordinary meaning,\u201d <em>Luck v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 827, 832, 531 S.E.2d 41, 43 (2000), which needs no technical, anatomical definition. \u201cBodily injury comprehends, it would seem, <em>any bodily hurt </em>whatsoever.\u201d <em>Bryant v. Commonwealth, </em>189 Va. 310, 316, 53 S.E.2d 54, 57 (1949) (emphasis in original) (quoting John B. Minor, <em>Synopsis of the Law of Crimes and Punishments </em>67 (1894)) (interpreting a predecessor statute). It includes any \u201cdetriment, hurt, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>loss, impairment\u201d that could fairly be considered an injury to the human body. <em>Johnson, </em>184 Va. at 416, 35 S.E.2d at 596 (citation omitted); <em>see, e.g., Dawkins, </em>186 Va. at 62, 41 S.E.2d at 504 (breaking the victim\u2019s nose and \u201ckneeing his genital organs\u201d constituted a bodily injury).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">To prove a bodily injury, the victim need not experience any observable wounds, cuts, or breaking of the skin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nor must she offer proof of \u201cbroken bones or bruises.\u201d <em>Luck, </em>32 Va.App. at 831-32, 531 S.E.2d at 43 (interpreting \u201cbodily injury\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-51.1). Bodily injury \u201cincludes soft tissue injuries, at least those which require medical attention and have some residual effect.\u201d Ronald J. Bacigal, <em>Criminal Offenses and Defenses </em>46 (2010-11 ed.) (citing <em>Luck </em>in a footnote). Thus, internal injuries\u2014no less than external injuries\u2014fall -within the scope of Code \u00a7 18.2-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Governed by these principles, we find ample evidence in the record to support the trial court\u2019s finding that English\u2019s beating of Wills caused her \u201cbodily injury\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-51.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The beating lasted for a sustained period of time, involved as many as twenty-five to thirty blows, and caused Wills \u201cintense shooting pain,\u201d temporarily leaving her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>barely able to move. Months later, at the time of English\u2019s trial, Wills was still partially incapacitated and continued to need medical treatment for her nerve damage and chronic radiating pain. These facts are more than sufficient for a factfinder to rationally conclude Wills sustained a bodily injury. <em>See, e.g., Luck, </em>32 Va.App. at 832, 531 S.E.2d at 43 (finding evidence sufficient where victim sustained \u201csoft-tissue injuries that required medical treatment\u201d and suffered \u201cpain and stiffness\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">English argues the absence of any expert medical testimony renders the evidence at trial insufficient as a matter of law. We recently rejected this argument as to the \u201cwounding\u201d aspect of Code \u00a7 18.2-51. <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>58 Va.App. 303, 316, 709 S.E.2d 175, 182 (2011). Finding \u201cno Virginia authority that requires the testimony of a medical professional or similar expert evidence to show that a victim was wounded,\u201d <em>id., </em>we refused to judicially graft such a requirement into the statute. We reach the same conclusion in this case with respect to the \u201cbodily injury\u201d aspect of Code \u00a7 18.2-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">In many contexts, Virginia law has recognized that, \u201con matters strictly involving medical science, as such, some special skill is needed, yet there are numerous related matters, involving health and bodily soundness, upon which the ordinary experience of everyday life is entirely sufficient.\u201d <em>Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co. v. McCullers, </em>189 Va. 89, 97, 52 S.E.2d 257, 260 (1949) (quoting 2 John H. Wigmore, <em>A Treatise of Anglo-American System of Evidence in Trials at Common Law </em>\u00a7 568, at 660 (3d ed.1940)); <em>see also Speller v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 437, 441, 345 S.E.2d 542, 545 (1986) (noting \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>longstanding Virginia rule is that a witness need not be a medical expert to offer testimony concerning a person\u2019s physical condition\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cGreat liberality should be shown by the courts in applying this principle, so that the cause of justice may not be obstructed by narrow and finical rulings.\u201d <em>McCullers, </em>189 Va. at 97, 52 S.E.2d at 260 (citation omitted). This observation surely applies where, as here, the victim of a violent attack testifies the beating caused her to suffer intense radiating nerve pain of such a degree that she remains partially incapacitated from participating in many ordinary activities of life.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">We affirm English\u2019s conviction, finding the evidence sufficient to prove he caused bodily injury in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b762-7\">. English testified at trial. He admitted arguing with Wills but denied using cocaine and claimed he only \"smacked\u201d Wills with an open hand a couple of times. When pronouncing its ruling, the trial court found \"a good deal of [English\u2019s] testimony to be frankly incredible.\u201d Sitting as factfinder, the trial court \u201cwas at liberty to discount [the defendant\u2019s] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>self-serving statements as little more than lying to conceal his guilt.\u201d <em>Armstead v. Commonwealth, </em>56 Va.App. 569, 581, 695 S.E.2d 561, 567 (2010) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b763-10\">. The trial court also found English guilty of abduction, a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-47. English did not challenge this conviction in his petition for appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b765-7\">. Our opinions often focus on the definition of a wound as \"a breach of the skin\u201d or a \"disruption of the internal skin\u201d of the victim. <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>58 Va.App. 303, 317, 709 S.E.2d 175, 182 (2011) (citation omitted) (relying on the \"continuing validity\u201d of <em>Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>150 Va. 580, 142 S.E. 354 (1928)). This certainly remains true for the \u201cwounding\u201d crime contained in Code \u00a7 18.2-51: <em>Wounding </em>requires a showing of a breach or disruption of the skin. \"Since <em>Harris, </em>however, the statute has been more broadly interpreted to include any bodily injury.\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>12 Va.App. at 483, 405 S.E.2d at 4 (citing <em>Bryant, </em>189 Va. at 316-17, 53 S.E.2d at 57).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b765-8\">. English does not dispute on appeal the trial court\u2019s finding that he intended \"to maim, disfigure, disable, or kill,\u201d an element of Code \u00a7 18.2-51. We thus do not address this issue. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:12(c)(l). In a single sentence in his appellate brief, English states he did not act \"with malice.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 1. We do not address this point, however, because unsupported assertions of error \"do not merit appellate consideration.\u201d <em>Jones v.

In his appellate brief, English states that an indictment charging bodily injury \"other than stabbing, shooting, cutting, or wounding\u201d should specify the means by which the injury was caused.
