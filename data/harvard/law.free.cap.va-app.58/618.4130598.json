Allen was tried at a joint trial with his codefendant, Carol Norman Drew, III. The court instructed the jury to consider separately the evidence as it related to each defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">On appeal, Allen argues the trial court erred by trying him jointly with Drew. In a prior appeal of Drew\u2019s convictions, we rejected this assertion advocated from Drew\u2019s perspective. <em>See Drew v. Commonwealth, </em>No. 2846-09-2, 2011 WL 382154, 2011 Va.App. Lexis 45 (Va.Ct.App. Feb. 8, 2011). We reach the same conclusion in this case advocated from Allen\u2019s perspective.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-12\">SCOPE OF APPELLATE REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b666-13\">When affirming a ruling made prior to trial, an appellate court may consider not only the proffers at the pretrial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>hearing but also the evidence presented at trial. <em>See generally Emerson v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 263, 272, 597 S.E.2d 242, 247 (2004) (applying principle to a pretrial suppression motion); <em>DePriest v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 577, 583, 359 S.E.2d 540, 542-43 (1987) (same); <em>see also United States v. Han, </em>74 F.3d 537, 539 (4th Cir.1996) (noting federal courts have \u201cheld uniformly that an appellate tribunal may consider evidence adduced at trial that supports the district judge\u2019s ruling\u201d made prior to trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">As an appellate basis for reversing a pretrial severance ruling, however, evidence at trial becomes relevant only if the defendant renews his motion at trial. \u201c[T]he fact a pretrial motion has been denied is no reason for not renewing the motion during the course of the trial.\u201d 5 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7 17.3(d), at 57 (3d ed.2007). Only by doing so does the defendant invite the trial court to reconsider its pretrial ruling in light of the actual evidence presented\u2014 rather than merely relying (as the trial court ordinarily must when deciding the issue prior to trial) solely upon the charging documents and the pretrial proffers of the parties. <em>See United States v. Rollins, </em>301 F.3d 511, 518 (7th Cir.2002); <em>see generally </em>5 LaFave, <em>supra, </em>at 57 (\u201cFailure to renew the motion at trial ... at a minimum is likely to limit appellate review to the question of whether the judge properly decided the pretrial motion on the facts then available to him.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">JOINDER AND SEVERANCE STANDARDS</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">Code \u00a7 19.2-262.1 governs joint trials of codefendants in criminal cases. If the Commonwealth shows \u201cgood cause\u201d for a joint trial, \u201cthe court shall order persons charged with participating in contemporaneous and related acts or occurrences or in a series of acts or occurrences constituting an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>offense or offenses, to be tried jointly unless such joint trial would constitute prejudice to a defendant.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-262.1. However, if the trial court \u201cfinds that a joint trial would constitute prejudice to a defendant, the court shall order severance as to that defendant or provide such other relief justice requires.\u201d <em>Id.; see generally Dearing v. Commonwealth, </em>259 <em>Va. </em>117, 122, 524 S.E.2d 121, 123-24 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Prior to the enactment of Code \u00a7 19.2-262.1, a criminal defendant\u2019s election to be tried separately was \u201ca matter of right.\u201d <em>Burgess v. Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 368, 373, 297 S.E.2d 654, 656 (1982) (citation omitted). Enacted in 1993, Code \u00a7 19.2-262.1 eliminated that right and provided a trial court \u201cin its discretion, may\u201d order joint trials. A few years later, the General Assembly substituted \u201cshall\u201d for the phrase \u201cin its discretion, may\u201d\u2014thereby establishing a presumption in favor of joint trials when the Commonwealth shows \u201cgood cause\u201d for joinder. <em>See </em>1997 Va. Acts ch. 518.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In its present form, Code \u00a7 19.2-262.1 places the initial burden of persuasion on the Commonwealth to show good cause for a joint trial. If good cause exists, the defendant seeking a severance \u201chas the burden of proving that a joint trial will result in prejudice.\u201d Ronald J. Bacigal, <em>Virginia Practice: Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7 14:19, at 398 (2010-2011 ed.) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The underlying determinations of good cause and prejudice involve a case-by-case exercise of the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>discretion. <em>See Dickerson v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 252, 254, 511 S.E.2d 434, 435-36 (1999); <em>Adkins v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 159, 162-63, 480 S.E.2d 777, 779 (1997). On appeal, we do not review these decisions <em>de novo </em>but rather under the deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. \u201cOnly when reasonable jurists could not differ can we say an abuse of discretion has occurred.\u201d <em>Grattan v. Commonwealth, </em>278 Va. 602, 620, 685 S.E.2d 634, 644 (2009) (quoting in parenthetical <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 741, 753, 607 S.E.2d 738, 743 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">On appeal, Allen does not claim the trial court abused its discretion in finding good cause for the joint trial. <em>See </em>Oral Argument Audio at 00:53 to 02:10. Instead, Allen contends only that the court erred in refusing to accept his argument that the joint trial would prejudice him. <em>Id. </em>Allen\u2019s prejudice argument turns on a single, general assertion: \u201cConnecting Allen with Drew in front of a jury tainted their ability to fairly judge Allen on the evidence against him by creating a vicarious guilt attaching to Allen, simply by virtue of being tried with Drew.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 10. As Allen views the case, the incriminating evidence against him was far less convincing than the incriminating evidence against Drew\u2014thus raising the specter of \u201cvicarious guilt.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">We find it unnecessary to examine the evidence in detail to determine whether Allen\u2019s factual assessment is persuasive because we disagree with the legal premise of his argument. Even if the case against Drew were stronger than that against Allen, that fact by itself would not entitle Allen to a separate trial. A criminal defendant must show a joint trial would cause \u201cactual prejudice\u201d to his rights, <em>Randolph v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 345, 363-64, 482 S.E.2d 101, 110 (1997) (citation omitted)\u2014not theoretical or hypothetical prejudice, but rather \u201clegally cognizable prejudice,\u201d <em>Zafiro v. United States, </em>506 U.S. 534, 541, 113 S.Ct. 933, 939, 122 L.Ed.2d 317 (1993).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This occurs only when \u201cthere is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>serious risk that a joint trial would compromise a specific trial right of one of the defendants\u201d or when the joinder would \u201cprevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 539, 113 S.Ct. at 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">That the prosecution may have a stronger case against one codefendant than another does not, by itself, constitute actual prejudice. Criminal defendants \u201care not entitled to severance merely because they may have a better chance of acquittal in separate trials.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 540, 113 S.Ct. at 938. Nor does it matter that \u201cseparate trials would more likely result in acquittal\u201d or that \u201cthe evidence against one defendant is not as strong as that against the other.\u201d <em>United States v. Shealey, </em>641 F.3d 627, 633 (4th Cir.2011) (citation omitted); <em>United States v. Akinkoye, </em>185 F.3d 192, 197 (4th Cir.1999) (citing <em>United States v. Brooks, </em>957 F.2d 1138, 1145 (4th Cir.1992)). \u201cThe fact that the evidence against one defendant is stronger than the evidence against other defendants does not in itself justify severance.\u201d <em>Brooks, </em>957 F.2d at 1145 (citing <em>United States v. Hargrove, </em>647 F.2d 411, 415 (4th Cir.1981)). All the more, the mere assertion that a codefendant was \u201cmore deeply involved in the crime\u201d does not constitute actual prejudice. <em>Hargrove, </em>647 F.2d at 415. If it were enough, separate trials \u201cwould have to be granted almost as a matter of course,\u201d <em>Brooks, </em>957 F.2d at 1145, except in those rare cases where the incriminating evidence is precisely the same against one defendant as it is against all others.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Because Allen \u201ccan point to no trial right which was compromised or any basis for concluding the jury was prevented from making a reliable judgment about his guilt or innocence,\u201d <em>Barnes v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 406, 413, 470 S.E.2d 579, 582 (1996), we hold the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing Allen\u2019s request for a separate trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b667-9\">. Unlike a pretrial motion to sever, however, a motion during trial should take into account applicable double jeopardy principles governing retrials. See <em>generally United States v. Newton, </em>327 F.3d 17, 21-26 (1st Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Odom, </em>888 F.2d 1014, 1018-21 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b668-7\">. At the time of Allen's trial, Rule 3 A: 10(a) provided: \"On motion of the Commonwealth, for good cause shown, the court, <em>in its discretion, may order </em>persons ... to be tried jointly unless such joint trial would constitute prejudice to a defendant.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Former Rule 3A: 10(a) mistakenly cast the good cause determination as a discretionary (\"may\u201d) directive rather than the mandatory (\"shall\u201d) directive mandated by the 1997 amendment to Code \u00a7 19.2-262.1. <em>See </em>1997 Va. Acts ch. 518. Because rules of court cannot contradict statutes, we do not apply former Rule 3A: 10(a) to this case. <em>See </em>Va. Const. art. VI, \u00a7 5 (stating rules of court \"shall not be in conflict with the general law as the same shall, from time to time, be established by the General Assembly\u201d). Rule 3A: 10(a) has since been amended to conform to the statute. <em>See </em>Va. Sup.Ct. Order dated March 1, 2011 (amending, effective May 2, 2011, Rule 3A:10(a) by deleting \"in its discretion, may\u201d and inserting \"shall\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b669-7\">. \u201cCases interpreting the federal rules on joinder are instructive in Virginia because both the federal rules and the Virginia statute focus on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>prejudice as the determinative factor governing joinder.\u201d Bacigal, <em>supra </em>at 397.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b670-7\">. On brief, Allen adds: \"To complicate things further, Drew testified in his own defense in the joint trial. Had Allen been tried separately from Drew, this evidence would not have come in.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 12. This point, however, is not accompanied by any citation to legal authority, <em>see </em>Rule 5A:20(e), was not raised at the pretrial hearing on joinder, <em>see </em>discussion <em>supra </em>at Part I, and was not argued at trial as a basis for severance, <em>see </em>Rule 5A:18. In any event, we see no reason to address the issue further. <em>Cf. Nelson v. O\u2019Neil, </em>402 U.S. 622, 629-30, 91 S.Ct. 1723, 1727, 29 L.Ed.2d 222 (1971) (holding a defendant has been denied no specific trial right \"protected by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments\u201d by the mere fact that \"a codefendant takes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>stand in his own defense\u201d); <em>United States v.
