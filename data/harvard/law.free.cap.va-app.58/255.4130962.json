On appeal, Isaac argues the trial court erred in admitting this evidence. We affirm without addressing the merits of his argument because Isaac introduced substantially similar evidence during his case in chief, thereby waiving his earlier objection and rendering harmless any alleged error.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">In March 2009, while driving eastbound in the westbound lanes of Interstate 495, Isaac ran head-on into a vehicle driven by Cristina L. Palese. Police officers and rescue teams immediately responded to the scene of the collision. One of the paramedics smelled alcohol inside Isaac\u2019s vehicle and on Isaac\u2019s person as he was transported by ambulance to the hospital. Virginia State Police Trooper Rosemary Daly found a bottle of vodka on the floorboard of Isaac\u2019s vehicle. At the hospital, Daly smelled alcohol on Isaac\u2019s clothing. The trooper informed Isaac at the hospital that he was under arrest for driving under the influence. Trooper Daly advised Isaac of the implied consent law and requested that the attending nurse obtain a blood sample. Test results revealed Isaac\u2019s blood alcohol content (BAC) was 0.16% by weight by volume. Isaac requested and received a second blood alcohol test. The second test resulted in a finding of 0.14% BAC by weight by volume.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Given Isaac\u2019s extensive injuries and the ongoing medical attention he was then receiving, Trooper Daly did not handcuff or otherwise physically restrain Isaac in the hospital. Instead, state troopers maintained an around-the-clock custodial presence outside Isaac\u2019s room. While Isaac was still in the hospital, Trooper Daly appeared before a local magistrate and obtained warrants for his arrest. Eight days later, officers transferred Isaac from the hospital directly into the Fairfax County Adult Detention Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Palese died from her injuries arising out of the collision. A grand jury indicted Isaac for aggravated involuntary manslaughter, alleging he caused Palese\u2019s death while \u201cdriving under the influence\u201d and acting in a manner \u201cso gross, wanton and culpable as to show a reckless disregard for human life.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1(A), (B). Prior to trial, Isaac sought to suppress the 0.16% BAC certificate of analysis on the ground that Trooper Daly did not have probable cause to make a DUI arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">After the trial court denied the motion to suppress, Isaac argued a separate motion <em>in limine </em>asserting an alternative ground to exclude the same BAC certificate of analysis. Citing <em>Bristol v. Commonwealth, </em>272 Va. 568, 636 S.E.2d 460 (2006), Isaac argued he was never actually arrested because Trooper Daly never physically touched him after declaring him under arrest. <em>See </em>Defendant\u2019s Motion <em>in Limine </em>at 2 (Oct. 30, 2009). In response, the Commonwealth argued the arresting officer\u2019s custodial confinement of Isaac within his hospital room constituted a common law arrest. <em>See </em>Commonwealth\u2019s Opp. to Motion <em>in Limine </em>at 5 (Nov. 3, 2009). In a detailed letter opinion, the trial court rejected Isaac\u2019s argument, ruling</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-5\">to extend the <em>Bristol </em>analysis to cover the facts of this case\u2014as Mr. Isaac urges\u2014would create a hazardous requirement that a law enforcement officer intrude into a sanitary operating room, thereby interrupting the medical personnel and potentially endangering a suspect\u2019s life, merely to physically touch an unconscious suspect for the sole purpose of ensuring the \u201clegality\u201d of an \u201carrest.\u201d This Court refuses to require such an ill-advised and dangerous gesture in interpreting Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Letter Op. at 6-7 (Dec. 31, 2009) (Klein, J.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Consistent with the trial court\u2019s rulings, the Commonwealth introduced into evidence the 0.16% BAC certificate of analysis. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>After the Commonwealth rested, Isaac offered into evidence during his case in chief the independent test results showing a 0.14% BAC. Isaac also presented the testimony of a toxicologist who restated the findings contained in the Commonwealth\u2019s 0.16% BAC certificate and commented upon Isaac\u2019s 0.14% BAC certificate. The toxicologist claimed the difference between the two findings rendered both certificates <em>per se </em>unreliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">An agreed jury instruction advised the jurors that they had \u201creceived evidence of the alleged blood alcohol content\u201d and could \u201cgive this evidence such weight as you see fit in determining the issue of guilt or innocence.\u201d The trial judge also explained: \u201cIf at the time that a person was operating a motor vehicle, that person\u2019s blood alcohol level was .08 or higher, you are permitted to infer that such a person was then under the influence of alcohol unless from all the evidence you have a reasonable doubt that the person was under the influence of alcohol.\u201d <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-269(A)(3). With both BAC certificates in evidence, the jury convicted Isaac of aggravated involuntary manslaughter under Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1(A), (B) (causing death while \u201cdriving under the influence\u201d and acting in a manner \u201cso gross, wanton and culpable as to show a reckless disregard for human life\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">On appeal, Isaac challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of his motions to exclude from evidence the Commonwealth\u2019s 0.16% BAC certificate. He was either arrested without probable cause or he was never arrested at all, Isaac argues. Both arguments, Isaac concedes, seek only to defeat the admission into evidence of the Commonwealth\u2019s 0.16% BAC certificate of analysis. <em>See </em>Oral Argument Audio at 18:55 to 20:10. We see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>no reason to decide these issues, however, given that Isaac introduced substantially similar evidence during his case in chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Under Virginia law, a litigant waives an objection to evidence when he introduces \u201cevidence dealing with the same subject <em>as part of his ovm case-in-chief.\u201d Pettus v. Gottfried, </em>269 Va. 69, 79, 606 S.E.2d 819, 825 (2005) (emphasis added) (citing <em>Drinkard-Nuckols v. Andrews, </em>269 Va. 93, 102-03, 606 S.E.2d 813, 819 (2005)). Put another way, when a litigant \u201cunsuccessfully objects to evidence that he considers improper and then introduces on his own behalf evidence of the same character, he waives his earlier objection to the admission of that evidence.\u201d <em>Combs v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry., </em>256 Va. 490, 499, 507 S.E.2d 355, 360 (1998). The waiver applies to criminal and civil cases, <em>see, e.g., Hubbard v. Commonwealth, </em>243 Va. 1, 9, 413 S.E.2d 875, 879 (1992); <em>Saunders v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 399, 401, 177 S.E.2d 637, 638-39 (1970),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and affects evidentiary objections based on constitutional as well as statutory and common law grounds, <em>see, e.g., Bynum v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 451, 506 S.E.2d 30 (1998) (holding a defendant, by testifying to the substance of the statement in his case in chief, waived his earlier <em>Miranda </em>objection to the prosecution\u2019s admission of statement).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">This same-evidence principle has none of the weaknesses of judicial novelty, for it has stood in roughly the same form for well over a century. <em>See New York Life Ins. Co. v. Taliaferro, </em>95 Va. 522, 523, 28 S.E. 879, 879 (1898); <em>Va. &amp; Tenn. Coal &amp; Iron Co. v. Fields, </em>94 Va. 102, 113, 26 S.E. 426, 426-27 (1896). Though explained in different ways, the practical effect of the principle remains clear: \u201cSome courts so hold because the error is harmless, and others because the subsequent introduction of the same evidence is a waiver of the objection. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Whether it be placed upon one ground or the other, the result is the same.\u201d <em>Taliaferro, </em>95 Va. at 523, 28 S.E. at 879.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">An exception to the same-evidence principle exists for evidence elicited \u201cduring cross-examination of a witness or in rebuttal testimony.\u201d <em>Zektaw v. Commonwealth, </em>278 Va. 127, 134, 677 S.E.2d 49, 52-53 (2009) (quoting <em>Drinkard-Nuckols, </em>269 Va. at 102, 606 S.E.2d at 818).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For purposes of the same-evidence principle, rebuttal evidence should not be confused with, or deemed congruent to, the entirety of a criminal defendant\u2019s <em>case in </em>chief\u2014which, by its very nature, seeks to rebut (using the term in the vernacular) the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence. If the rebuttal exception included all evidence presented during the defendant\u2019s case in chief, the exception would swallow the rule. Almost everything covered by the waiver would likewise be protected by the exception. To adopt such an anomalous interpretation of the doctrine would put us in conflict with numerous Virginia cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">In the context of the same-evidence principle, Virginia courts have applied the rebuttal exception in very limited circumstances. For example, in <em>Snead v. Commonwealth, </em>138 Va. 787, 121 S.E. 82 (1924), the Commonwealth introduced into evidence an incriminating letter allegedly sent by the victim to the defendant. The defendant\u2019s counsel cross-examined the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>victim and, in his case in chief, the defendant took the stand and testified he knew nothing about the letter. <em>Id. </em>at 801,121 S.E. at 86. He did not know of the letter\u2019s alleged existence \u201cuntil it was introduced in evidence on the trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendant did not introduce the letter in his case in chief to prove some point he wanted to make, or offer an alternative letter allegedly received from the victim, or explain that he received the letter but interpreted it differently than the prosecutor. Given the limited nature of the defendant\u2019s testimony, <em>Snead </em>held the defendant did not waive his earlier objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">The rebuttal exception, however, does not apply when the defendant presents in his case in chief the same or similar evidence he previously objected to in order to explain it away or to offer a more favorable interpretation. For example, in <em>Snarr v. Commonwealth, </em>131 Va. 814, 818, 109 S.E. 590, 592 (1921), the defendant waived his objection when he took the stand and \u201cfully related his recollection\u201d of an alleged reckless driving incident, the subject of his earlier objection. Similarly, in <em>Hutchinson v. Commonwealth, </em>133 Va. 710, 717, 112 S.E. 624, 626 (1922), the defendant waived his earlier objection when he \u201csubsequently also testified as to the same matter on direct examination.\u201d <em>Accord Moore Lumber Corp. v. Walker, </em>110 Va. 775, 778-79, 67 S.E. 374, 375 (1910) (holding the defendant waived objection to testimony concerning \u201cthe writing in question\u201d when he \u201cin his oral testimony undertook to explain its purport\u201d); <em>Bynum, </em>28 Va.App. at 459, 506 S.E.2d at 34 (holding a defendant, by testifying to the substance of the statement in his case in chief, waived his earlier <em>Miranda </em>objection to the prosecution\u2019s admission of statement).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">This point highlights the harmless error underpinnings of the same-evidence principle, <em>Taliaferro, </em>95 Va. at 523, 28 S.E. at 879, and thus implicates the \u201cimperative demands of common sense,\u201d <em>Oliver v. Commonwealth, </em>151 Va. 533, 541, 145 S.E. 307, 309 (1928). Here, for example, if we excised from the evidentiary record the Commonwealth\u2019s 0.16% BAC certificate (the relief Isaac seeks on appeal) we must still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>examine the rest of the evidence (including Isaac\u2019s 0.14% BAC certificate) to determine if the case should be retried.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That analysis would surely end with the conclusion that the 0.02% difference had a negligible, if any, effect on the outcome of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">No doubt Isaac would protest this reasoning\u2014whether described as waiver or as an analogue of harmless error\u2014by pointing out he would <em>not </em>have offered his 0.14% BAC certificate into evidence the trial court had excluded the Commonwealth\u2019s 0.16% BAC certificate as Isaac had earlier requested. Perhaps so, but this observation does not authorize us to excise from the record Isaac\u2019s own evidence, offered by him during his case in chief, addressed by the trial court in its instructions to the jury, considered by the jurors during their deliberations, and unchallenged by any party on appeal. <em>See Taliaferro, 95 </em>Va. at 523-24, 28 S.E. at 879 (\u201cIf the action of the court in permitting this record to be read at the instance of the plaintiffs were now held to be erroneous, it would not affect the record as it was presented in the trial before the jury, for it would still be in evidence upon the motion of the defendants.\u201d (quoting <em>Fields, </em>94 Va. at 113, 26 S.E. at 427)). In short, while a party can complain on appeal about his opponent\u2019s erroneously admitted evidence, he cannot complain about his own. And, when his own evidence is substantially the same as his opponent\u2019s, he can complain on appeal about neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">As for the <em>scope </em>of the same-evidence principle, an objecting party waives his objection when he introduces in his case in chief exactly the same evidence he previously objected to. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number><em>Taliaferro, </em>95 Va. at 523, 28 S.E. at 879 (applying waiver principles to the introduction of the \u201csame evidence\u201d); <em>see also Snarr, </em>131 Va. at 818, 109 S.E. at 592; <em>Walker, </em>110 Va. at 778, 67 S.E. at 375. The scope of the waiver goes further, however, for it also includes evidence dealing \u201cwith the same subject,\u201d <em>Pettus, </em>269 Va. at 79, 606 S.E.2d at 825 (citation omitted), evidence fairly considered to be \u201cof the same character,\u201d <em>Combs, </em>256 Va. at 499, 507 S.E.2d at 360,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as well as evidence \u201csimilar to that to which the objection applies,\u201d <em>Snead, </em>138 Va. at 802, 121 S.E. at 86 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">In this case, Isaac introduced into evidence a 0.14% BAC certificate of analysis. This evidence deals with the same subject as, and is sufficiently similar to, the Commonwealth\u2019s 0.16% BAC certificate. Both certificates address the same topic: the blood alcohol content in Isaac\u2019s blood. Both establish BAC levels in excess of 0.08%, thereby triggering the inference of Code \u00a7 18.2-269(A)(3) \u201cthat the accused was under the influence of alcohol intoxicants at the time of the alleged offense.\u201d <em>See also </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1(A), (B). The two certificates differ in degree, though only slightly, but not in kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">In sum, we need not address whether the trial court erred in admitting into evidence the Commonwealth\u2019s 0.16% BAC certificate. Isaac waived his objection by introducing sufficiently similar evidence during his case in chief. For this reason, we affirm Isaac\u2019s conviction for aggravated involuntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b304-8\">. <em>See generally </em>2 William Blackstone, <em>Commentaries on the Laws of England </em>287, n. 14 (George Sharswood ed. 1892) (citing <em>Williams v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number><em>Jones, </em>95 Eng.
