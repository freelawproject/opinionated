Employer contends the commission erred in concluding claimant sustained his burden of proof to show that his purchase of a spa pool was reasonable, necessary, and related to his work-related injury. For the reasons stated, we reverse the decision of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">\u201cOn appeal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party before the commission.\u201d <em>Central Va. Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology Assocs., P.C. v. Whitfield, </em>42 Va.App. 264, 269, 590 S.E.2d 631, 634 (2004). So viewed, the evidence relevant to this appeal was as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">On September 20, 2005, claimant sustained a compensable injury to his left shoulder. As a result of his injury, claimant consulted Dr. Felix Kirven, an orthopedic surgeon, about ongoing swelling, stiffness, and soreness in his back. Dr. Kirven did not testify, either in person or by deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-11\">Claimant saw an advertisement on television featuring a spa pool with jets to massage a person\u2019s neck, shoulders, and lower back. Claimant mentioned the spa pool to Dr. Kirven. On May 31, 2007, Dr. Kirven wrote a letter indicating that claimant would benefit from a spa pool. The record contains no indication this letter was sent to employer, and there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>medical report attached to the letter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rather, the letter said only:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-4\">Mr. Harris is a 46-year-old male with upper cervical neck pain, spondylosis with radiculopathy. He is status post an anterior cervical diskectomy with fusion. He continues to have pain in the neck secondary to his arthritic condition, in addition he has a left knee arthritis condition. Mr. Harris would benefit from a spa pool/heater for the above medical reasons to decrease pain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">On June 11, 2008, Dr. Kirven wrote claimant a prescription for a spa pool.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the same day, claimant spoke with Wyvette Johnson, a claims adjuster, to ask if he would be reimbursed for the spa pool. Johnson declined. She explained to claimant that her file did not contain a recommendation or prescription from Dr. Kirven, and claimant said he would call the doctor. The next day, Johnson received a fax cover letter and a prescription from Dr. Kirven\u2019s office. Johnson wrote to Dr. Kirven on June 20, 2008, asking for more details about the recommended spa pool. She also asked if claimant could attend therapy at a center that offered whirlpool or aquatic therapy, rather than purchasing a spa pool for home use. Dr. Kirven did not respond.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Johnson did not investigate the matter further.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Despite Johnson\u2019s response, claimant purchased the spa pool for $5,200 on June 16, 2008. Claimant\u2019s private insurance covered part of the cost, and claimant himself paid the remaining amount. Claimant purchased a six-person spa pool from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>East Coast Leisure, which sells patio furniture, picnic equipment, etc. Claimant acknowledged Dr. Kirven had not recommended this particular spa pool. Claimant also testified he later saw smaller spa pools that seated fewer than six people. He did not explain why he purchased a six-seat hot tub. Claimant testified the spa pool has been beneficial and that he continues to use it.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">The deputy commissioner found that employer was responsible for payment of the spa pool, noting that Code \u00a7 65.2-603(A)(1) requires an employer to provide necessary medical treatment for a compensable injury, including any appliances prescribed by the claimant\u2019s treating physician. The deputy commissioner found that spa pools are an \u201cappliance\u201d as contemplated by the statute.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-5\">The commission affirmed the deputy commissioner, noting: As an initial matter, the burden of proof rests with the claimant to show that the medical expenses for which he seeks payment are causally related to the accident, and reasonable and necessary for treatment of his compensable injury, and that the medical service was rendered by, or on referral by, an authorized treating physician. <em>Volvo White Truck Corp. v. Hedge, </em>1 Va.App. 195, 336 S.E.2d 903 (1985). As long as a causal relationship between the industrial accident and the complaints which are the subject of the referral exists, the employer is financially responsible for the medical attention which the attending physician deems necessary, subject to review by the Commission. <em>Jensen Press v. Ale, </em>1 Va.App. 153, 159, 336 S.E.2d 522, 535 [525] (1985). Where the treating physician has prescribed specific medical treatment, the burden of proof shifts to the employer to show that the medical treatment is unreasonable or unnecessary, and that it is relieved from the mandate of the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. <em>Hogan v. Misener Marine Constr., Inc., </em>VWC File No. 128-80-49 (Feb. 25, 1993).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>The commission noted that Dr. Kirven had issued several prescriptions for a spa pool and in March 2010 had indicated the pool was necessary to treat claimant\u2019s injuries. The commission then stated, \u201cThere was simply no medical evidence to the contrary.\u201d The commission also noted the record contained no evidence from Dr. Kirven that other forms of water therapy, rather than a six-person home spa pool, would have been equally helpful or available to claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">On appeal, employer contends the commission erred in finding that claimant met his burden of proof to show that his purchase of a spa pool was reasonable and necessary, and related to his work injury. In order to resolve this issue, we must also determine what limits, if any, apply to a nonspecific, generalized and generic physician\u2019s prescription for treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">In Virginia, workers\u2019 compensation law requires:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-8\">As long as necessary after an accident, the employer shall furnish or cause to be furnished, free of charge to the injured employee, a physician ... and such other necessary medical attention.... [U]pon determination by the treating physician and the Commission that the same is medically necessary, the Commission may require that the employer furnish and maintain ... modification of the employee\u2019s principal home consisting of ... any appliances prescribed by the treating physician ... provided that the aggregate cost of all such items and modifications required to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>furnished on account of any one accident shall not exceed $25,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Code \u00a7 65.2-603(A)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">It is the claimant\u2019s burden to demonstrate that the treatment for which he seeks payment is causally related to the accident, is necessary for treatment of his compensable injury, and is recommended by an authorized treating physician. <em>See Volvo White Truck Corp., </em>1 Va.App. at 199-200, 336 S.E.2d at 906; <em>accord </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-603.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">We will uphold the commission\u2019s factual findings if they are supported by credible evidence. <em>See James v. Capitol Steel Constr. Co., </em>8 Va.App. 512, 515, 382 S.E.2d 487, 488 (1989). \u201cHowever, the question of whether the disputed medical treatment was necessary within the meaning of Code \u00a7 65.2-603 is a mixed question of law and fact.\u201d <em>Lynchburg Foundry Co. v. Goad, </em>15 Va.App. 710, 712-13, 427 S.E.2d 215, 217 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">\u201c \u2018[Conclusions of the Commission upon questions of law, or mixed questions of law and fact, are not binding on [appeal].\u2019 \u201d <em>City of Waynesboro v. Harter, </em>1 Va.App. 265, 269, 337 S.E.2d 901, 903 (1985) (quoting <em>Brown v. Fox, </em>189 Va. 509, 517, 54 S.E.2d 109, 113 (1949)). Accordingly, we review <em>de novo </em>the commission\u2019s application of the law to those findings. <em>Roanoke Belt, Inc. v. Mroczkowski, </em>20 Va.App. 60, 68, 455 S.E.2d 267, 271 (1995). Therefore, the commission\u2019s findings in this case as to the necessity of the claimant\u2019s purchase of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>home spa pool are not binding upon this Court. <em>Papco Oil Co. v. Farr, </em>26 Va.App. 66, 73-74, 492 S.E.2d 858, 861 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">At oral argument, claimant conceded, and we agree, that there must be limits to an unspecific and generic prescription for the items required under Code \u00a7 65.2-603(A)(l). Clearly, under the facts of this case, i.e. a prescription for \u201cspa pool,\u201d with nothing more, would not require employer to pay for claimant\u2019s trip to Europe to seek a \u201cspa pool\u201d in Switzerland. Obviously, the treatment in question is not that extreme.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">In <em>Lynchburg Foundry, </em>15 Va.App. 710, 427 S.E.2d 215, the treating physician authorized home nursing care to change claimant\u2019s dressings for burns received as a result of a compensable injury. While claimant could have received the same treatment at his doctor\u2019s office, we found such home treatment was medically necessary, primarily based on the treating physician\u2019s specific order for <em>home </em>health care. Here, unlike <em>Lynchburg Foundry, </em>the treating physician made neither a specific order nor a determination as to the situs of the treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\"><em>City of Salem v. Colegrove, </em>228 Va. 290, 321 S.E.2d 654 (1984), is instructive. The issue in <em>Colegrove </em>was whether \u201creasonable and necessary vocational rehabilitative training services\u201d provided by Code \u00a7 65.1-88 (now Code \u00a7 65.2-603(A)(3)) included a four-year college program. The Supreme Court of Virginia found they did not. Colegrove, as a result of a compensable injury, was no longer able to perform heavy work. His treating physician recommended \u201cjob retraining.\u201d On his own initiative, claimant enrolled in a community college and then transferred to a four-year college to major in accounting. The Supreme Court of Virginia found such an education was \u201coutside the range\u201d of benefits provided by the General Assembly. <em>Id. </em>at 294, 321 S.E.2d at 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\"><em>Colegrove </em>is instructive because in that case and in the instant case, the actual treatment incurred far exceeded the general nature of the treatment authorized by the treating physician, both in scope and degree. In <em>Colegrove, </em>the physi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>cian never determined a four-year degree program was medically necessary nor did the doctor recommend such a program.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\"><em>Reynolds Metals Company v. Chowning, </em>No. 0800-00-2, 2000 WL 1180151, 2000 Va.App. LEXIS 614 (Va.Ct.App. Aug. 22, 2000),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> addresses an issue similar to the instant case. In <em>Reynolds, </em>the issue was whether a whirlpool tub qualified as necessary medical treatment under Code \u00a7 65.2-603(A)(l). <em>Id. </em>at *1, 2000 Va.App. LEXIS 614, at *1. The treating physician prescribed a \u201chot tub spa\u2014one that she will be able to soak entire [left] arm, shoulder and neck in.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *1, 2000 Va.App. LEXIS 614, at *3. Employer defended the claim by contending a health club hot tub was adequate to meet claimant\u2019s needs. <em>Id. </em>at *1-2, 2000 Va.App. LEXIS 614, at *4. We affirmed the commission\u2019s findings that a health club membership was not adequate to satisfy claimant\u2019s treatment needs. <em>Id. </em>at *2-3, 2000 Va.App. LEXIS 614, at *6. Testimony before the commission indicated the health club was not open at night when claimant\u2019s pain was the greatest, that the pool was not deep enough for her to immerse her entire shoulder, neck, and arm, and it contained chlorine, which bothered claimant. <em>Id. </em>at *1-2, 2000 Va.App. LEXIS 614, at *4. Evidence further revealed the health club was 45 minutes from claimant\u2019s home. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Unlike the instant case, the record in <em>Reynolds </em>contained testimony that alternate treatment was not adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">In this case, claimant failed to demonstrate that the six-person home spa pool was medically necessary. Nothing in the record indicates that claimant could not receive similar treatment (water/heat therapy) elsewhere.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Dr. Kirven never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>indicated that claimant was unable to obtain the same treatment at a f\u00edtness/health center. There is certainly no evidence that claimant needed to purchase a six-person hot tub for his home.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Dr. Kirven\u2019s prescription did not call for a \u201chome\u201d spa pool, nor did it call for a spa pool capable of seating six people. In other words, he never prescribed this specific appliance. At oral argument, when asked what evidence supported his contention that a six-seat home \u201cspa pool\u201d was medically necessary, claimant\u2019s counsel could only refer to the \u201cspa pool\u201d prescriptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">Furthermore, Dr. Kirven\u2019s affirmative answer to claimant\u2019s counsel\u2019s question about whether the spa pool is necessary for claimant\u2019s treatment does not establish that claimant\u2019s purchase of a six-person home spa pool was medically necessary. Further, no evidence indicates Dr. Kirven knew of the specific description of the spa pool purchased by claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The record is devoid of any evidence to support claimant\u2019s purchase of a six-person home spa pool as medically necessary.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We conclude that when a treating physician prescribes an unspecific, generalized, and generic treatment, the claimant must present evidence that such treatment is medically necessary such as evidence that alternative treatment is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>not adequate, or available medical testimony elaborating on the non-specific prescription, or documentation of the need for the specific treatment obtained by claimant. This list is not exhaustive. Claimant cannot, \"with unbridled discretion, choose any treatment that falls within the non-specific prescription.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">We find the commission erred in concluding employer was responsible for payment of claimant\u2019s spa pool. We therefore reverse the decision of the commission, and the award is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b606-7\">. In fact, Dr. Kirven's medical notes are silent as to this recommended treatment. It is important to note that while the prescriptions are dated June 11, 2008 and May 14, 2009, none of the office notes in that general time period mention a spa pool or any type of water or heat therapy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b606-8\">. On May 14, 2009, Dr. Kirven repeated this prescription for a \"spa pool.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b606-9\">. On March 24, 2010, Dr. Kirven responded to a letter from claimant's attorney and stated that a spa pool was a necessary treatment for claimant\u2019s injuries.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b607-6\">. While the commission referred to \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d treatment, Code \u00a7 65.2-603(A)(l) only uses the phrase \"medically neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>saiy\u201d in describing various appliances and alterations to a claimant\u2019s home. Code \u00a7 65.2-604(A)(3) uses the phrase \u201creasonable and necessary\" in reference to \"vocational rehabilitative services.\u201d This opinion will only address whether the spa pool in question is \"medically necessary\u201d under Code \u00a7 65.2-603(A)(l).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b609-9\">. The commission cites its own case of <em>Hogan v. Misener, </em>VWC File No. 128-80-49, 1993 Va. Wrk. Comp. LEXIS 35 (Feb. 25, 1993), for the proposition that if the treating physician has prescribed specific medical treatment, the burden shifts to employer to show that the medical treatment is unreasonable or unnecessary. However, neither party argues that this case applies. Therefore, we take no position on whether the burden shifts. Even if we accept the burden-shifting under <em>Hogan, </em>we find that <em>Hogan </em>does not apply here, because Dr. Kirven made no recommendation for this specific appliance. As we indicate, Dr. Kirven did not specify whether the spa pool needed to be installed in claimant's home, nor did he indicate the seating capacity of the spa pool. Therefore, claimant failed to meet the second and third prongs of his burden.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b611-7\">. While an unpublished case has no precedential value, courts do \"not err by considering the rationale and adopting it to the extent it is persuasive.\u201d <em>Fairfax County School Board v. Rose, 29 </em>Va.App. 32, 39 n. 3, 509 S.E.2d 525, 528 n. 3 (1999) (en banc); see also Rule 5A:1(f) (\"The citation of judicial opinions, orders, judgments, or other written dispositions that are not officially reported ... is permitted as informative, but shall not be received as binding authority.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b611-8\">. Claimant seems to suggest it is significant that employer never followed through with its inquiry as to alternate treatments. However, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>we have previously stated, the burden is on claimant, not employer, to show that the treatment is medically necessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b612-7\">. Although unpublished, <em>Murray v. Westmoreland Coal Company, </em>No. 1090-95-3, 1995 WL 577597, 1995 Va.App. LEXIS 714 (Va.Ct.App. Oct. 3, 1995), supports this position. In <em>Mmray, </em>this Court upheld the commission\u2019s finding that employer was not responsible for a two-person Craftmatic Adjustable Bed, because \"no evidence established that a two-person bed (as opposed to a one-person model) was reasonable and necessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *1, 1995 Va.App. LEXIS 714, at <em>*2.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b612-8\">.

However, in that case, the treating physician specifically recommended the installation of a hot tub in claimant\u2019s home, due in part to claimant's allergies. In this case, Dr. Kirven provided no such explanation and no specific recommendation for a home spa pool.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
