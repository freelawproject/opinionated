Upon finding the evidence insufficient for a finding of guilt on either count, the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>convicted Dezfuli of brandishing a firearm, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-282, as a lesser-included offense of the use of a firearm in the commission of a felony. Dezfuli alleges on appeal that the trial court erred (1) in finding that brandishing is a lesser-included offense contained within Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, and (2) in refusing to dismiss the indictment for a violation of his statutory right to a speedy trial. Because we agree that the trial court erred in finding that brandishing is a lesser-included offense contained within Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, we reverse Dezfuli\u2019s conviction for brandishing. Thus, we do not address Dezfuli\u2019s second assignment of error regarding his right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">On the morning of January 30, 2009, Dezfuli\u2019s brother Morteza Ghalambor (\u201cMort\u201d) was pulling his car out of his two-car garage, when he noticed Dezfuli standing nearby with a handgun pointed at Mort \u201calmost to [Mort\u2019s] head.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mort also noticed a rental car parked \u201cnot straight but sideways\u201d where the other garage door was shut. Mort, who was \u201cterrified\u201d and \u201cshocked,\u201d grabbed his own handgun from the passenger\u2019s seat. When Dezfuli reached out to open the car door, Mort pushed the door toward Dezfuli, which caused Dezfuli to lose his balance. Mort then jumped out of the car and moved toward Dezfuli \u201cto defend [himself].\u201d The two men struggled as Mort attempted to take the gun from Dezfuli. Mort implored Dezfuli to \u201cjust calm down, let\u2019s talk.\u201d At some point, Dezfuli struck Mort so hard with the handgun that Mort started bleeding profusely. The impact was so hard that Mort \u201csaw a flash and thought maybe the gun went off.\u201d At that point, Mort \u201clost control a couple of times and then [Dezfuli] pointed the gun\u201d at Mort and attempted to fire it. The gun did not fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>Mort, who was by now \u201csoaked with blood,\u201d continued trying to defuse the situation and take the gun from Dezfuli. Mort ultimately prevailed and \u201cgot the gun from out of [Dezfuli\u2019s] hand.\u201d Dezfuli then \u201cseemed lost\u201d and started walking around in front of the garage. Mort said, \u201cjust calm down,\u201d and asked Dezfuli to go inside the house with him to \u201cjust sit down and talk.\u201d Mort walked to the front of the house and entered through the front door. He immediately ran to the back door, exited, and ran to the next-door neighbor\u2019s house. After asking the neighbor to call the police, Mort returned to his own house. Dezfuli was gone.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">A Fairfax County magistrate issued arrest warrants on January 30, 2009, charging Dezfuli with malicious wounding and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony. Dezfuli was arrested later that day. The Fairfax County Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court held a preliminary hearing on March 27, 2009, and certified both charges to the grand jury. On April 6, 2009, the grand jury issued a two-count indictment charging that Dezfuli \u201cdid feloniously and maliciously shoot [Mort], with the intent to maim, disfigure, disable or kill\u201d (Count I) and that he \u201cfeloniously [used] a firearm while committing the maiming of\u2019 Mort (Count II). The case was originally scheduled for trial on May 11, 2009, but the court thereafter rescheduled it for July 13, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">On July 13, 2009, the parties appeared in court as scheduled and the prosecution moved, over Dezfuli\u2019s objection, to amend the indictment since the evidence failed to show that Dezfuli shot Mort. The trial court denied the motion to amend the indictment, in large part, because it believed \u201cthat [Dezfuli] needs to be fully informed of the nature and character of the accusation and this is a material change.\u201d In response, the prosecution sought a continuance. Dezfuli again objected, asserting he had already been in jail since January, and arguing he was being \u201cpunished by a continuance by the fact that he will remain incarcerated and that\u2019s unfair to him.\u201d The trial court agreed with Dezfuli and denied the request for a continuance \u201cin light of the fact that [Dezfuli] has been in jail since January and that this should have been discovered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>way before then.\u201d The prosecutor, therefore, moved, again over Dezfuli\u2019s objection, to <em>nolle prosequi </em>the case. The trial court granted this motion, finding \u201calthough there was some sloppiness here in failing to amend on a timely basis, I don\u2019t find that there was any bad faith on the part of the Commonwealth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">On July 20, 2009, the grand jury handed down a new indictment for malicious wounding (Count I) and use of a firearm in the commission of malicious wounding (Count II). On August 23, 2009, Dezfuli, who was still in jail, filed a notice and motion to dismiss the indictment against him for \u201cviolation of his speedy trial rights under Va.Code \u00a7 19.2-243, or in the alternative because there was no good cause shown to grant the nolle prosequi on July 13, 2009, under [\u00a7 ]19.2-265.3.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court denied his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Trial commenced on September 9, 2009. Upon the conclusion of the evidence, the trial court found Dezfuli not guilty of malicious wounding and use of a firearm in the commission of malicious wounding. However, the trial court found Dezfuli guilty of brandishing a firearm, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-282, as a lesser-included offense under Count II. The court scheduled a sentencing hearing for September 18, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">On September 17, 2009, Dezfuli filed a notice and motion to set aside the verdict, along with his supporting memorandum. He argued the merits of his motion at the sentencing hearing on September 18, 2009. The trial court first denied Dezfuli\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict, and then sentenced Dezfuli to serve 365 days in jail for brandishing a firearm, with 364 days suspended. The court entered its order memorializing Dezfuli\u2019s sentence on October 16, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">On October 30, 2009, Dezfuli filed a motion to reconsider the sentence imposed. The trial court, by final order dated December 11, 2009, \u201cafter a full consideration of the matter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>denied the motion, without oral hearing, as no relevant matters were raised that had not been previously considered by this Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Dezfuli noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">II. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Dezfuli argues on appeal that the trial court erred in finding him guilty of brandishing a firearm, a crime for which he was never charged, as a lesser-included offense of use of a firearm in the commission of a felony. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">As Dezfuli correctly notes, \u201c \u2018an accused cannot be convicted of a crime that has not been charged, unless the crime is a lesser-included offense of the crime charged.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bowden v. Commonwealth, </em>52 Va.App. 673, 675-76, 667 S.E.2d 27, 28 (2008) (quoting <em>Commonwealth v. Dalton, </em>259 Va. 249, 253, 524 S.E.2d 860, 862 (2000)). \u201cA lesser-included offense is an offense which is composed entirely of elements that are also elements of the greater offense.\u201d <em>Kauffmann v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 400, 409, 382 S.E.2d 279, 283 (1989). \u201cThus, in order for one crime to be a lesser included offense of another crime, every commission of the greater offense must also be a commission of the lesser offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That is, \u201cproof of the greater offense necessarily proves the lesser.\u201d <em>Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 37, 39, 434 S.E.2d 914, 915 (1993). \u201c[A]n offense is not a lesser-included offense if it contains an element that the charged offense does not contain.\u201d <em>Dalton, </em>259 Va. at 253, 524 S.E.2d at 862.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">In deciding whether two offenses are sufficiently distinguishable from one another so as to constitute two separate crimes, courts apply the test established in <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932). <em>See Schwartz v. Commonwealth, </em>45 Va.App. 407, 440-41, 611 S.E.2d 631, 648 (2005). The <em>Blockburger </em>test \u201cemphasizes the elements of the two crimes.\u201d <em>Brown v. Ohio, </em>432 U.S. 161, 166, 97 S.Ct. 2221, 2226, 53 L.Ed.2d 187 (1977). \u201cIf each [crime] requires proof of a fact that the other does not,\u201d the test is satisfied, and the offenses are different \u201cnotwith<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>standing a substantial overlap in the proof offered to establish the crimes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). \u201cIf not, [the crimes] are the same....\u201d <em>Schwartz, </em>45 Va.App. at 441, 611 S.E.2d at 648 (alteration in original) (citation omitted). In other words, if it is possible to commit each of the offenses without also committing the other, then the two offenses are different. <em>See Morris v. Commonwealth, </em>45 Va.App. 181, 189, 609 S.E.2d 92, 96 (2005) (finding that brandishing is not a lesser-included offense of robbery because \u201cit is clear that robbery can be committed without brandishing <em>and </em>brandishing can be committed without the taking of property\u201d (emphasis added)). \u201cWhen determining whether each offense requires proof of a fact which the other does not, we examine the offenses in the abstract, rather than with reference to the facts of the particular case under review.\u201d <em>Bowden, </em>52 Va.App. at 676, 667 S.E.2d at 28 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The trial court found that the evidence presented in this case was insufficient for a conviction on the charge of use of a firearm in the commission of a felony, primarily because the evidence failed to prove Dezfuli committed the underlying felony. The trial court, nevertheless, convicted Dezfuli of brandishing a firearm, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-282. Since Dezfuli was never actually charged with brandishing a firearm, the pertinent query for this Court under <em>Blockburger </em>is simply whether or not a conviction for each offense requires proof of a fact that the other does not.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, makes it \u201cunlawful for any person to use or attempt to use ... any firearm or display such weapon in a threatening manner while committing or attempting to commit\u201d certain enumerated felonies. Thus, in its prosecution under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, the Commonwealth was required to prove four basic elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">(1) that [Dezfuli] \u201cpossessed\u201d an object; (2) that this object was a ... \u201cfirearm\u201d; (3) that [Dezfuli] \u201cused or attempted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>to use the firearm <em>or </em>displayed the firearm in a threatening manner\u201d; and (4) that this action involving the firearm occurred during the commission or attempt to commit one of the felonies enumerated in the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-5\"><em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 681, 684-85, 492 S.E.2d 460, 462 (1997) (emphasis added). A violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 is a felony offense. \u201cThe purpose of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 is to deter violent criminal conduct.\u201d <em>Rose v. Commonwealth, </em>53 Va.App. 505, 512, 673 S.E.2d 489, 492 (2009) (citation omitted). \u201cThe statute is aimed at preventing actual physical injury and also to discourage criminal conduct that produces fear of physical harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Notably, \u201cCode \u00a7 18.2-53.1 is written in the disjunctive, prohibiting either the actual use of a firearm, <em>or </em>the display of a firearm in a threatening manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 513-14, 673 S.E.2d at 493 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-282, on the other hand, \u201cmakes it a Class 1 misdemeanor to point, hold, or brandish a firearm in such manner as to reasonably induce fear in the mind of another.\u201d <em>Morris v. Commonwealth, </em>269 Va. 127, 129, 607 S.E.2d 110, 111 (2005). A conviction for brandishing, thus, requires proof of two basic elements: \u201c(1) pointing or brandishing a firearm, and (2) doing so in such a manner as to reasonably induce fear in the mind of a victim.\u201d <em>Kelsoe v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 197, 198, 308 S.E.2d 104, 104 (1983). \u201c \u2018Brandish\u2019 means \u2018to exhibit or expose in an ostentatious, shameless, or aggressive manner.\u2019 \u201d <em>Morris, </em>269 Va. at 135, 607 S.E.2d at 114 (quoting <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>268 (1993)). And \u201c[t]his Court has held, in connection with robbery, that \u2018the word \u201cfear\u201d ... does not so much mean \u201cfright\u201d as it means \u201capprehension\u201d; one too brave to be <em>frightened </em>may yet be apprehensive of bodily harm.\u2019 \u201d <em>Huffman v. Commonwealth, </em>51 Va.App. 469, 472, 658 S.E.2d 713, 714 (2008) (emphasis in original) (quoting <em>Seaton v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 739, 749, 595 S.E.2d 9, 14 (2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">A review of the elements of each offense at issue in this case suggests that brandishing under Code \u00a7 18.2-282 is <em>not </em>a lesser-included offense of use of a firearm in the commission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>a felony under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. Viewed in the abstract, these code sections each require proof of a fact that the other does not. Indeed, the offense of using a firearm in the commission of a felony requires proof that the defendant either \u201cused or attempted to use\u201d a firearm, or that he \u201cdisplayed a firearm in a threatening manner\u201d during the commission or attempt to commit one of the felonies enumerated in the statute. <em>Thomas, </em>25 Va.App. at 684, 492 S.E.2d at 462. Thus, in such cases, the Commonwealth must prove that the defendant used or threateningly displayed the firearm expressly to assist him in attempting or completing a specified underlying criminal act. Conversely, in a prosecution for the act of brandishing, the Commonwealth must merely prove that the defendant \u201cpointed, held or brandished\u201d a firearm in a manner that reasonably induced fear in the mind of some nearby person.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The Commonwealth argues that the phrase \u201cin a threatening manner,\u201d found in Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, is essentially synonymous with the phrase \u201cin such manner as to reasonably induce fear in the mind of another,\u201d found in Code \u00a7 18.2-282. We disagree. The word \u201cthreaten\u201d means \u201cto utter threats against: promise punishment, reprisal, or other distress to,\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s supra, </em>at 2382, whereas the word \u201cinduce\u201d means \u201cto move and lead; to bring in; or to bring on or bring about: effect, cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1154. Thus, in cases involving the threatening display of a firearm under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, the defendant must display his firearm to \u201cpromise punishment, reprisal or other distress to\u201d the victim, whereas in cases involving brandishing under Code \u00a7 18.2-282, the defendant must merely brandish or display a firearm in such a manner as to reasonably \u201cbring about or cause fear\u201d in the mind of the victim. While the concepts are concededly similar, they are not the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">True, it <em>is </em>possible to brandish a firearm during a violation for Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1; in fact, brandishing often <em>does </em>occur when one uses or displays a firearm in the commission of a felony. <em>See Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 148, 116 S.Ct. 501, 508, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995) (\u201cThe active-employment understanding of \u2018use\u2019 certainly <em>includes </em>brandishing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>displaying ... and most obviously, firing or attempting to fire a firearm.\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>see also Holloman v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 196, 198, 269 S.E.2d 356, 358 (1980) (A victim \u201ccannot be required to distinguish between a loaded pistol and a spring gun when it is <em>brandished </em>during commission of a felony.\u201d (emphasis added)). In fact, arguably, <em>any time </em>a criminal defendant displays his firearm in a threatening manner toward a victim, he necessarily brandishes it.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">Nevertheless, the prosecution is not required to prove a criminal defendant actually brandished his firearm in order to obtain a conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. Again, \u201cCode \u00a7 18.2-53.1 is written in the disjunctive, prohibiting either the actual use of a firearm, <em>or </em>the display of a firearm in a threatening manner.\u201d <em>Rose, </em>53 Va.App. at 513-14, 673 S.E.2d at 493 (emphasis in original). Thus, the Commonwealth can obtain a conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 if it proves the defendant \u201cused or attempted to use\u201d his firearm, even in the absence of evidence that the defendant brandished it. <em>See, e.g., Rose, </em>53 Va.App. at 508, 673 S.E.2d at 490 (conviction for use of a firearm affirmed where the victim \u201cnever saw the pistol during this encounter\u201d); <em>Gaines v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 562, 565, 574 S.E.2d 775, 776 (2003) (en banc) (conviction for use of a firearm affirmed where \u201cthe defendant shot the victim in his back at a distance of 98 feet\u201d); <em>McBride v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 603, 605, 484 S.E.2d 165, 166 (1997) (conviction for use of a firearm affirmed where the victim \u201ctestified that he never saw the gun\u201d). The prosecution is, likewise, not required to prove the defendant displayed his firearm \u201cin a threatening manner\u201d to obtain a conviction for brandishing a firearm under Code \u00a7 18.2-282. <em>See Huffman, </em>51 Va.App. at 471-72, 658 S.E.2d at 713-14 (Huffman\u2019s conviction for brandishing a firearm affirmed where the evidence proved the victim merely observed Huffman \u201cwaving a handgun around in the air\u201d and asked him to \u201cput the gun away.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">The requirements of <em>Blockburger </em>are, therefore, not satisfied in this case, because the Commonwealth can obtain a conviction for use of a firearm during the commission of a felony without proof that the defendant brandished the fire<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>arm, and it can obtain a conviction for brandishing without also proving use of the firearm in the commission of a felony. <em>See Coleman v. Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 196, 200-01, 539 S.E.2d 732, 734 (2001) (\u201cNoting the use of the disjunctive \u2018or\u2019 in the [malicious wounding] statute, we agree with the Commonwealth that a malicious wounding charge does not require proof of the specific intent to kill [whereas attempted murder does require proof of such intent]. Thus, each of the convictions involved in this appeal contains required elements of proof not contained in the other conviction as required in the <em>Blockburger </em>test.\u201d); <em>Schwartz, </em>45 Va.App. at 442, 611 S.E.2d at 649 (rejecting double jeopardy argument because \u201cone of the two alternative means of establishing appellant\u2019s guilt\u201d could have been the basis for the conviction). Although the evidence presented to prove the former offense may, indeed, overlap with the evidence used to prove the latter, the fact remains that the Commonwealth must submit proof of completely different elements for a finding of guilt as to each separate offense. These offenses are, therefore, different for purposes of <em>Blockburger.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">It follows that, because it is possible to commit a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 without brandishing a firearm, and because one can brandish a firearm without also committing a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, the act of brandishing is not a lesser-included offense of use of a firearm in the commission of a felony. The offenses are not the same. The trial court, therefore, erred in convicting Dezfuli of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-282. Because we reverse Dezfuli\u2019s conviction for brandishing a firearm, we do not address Dezfuli\u2019s second assignment of error regarding his statutory right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">III. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold the trial court erred in finding that brandishing is a lesser-included offense of use of a firearm in the commission of a felony. We, thus, reverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>Dezfuli\u2019s conviction for that offense and vacate the judgment of conviction for brandishing a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">\n<em>Reversed and vacated.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b50-6\">.
