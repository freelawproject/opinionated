After granting his petition for appeal, a divided panel of this Court affirmed his convictions. <em>See Quarles v. Commonwealth, </em>No.1988-09-2, 2010 WL 3119283, at *2-3, 2010 Va.App. LEXIS 326, at *7 (Va.Ct.App. Aug. 10, 2010). Quarles\u2019 petition for <em>en banc </em>review by this Court was then granted. Quarles argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress incriminating statements he made to the police during a custodial interrogation. Relying on <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), and its progeny, Quarles argues that a police detective impermissibly reinitiated communication with him after he invoked his right to counsel. We agree and hold that the police detective impermissibly reinitiated communication with Quarles after Quarles unequivocally requested the assistance of counsel. Accordingly, Quarles\u2019 subsequent waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights was not voluntary, and his subsequent incriminating statements were inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">On October 21, 2008, Quarles and an eleven-year-old boy (co-defendant) were arrested for robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery. The pair were transported to the police station, where they were separated. Officer Papeo stayed with Quarles in the main detectives\u2019 office, where he informed Quarles of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Quarles signed the waiver of rights form, but informed Officer Papeo that he wanted to speak to an attorney. Meanwhile, Detective Alston spoke with co-defendant for approximately forty-five minutes, during which time co-defendant confessed that he and Quarles had planned to \u201crob a white lady or white people in the YCU area\u201d and that they had robbed the victim, whom co-defendant described as a \u201cwhite lady.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">After obtaining co-defendant\u2019s confession, Detective Alston joined Officer Papeo and Quarles in the detectives\u2019 office. Officer Papeo gave Detective Alston Quarles\u2019 signed waiver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>form and informed Detective Alston that Quarles had invoked his right to counsel. Detective Alston then stated, \u201c[Tjhat\u2019s f\u00edne if he doesn\u2019t want to talk to me. I wasn\u2019t the person that robbed a white lady and hit her in the head with a brick. If that\u2019s the story you want to tell the judge[,] that\u2019s f\u00edne.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Immediately after this exchange, Quarles told the officers that he wished to talk to them. Detective Alston responded, \u201cNo, that\u2019s fine, you don\u2019t have to talk to me, I\u2019m good.\u201d Quarles then again stated that he wanted to talk to them. Detective Alston informed Quarles that he must sign another waiver of rights form and that he must write on it that he wished to speak to the detectives. Quarles signed the form and wrote on the back that he had asked for an attorney, but had changed his mind and wished to speak to Detective Alston. Quarles subsequently admitted that he and co-defendant decided to \u201crob a white lady in the VCU area,\u201d he gave co-defendant a knife, and he armed himself with a brick wrapped in a shirt. He stated that he hit the victim on the side of the head with the brick. The victim resisted, and Quarles and co-defendant fled the scene. Thereafter, the police arrested Quarles and co-defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Prior to trial, Quarles moved to suppress the statements he made after he waived his right to counsel the second time. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>During Quarles\u2019 motion to suppress, Detective Alston stated on cross-examination that because Quarles was in the room, his statement regarding Quarles\u2019 decision not to talk was directed at Quarles, as well as Officer Papeo. Detective Alston further testified that he referred to the victim as a \u201cwhite lady\u201d because co-defendant used that expression during his confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">The trial court denied Quarles\u2019 motion to suppress, finding that Detective Alston made his statement to Officer Papeo alone and that even if Detective Alston made his statement to Quarles, the statement \u201cwas not a reinitiation, and it was not a functional equivalent of interrogation.\u201d The trial court further found that after invoking his right to counsel, Quarles reinitiated the conversation with Detective Alston and made a knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Quarles was subsequently convicted of robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">\u201cIn reviewing a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, \u2018[t]he burden is upon [the defendant] to show that the ruling, when th[e] evidence is considered most favorably to the Commonwealth, constituted reversible error.\u2019 \u201d <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 197, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting <em>Fore v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 1007, 1010, 265 S.E.2d 729, 731 (1980)). In addition,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-8\">[w]e review the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact only for clear error. <em>See Shears v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 394, 398, 477 S.E.2d 309, 311 (1996). However, we review <em>de novo </em>the trial court\u2019s application of defined legal standards to the particular facts of a case. <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 697 [116 S.Ct. 1657, 1662, 134 L.Ed.2d 911] (1996).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-9\"><em>Ferguson v. Commonwealth, </em>52 Va.App. 324, 334, 663 S.E.2d 505, 510 (2008) <em>(en </em>banc), <em>aff'd, </em>278 Va. 118, 677 S.E.2d 45 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>The Fifth Amendment provides that \u201c[n]o person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself....\u201d U.S. Const, amend. V. To guard against potential compulsion, the United States Supreme Court announced a number of rights to protect the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, including the right to have an attorney present during custodial interrogation. <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 469-73, 86 S.Ct. at 1625-27. Under <em>Miranda, </em>\u201c[i]f [the accused] states that he wants an attorney, the interrogation must cease until an attorney is present.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 473-74, 86 S.Ct. at 1627-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">In addition, \u201can accused, ... having expressed his desire to deal with the police only through counsel, is not subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him, unless the accused himself initiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations with the police.\u201d <em>Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 484-85, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 1885, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981). Therefore, \u201cwhen an accused has invoked his right to have counsel present during custodial interrogation, a valid waiver of that right cannot be established by showing only that he responded to further police-initiated custodial interrogation even if he has been advised of his rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 484, 101 S.Ct. at 1884-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Over time, what facts or circumstances amount to a constitutional violation have become more difficult to define. This Court in <em>Ferguson, </em>52 Va.App. 324, 663 S.E.2d 505, provided a three-part analysis to determine the admissibility of a suspect\u2019s statement under <em>Edwards: </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>52 Va.App. at 335-36, 663 S.E.2d at 510 (citing <em>Giles v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 527, 532, 507 S.E.2d 102, 105 (1998)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>First, the trial court must determine whether the accused \u201cunequivocally\u201d invoked his or her right to counsel. Second, the trial court must determine whether the accused, rather than the authorities, initiated further discussions or meetings with the police. Third, if the accused did initiate further discussions or conversations with police, the trial court must then ascertain whether the accused knowingly and intelligently waived the previously invoked right to counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>This prophylactic rule reflects \u201c[t]he underlying concern of <em>Miranda, Edwards, </em>and their progeny[:] the coercive atmosphere of custodial interrogation and the state of mind of the suspect.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Gregory, </em>263 Va. 134, 147, 557 S.E.2d 715, 722 (2002). The protections provided by <em>Miranda</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-6\">to counteract the \u201cinherently compelling pressures\u201d of custodial interrogation and to \u201cpermit a full opportunity to exercise the privilege against self-incrimination,\u201d are implemented by the application of the <em>Edwards </em>corollary that if a suspect believes that he is not capable of undergoing such questioning without advice of counsel, then it is presumed that any subsequent waiver that has come at the authorities\u2019 behest, and not at the suspect\u2019s own instigation, is itself the product of the \u201cinherently compelling pressures\u201d and not the purely voluntary choice of the suspect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-7\"><em>Arizona v. Roberson, </em>486 U.S. 675, 681, 108 S.Ct. 2093, 2097-98, 100 L.Ed.2d 704 (1988) (quoting <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 467, 86 S.Ct. at 1624). Moreover, in a custodial setting, the use of ploys and other techniques of persuasion, no less than express questioning, may amount to interrogation. <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 299, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 1688-89, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">In this case, it is undisputed that Quarles unequivocally invoked his right to counsel when he was alone in the detectives\u2019 office with Officer Papeo. Our inquiry thus turns to whether Detective Alston engaged in an impermissible interrogation of Quarles after Quarles invoked his constitutional rights. <em>See Edwards, </em>451 U.S. at 484-85, 101 S.Ct. at 1884-85; <em>Ferguson, </em>52 Va.App. at 335-36, 663 S.E.2d at 510.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AK\">[T]he term \u201cinterrogation\u201d under <em>Miranda </em>refers not only to express questioning, but also to any words or actions on the part of the police ... that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>the suspect. The latter portion of this definition focuses primarily upon the perceptions of the suspect, rather than the intent of the police. This focus reflects the fact that the <em>Miranda </em>safeguards were designed to vest a suspect in custody with an added measure of protection against coercive police practices, without regard to objective proof of the underlying intent of the police. A practice that the police should know is reasonably likely to evoke an incriminating response from a suspect thus amounts to interrogation. But, since the police surely cannot be held accountable for the unforeseeable results of their words or actions, the definition of interrogation can extend only to words or actions on the part of police officers that they should have known were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-5\"><em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 301-02, 100 S.Ct. at 1689-90 (footnotes omitted). \u201cIf a [suspect\u2019s] statement is \u2018not foreseeable, then it is volunteered.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gates v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 352, 356, 516 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1999) (quoting <em>Blain v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 10, 15, 371 S.E.2d 838, 841 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Furthermore, when determining whether the foreseeable response is incriminating, \u201c \u2018no distinction may be drawn between inculpatory statements and statements alleged to be merely exculpatory.\u2019 \u201d <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 301 n. 5, 100 S.Ct. at 1690 n. 5 (quoting <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 477, 86 S.Ct. at 1629). This protective measure reflects the reality that \u201c \u2018statements merely intended to be exculpatory by the defendant are often used to impeach his testimony at trial or to demonstrate untruths in the statement given under interrogation and thus to prove guilt by implication.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 477, 86 S.Ct. at 1629). As such, if a police officer should have known that his words were reasonably likely to elicit an attempt by a defendant to exculpate himself, those words constitute an interrogation. <em>See id. </em>at 301, 100 S.Ct. at 1689-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Based on these principles, we \u201cfocus[ ] primarily upon the perceptions of the suspect,\u201d <em>id., </em>and determine, in this case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>whether Detective Alston\u2019s words or actions constituted a coercive pressure \u201cabove and beyond that inherent in custody itself,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 300, 100 S.Ct. at 1689.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Essentially, the Commonwealth argues on appeal that Detective Alston\u2019s comment was, like the comments in <em>Innis, </em>simply an exchange of words between the officers, and thus should not be deemed a reinitiation of communication with Quarles. The salient facts in <em>Innis </em>are significant. In <em>Innis, </em>police officers were transporting Innis, a murder suspect, to the police station. <em>Id. </em>at 294, 100 S.Ct. at 1686. During a conversation <em>between the officers </em>en route, one officer expressed concern about the location of a missing firearm used in the crime because the crime had occurred near a school for handicapped children. <em>Id. </em>at 294-95, 100 S.Ct. at 1686-87. He said, \u201cGod forbid one of them might find the weapon with shells and they might hurt themselves.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Innis then interrupted the officers and offered to show them the location of the firearm. <em>Id. </em>at 295, 100 S.Ct. at 1686-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">The Supreme Court held that the conversation between the officers included no express questioning of Innis, but \u201c[rjather, that conversation was, at least in form, nothing more than a dialogue between the two officers to which no response from the respondent was invited.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 302, 100 S.Ct. at 1690. Because no response from Innis was invited, the Supreme Court found that the officers\u2019 conversation could be considered no more than \u201csubtle compulsion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 303, 100 S.Ct. at 1691. The Supreme Court stated that it was error to equate such \u201c \u2018subtle compulsion\u2019 with interrogation.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court held that because the officers should not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>known that their conversation was reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from Innis, the officers did not functionally interrogate him. <em>Id. </em>at 303, 100 S.Ct. at 1690-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Detective Alston\u2019s statement is distinguishable from those in <em>Innis. </em>First, on its face, it was nominally directed at Quarles, as evidenced by Detective Alston\u2019s use of the pronoun \u201cyou.\u201d If Detective Alston was directing his comment solely at Officer Papeo, he would have chosen the pronoun \u201che,\u201d rather than \u201cyou,\u201d when he said, \u201cIf that\u2019s the story you want to tell the judge[,] that\u2019s fine.\u201d Furthermore, at the motion to suppress hearing, Detective Alston acknowledged that he directed his statement, at least in part, to Quarles. In this way, Detective Alston\u2019s comment was not part of a simple \u201cdialogue between the two officers\u201d like the exchange between the officers in <em>Innis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Second, when Detective Alston spoke to Quarles, he effectively informed Quarles of the evidence against him, using the specific terminology provided by Quarles\u2019 co-defendant. The detective identified the victim in the case as a \u201cwhite lady\u201d after hearing co-defendant confess that Quarles and co-defendant\u2019s plan was to \u201crob a white lady or white people in the VCU area.\u201d In <em>Miranda, </em>the Supreme Court in dicta disapproved of police departments\u2019 use of \u201clineups in which a coached witness would pick the defendant as the perpetrator.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 299, 100 S.Ct. at 1689 (citing <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 453, 86 S.Ct. at 1616-17). The <em>Innis </em>Court recognized that this practice \u201cwas designed to establish that the defendant was in fact guilty as a predicate for further interrogation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 453, 86 S.Ct. at 1616-17). The detective\u2019s words in the instant case had a remarkably similar effect. They amounted to a specific warning to Quarles that co-defendant had implicated Quarles in the robbery and the conspiracy to rob the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">The second half of Detective Alston\u2019s statement, \u201cIf that\u2019s the story you want to tell the judge[,] that\u2019s fine,\u201d challenged Quarles\u2019 ability to exculpate himself. The detective\u2019s statement was tantamount to a veiled threat signaling to Quarles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>that unless he made a statement to the officers, the judge would look unfavorably upon Quarles, based on co-defendant\u2019s confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Clearly, Detective\u2019s Alston\u2019s words rise above the mere \u201csubtle compulsion\u201d contemplated by the Supreme Court in tais. When we consider Detective Alston\u2019s statements from Quarles\u2019 perspective, we conclude Detective Alston should have known that his pointed criticism of Quarles\u2019 defense was reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response. The legal significance of Detective Alston\u2019s unsolicited statements to Quarles can be resolved by consideration of analogous circumstances addressed by this Court sitting <em>en banc </em>in <em>Ferguson, </em>52 Va.App. 324, 663 S.E.2d 505. In that case, after the defendant clearly invoked his right to counsel twice, the investigating officer continued to speak to the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 331, 663 S.E.2d at 508. This Court found that the officer\u2019s subsequent questioning was designed to elicit an incriminating response, when the officer informed the defendant that there was eyewitness testimony placing the defendant\u2019s vehicle at the scene of the crime, told the defendant that \u201cthe only hope\u201d for the defendant was to tell his side of the story, and questioned whether the defendant\u2019s alibi would withstand scrutiny. <em>Id. </em>at 341, 663 S.E.2d at 513. Similarly, Detective Alston informed Quarles of co-defendant\u2019s inculpatory statement and also suggested that Quarles would have no defense to present to the judge at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Given the content and context of Detective Alston\u2019s statement, the trial court erred in holding that his comment was not the functional equivalent of interrogation and that Quarles reinitiated communication by asserting his wish to talk.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-7\">Once an accused asserts his or her right to counsel, subsequent waiver of that right is not sufficient to make admissible any incriminating statements thereafter obtained, even if investigators have re-Mirandized the accused, unless the statements are initiated by the defendant and shown to be based on a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXX\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number><em>Giles, </em>28 Va.App. at 531, 507 S.E.2d at 105. Since Detective Alston reinitiated communication with Quarles after Quarles\u2019 assertion of his right to the assistance of counsel, Quarles\u2019 subsequent waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights was not voluntary. <em>Id. </em>Thus, his subsequent incriminating statements were inadmissible. It follows that the motion to suppress should have been granted and that the trial court\u2019s denial of that motion was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">We hold that the trial court erred in denying Quarles\u2019 motion to suppress the statements he made to the officers. Accordingly, we reverse Quarles\u2019 convictions and remand the case for a new trial if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b64-6\">. At the hearing on the motion to suppress, this statement was introduced through Detective Alston\u2019s testimony, rather than through an audio or video recording. Although the detective initially testified that he used the pronoun \"he\u201d rather than \"you,\u201d the detective later acknowledged in response to questioning from both defense counsel and the prosecutor that he said, \"If that\u2019s the story you want to tell the judge that's fine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">In making its ruling on the motion to suppress, the trial court found that Detective Alston said, \u201d[I]f that is what he wants to tell the judge!,] that\u2019s fine.\u201d On brief, the Commonwealth states that Detective Alston used the pronoun \"you,\u201d as opposed to \"he,\u201d as the trial court found. The Commonwealth also adopted this position before the panel of this Court. As such, the Commonwealth implicitly concedes that the trial court\u2019s finding regarding Detective Alston\u2019s use of the pronoun \"he\u201d was plainly wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we reject the trial court\u2019s finding that Detective Alston used the pronoun \"he.\u201d <em>See Shears v. Commonwealth, 23 </em>Va.App. 394, 398, 477 S.E.2d 309, 311 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b69-7\">.

While the majority certainly gives due attention to the <em>language </em>in <em>Innis </em>setting forth the meaning of \u201cinterrogation,\u201d I believe the majority fails to give proper weight to the <em>holding </em>of <em>Innis </em>on its specific <em>facts. </em>To me, the answer to the question before us is straightforward\u2014if the statements of the officers in <em>Innis </em>did not constitute \u201cinterrogation,\u201d neither did the statements of Detective Alston.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">At the outset, I do not take issue with the majority\u2019s general discussion of the scope of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), and <em>Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981). However, I also remain mindful that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-10\">Suppression of evidence ... has always been our last resort, not our first impulse. The exclusionary rule generates \u201csubstantial social costs,\u201d which sometimes include setting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>the guilty free and the dangerous at large. [The United States Supreme Court has] therefore been \u201ceautio[us] against expanding\u201d it, and \u201c[has] repeatedly emphasized that the rule\u2019s \u2018costly toll\u2019 upon truth-seeking and law enforcement objectives presents a high obstacle for those urging [its] application.\u201d [The Court has] rejected \u201c[indiscriminate application\u201d of the rule, and [has] held it to be applicable only \u201cwhere its remedial objectives are thought most efficaciously served\u201d\u2014that is, \u201cwhere its deterrence benefits outweigh its \u2018substantial social costs.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-4\"><em>Hudson v. Michigan, </em>547 U.S. 586, 591, 126 S.Ct. 2159, 2163, 165 L.Ed.2d 56 (2006) (some alterations in original) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">As the majority notes, the United States Supreme Court has defined \u201cinterrogation\u201d for purposes of <em>Miranda </em>as referring \u201cnot only to express questioning, but also to any words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\u201d <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 301, 100 S.Ct. at 1689-90 (footnote omitted). In keeping with the Supreme Court\u2019s direction that \u201c[t]he latter portion of this definition focuses primarily upon the perceptions of the suspect, rather than the intent of the police,\u201d <em>id., </em>we have previously held that \u201c \u2018the <em>Innis </em>standard ... requires] a determination of whether an objective observer would view an officer\u2019s words or actions as designed to elicit an incriminating response,\u2019 \u201d <em>Timbers v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 187, 196, 503 S.E.2d 233, 237 (1998) (quoting <em>Blain v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 10, 15, 371 S.E.2d 838, 841 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Importantly, however, the Supreme Court in <em>Innis </em>also stated that \u201csubtle compulsion\u201d is not sufficient to constitute \u201cinterrogation\u201d as the Court defined that term. <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 303, 100 S.Ct. at 1691. According to the Court, \u201csubtle compulsion\u201d does not, as a matter of law, rise to the level of \u201cwords or actions on the part of the police that they should have known were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Arizona v. Mauro, </em>481 U.S. 520, 529, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>107 S.Ct. 1931, 1936, 95 L.Ed.2d 458 (1987) (recognizing <em>Innis\u2019 </em>holding that \u201csubtle compulsion\u201d is not interrogation). \u201cOfficers do not interrogate a suspect simply by hoping that he will incriminate himself.\u201d <em>Mauro, </em>481 U.S. at 529, 107 S.Ct. at 1936. Thus, even were we to assume that Detective Alston personally <em>hoped </em>that some sort of \u201csubtle compulsion\u201d would induce Quarles to incriminate himself, the Supreme Court has already told us such behavior is <em>not </em>sufficient to constitute interrogation. When I examine the facts and holding in <em>Innis, </em>I am convinced that whatever subtle compulsion may have been present in this case does not rise to the level of \u201cinterrogation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">In <em>Innis, </em>three police officers accompanied Innis to the police station in a police car after he had been arrested. <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 294, 100 S.Ct. at 1686. Innis was suspected of having committed murder and robbery with a shotgun. <em>See id. </em>at 293, 295, 100 S.Ct. at 1686-87. Innis did not have a shotgun with him when the police arrested him. <em>See id. </em>at 294, 100 S.Ct. at 1686. The police advised Innis of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and Innis requested an attorney. <em>Id. </em>On the way to the police station, one of the officers remarked to another officer that because of a school for handicapped children in the vicinity, \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of handicapped children running around in this area, and God forbid one of them might find a weapon with shells and they might hurt themselves.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 294-95, 100 S.Ct. at 1686. The third officer in the car testified that the first officer \u201csaid it would be too bad if the little\u2014I believe he said a girl\u2014would pick up the gun, maybe kill herself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 295, 100 S.Ct. at 1687. The conversation did not stop there\u2014the second officer was conversing with the first officer, agreeing \u201cthat it was a safety factor and that we should, you know, continue to search for the weapon and try to find it.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Upon hearing this exchange, Innis interrupted the officers\u2019 dialogue and asked them to take him back so he could show them where the gun was. <em>Id. </em>Once they arrived back at the arrest scene, Innis was again advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, but he stated that he \u201cwanted to get the gun out of the way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>because of the kids in the area in the school.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Innis then led the police to where the gun was hidden. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">On these facts, the Supreme Court held that the behavior of the police officers in the car with Innis did not constitute interrogation. <em>Id. </em>at 302-08, 100 S.Ct. at 1690-91. Although the Rhode Island Supreme Court had held that the officers\u2019 behavior was interrogation, since it constituted \u201csubtle coercion\u201d or \u201csubtle compulsion,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 296, 303, 100 S.Ct. at 1687, 1691, the United States Supreme Court said that \u201csubtle compulsion\u201d is <em>not sufficient </em>to constitute \u201cinterrogation\u201d for purposes of <em>Miranda, id. </em>at 303, 100 S.Ct. at 1691. An analysis of the Court\u2019s reasoning on the facts in <em>Innis </em>leads me to conclude that the facts in the present case are no closer to \u201cinterrogation\u201d than the facts in <em>Innis </em>were.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">In <em>Innis, </em>the Court noted that there was no \u201cexpress questioning\u201d of the defendant, and that the police officers\u2019 \u201cconversation was, at least in form, nothing more than a dialogue between the two officers to which no response from [Innis] was invited.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 302, 100 S.Ct. at 1690. Likewise, in the case before us, Detective Alston\u2019s statements did not take the form of express questions directed to Quarles. Rather, they were simply declarative statements addressed to Officer Papeo.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">While the majority interprets Detective Alston\u2019s statements as being, at least in part, addressed to Quarles, the trial court expressly found that all of Detective Alston\u2019s statements were addressed to Officer Papeo. In rejecting this factual finding, the majority ignores the totality of Detective Alston\u2019s testimony and fixes on an obvious mistake in the Commonwealth\u2019s recitation of facts in its brief. From that error, the majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>concludes, in a footnote, that \u201cthe Commonwealth implicitly concedes that the trial court\u2019s [factual] finding ... was plainly wrong.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Supra </em>at 18 n. 1, 707 S.E.2d at 9 n. 1. I suggest that the more appropriate course in reviewing factual findings of a trial court is to review the actual testimony of the witnesses who appeared at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">During his direct examination, Detective Alston unequivocally said that his statement, addressed to Officer Papeo, was, \u201c[T]hat\u2019s fine if he doesn\u2019t want to talk to me.\u201d Then, during a disjointed and admittedly confusing cross-examination, defense counsel attempted to impeach Detective Alston with a summary of the statement that the Commonwealth had included in its written response to the motion to suppress.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It was at this point that defense counsel, in his questioning, used the pronoun \u201cyou\u201d in place of \u201che.\u201d Detective Alston responded, \u201cI think what you added in is that last sentence [containing the pronoun \u2018you\u2019], and that\u2019s fine. I may have said that too. I may have added that in there. It\u2019s possible.\u201d However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>Detective Alston remained insistent throughout the direct examination, cross-examination, and re-direct examination that he was talking to Officer Papeo when he said what he did. Irrespective of the pronoun used, it is the trial court\u2019s factual finding in favor of the Commonwealth that is relevant to the analysis. Based on what I believe to be a fair reading of the entire testimony, I cannot say that this factual finding was plainly wrong. <em>See Blow v. Commonwealth, 52 </em>Va.App. 533, 542, 665 S.E.2d 254, 258 (2008) (\u201c[W]e are bound by the trial court\u2019s factual findings unless they are \u2018plainly wrong\u2019 or without evidentiary support.\u201d (quoting Code \u00a7 8.01-680)). Thus, I reject the majority\u2019s premise that this statement was directed specifically to Quarles, and I disagree with the conclusion that it was anything other than \u201ca dialogue between the two officers to which no response from [Quarles] was invited.\u201d <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 302, 100 S.Ct. at 1690.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The majority also fails to properly analyze the other factors the Court found relevant in Innis\u2014factors that I believe require a similar conclusion in this case. For instance, the Court in <em>Innis </em>concluded that the officers\u2019 behavior did not constitute the \u201c \u2018functional equivalent\u2019 of questioning,\u201d because there was no indication \u201cthat the officers were aware that [Innis] was peculiarly susceptible to an appeal to his conscience concerning the safety of handicapped children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Similarly, there is no evidence here that Detective Alston knew Quarles was \u201cpeculiarly susceptible\u201d to being confronted with the evidence against him. I cannot conclude that Quarles\u2019 asking to speak to an attorney and then remaining steadfastly silent for forty-five minutes to an hour while sitting with another police officer in a room should have led the police to think that Quarles was \u201cpeculiarly susceptible\u201d to hearing any comments from one police officer to another concerning the evidence against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Additionally, the majority attempts to distinguish <em>Innis </em>by declaring that \u201cDetective Alston should have known that his pointed criticism of Quarles\u2019 defense was reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.\u201d <em>See supra </em>at 25, 707 S.E.2d at 12. I disagree. I find no logical basis to distinguish what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>could arguably be characterized as an emotional appeal to Innis\u2019 conscience from a \u201cpointed criticism of Quarles\u2019 defense.\u201d This is simply a distinction without a difference. More to the point, however, confronting a suspect with evidence against him does not necessarily constitute interrogation under the <em>Innis </em>standard. <em>See State v. Cunningham, </em>144 Wis.2d 272, 423 N.W.2d 862, 866 (1988) (explaining that <em>Innis </em>does not dictate a per se rule \u201cthat whenever an officer confronts a suspect with incriminating physical evidence, or verbally summarizes the state\u2019s case against the suspect, the officer engages in the functional equivalent of express questioning\u201d). Rather, \u201c[ejach case must be considered upon its own facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 274, 423 N.W.3d at 862-63; <em>see also United States v. Suggs, </em>755 F.2d 1538, 1541-42 (11th Cir.1985) (holding there was no interrogation where defendant made incriminating statements upon being shown a copy of his indictment); <em>Smith v. State, </em>414 Md. 357, 995 A.2d 685, 688-89, 691-92 (2010) (holding there was no interrogation where defendant made incriminating statement after officer walked by him and showed him the cocaine the officer had just found in his bedroom); <em>People v. Benjamin, </em>101 Mich.App. 637, 300 N.W.2d 661, 663, 667 (1980) (holding there was no interrogation where defendant made incriminating statement when officer showed her the knives he found in her purse); <em>State v. Gibson, </em>228 Neb. 455, 422 N.W.2d 570, 572, 577 (1988) (holding there was no interrogation where defendant made incriminating statement when officer said, \u201cOh, look what I found,\u201d after discovering a loaded revolver); <em>State v. Grisby, </em>97 Wash.2d 493, 647 P.2d 6, 12-13 (1982) (holding there was no interrogation where defendant made incriminating statement when officer placed physical evidence within defendant\u2019s view); <em>cf. State v. Jones, </em>386 So.2d 1363, 1365, 1367 (La.1980) (holding there was no interrogation where defendant made incriminating statement regarding his murder of his infant son after officer told him, \u201cGod takes care of little babies,\u201d and said \u201cthe baby was already in heaven\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Although the majority attempts to analogize this case to <em>Ferguson v. Commonwealth, </em>52 Va.App. 324, 663 S.E.2d 505 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>(2008) (en banc), <em>aff'd, </em>278 Va. 118, 677 S.E.2d 45 (2009), the facts here are quite different from those in <em>Ferguson. </em>In <em>Ferguson, </em>a police officer spoke directly to the defendant in such an overbearing way that it was quite obvious he was trying to elicit an incriminating response. <em>See Ferguson, </em>278 Va. at 124-25, 677 S.E.2d at 48. The continued interrogation, characterized by the Supreme Court as one containing \u201cthreats and coercive techniques,\u201d included such direct statements and questions as: \u201cThe only hope you\u2019ve got right now is to come as clean as you can get,\u201d \u201cWhere was you at yesterday[?],\u201d and, \u201c[W]ho was with you yesterday?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 125, 677 S.E.2d at 48. The continued harangue in <em>Ferguson </em>stands in sharp contrast to the brief comments Detective Alston uttered to his partner, Officer Papeo.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Another factor noted by the Court in <em>Innis, </em>but overlooked by the majority here, was the lack of any evidence \u201cto suggest that the police knew that [Innis] was unusually disoriented or upset at the time of his arrest.\u201d <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 303, 100 S.Ct. at 1690. Here, there is no evidence before us suggesting that the police knew of anything that would have led them to believe Quarles was \u201cunusually disoriented or upset\u201d when Detective Alston came into the room where Quarles and Officer Papeo had been waiting.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Finally, the <em>Innis </em>Court directs us to consider the length and duration of the police officers\u2019 conversation. <em>Id. </em>If, as the Supreme Court concluded, the conversation between the police officers in the car with Innis was \u201cno more than a few offhand remarks,\u201d I fail to see how Detective Alston\u2019s brief monologue of three sentences here could qualify as anything more. In <em>Innis, </em>there was a conversation between two police officers in Innis\u2019 presence. <em>Id. </em>at 294-95, 100 S.Ct. at 1686-87. Here, there were a few short sentences spoken by one police officer to another in Quarles\u2019 presence. Surely, Detective Alston\u2019s remarks were no more provocative than those in <em>Innis. </em>Simply put, \u201c[t]his is not a case where the police carried on a lengthy harangue in the presence of the suspect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 303, 100 S.Ct. at 1691.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>The Court in <em>Innis </em>mentioned the trial judge\u2019s conclusion in that case that \u201cit was \u2018entirely understandable that [the officers] would voice their concern [for the safety of the handicapped children] to each other.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 303 n. 9, 100 S.Ct. at 1690 n. 9 (alterations in original). Likewise, I believe it was entirely understandable that an exasperated Detective Alston, upon learning that Quarles was not going to incriminate himself, would utter the kind of brief, immediate remarks that he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">If the United States Supreme Court could say\u2014and did say\u2014that the officers\u2019 conversation in <em>Innis </em>was not \u201cparticularly \u2018evocative,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 303, 100 S.Ct. at 1691, I cannot say that Detective Alston\u2019s comments here were any more \u201cevocative.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has held that a statement to the effect of, \u201cI sure hope a poor handicapped girl doesn\u2019t find that gun and shoot herself with it,\u201d is merely \u201csubtle compulsion\u201d and not \u201cinterrogation.\u201d With that comment as a measure, I fail to see how the statement here is so compulsive that it rises to the functional equivalent of an interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Accordingly, based on the facts, reasoning, and holding in <em>Innis, </em>I would affirm Quarles\u2019 convictions. Therefore, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b75-8\">. The majority proclaims that \"Detective Alston\u2019s comment was not part of a simple \u2018dialogue between the two officers\u2019 like the exchange between the officers in <em>Innis,\u201d </em>because \"Detective Alston acknowledged that he directed his statement, at least in part, to Quarles.\u201d <em>Supra </em>at 24, 707 S.E.2d at 12. In reality, what Detective Alston acknowledged was the obvious\u2014that Quarles was in the room and could hear what he said. I find this no more meaningful than the fact that Innis was in a car with three officers and could hear what they said to one another.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b76-6\">. In its brief, the Commonwealth quoted Detective Alston, using the pronoun \"you\u201d and referencing pages 30-31 and 36-37 of the appendix. However, Detective Alston never said what the Commonwealth attributed to him. On page 30, he used the pronoun \"he,\" and on pages 36-37, he denied that he made the statement defense counsel read to him. The majority seizes on this obvious mistake in the Commonwealth's brief to conclude that \"the Commonwealth implicitly concedes that the trial court\u2019s finding regarding Detective Alston\u2019s use of the pronoun 'he' was plainly wrong,\u201d and the majority therefore \"reject[s] the trial court\u2019s finding that Detective Alston used the pronoun 'he.' \u201d <em>Supra </em>at 18 n. 1, 707 S.E.2d at 9 n. 1. In doing so, the majority cites no authority for the proposition that we can disregard a trial court\u2019s express factual findings and instead adopt an \"implicit concession\u201d from a party\u2019s brief. Although the majority cites <em>Shears v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 394, 398, 477 S.E.2d 309, 311 (1996), that case says nothing about an implicit concession that a trial court was plainly wrong in its factual findings. While we certainly can rely on a party's concessions of fact, <em>Logan v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 168, 172, 622 S.E.2d 771, 773 (2005) (en banc), before we do so we should ensure that the concession was intended and not simply implied from an erroneous recitation of facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b76-7\">.

The Wisconsin Supreme Court used a similar mode of analysis in <em>Cunningham </em>on the facts before it in that case.
