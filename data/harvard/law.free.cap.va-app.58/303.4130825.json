On appeal, appellant argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions. Appellant further contends that his convictions under both statutes violate principles of double jeopardy. Finding no error, we affirm appellant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">On appeal, we view \u201cthe evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party in the circuit court, and we accord the Commonwealth the benefit of all reasonable inferences deducible from the evidence.\u201d <em>Britt v. Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 569, 573, 667 S.E.2d 763, 765 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">So viewed, the evidence indicated that on February 7, 2009, Daniel Ammons (Ammons) and Cameron James (James), two airmen in the United States Air Force, visited a McDonald\u2019s restaurant in Hampton, Virginia.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While there, they encountered a group of fifteen to twenty men, including appellant, Terry Batten, and a man known only as \u201cMike-Mike.\u201d After Ammons and James ordered their food, a few men from this group, including Mike-Mike and Batten, saw that Ammons had a red bandana visible in his back pocket and approached the airmen and asked whether they were in a gang. According to James, he replied that he was not in a gang, and the group of men making the inquiry \u201cacted just like everything was cool.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The airmen then decided to leave the restaurant. As they collected their order, exited the restaurant, and entered the parking lot, Mike-Mike and Batten followed. James heard the two men saying, \u201c[N]o, you\u2014all cool, everything\u2019s good.\u201d In response, Ammons and James turned around to face the men, one of whom reached out to shake Ammons\u2019 hand in what James described as \u201ca gang kind of handshake.\u201d Ammons was unfamiliar with this handshake and did not execute it properly. At that point most, if not all, of the group of men who had originally confronted Ammons and James in the McDonald\u2019s exited the restaurant and approached the two airmen. James could not recall specifically whether appellant was among the men who exited the McDonald\u2019s. Although James attempted to keep all of the men in his fine of sight, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>soon felt a blow to the back of his head. Subsequently, at least four or five members of the group were on top of him, hitting him from every side. At trial, James testified that he could not identify specifically who hit him. James further testified that when the beating ended, he was bleeding from his nose and had sustained a broken nose and fractured cheek as a result of this incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Thomas Nixon witnessed the attack as he was leaving a restaurant next door to the McDonald\u2019s on the evening of February 7, 2009. As he walked to his nearby car with his wife, he saw \u201ca group of probably fifteen to twenty mix[ed] age males\u201d in the McDonald\u2019s parking lot. Next, he realized that someone was being kicked, stomped, and punched and then saw the group converge on top of what looked to be one person. After someone yelled \u201c[C]ops,\u201d Nixon saw the group flee from the parking lot. At this point, Nixon rushed over to help the person who had been beaten. When he got to James, Nixon saw \u201ca very large pool of blood beside his head.\u201d Nixon also observed blood coming out of James\u2019 nose, mouth, and eye. In Nixon\u2019s view, there was \u201ca huge amount of blood for a beating,\u201d so much so that Nixon initially mistakenly believed that James had been shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">As a result of the February 7, 2009 incident, appellant was indicted on July 6, 2009, for misdemeanor assault and battery by mob, participation in a criminal street gang, felonious malicious bodily injury, and malicious bodily injury by mob.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">Tron Martinez, who was inside the McDonald\u2019s when Ammons and James entered, also saw the entire series of events. At trial, Martinez testified that, on February 7, 2009, he and a friend traveled from a party to the Wal-Mart located near the McDonald\u2019s on Mercury Boulevard, where they \u201cmet up\u201d with approximately seven to eight other men, including Batten, Tevin Terry (Terry), Curtis Scott, and appellant, whom Martinez testified he had not met before that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">Martinez then decided to go to the McDonald\u2019s, where he encountered the same group of men from the Wal-Mart, as well as approximately ten additional men. Martinez observed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>appellant sitting near the entrance of the restaurant, about thirty feet from Martinez, with Batten, Scott, Terry, and a man Martinez knew as \u201cAnt.\u201d Martinez testified that, before the airmen arrived, Terry initiated a confrontation with another patron by intentionally walking into the man. According to Martinez, Terry and appellant then followed the patron outside, and Terry cursed at the man and threw a drink at his car as he drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">Shortly thereafter, Martinez saw Ammons and James enter the restaurant. Batten asked Ammons whether the red bandana sticking out of Ammons\u2019 back pocket meant he was in a gang. According to Martinez, Ammons responded that he was \u201ctrying to get out of a gang.\u201d Appellant was sitting about fifteen feet from Batten and Ammons during this exchange. At this point, Martinez heard an unknown speaker exclaim, \u201cKnock him out, like you used to do up state.\u201d A few moments later, as Ammons and James attempted to leave the restaurant, Martinez saw Batten attempt to \u201cdap [Ammons] up,\u201d or offer him a gang handshake. Ammons failed to properly execute the handshake, after which Batten \u201cwaved [Ammons] off.\u201d Terry then stated, \u201cI\u2019m gonna [sic] hit the dude, I\u2019m gonna [sic] step on him.\u201d At trial, Martinez testified that Terry appeared \u201c[h]ot headed and ready to fight\u201d and that appellant\u2019s demeanor and \u201cswagger\u201d indicated that appellant was prepared to aid Terry.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">According to Martinez, as Ammons and James exited, \u201ceverybody\u201d got up and exited the restaurant. Terry and appellant came up behind Ammons and James. Terry struck Ammons, and appellant struck James. Next, Martinez, Batten, and Scott attacked Ammons. Martinez chased Ammons to another parking lot, and, after striking Ammons one time, Martinez returned to the McDonald\u2019s parking lot, where he saw \u201ca whole bunch of people,\u201d including appellant, standing around James, who was on the ground. Martinez estimated that only fifteen seconds elapsed between the time that appellant first struck James and the time that Martinez returned to the McDonald\u2019s parking lot to find James on the ground, surrounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>After describing the previously cited circumstances in his trial testimony, Martinez was asked about his criminal record. Martinez admitted having been charged with eleven separate felonies, some from the February 7, 2009 incident and some from a second, later incident. Martinez stated that he was currently out on bail, but not through any agreement with the Commonwealth. He also denied being offered any deals from the Commonwealth in exchange for his testimony. On cross-examination, Martinez stated that he had graduated from Hampton High School, where he had played football, and that he hoped to play football in college. In response to defense counsel\u2019s questioning about his hopes for leniency in exchange for his testimony, Martinez responded by recognizing that a felony conviction would adversely affect his college plans; however, he also stated that he appreciated that false testimony would carry negative consequences. He further stated that he had testified truthfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">At trial, Detective Earnest Corey Sales of the Hampton Police Division provided expert testimony on gang identification and ideology in the City of Hampton. Sales testified that \u201cG-checking,\u201d or the manner by which gangs identify fellow members, is the process by which a member of a gang asks another individual questions about his gang affiliation in order to \u201cweed out ... false gang members.\u201d According to Sales, if a person is \u201cflagging,\u201d or \u201cwearing a bandana [associated with the gang in his] pocket or on [his] person,\u201d it is common practice for a gang member to \u201cG-check\u201d the flagging person in order to test his knowledge of the gang. If the flagging person is unable to answer the questions posed to him, this can result in a range of repercussions, from stealing this individual\u2019s bandana to a potentially fatal \u201cbeat down.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">At the conclusion of the bench trial, the trial court found appellant guilty of felonious malicious wounding and maiming by mob and acquitted appellant of misdemeanor assault and battery by mob and participation in a criminal street gang. The trial court found, as a matter of fact, that appellant followed James out of the McDonald\u2019s and hit him. Further<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>more, the trial court found that appellant and others from the group</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-4\">bec[ame] so incensed that they did, in fact, form a mob mentality with a common plan to assault [James] and/or [Ammons]. And [they] got up from where they sat and went outside and began to accelerate the violence to an extent that resulted in [James\u2019] wounding in a malicious fashion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">With regard to appellant\u2019s conviction for malicious wounding, the trial court found that appellant was \u201cat the very least ... a principal [in the second degree].\u201d In reaching its findings, the trial court specifically found that Martinez\u2019s testimony, while somewhat self-serving, was also accurate and thus credible. In making this credibility determination, the trial court found that Martinez\u2019s \u201cdemeanor and appearance on the stand, his body language, [and] his response[s] to all the questions he was asked\u201d suggested that he was being truthful.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">After his conviction, appellant moved to dismiss one of his two convictions on the grounds that his conviction of both offenses constituted double jeopardy and thus violated his rights under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Code \u00a7 19.2-294. The trial court rejected appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss, essentially reconfirming the determination of guilt, and sentenced appellant to ten years imprisonment for each offense, to run concurrently, with four years of each offense\u2019s sentence suspended. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">A. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"A5\">\n<em>1. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">In reviewing a conviction for the sufficiency of the evidence, we ask only if \u201c \u2018after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019\u201d <em>Maxwell v. Commonwealth, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>275 Va. 437, 442, 657 S.E.2d 499, 502 (2008) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)). We \u201cwill affirm the judgment unless the judgment is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Bolden v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 144, 148, 654 S.E.2d 584, 586 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">\n<em>2. Malicious Wounding</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">On appeal, appellant first argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for malicious wounding, because the trial court erred in relying upon Martinez\u2019s testimony and because the evidence did not show that appellant\u2019s actions caused James\u2019 injuries.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We reject both of appellant\u2019s arguments and hold that the evidence was sufficient to support appellant\u2019s conviction for malicious wounding.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Appellant contends that the trial court erred in relying upon Martinez\u2019s testimony because it was inherently suspect. In support of this claim, appellant maintains that Martinez admitted to striking one of the two airmen at least once during the incident. In addition, Martinez had charges pending based on the underlying incident and a second, unrelated incident, and he faced criminal penalties and damage to his prospective college football career if convicted. The possibility of Martinez\u2019s bias was raised during both direct- and cross-examination at trial. Martinez also stated that he testified honestly in the instant case and was not offered anything in exchange for his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">\u201cThe credibility of the witnesses and the weight accorded the evidence are matters solely for the fact finder who has the opportunity to see and hear that evidence as it is presented.\u201d <em>Sandoval v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 133, 138, 455 S.E.2d 730, 732 (1995). The conclusions of the fact finder on issues of witness credibility \u201cmay only be disturbed on appeal if this Court finds that [the witness\u2019] testimony was \u2018inherently incredible, or so contrary to human experience as to render it unworthy of belief.\u2019 \u201d <em>Robertson v. Commontoealth, </em>12 Va.App. 854, 858, 406 S.E.2d 417, 419 (1991) (quoting <em>Fisher v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 296, 299-300, 321 S.E.2d 202, 204 (1984)). The trial court specifically found that Martinez was credible, stating,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">Mr. Martinez is a co-defendant in matters, apparently in this case and some partially related case. I found his demeanor and appearance on the stand, his body language, his response to all the questions he was asked to be one of a truthful person. While his testimony was in some degree self serving, I believe it was also accurate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Because Martinez\u2019s credibility is solely a matter for the trial court as the finder of fact, we will not disturb this determination on appeal. His testimony was not inherently incredible or so contrary to human experience as to render it unworthy of belief. Therefore, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s reliance upon Martinez\u2019s testimony regarding the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>Appellant farther asserts that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction because it failed to show that appellant\u2019s actions caused James\u2019 injuries. Appellant presents two arguments in support of this contention: he argues that the evidence was insufficient to show that James was wounded; in the alternative, appellant argues that the evidence was insufficient to show that appellant\u2019s actions caused James\u2019 wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-51 provides, in pertinent part, \u201cIf any person maliciously shoot, stab, cut, or wound any person or by any means cause him bodily injury, with the intent to maim, disfigure, disable, or kill, he shall ... be guilty of a Class 3 felony.\u201d Thus, \u201c[t]o support a conviction for malicious wounding under Code \u00a7 18.2-51, the Commonwealth must prove that the defendant inflicted the victim\u2019s injuries \u2018maliciously and \u25a0with the intent to maim, disfigure, disable or kill.\u2019 \u201d <em>Robertson v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 814, 823, 525 S.E.2d 640, 645 (2000) (quoting <em>Campbell v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 476, 483, 405 S.E.2d 1, 4 (1991) <em>(en </em>banc)).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">First, appellant asserts that because no medical evidence regarding James\u2019 injuries was introduced, the evidence was insufficient to show that James was wounded at all as a result of the attack.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We find no Virginia authority that requires the testimony of a medical professional or similar expert evidence to show that a victim was wounded, and we decline to adopt such a requirement in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Furthermore, based on James\u2019 and Nixon\u2019s testimony regarding James\u2019 injuries, we hold that the evidence was sufficient to establish that James was wounded in a manner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Code \u00a7 18.2-51. The Supreme Court of Virginia, in interpreting the predecessor statute to Code \u00a7 18.2-51, previously held that to prove the existence of a \u201cwound,\u201d the Commonwealth must show that the victim\u2019s skin was broken or cut. <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>184 Va. 409, 413, 35 S.E.2d 594, 595 (1945) (affirming the continuing validity of <em>Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>150 Va. 580, 142 S.E. 354 (1928)). Similarly, in <em>Harris, </em>the Court held that a \u201cwound\u201d is defined as \u201ca breach of the skin, or of the skin and flesh, produced by external violence.\u201d 150 Va. at 584, 142 S.E. at 355 (internal quotation omitted). The Court stated that \u201c[without such a parting of the skin ... there can be no wounding____ Yet a disruption of the internal skin\u2014as, that within the mouth ... will suffice.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Here, James testified that after the attack he believed his nose was broken \u201cbecause [he] was bleeding.\u201d The trial court could reasonably interpret this statement to mean that James was bleeding from the nose. In addition, Nixon testified that he found James with \u201ca very large pool of blood beside his head,\u201d with blood \u201ccoming out his nose, his mouth, [and] his eye.\u201d This testimony supports the finding that James was bleeding from the nose, mouth, and eye; as a result, the trial court could reasonably infer that James\u2019 skin in or around his nose, mouth, and eye had been broken or cut. Under <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Harris, </em>these breaks or cuts in the skin are sufficient to show that James suffered a wound, and we hold that the evidence in the instant case was sufficient to find that James suffered a qualified \u201cwound\u201d under the applicable statutory provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">Appellant next argues that even if James was wounded in the attack, the evidence was insufficient to show that appellant\u2019s actions caused James\u2019 wounds. Appellant alleges that the evidence established that he struck James only once, at most, and that a single blow could not have caused the wounds James suffered. Assuming without deciding that the evidence established that appellant struck James only once, we nevertheless find that the evidence was suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>cient to prove that appellant, at a minimum, acted as a principal in the second degree in the malicious wounding of James. Appellant misapprehends the nature of the evidence necessary to support his culpability as a principal in the second degree. \u201c \u2018It is a well-settled rule that a defendant is guilty as a principal in the second degree if he is guilty of some overt act done knowingly in furtherance of the commission of the crime, or if he shared in the criminal intent of the principal committing the crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>279 Va. 131, 156, 688 S.E.2d 220, 234 (2010) (quoting <em>McMorris v. Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 500, 505, 666 S.E.2d 348, 351 (2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Malicious wounding is a Class 3 felony. Code \u00a7 18.2-51. A principal in the second degree to a malicious wounding is punishable in all respects as a principal in the first degree. <em>Washington v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 291, 306, 597 S.E.2d 256, 263 (2004) (\u201c \u2018Generally, in the case of every felony, a principal in the second degree may be indicted, tried, convicted, and punished in all respects as if a principal in the first degree.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 683, 687-88, 537 S.E.2d 592, 594 (2000))); <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-18. In Virginia,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-5\">\u201c[a] principal in the second degree is one not the perpetrator, but present, aiding and abetting the act done, or keeping watch or guard at some convenient distance.\u201d <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>130 Va. 733, 736, 107 S.E. 809, 810 (1921). As for what constitutes \u201caiding and abetting,\u201d it is clear that mere presence and consent will not suffice. <em>E.g., Underwood v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 1045, 1048, 243 S.E.2d 231, 233 (1978). The defendant\u2019s conduct must consist of \u201cinciting, encouraging, advising or assisting in the [crime].\u201d <em>Frye v. Commonwealth, </em>231 Va. 370, 389, 345 S.E.2d 267, 280 (1986). It must be shown that the defendant procured, encouraged, countenanced, or approved commission of the crime. <em>Augustine v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 120, 124, 306 S.E.2d 886, 888-89 (1983).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADT\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number><em>Rollston v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 535, 539, 399 S.E.2d 823, 825 (1991). Moreover, \u201c \u2018fw]hen the alleged accomplice is actually present and performs overt acts of assistance or encouragement, he has communicated to the perpetrator his willingness to have the crime proceed and has demonstrated that he shares the criminal intent of the perpetrator.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 539, 399 S.E.2d at 825-26 (quoting R. Groot, <em>Criminal Offenses and Defenses in Virginia </em>183 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">Here, the trial court found that appellant hit James as part of the group-beating or immediately before the group-beating began. This finding was supported by Martinez\u2019s testimony that appellant struck James as Terry simultaneously struck Ammons. Furthermore, Martinez testified that, a short time later, he saw appellant standing with a group of men around James. Nixon testified that, during the same time period, he saw a group of men standing around James kicking, stomping, and punching him. This evidence was sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding that appellant was present during the malicious wounding of James and performed an overt act of assistance or encouragement by striking the initial blow against James. Therefore, the evidence was sufficient to sustain appellant\u2019s conviction for malicious wounding as a principal in the second degree in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">\n<em>3. Maiming by Mob</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Appellant also argues on appeal that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for maiming by mob in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-41 because the evidence was insufficient to prove that the men had assembled to achieve a common purpose or action.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Code \u00a7 18.2-38 defines a \u201cmob\u201d as \u201c[a]ny collection of people, assembled for the purpose and with the intention of committing an assault or a battery upon any person or an act of violence as defined in [Code] \u00a7 19.2-297.1, without authority of law....\u201d We reject appellant\u2019s initial argument that, because the men had already assembled at the McDonald\u2019s before the airmen arrived, they could not have \u201cassembled for the purpose and with the intention\u201d of commit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>ting an act of violence. While \u201c[t]he criterion which distinguishes individual behavior while part of a group from \u2018mob\u2019 behavior is assembling for the specific purpose and with the specific intent\u201d of committing an act of violence,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-5\">[t]hat is not to say that the purpose for which the group initially came together must have been for the purpose of committing [an act of violence] before a \u201cmob\u201d may be said to have \u201cassembled.\u201d It is possible that individuals who are lawfully assembled may become members of a \u201cmob\u201d without great deliberation and for them to become part of a group which is moved or controlled by those impulsive and irrational forces which perpetuate mob violence____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-6\"><em>Harrell v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 1, 7, 396 S.E.2d 680, 683 (1990). Thus, the fact that the men may have originally assembled at the McDonald\u2019s for a lawful purpose before the airmen arrived does not preclude the possibility that the group later developed into a mob. The impulsive and irrational forces that may exist to transform peaceable assembly into mob violence are to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. <em>See id. </em>at 7-8, 396 S.E.2d at 683 (stating that \u201c[w]hether a group of individuals has been so transformed into a \u2018mob\u2019 depends upon the circumstances ... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">To prove that the group in the instant case assembled into a mob, the Commonwealth must show that the group formed a collective purpose and intent to commit an act of violence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-8\">Whether a group of individuals has been so transformed into a \u201cmob\u201d depends upon the circumstances; no particular words or express agreements are required to effect a change in a group\u2019s purpose or intentions. Events or emotionally charged circumstances suddenly may focus individuals toward a common goal or purpose without an express or stated call to join forces.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-9\"><em>Id. </em>This Court may consider \u201cthe purpose, circumstances, or the setting of the group\u2019s initial assemblage\u201d and also \u201cproof of what transpired after the original assemblage\u201d to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>whether a group assembled into a mob. <em>Id. </em>at 10, 396 S.E.2d at 684-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\"><em>Abdullah v. Commonwealth, </em>53 Va.App. 750, 675 S.E.2d 215 (2009), is instructive in the instant case. In <em>Abdullah, </em>this Court found the existence of a mob where a group of approximately twelve men followed the victim\u2019s movements so as to intercept him, surrounded the victim as he emerged from an alley, and then assaulted and battered the victim. 53 Va.App. at 758, 675 S.E.2d at 219. Similarly, in the instant case, the group of men emerged from the McDonald\u2019s <em>en masse, </em>followed James and Ammons, surrounded James and Ammons, and then beat James and struck and chased Ammons.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Furthermore, the actions of the group, including those of appellant, suggested that the group acted in concert to attack James and Ammons. While some members approached the airmen, appellant, Terry, Martinez, and others sneaked behind James and Ammons and attacked them. This coordinated action is sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the members of the group, including appellant, were acting collectively with the intent to commit an act of violence. <em>See Hughes v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 391, 402, 598 S.E.2d 743, 748 (2004) (holding that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the convictions of three brothers for malicious wounding by mob in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-41 where the brothers acted in concert to attack, assault, and batter three men, as \u201c[t]heir actions in attacking various individuals clearly indicate[d] that they were acting collectively with the intent to assault\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Finally, although no express or stated call to join forces is necessary to constitute an assembly into a mob, <em>Harrell, </em>11 Va.App. at 7-8, 396 S.E.2d at 683, in the instant case, Martinez testified that Terry stated, \u201cI\u2019m gonna [sic] hit the dude, I\u2019m gonna [sic] step on him\u201d immediately before he exited the McDonald\u2019s and other members of the group followed. The trial court could reasonably infer that the group shared Terry\u2019s intent to commit an act of violence against the airmen and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>assembled for that purpose, especially in light of the fact that members of the group then attacked the airmen.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Because the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, showed that the group, including appellant, acted in concert to attack James and Ammons following Terry\u2019s stated intent to hit at least one of the airmen, the evidence was sufficient to show that a mob had assembled with the purpose and intent of committing an act of violence. Therefore, we hold that the evidence was sufficient to sustain appellant\u2019s conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">B. DOUBLE JEOPARDY</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Appellant also contends that his convictions under both Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-51 and 18.2\u201441 violate double jeopardy principles, as he has been twice punished for the same offense. For the reasons that follow, we hold that appellant\u2019s convictions for malicious wounding under Code \u00a7 18.2-51 and maiming by mob under Code \u00a7 18.2-41 do not violate the prohibition on double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">\u201cIn reviewing a double jeopardy claim, or a claim based on statutory interpretation, this Court shall conduct a <em>de novo </em>review.\u201d <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>57 Va.App. 446, 455, 703 S.E.2d 259, 263 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution \u201cguarantees protection against ... multiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d <em>Payne v. Commonwealth, </em>257 Va. 216, 227, 509 S.E.2d 293, 300 (1999). \u201cTo determine whether two charges constitute the same offense, we must consider the rule enunciated in <em>Blockburger [v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 182, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932) ].\u201d <em>Davis, </em>57 Va.App. at 455, 703 S.E.2d at 263.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-10\">[W]here the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not. <em>Gavieres v.

Commonwealth, </em>108 Mass. 433 (1871)). The <em>Blockburger </em>test \u201c \u2018emphasizes the elements of the two crimes. If each requires proof of a fact that the other does not, the <em>Blockburger </em>test is satisfied, notwithstanding a substantial overlap in the proof offered to establish the crimes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Hudgins, </em>269 Va. 602, 605, 611 S.E.2d 362, 364 (2005) (quoting <em>Brown v. Ohio, </em>432 U.S. 161, 166, 97 S.Ct. 2221, 2226, 53 L.Ed.2d 187 (1977)). Moreover, \u201c[i]n applying the <em>Blockburger </em>test, we look at the offenses charged <em>in the abstract, </em>without referring to the particular facts of the case under review.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 196, 200, 539 S.E.2d 732, 734 (2001) (emphasis added). This standard requires that we view the elements of the offenses generally and conceptually, rather than the elements of the offenses as charged in a specific instance. Thus, \u201c[a] double jeopardy violation exists only if the offenses <em>always </em>require proof of the same elements.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>57 Va.App. at 456, 703 S.E.2d at 263 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">We note at the outset that appellant concedes that Code \u00a7 18.2-41, prohibiting maiming by mob, contains an additional element not found in Code \u00a7 18.2-51, namely, the existence of a mob. However, appellant argues that Code \u00a7 18.2-51 contains no elements not found in Code \u00a7 18.2-41. Thus, the only question before this Court is whether Code \u00a7 18.2-51 contains an element not found in Code \u00a7 18.2-41, when both statutes are viewed in the abstract.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">In <em>Paiz v. Commonwealth, </em>54 Va.App. 688, 698, 682 S.E.2d 71, 76 (2009), this Court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-8\">[W]e note that malicious wounding by mob, as set out in Code \u00a7 18.2-41, is a different offense from malicious wounding as codified in Code \u00a7 18.2-51. Malicious wounding by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>mob does not require the Commonwealth to prove malice because it defines the crime as \u201cmaliciously or unlawfully [wounding] any person ... with intent to maim, disable, disfigure, or Mil him.... \u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-41. The disjunctive term \u201cor,\u201d which separates the terms \u201cmaliciously\u201d and \u201cunlawfully,\u201d indicates that Code \u00a7 18.2-41 only requires proof that the wounding was unlawful. Code \u00a7 18.2-41 therefore criminalizes different conduct from malicious wounding under Code \u00a7 18.2-51.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">We find this reasoning persuasive in the instant case. Code \u00a7 18.2-51 codifies two distinct crimes: malicious wounding and unlawful wounding. Code \u00a7 18.2-51 provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">If any person <em>maliciously </em>shoot, stab, cut, or wound any person or by any means cause him bodily injury, with the intent to maim, disfigure, disable, or Mil, he shall ... be guilty of a <em>Class 3 felony. </em>If such act be done <em>unlawfully but not maliciously, </em>with the intent aforesaid, the offender shall be guilty of a <em>Class 6 felony.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">(Emphasis added). In contrast, Code \u00a7 18.2-41 codifies only one crime, providing,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-8\">Any and every person composing a mob which shall <em>maliciously or unlawfully </em>shoot, stab, cut or wound any person, or by any means cause him bodily injury with intent to maim, disable, disfigure or Mil him, shall be guilty of a Class 3 felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">(Emphasis added). Appellant argues that, contrary to the holding in <em>Paiz, </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-51 and Code \u00a7 18.2-41 are not distinct because, while Code \u00a7 18.2-41 criminalizes maliciously <em>or </em>unlawfully wounding another person, so too does Code \u00a7 18.2-51, albeit as different classes of felonies. In other words, appellant argues that if one is guilty of maiming by mob under Code \u00a7 18.2-41, one is also necessarily guilty of a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-51, be it either malicious wounding or unlawful wounding. This argument, however, ignores the fact that Code \u00a7 18.2-51, when viewed in the abstract, creates two distinct crimes with distinct elements, malicious wounding and unlawful wounding, because it imposes different punishments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>based on the defendant\u2019s intent. As a result, malicious wounding and unlawful wounding, while both codified in Code \u00a7 18.2-51, should rightly be considered separate offenses for the purposes of the <em>Blockburger </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">The holding of <em>Hudgins, </em>269 Va. 602, 611 S.E.2d 362, supports this construction. In <em>Hudgins, </em>the defendant was acquitted of robbery in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-58. 269 Va. at 604, 611 S.E.2d at 364. Ten days later, the defendant was indicted for grand larceny from the person in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-95 based on the same underlying conduct. <em>Id. </em>The defendant appealed his conviction, alleging that grand larceny from the person is a lesser-included offense of robbery and therefore his conviction was barred by his earlier acquittal of robbery. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court of Virginia held that, under the <em>Blockburger </em>test, robbery and grand larceny from the person were not the same offense because each contained an element not found in the other. <em>Id. </em>at 606, 611 S.E.2d at 365. The Court held that robbery was distinct from grand larceny from the person because under the common law definition of robbery, there must be a taking <em>by violence or intimidation, </em>unlike larceny. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, the Court held that grand larceny from the person was distinct from robbery because, under Code \u00a7 18.2-95, grand larceny from the person required the taking of a thing <em>with a value of $5 or more, </em>unlike robbery. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">In so holding, the Supreme Court of Virginia overruled a decision of this Court that the two offenses contained the same elements. <em>Id. </em>This Court, reasoning that \u201cthe reference in Code \u00a7 18.2-95 [the grand larceny statute] to the value of the property stolen relate[d] solely to \u2018the degree of the potential punishment\u2019 for the offense of grand larceny from the person,\u201d had found as a result, \u201cthat value is not an element of the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In holding that this was error, the Supreme Court of Virginia stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-6\">In <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>[530 U.S. 466, 478, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 2356, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000),] the Supreme Court noted that \u201c[a]ny possible distinction between an \u2018element\u2019 of a felony offense and a \u2018sentencing factor\u2019 was unknown to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>the practice of criminal indictment, trial by jury, and judgment by court ... as it existed dining the years surrounding our Nation\u2019s founding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\"># :\u00a1; # <em>% %</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">\u201cPut simply,\u201d the Court said, \u201cif the existence of any fact (other than a prior conviction) increases the maximum punishment that may be imposed on a defendant, that fact\u2014no matter how the State labels it\u2014constitutes an element, and must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Sattazahn </em>[v. <em>Pennsylvania], </em>537 U.S. 101, 111 [123 S.Ct. 732, 739, 154 L.Ed.2d 588 (2003) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 606-07, 611 S.E.2d at 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">Similarly, in the instant case, malicious wounding as codified by Code \u00a7 18.2-51 contains an element that leads to a more severe punishment than that for unlawful wounding, also codified by Code \u00a7 18.2-51. Malicious wounding requires proof of malice and is punishable as a Class 3 felony. Code \u00a7 18.2-51. In contrast, unlawful wounding requires no showing of malice and is punishable as a Class 6 felony. <em>Id. </em>Because different elements must be proven and different penalties are imposed for each offense, malicious wounding and unlawful wounding must be treated as distinct offenses codified together in the same statute. Thus, because under Code \u00a7 18.2-51 the existence of malice is an aggravating factor that increases the penalty for the crime from a Class 6 to a Class 3 felony, <em>Hudgins </em>requires that this Court consider malicious wounding as a distinct crime with distinct elements when applying the <em>Blockburger </em>test. <em>Hudgins, </em>269 Va. at 606-07, 611 S.E.2d at 365. In contrast, maiming by mob requires a showing of malice <em>or </em>unlawful conduct; regardless of the defendant\u2019s intent, both are punishable as a Class 3 felony. Code \u00a7 18.2-41. Consequently, Code \u00a7 18.2-41 codifies only one crime, maiming by mob, whether it be done with malice or merely unlawfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">As a result, the question in this case is not whether Code \u00a7 18.2-41, maiming by mob, and Code \u00a7 18.2-51, including both malicious wounding and unlawful wounding, contain dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>tinct elements when viewed in the abstract. Rather, the question is whether maiming by mob, as codified by Code \u00a7 18.2-41, and <em>malicious wounding, </em>as codified by Code \u00a7 18.2-51, contain distinct elements when viewed in the abstract. As in <em>Paiz, </em>54 Va.App. at 698, 682 S.E.2d at 76, we hold that malicious wounding contains an additional element not found in maiming by mob.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under Code \u00a7 18.2-51, the Commonwealth must prove malice to sustain a conviction for malicious wounding. Under Code \u00a7 18.2-41, the Commonwealth need not prove malice to sustain a conviction for maiming by mob; by its plain language, Code \u00a7 18.2-41 criminalizes acts that are malicious <em>or </em>unlawful.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> From this analytical perspective, it follows that one who is guilty of maiming by mob is not necessarily guilty of malicious wounding; an unlawful wounding while part of a mob would not satisfy the requirements of malicious wounding under Code \u00a7 18.2-51, as no malice exists. Accordingly, we hold that appellant\u2019s convictions for malicious wounding under Code \u00a7 18.2-51 and maiming by mob under Code \u00a7 18.2-41 do not violate principles of double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">III.

However, for purposes of this matter we find that appellant stated his concern with the minimum amount of specificity necessary to fulfill the requirements of Rule 5A:18. In his closing argument, appellant stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AoE\">In any event, between these two charges [of malicious wounding and malicious wounding by mob], I would assume the Court would have to make a determination <em>whether my client caused., </em>uh, if the Court did feel that there was a maiming, the Court would make a determination whether it was with a mob or without a mob____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABh\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">Because appellant referenced the issue of causation, we find that he met the minimum requirements of Rule 5A:18. The purpose of Rule 5A:18 is to \"enable the ruling court to take any necessary corrective action,\u201d <em>Saunders v.

As a result, we conclude that the primary purpose of Rule 5A:18 was accomplished and thus appellant\u2019s argument regarding causation is not waived on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b362-8\">.
