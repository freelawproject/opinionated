On appeal, Shifflett contends the trial court should have suppressed the evidence of his guilt because the police officer unlawfully stopped his \u201cfarm use\u201d vehicle. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-10\">On appeal of a denial of a suppression motion, we view the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, giving it the benefit of any reasonable inferences.\u201d <em>Glenn v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 413, 416, 642 S.E.2d 282, 283 (2007) <em>(en banc) </em>(citation omitted), <em>aff'd, </em>275 Va. 123, 654 S.E.2d 910 (2008). This standard requires us to \u201cgive due weight to inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>Malbrough v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 163, 169, 655 S.E.2d 1, 3 (2008) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-11\">On February 18, 2010, a Virginia State Police Trooper, driving southbound on Rockfish Valley Highway, Route 151, in Nelson County, just south of River Road, Route 6, noticed a pickup truck traveling northbound. The pickup truck displayed a store-bought farm use tag, rather than an official license plate issued by the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) for registered farm use vehicles. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-698. It was nearly 10:00 p.m. and very dark. Three people occupied the cab of the pickup truck. The trooper saw something in the bed of the pickup truck but could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>determine what it was. Snow from a recent snowstorm covered the ground. \u201cIt was late at night,\u201d the trooper testified, \u201c[a]nd in the wintertime you don\u2019t see many farm use vehicles on the road.\u201d App. at 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">The trooper stopped the pickup truck to determine if it was, in fact, an unregistered vehicle being used exclusively for farm use. The trooper discovered that the driver, Shifflett, smelled of alcohol, had glassy, bloodshot eyes, and spoke with slurred speech. The trooper also saw two empty cases of beer, several empty single beer cans, and a bottle of whiskey. He later determined the pickup truck was unregistered, uninspected, and uninsured. From his investigation, the trooper also concluded his initial suspicion was correct: The pickup truck was not being used for agricultural purposes that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">In the trial court, Shifflett moved to suppress the evidence of his guilt, claiming the trooper did not have a reasonable suspicion to stop the pickup truck. The trial court disagreed and held the trooper had reasonable suspicion \u201cunder the circumstances of this case.\u201d App. at 26. With the trial court\u2019s approval, Shifflett entered a conditional guilty plea to driving while intoxicated and operating an unregistered, uninspected, and uninsured vehicle. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-266, 46.2-646, 46.2-1157, 46.2-707.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">On appeal, Shifflett argues the trial court erred by denying his suppression motion.

REASONABLE SUSPICION STANDARD</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">While an arrest requires probable cause, a mere investigatory stop requires only a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d that unlawful activity \u201cmay be afoot.\u201d <em>United States v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 273, 122 S.Ct. 744, 750, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002) (quoting <em>United States v. Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. 1, 7, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 1585, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989), and <em>Terry v.

Commonwealth, </em>280 Va. 572, 581, 701 S.E.2d 431, 436 (2010) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. at 7, 109 S.Ct. at 1585). The standard \u201cis not an exacting one,\u201d <em>Braun v. Maynard, </em>652 F.3d 557, 561, 2011 WL 2906104, at *4 (4th Cir.2011), and requires only \u201ca moderate chance of finding evidence of wrongdoing,\u201d <em>Safford Unified Sch. Disk No. 1 v. Redding, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 129 S.Ct. 2633, 2639, 174 L.Ed.2d 354 (2009).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">It follows that the mere \u201cpossibility of an innocent explanation\u201d does not necessarily exclude a reasonable suspicion that the suspect might be violating the law. <em>Morris v. City of Va. Beach, </em>58 Va.App. 173, 183, 707 S.E.2d 479, 483 (2011) (quoting <em>Raab v.

And, understandably so, for \u201cthe principal function <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>of his investigation is to resolve that very ambiguity and establish whether the activity is in fact legal or illegal\u2014to enable the police to quickly determine whether they should allow the suspect to go about his business or hold him to answer charges.\u201d <em>Morris, </em>58 Va.App. at 188, 707 S.E.2d at 483 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Raab, </em>50 Va.App. at 582, 652 S.E.2d at 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">To be sure, <em>Terry </em>itself involved a police officer observing Terry and his companions \u201crepeatedly walk back and forth, look into a store window, and confer with one another.\u201d <em>Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. at 274, 122 S.Ct. at 751. \u201cAlthough each of the series of acts was \u2018perhaps innocent in itself,\u2019\u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 22, 88 S.Ct. at 1880-81), collectively they were suspicious enough to give a police officer legitimate grounds to stop Terry and his companions for purposes of investigating the situation further. In other words, even though the suspicious individuals walking up and down the sidewalk \u201ccould simply have been innocuous, albeit overly energetic, window shoppers,\u201d that hypothesis of innocence \u201cdid not invalidate the <em>Terry </em>stop.\u201d <em>Raab, </em>50 Va.App. at 583, 652 S.E.2d at 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">B. EXEMPTION FOR FARM USE VEHICLES</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">Virginia\u2019s statutory \u201clicensing, registration and vehicle inspection requirements\u201d protect the public from potentially \u201cunsafe\u201d drivers and vehicles. <em>Vasaio v. Va. Dep\u2019t of Motor Vehicles, </em>42 Va.App. 190, 202, 590 S.E.2d 596, 602 (2004) (citation omitted). A farm use vehicle registered with the DMV receives official license plates called F-tags, identifying the vehicle as a farm use vehicle. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-698. Though it must ordinarily be \u201cused exclusively for farm use,\u201d <em>id., </em>a <em>registered </em>farm use vehicle may also be used for a limited number of \u201cnonfarm use[s],\u201d such as \u201cattending church or school, securing medical supplies, or securing other household or family necessities,\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-698(B)(2), and \u201cresponding to emergency calls\u201d when the farmer belongs to a volunteer rescue squad or firehouse, Code \u00a7 46.2-698(H).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>An <em>unregistered </em>farm use vehicle must comply with stricter limitations. \u201cBecause of the limited number and use of such vehicles upon the highway,\u201d <em>Duke v. Cnty. of Pulaski, </em>219 Va. 428, 436, 247 S.E.2d 824, 829 (1978), the general statutory exemption applies only when the vehicle is being \u201cused <em>exclusively </em>for agricultural or horticultural purposes,\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-665(A) (emphasis added), and, even then, only when its actual operation fits within a limited list of permissible farm use tasks, Code \u00a7 46.2-665(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">Additional statutes provide narrowly crafted exemptions for farm use vehicles involved in particular farm-related activities. <em>See, e.g., </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-664 (vehicles used for \u201cspraying\u201d crops and trees); Code \u00a7 46.2-666 (vehicles used \u201con a seasonal basis in transporting farm produce and livestock\u201d); Code \u00a7 46.2-668 (vehicles registered in other states used in Virginia \u201charvesting\u201d operations); Code \u00a7 46.2-670 (farm vehicles traveling to and from \u201csawmills\u201d); Code \u00a7 46.2-672 (vehicles used to \u201ctransport unginned cotton, peanuts, or fertilizer\u201d). These specific-use statutes, however, involve exclusively agricultural or horticultural uses. Code \u00a7 46.2-673 permits additional uses\u2014making a \u201creturn trip\u201d from a marketplace and transporting food and other supplies \u201cto a farm\u201d\u2014but limits those return-trip uses to a \u201cfarm vehicle\u201d already \u201cexempted from registration\u201d under the general and specific-use exemption statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">In this case, the factual circumstances justified a reasonable suspicion that Shifflett\u2014at the time of the stop\u2014might not have been using his unregistered pickup truck consistent with the statutory exemptions governing farm use vehicles. Several circumstances support this conclusion: the pickup truck displayed a store-bought farm use tag, purporting itself to be an unregistered farm use vehicle; three people were in the pickup truck\u2019s cab; and the pickup truck traveled north on Route 151 in Nelson County at nearly 10:00 p.m. in the dead of winter after a snowstorm. These facts were further amplified by the trooper\u2019s observation that \u201cin the wintertime you don\u2019t see many farm use vehicles on the road.\u201d App. at 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>To those outside the local community, these circumstances may mean very little. Under settled law, however, a trial judge applying the Fourth Amendment \u201cviews the facts of a particular case in light of the distinctive features and events of the community\u201d and these \u201cbackground facts, though rarely the subject of explicit findings, inform the judge\u2019s assessment of the historical facts.\u201d <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699-700, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1663, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996). Given the trial judge\u2019s unique capacity to contextualize the facts, appellate courts give \u201cdue weight\u201d to the inferences drawn \u201cby resident judges,\u201d <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>279 Va. 521, 528, 690 S.E.2d 95, 99 (2010) (citation omitted), applying Fourth Amendment principles to fact patterns unique to their local communities.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">We acknowledge Shifflett\u2019s complaint that the trial court\u2019s analysis, which we adopt as our own, relies heavily on generalities. But, truth be told, it is supposed to be this way. The reasonable suspicion standard itself is a \u201csomewhat abstract\u201d and \u201celusive concept\u201d that cannot be reduced to a \u201cneat set of legal rules.\u201d <em>Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. at 274, 122 S.Ct. at 751 (additional citation omitted) (quoting <em>Ornelas, </em>517 U.S. at 695-96, 116 S.Ct. at 1661, and <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 232, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2329, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983)). We thus find it unnecessary to develop a grid of all possible lawful uses of an unregistered farm use vehicle in order to determine whether the facts convincingly negate each hypothesized use.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Each permissible use of an unregistered vehicle presupposes the vehicle is being \u201cused exclusively for agricultural or horticultural purposes,\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-665(A), or for one of the intrinsically farm-related activities covered by the specific-use exemption statutes. Driving from one farm to another, for example, may be a permissible use\u2014but only when the drive is exclusively for agricultural or horticultural purposes. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-665(B)(2) (authorizing farm use vehicles to oper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>ate \u201calong a highway for a distance of no more than thirty miles from one part of the owner\u2019s land to another, irrespective of whether the tracts adjoin\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Picking up a plow from the nearby farm would certainly qualify, while picking up a case of beer to drink on the ride home would not.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">In sum, we eschew any \u201cdivide-and-conquer analysis\u201d that ignores the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. at 274, 122 S.Ct. at 751. Nor do we ask whether these circumstances, under a preponderance of the evidence standard, made it more likely than not that Shifflett had exceeded the permissible uses of his unregistered pickup truck on the night of the stop. We do not even ask whether probable cause existed to suspect as much. Instead, we ask only whether the objective facts created a reasonable suspicion that Shifflett\u2014 at the time of the stop\u2014might not have been using his unregistered pickup truck consistent with the statutory exemptions governing farm use vehicles. <em>Accord Morris, </em>58 Va.App. at 176, 707 S.E.2d at 480; <em>Reel v.
