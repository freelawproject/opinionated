For the following reasons, we affirm this conviction of appellant by the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">Appellant, who is a member of a Bloods gang, was at a party with several members of the Crips, a criminal street gang, on the evening of February 21, 2009 and in the early morning of February 22, 2009, at Nottingham Green Apartments in Henrico County. Mentor Bislimi (appellant\u2019s co-defendant) was the leader of the Crips gang at the party. Bislimi and the other Crips were wearing their blue gang-colors and bandanas that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-10\">According to Hakeem Johnson, a Crips member, appellant was a part of a group discussion amongst Crips members at the party about \u201cgoing on gang missions and stuff.\u201d At some point in the discussion, Bislimi ordered David Blackeney, one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>of the Crips members, to attack people so that he could improve his \u201cstatus in the gang.\u201d Bislimi also directed the people with him, including appellant, to attack a number of people. Appellant participated in these attacks.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Near the conclusion of their night\u2019s activities, at about 1:15 a.m. on February 22, 2009, the group saw two men and one woman walking through the Nottingham Green Apartments complex. The group, including appellant, attacked the two men\u2014and one of these victims was taken to the hospital with facial and shoulder injuries. This particular attack was expressly done to help increase the rank of a particular member of the Crips\u2014Tyler Addison. After this final attack, Bislimi, appellant, and the rest of the group ran away and got into a car that belonged to appellant\u2019s friend. In the car, appellant said, \u201cwe beat his ass.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Blackeney testified at trial that Crips and Bloods can be friends and they can work together. Although appellant was not a Crip, Blackeney also testified that appellant \u201cstill participated\u201d in the gang activity that evening. Johnson confirmed in his testimony that a Blood \u201chelp[ed] a Crip for his missions\u201d that night. Jaquan Payne also testified that all the attacks that evening were designed to help people improve their rank in the Crips and that appellant participated in the attacks. Investigator D.C. Wood, testifying as an expert on gangs in Virginia, testified that Bloods and Crips are \u201cbasically rivals\u201d and usually do not work together. However, he also explained that, although it would be unusual, a Blood could improve his rank in that gang by working with Crips.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">In his motion to strike at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, appellant argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that he was simply present with the Crips, \u201cnot helping them\u201d and \u201cnot achieving any ranks.\u201d Appellant then rested without putting on any evidence, and he renewed his motion to strike. He argued again <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>that the evening\u2019s activities were Crips-related\u2014not Bloods-related\u2014which was insufficient evidence to prove that he was associated with the gang. However, the trial court found that the \u201centire evening ... these individuals were together, they were acting together.\u201d In addition, the trial court found that \u201ceven though Mr. Morris is a Blood as opposed to a Crip, he was acting in concert with these other individuals in this, and he knew well that they were Crips as opposed to Bloods and vice versa, and that their activities were in association.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">When considering the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal, \u201ca reviewing court does not \u2018ask itself whether <em>it </em>believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crowder v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 658, 663, 588 S.E.2d 384, 387 (2003) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-19, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)). \u201cViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, as we must since it was the prevailing party in the trial court,\u201d <em>Riner v. Commonwealth, </em>268 Va. 296, 330, 601 S.E.2d 555, 574 (2004), \u201c[w]e must instead ask whether <em>\u2018any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt,\u2019 \u201d <em>Crowder, </em>41 Va.App. at 663, 588 S.E.2d at 387 (quoting <em>Kelly v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 250, 257, 584 S.E.2d 444, 447 (2003) <em>(en banc)). See also Maxwell v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 437, 442, 657 S.E.2d 499, 502 (2008). \u201cThis familiar standard gives full play to the responsibility of the trier of fact fairly to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. at 2789.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">A person is guilty of criminal street gang participation if that person \u201cactively participates in or is a member of a criminal street gang and ... knowingly and willfully participates in any predicate criminal act<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> committed for the benefit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>of, at the direction of, or in association with any criminal street gang.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-46.2(A). The Supreme Court of Virginia has stated that \u201c[t]he offense of participating in a criminal street gang contains three elements that the Commonwealth must prove to sustain a conviction under the statute.\u201d <em>Hamilton v. Commonwealth, </em>279 Va. 94, 108, 688 S.E.2d 168, 177 (2010). \u201cFirst, a person must actively participate in or be a member of a criminal street gang. Second, the person must knowingly and willfully participate in a predicate criminal act. Third, the act must be committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with the gang.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">On appeal, appellant argues that \u201cthe Commonwealth has failed to prove the third element\u201d of an offense under Code \u00a7 18.2-46.2(A). Specifically, appellant contends that \u201cthe evidence failed to prove that [appellant], a Blood, was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, of acting for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with the Crips\u201d on the evening of February 21, 2009 and the early morning hours of February 22, 2009. Therefore, on appeal in this case, we consider only whether the evidence proved that appellant acted for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with the Crips during that time period. Code \u00a7 18.2-46.2(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">To be punishable under Code \u00a7 18.2-46.2(A), the predicate criminal act must be \u201ccommitted for the benefit of, at the direction of, <em>or </em>in association with any criminal street gang.\u201d (Emphasis added). Thus, under the plain language of Code \u00a7 18.2-46.2(A), the Commonwealth in this case was required to prove that the predicate criminal act appellant participated in with the Crips gang was committed \u201cfor the benefit of\u2019 <em>or </em>\u201cat the direction of\u2019 <em>or </em>\u201cin association with\u201d the Crips gang. <em>See Bunch v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 423, 442, 304 S.E.2d 271, 282 (1983) (\u201c[T]he use of the disjunctive word \u2018or,\u2019 rather than the conjunctive \u2018and,\u2019 signifies the availability of alternative choices.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">Here, the trial court specifically found that appellant acted \u201cin association with\u201d the Crips members in the attacks that occurred here\u2014i.e., committing a predicate criminal act under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>the criminal street gang participation statute. This factual finding by the trial court that appellant acted in association with the Crips will not be disturbed on appeal unless it was plainly wrong or unsupported by the evidence. Code \u00a7 8.01-680. Challenging the trial court\u2019s finding here, appellant asserts that he did not share the Crips members\u2019 purpose for the attacks\u2014\u201cto gain or improve rank within the Crips.\u201d According to appellant, to act \u201cin association with\u201d a criminal street gang, one must have a \u201ccommon object\u201d with the gang. However, Code \u00a7 18.2-46.2(A) contains no such language and, contrary to appellant\u2019s argument, this statute does not expressly require that the defendant have the same, specific objective of achieving rank within the criminal street gang. Furthermore, in this case, appellant participated \u201cin association with\u201d the Crips gang members when he acted with a shared intent to attack innocent people.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">The testimony at trial established that appellant associated himself with the Crips members in order to attack innocent individuals\u2014an intent shared by everyone in the group. One of the members of the group even declared, in response to a plea to stop one of the unprovoked attacks: \u201c[WJe\u2019re goons, that\u2019s what we do.\u201d The trial court found this testimony credible\u2014as it was entitled to do as the factfinder. <em>See Sandoval v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 133, 138, 455 S.E.2d 730, 732 (1995). Moreover, no evidence compelled the factfinder to conclude appellant had any different reason for being with the group and participating in the attacks.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court certainly could infer from appellant\u2019s statement after the attacks, \u201cwe beat his ass,\u201d that appellant shared the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>general objective as the Crips gang members in this group of men who joined in these attacks. <em>See Sullivan v. Commonwealth, </em>280 Va. 672, 676, 701 S.E.2d 61, 68-64 (2010) (stating that an appellate court must defer \u201cto any reasonable and justified inferences the fact-finder may have drawn from the facts proved\u201d)- As the trial court found, appellant was \u201cacting in concert\u201d with the Crips during these unprovoked attacks.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Further circumstances in the record support the trial court\u2019s finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Bolden v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 144, 147, 654 S.E.2d 584, 586 (2008) (\u201cWhen a defendant challenges on appeal the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain his conviction, the appellate court has a duty to examine all the evidence that tends to support the conviction.\u201d). Appellant was present at a party where Crips members discussed \u201cgoing on gang missions,\u201d and Bislimi told Crips members\u2014in appellant\u2019s presence\u2014that attacking people would improve one\u2019s \u201cstatus in the gang.\u201d Appellant then participated in these attacks\u2014and appellant\u2019s friend even provided appellant and the Crips with the means to leave the scene of those attacks.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">The trial court could have reasonably inferred appellant was well-aware that he was interacting with Crips members\u2014that he was not only associating with them, but also working to benefit them and at their direction. Appellant asserts that <em>he </em>gained nothing personally from the attacks. However, the plain language of Code \u00a7 18.2-46.2(A) does not require that <em>the defendant </em>benefit personally from the predicate criminal act\u2014but instead provides, as one possible method of proof, that the predicate criminal act \u201cbenefit ... any criminal street gang.\u201d In addition, the evidence proved that Bislimi, the leader of this gang of Crips, orchestrated the attacks that evening. Through Bislimi\u2019s directions, appellant knew whom to attack and where to be in order to participate in the attacks. Thus, it is evident that appellant\u2019s criminal acts that night were committed at the Crips\u2019 direction\u2014through Bislimi, a Crips leader.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>Therefore, \u201c[viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, as we must since it was the prevailing party in the trial court,\u201d <em>Riner, </em>268 Va. at 330, 601 S.E.2d at 574, a rational factfinder certainly could have concluded that the criminal acts appellant participated in here were committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with the Crips, a criminal street gang. Code \u00a7 18.2-46.2(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">In this case, ample evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding that appellant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of criminal street gang participation. Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we affirm this conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b792-11\">. Appellant was also convicted at trial of assault or battery by mob, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-42, and malicious wounding by mob, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-41. Appellant has not challenged the conviction for assault or battery by a mob, and, although appellant argued in his petition for appeal that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for malicious wounding by a mob, an appeal was not granted on that issue. Therefore, we consider only appellant\u2019s assignment of error challenging his conviction for criminal street gang participation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b793-8\">. Johnson testified that he himself attempted to separate from the group committing the attacks, but that the group threatened that he would become the next victim if he did not participate in the evening's \"mission.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b794-8\">. Whether a \"[p]redicate criminal act\u201d (as defined by Code \u00a7 18.2-46.1) occurred is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b796-6\">. Investigator Wood\u2019s testimony-\u2014that Crips and Bloods do not usually work together\u2014does not negate or outweigh the sufficient and ample evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s finding that members of the two rival gangs worked together in association with each other in this particular case. Rather, Investigator Wood\u2019s testimony is just one factor in the totality of the evidence, which clearly supports the trial court's finding of guilt. <em>See Bowling v. Commonwealth, </em>51 Va.App. 102, 107, 654 S.E.2d 354, 356 (2007) (\"[Wjhen we consider the sufficiency of the evidence ... we review the totality of the evidence to determine whether it was sufficient to prove an offense.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
