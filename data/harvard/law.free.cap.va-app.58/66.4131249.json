Cortez-Hernandez asserts the trial court erred in refusing him the opportunity to re-cross-examine a prosecution witness after the Commonwealth\u2019s re-direct examination of that witness. Cortez-Hernandez also alleges the trial court erred in refusing to grant jury instructions on excusable self-defense and voluntary manslaughter. For the following reasons, we affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">During the second week of May 2008, Omar Yasquez (\u201cOmar\u201d) got into a fistfight with Santos Ontiveros (\u201cSantos\u201d). After besting Santos, Omar went into El Mexicano Restaurant in the Georgetown South Shopping Center to wait for his brother, Ruben, to pick him up. When Ruben arrived, the two drove off toward Omar\u2019s residence in the Georgetown South housing community (\u201cGeorgetown South\u201d). Before they got to Omar\u2019s residence, however, Cortez-Hernandez, Santos, and another individual intercepted them by standing in front of their vehicle, blocking the street. As Omar and Ruben exited the vehicle, Omar got punched in the face. A fight ensued, and Omar was beaten \u201cpretty badly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">A few weeks later, on May 31, 2008, Cortez-Hernandez and Santos dined with a group of friends at El Mexicano Restaurant in the Georgetown South Shopping Center. At the same time, Omar congregated with his cousin and friends in front of Mike\u2019s Quick Mart, also in the Georgetown South Shopping Center. They planned to dine at El Mexicano Restaurant, but when Omar realized the individuals from the previous altercation were inside, he called Ruben to pick them up.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">When Cortez-Hernandez found out Omar and his friends were outside, he called a friend to bring him a gun. When the friend arrived, Cortez-Hernandez stashed the .45 caliber gun in his pants. Shortly thereafter, he and his friends exited the restaurant and proceeded down the sidewalk past Omar and his companions, down Grant Avenue and toward Georgetown South. Omar and his friends, also residents at Georgetown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>South, decided to walk home in the same direction. Along the way, Omar picked up a stick and gave it to his brother, Ruben. When they reached Grant Avenue, Santos came from behind Omar and punched him in the nose. Omar grabbed his face as blood poured out of his nose. Ruben hit Santos with the stick before Santos could hit Omar a second time. Santos ran toward his group, comprised of nine individuals, and one of them responded by charging toward Omar and Ruben with a knife. Ruben again raised the stick to ward him off.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">At that point, Cortez-Hernandez positioned himself behind a large tree in a nearby yard and took out his gun. All of a sudden, he lifted up his shirt, yelled, \u201cQue vale mierdas,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> then, fired four shots, hitting Omar twice. Ruben called 911 and waited for help while Cortez-Hernandez and his friends fled. Paramedics arrived and announced Omar dead at the scene. The autopsy revealed that Omar had been shot twice, and the kill shot had traveled through his lung, heart, aorta, esophagus and vertebra before lodging in his lower left back. The bullets found in Omar\u2019s body were traced to Cortez-Hernandez\u2019s .45 caliber gun, and Omar\u2019s blood was found \u201cten to fifteen feet\u201d from the tree behind which Cortez-Hernandez had been standing during the altercation.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Cortez-Hernandez was indicted and tried by a jury for first-degree murder and use of a firearm during the commission of a felony. Hermenjildo Rivera (\u201cRivera\u201d), an eyewitness and friend of the decedent, testified during the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief. During re-direct examination, the Commonwealth asked Rivera for the first time about the fight and the shooting. Defense counsel objected, arguing the Commonwealth exceeded the scope of direct and cross. The Commonwealth offered to \u201crelieve [Rivera] and re-call him back.\u201d Without comment, the trial court said, \u201cI overrule the objection.\u201d The Commonwealth proceeded to ask Rivera details <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>about the shooting. Rivera corroborated the fact that Ruben hit Santos with the stick after Santos punched Omar in the face. Rivera also testified that Omar did not have a weapon, and Rivera did not see Omar hit anyone prior to the shooting. Rivera explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-4\">[Cortez-Hernandez] went up to the yard, and when he said that phrase, \u201cque vale mierda,\u201d he took out the gun and he pointed the gun, and it was some seconds\u2014he took out the gun and he started to move around like this (indicating), and he said that it was no vale mierda, and he fired it. A few seconds went by, and he took it up again and he fired again.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Rivera responded, \u201cno,\u201d when asked whether anyone in Omar\u2019s group had gotten into a physical fight with Cortez-Hernandez.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">As the Commonwealth concluded its re-direct, defense counsel made some indication, the nature of which is unclear from the record, to which the court responded, \u201cNo.\u201d Defense counsel then requested and received a bench conference in which the following discussion took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-7\">MS. IRVING [Defense counsel]: At the time that Ms. Millette started her direct examination, she never talked about the actual shooting. She only talked about when they were outside of Mike\u2019s, walking, waiting until the Defendant and his friends had passed, and that\u2019s where her cross\u2014her direct ended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-8\">THE COURT: Then you should have objected. I do not allow recross.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-9\">MS. IRVING: Judge, I did object. If I can\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-10\">THE COURT: You did object, and then she went in\u2014you objected before it went into the shooting. After the shooting you did not object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-11\">MS. IRVING: If I may just make my record clear, then. I objected when I thought she exceeded my scope. She mentioned that she could call him again, at which the point the Court\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-12\">THE COURT: Overruled your objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>MS. IRVING:\u2014overruled the objection. And I was under the impression that instead of having her call him again one more time that she could continue going because I thought she had exceeded the scope.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-5\">THE COURT: No. I overruled the objection, you did not object again, so the objection is noted. You cannot go recross. Thank you. You may step back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-6\">MS. IRVING: Please note my exception. Thank you, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Following this exchange, Cortez-Hernandez\u2019s attorney did not seek an additional opportunity to re-cross Rivera or otherwise proffer for the record the questions she would have asked Rivera or the expected answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">Cortez-Hernandez later took the stand in his own defense. He testified that when he learned Omar and two friends were outside the restaurant, he got nervous so he called a friend to bring him a gun. After he left El Mexicano, he didn\u2019t realize there was any trouble until Santos \u201cpassed me running ... holding his head----\u201d At that point, Cortez-Hernandez turned around and saw one of Omar\u2019s friends approaching him with a stick. He testified that he raised his hands for protection and the man hit his hands with the stick. Cortez-Hernandez then \u201cran behind a tree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-11\">Although Cortez-Hernandez\u2019s group outnumbered Omar\u2019s group nine to four, Cortez-Hernandez claimed eight people surrounded him, causing him to tremble with fear and feel like he could lose \u201cmy life right then and there.\u201d He testified the group was only about five feet away from him. Cortez-Hernandez testified he pulled out his gun to scare Omar\u2019s group off, but when they didn\u2019t back off, he shot toward the ground. Two of the bullets hit Omar, even though Cortez-Hernandez maintained he never aimed at anyone. Cortez-Hernandez admitted Omar was not the individual who hit him that evening, nor did he ever see Omar with any weapons. After he fired the rounds, Cortez-Hernandez did not stop to see whether he had hit anyone. Instead, he fled the scene and stashed the weapon at a friend\u2019s residence nearby.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>At the conclusion of the evidence, Cortez-Hernandez proffered model jury instructions on excusable self-defense and voluntary manslaughter. The trial court refused both instructions finding they were inapplicable to the facts presented at trial. Instead, the court instructed the jury on justifiable self-defense, and first and second-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The jury found Cortez-Hernandez guilty of both first-degree murder and use of a firearm during the commission of a felony, and fixed his sentence at 63 years imprisonment. The trial court entered final judgment on March 9, 2010. Cortez-Hernandez noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">II <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">A. <em>Trial Court\u2019s Refusal to Allow Re-Cross-Examination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">Cortez-Hernandez first contends the trial court erred in refusing to allow him the right to re-cross-examine a prosecution witness, Hermenjildo Rivera, after the Commonwealth brought out new information on re-direct. Cortez-Hernandez specifically alleges the trial court erred in not allowing him re-cross-examination concerning matters brought out for the first time on Rivera\u2019s re-direct by the prosecutor. The Commonwealth agrees the trial court erred in refusing to allow re-cross-examination of Rivera, but asserts the error is \u201cnot reversible error\u201d because Cortez-Hernandez failed to proffer the questions he would have asked Rivera on re-cross and the expected answers. We do not address the merits of this assignment of error because it is not properly preserved for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">Rule 5A:18 provided that \u201c[n]o ruling of the trial court ... will be considered as a basis for reversal unless the objection was stated together with the grounds therefor at the time of the ruling.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The rule requires that \u201c[i]n order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>preserve an issue for appeal, \u2018an objection must be timely made and the grounds stated with specificity.\u2019 \u201d <em>McDuffie v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 170, 177, 638 S.E.2d 139, 142 (2006) (quoting <em>Marlowe v. Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va.App. 619, 621, 347 S.E.2d 167, 168 (1986)). \u201cTo be timely, an objection must be made when the occasion arises\u2014at the time the evidence is offered or the statement made.\u201d <em>Marlowe, 2 </em>Va.App. at 621, 347 S.E.2d at 168 (citation omitted). \u201cThe purpose of the rule is to ensure that any perceived error by the trial court is \u2018promptly brought to the attention of the trial court with sufficient specificity that the alleged error can be dealt with and timely addressed and corrected when necessary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wood v. Commonwealth, </em>57 Va.App. 286, 303, 701 S.E.2d 810, 818 (2010) (quoting <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 126, 131, 380 S.E.2d 8, 10 (1989)). \u201cIf a party fails to timely and specifically object, she waives her argument on appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Arrington v. Commonwealth, </em>53 Va.App. 635, 641, 674 S.E.2d 554, 557 (2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">Moreover, \u201c[i]n Virginia, when \u2018testimony is rejected before it is delivered, an appellate court has no basis for adjudication unless the record reflects a proper proffer.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ray v. Commonwealth, </em>55 Va.App. 647, 649, 688 S.E.2d 879, 880 (2010) (quoting <em>Whittaker v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 966, 968, 234 S.E.2d 79, 81 (1977)). \u201c \u2018When an appellant claims a trial court abused its discretion in excluding evidence, we cannot competently determine error\u2014much less reversible error\u2014 without a proper showing of what that testimony would have been.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Tynes v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 17, 21, 635 S.E.2d 688, 689 (2006)). \u201cThough sometimes thought of as a mere waiver principle, the proffer requirement serves the higher purpose of safeguarding our duty under Code \u00a7 8.01-678<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to reverse only when the trial court error actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 650, 688 S.E.2d at 881 (citing <em>Kirby v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 691, 698-99, 653 S.E.2d 600, 603-04 (2007)). Thus,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-5\">Absent a proffer showing harm was done, we are forbidden to consider the question----This is because a proffer allows us to examine both the admissibility of the proposed testimony, and whether, even if admissible, its exclusion prejudiced the proffering party.... We can perform this examination only when the proponent proffers the testimony he expected to elicit, rather than merely his theory of the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AS\"><em>Id. </em>(quotations and citatiohs omitted). Indeed, \u201ceven when Ve are not totally in the dark concerning the nature of the evidence,\u2019 we still must \u2018know enough about the specifics\u2019 to be able to \u2018say with assurance\u2019 that the lower court committed prejudicial error.\u201d <em>Tynes, </em>49 Va.App. at 22, 635 S.E.2d at 690 (quoting <em>Smith v. Hylton, </em>14 Va.App. 354, 358, 416 S.E.2d 712, 715 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">As the Commonwealth correctly notes, these general principles apply to testimony excluded on cross-examination. <em>See, e.g., Spencer v. Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 295, 305, 384 S.E.2d 785, 792 (1989) (\u201cSpencer contends that the trial court limited his cross-examination of Dr. Roberts on this point. Because Spencer failed to proffer the questions he wanted to ask Dr. Roberts and the answers Dr. Roberts would have made, we are unable to review Spencer\u2019s claim.\u201d); <em>Clagett v. Commonwealth, </em>252 Va. 79, 95, 472 S.E.2d 263, 272 (1996) (\u201cThe trial court sustained the Commonwealth\u2019s objection to Clagett\u2019s attempt to cross-examine the lead investigator concerning Holsinger\u2019s remorse for her part in the crime. As Clagett failed to proffer the testimony he expected to elicit, we will not consider this issue on appeal.\u201d). In such cases, as long as the trial court does not prohibit counsel from proffering the necessary evidence for the record, we will not disturb the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>court\u2019s ruling on appeal. <em>See Williams v. Harrison, </em>255 Va. 272, 277, 497 S.E.2d 467, 471 (1998) (\u201cWilliams did not proffer the additional questions he intended to ask or the additional testimony he expected to elicit from further cross-examination, <em>nor was he prevented from doing so by the trial court ... </em>[i]n the absence of a proffer, we will not consider this issue on appeal.\u201d (emphasis added) (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">In this case, the Commonwealth called Rivera to the stand and questioned him about some of the events leading up to the May 31, 2008 shooting of Omar. The Commonwealth did not ask Rivera on direct examination' about the shooting itself. During cross-examination, counsel for Cortez-Hernandez also did not ask Rivera about the shooting. Nevertheless, during re-direct examination, the Commonwealth asked Rivera about the fight and the shooting. Cortez-Hernandez\u2019s counsel objected, arguing only that the Commonwealth exceeded the scope of direct and cross. When the Commonwealth offered to \u201creheve [Rivera] and re-call him back,\u201d the trial court, without further comment, overruled the objection. Upon the conclusion of re-direct, the trial court precluded Cortez-Hernandez\u2019s counsel from further cross-examination of the witness. Although counsel again noted her objection, she did not proffer the questions she would have asked or Rivera\u2019s expected answers for the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Assuming the trial court erred procedurally in disallowing re-cross on matters brought out for the first time on re-direct, as the Commonwealth suggests, we hold that in light of Cortez-Hernandez\u2019s failure to proffer the evidence he expected to obtain, we cannot ascertain whether the asserted error is reversible.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Cortez-Hernandez failed to proffer his questions and Rivera\u2019s expected answers for the record, and the record fails to demonstrate that the trial court prohibited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Cortez-Hernandez from doing so. Cortez-Hernandez also failed to re-call the witness to obtain any desired testimony during his own case-in-chief, as he could have done. Without a proper proffer, and because Cortez-Hernandez did not call the witness to testify during his own case, we cannot \u201ccompetently\u201d ascertain whether or not the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow counsel to re-cross-examine Rivera was error, \u201cmuch less reversible error.\u201d <em>Ray, </em>55 Va.App. at 649, 688 S.E.2d at 880.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Moreover, contrary to the assertion of the dissent, there is no constitutional dimension to the asserted error properly before us, as Cortez-Hernandez never objected to the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow re-cross-examination of Rivera <em>on the specific basis </em>that his constitutional right to confrontation required it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Indeed, Cortez-Hernandez never mentioned the Sixth Amendment at all. Rather, his only stated objection to the Commonwealth\u2019s questions was that they \u201cexceeded the scope of direct and cross.\u201d The trial court was, therefore, never afforded the opportunity to correct any alleged constitutional error. It follows that because Cortez-Hernandez did not raise an objection based on his right of confrontation, that specific objection is not properly preserved for appeal and we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>will not consider it. <em>See West Alexandria Prop., Inc. v. First Virginia Mortgage and Real Estate Inv. Trust, </em>221 Va. 134, 138, 267 S.E.2d 149, 151 (1980) (\u201cOn appeal, though taking the same general position as in the trial court, an appellant may not rely on reasons which could have been but were not raised for the benefit of the lower court.\u201d); <em>Edwards v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 752, 760, 589 S.E.2d 444, 448 (2003) <em>(en </em>banc) (\u201cMaking one specific argument on an issue does not preserve a separate legal point on the same issue for review.\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">In sum, because Cortez-Hernandez failed to proffer the questions he would have asked and Rivera\u2019s expected answers to those questions for the record, and because he did not specifically raise an objection to the court\u2019s decision based upon the Sixth Amendment right to confrontation, we find the issue is not properly preserved for appeal and we, thus, affirm the trial court as to this assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">B. <em>Trial Court\u2019s Refusal to Grant Jury Instructions on Excusable Self-Defense and Voluntary Manslaughter</em></p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Cortez-Hernandez also claims the trial court erred in refusing to grant his proposed jury instructions on excusable self-defense and voluntary manslaughter. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">\u201c \u2018On appeal, when the issue is a refused jury instruction, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>the proponent of the instruction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Connell v. Commonwealth, </em>34 Va.App. 429, 436, 542 S.E.2d 49, 53 (2001) (quoting <em>Lynn v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 336, 344, 499 S.E.2d 1, 4-5 (1998)). Nevertheless, \u201cthe trial court should instruct the jury only on those theories of the case which find support in the evidence.\u201d <em>Morse v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 627, 632, 440 S.E.2d 145, 149 (1994). Indeed, \u201c[i]t is a fundamental principle that \u2018although an instruction may correctly state the law, it should not be given if it is inapplicable to the facts in evidence ... [and] might confuse or distract the jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 633, 440 S.E.2d at 149 (quoting <em>King v. Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va.App. 708, 711, 347 S.E.2d 530, 531 (1986)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-5\"><em>Excusable </em>homicide in self-defense occurs where the accused, although <em>in some fault in the first instance </em>in provoking or bringing on the difficulty, when attacked retreats as far as possible, announces his desire for peace, and kills his adversary from a reasonably apparent necessity to preserve his own life or save himself from great bodily harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-6\"><em>Bailey v. Commonwealth, </em>200 Va. 92, 96, 104 S.E.2d 28, 31 (1958) (emphases added). On the other hand, <em>\u201cfjJustifiable </em>homicide in self-defense occurs where a person, <em>vnthout any fault on his part </em>in provoking or bringing on the difficulty, kills another under reasonable apprehension of death or great bodily harm to himself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). In considering a defendant\u2019s assertion of self-defense, we recognize the \u201cwell-established principle that one assaulted may use only such force as appears to him reasonably necessary to repel the attack.\u201d <em>Cook v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 769, 773, 250 S.E.2d 361, 364 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">In this case, the trial court rejected Cortez-Hernandez\u2019s proposed jury instruction on excusable self-defense because \u201cthere is [obviously] no evidence on both sides to back up [the instruction].\u201d The trial court noted that even under Cortez-Hernandez\u2019s own version of events, he was \u201ccompletely without fault\u201d in the altercation. In fact, Cortez-Hernandez requested and received a jury instruction on justifiable self-defense, which provided that he \u201cwas without fault in provok<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>ing or bringing on the fight or difficulty.\u201d Concluding there was \u201cno evidence of either side that there was some degree of fault [on the part of Cortez-Hernandez],\u201d the instruction on excusable self-defense was refused. The trial court\u2019s ruling is not plainly wrong, even viewed from the standpoint of the proponent of the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">In fact, even if Cortez-Hernandez was at fault in the altercation, the record fails to prove he retreated as far as he safely could under the circumstances, that he attempted to abandon the fight, that he made known his desire for peace, and that he <em>reasonably </em>feared great bodily harm to himself. Cortez-Hernandez was the only individual in the entire group armed with a firearm, and he concedes Omar never hit or threatened anyone or otherwise carried a weapon himself. Significantly, Omar\u2019s blood was found 15 feet from where Cortez-Hernandez stood, wielding his gun. Cortez-Hernandez also testified that the source of his \u201cfear\u201d was an altercation that took place in 2002 that did not involve Omar\u2019s group in any way. He also stated he was surrounded by eight people, when Omar\u2019s group only included four. Despite the fact that no one in Omar\u2019s group spoke to or threatened him, Cortez-Hernandez fired his gun toward the small group, only one of whom was himself \u201carmed\u201d with a mere stick. Moreover, rather than expressing a desire for peace, Cortez-Hernandez yelled out \u201cQue vale mierdas,\u201d a Mexican idiomatic expression meaning something along the lines of \u201cWho\u2019s the next motherfucker?\u201d or \u201cto not be worth shit,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m going to finish you up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">We can only conclude on these facts that the trial court did not err in refusing to grant Cortez-Hernandez\u2019s proposed jury instruction on excusable self-defense. As the trial court found, the evidence failed to support the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">With respect to voluntary manslaughter, it is well settled that if a jury in a first-degree murder case rejects an instruction on the lesser-included offense of second-degree murder and finds the defendant guilty of first-degree murder, then it \u201cnecessarily rejected the factual basis upon which it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>might have rendered a verdict on the lesser-included offense of voluntary manslaughter.\u201d <em>Turner v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 270, 278, 476 S.E.2d 504, 508 (1996), <em>aff'd, </em>255 Va. 1, 492 S.E.2d 447 (1997). In such cases, any alleged error in the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant an instruction on voluntary manslaughter would be harmless. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Here, as in <em>Turner, </em>the jury rejected the instruction on second-degree murder and convicted Cortez-Hernandez of first-degree murder. It follows that, as in <em>Turner, </em>the jury \u201cwould never have reached a voluntary manslaughter verdict.\u201d Any supposed error in refusing to award an instruction on voluntary manslaughter would, therefore, be harmless. For that reason, we affirm the trial court\u2019s refusal to award a voluntary manslaughter instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">III. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we do not consider Cortez-Hernandez\u2019s first assignment of error, because he failed to properly preserve it for appeal. However, we affirm the trial court\u2019s refusal to award a jury instruction on excusable self-defense, since the evidence failed to support such an instruction. We also find the trial court did not err in refusing an instruction on voluntary manslaughter, because the jury necessarily rejected the factual premise upon which to convict Cortez-Hernandez of that offense when it convicted him of first-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b118-7\">.

Here, the trial court denied Cortez-Hernandez <em>any </em>opportunity to cross-examine a key Commonwealth witness on the material issue of whether he was the unprovoked perpetrator of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">The Commonwealth concedes the error. Appellee Br. at 13. Cortez-Hernandez objected to the denial of re-cross-examination before the trial court, which understood and ruled on the objection. Nonetheless, the majority holds that because Cortez-Hernandez failed to proffer proposed cross-examination questions, the evidentiary dimension of this error was waived pursuant to Rule 5A:18. The majority also narrowly interprets Cortez-Hernandez\u2019s second objection, made during the bench conference, to find he never raised any constitutional issue before the trial court. I believe that the constitutional basis of appellant\u2019s error was preserved and that the trial court\u2019s improper constriction of Cortez-Hernandez\u2019s right to cross-examination was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Moreover, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>the constitutional component of appellant\u2019s argument was not properly preserved for appellate review, I believe the trial court\u2019s error remains reversible pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-678. Thus, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">I concur with the majority that the trial court correctly denied appellant\u2019s proposed jury instructions on excusable self-defense and voluntary manslaughter, upon the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">\n<em>III.

Indeed it is the primary means by which the credibility and trustworthiness of a witness is tested. <em>Davis, </em>415 U.S. at 316, 94 S.Ct. at 1109-10.

To allow redirect examination on new material but deny recross on the same material is to violate both the Confrontation Clause and fundamental principles of fairness.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 1375; <em>see also United States v. Jones, </em>982 F.2d 380 (9th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Morris, </em>485 F.2d 1385 (5th Cir.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Here, the majority finds Cortez-Hernandez failed to preserve his constitutional argument because he \u201cnever mentioned the Sixth Amendment.\u201d I believe that by doing so, the majority does not appreciate the constitutional magnitude of counsel\u2019s arguments, set forth in both open court and in the bench conference. In its analysis, the majority subordinates substance to form contrary to the longstanding policy of this Court. <em>See, e.g., Irvine v. Carr, </em>163 Va. 662, 668, 177 S.E. 208, 210 (1934) (\u201cit has been the policy of this court for many years, and is still, to subordinate <em>form </em>to <em>substance, </em>and not to allow the substantial rights of parties to be taken away for the sake of adherence to any forms of procedure not essential to the orderly conduct of judicial proceeding\u201d (emphasis added)). In applying Rule 5A:18 to this case, my analysis is guided by the substance of Cortez-Hernandez\u2019s objections, not their form.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Counsel\u2019s mutual understanding of the trial court\u2019s prior ruling on Cortez-Hernandez\u2019s scope objection cannot be ignored when considering whether she adequately raised the constitutional dimension of her cross-examination argument to the trial court. Appellant\u2019s counsel objected, \u201cThis exceeds the scope,\u201d when the prosecution started to broach new material on re-direct examination of Hermenjildo Rivera. The prosecution met appellant\u2019s objection with an offer to \u201crelieve [the witness] and re-call him back.\u201d The trial court denied the objection without comment, but both parties interpreted the court\u2019s adverse ruling as permission for the Commonwealth to informally recall the testifying witness. To be sure, the Commonwealth takes the position on appeal that the trial court did not err in permitting \u201cthe prosecutor to recall the witness.\u201d Appellee Br. at 11. With this mutual understanding, the prosecution continued to ask Rivera about the shooting, believing her re-direct had become the logical equivalent of direct examination. Defense counsel, without repeated objections, awaited for what she believed to be her absolute right to cross.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Viewing the bench conference dialogue against this backdrop, it becomes clear Cortez-Hernandez\u2019s counsel adequately apprised the trial court of her desire to cross-examine Rivera on new material. Indeed she specifically mentioned the new material\u2014\u201cthe actual shooting\u201d\u2014during her argument. The trial judge, after acknowledging the new material, ruled, \u201cYou cannot go recross.\u201d The trial court undoubtedly understood both that new material was brought out on re-direct and that defense counsel wanted the opportunity to re-cross the witness on that material.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">By permitting the Commonwealth to question Rivera about new material and denying Cortez-Hernandez re-cross on the same material, the trial court violated \u201cboth the Confrontation Clause and fundamental principles of fairness.\u201d <em>Riggi, </em>951 F.2d at 1375. Under these facts, I would hold that the trial court\u2019s arbitrary refusal to allow any re-cross-examination whatsoever was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Like other Confrontation Clause errors, though, improper denial of Cortez-Hernandez\u2019s opportunity to cross-examine Rivera is subject to harmless-error analysis. <em>Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. at 684, 106 S.Ct. at 1438. The correct inquiry is whether the \u201c \u2018the beneficiary of the constitutional error ... proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 395, 399, 528 S.E.2d 166, 168 (2000) (quoting <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 828, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967)); <em>see also Olden v. Kentucky, </em>488 U.S. 227, 232-33, 109 S.Ct. 480, 483-84, 102 L.Ed.2d 513 (1988); <em>Lilly v. Commonwealth, </em>258 Va. 548, 551, 523 S.E.2d 208, 209 (1999). Even if other evidence amply supports the obtained verdicts, the error is not harmless if \u201cthe disputed testimony may well have affected the ... decision.\u201d <em>Cartera v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 516, 519, 248 S.E.2d 784, 786 (1978). Whether the error was harmless requires consideration of a host of factors including \u201c\u2018the importance of the witness\u2019 testimony in the prosecution\u2019s case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>of the witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and, of course, the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case.\u2019\u201d <em>Dearing v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 671, 673, 536 S.E.2d 903, 904 (2000) (quoting <em>Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. at 684, 106 S.Ct. at 1438).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">I believe the unchallenged damaging testimony elicited during the re-direct examination of Rivera contributed to Cortez-Hernandez\u2019s conviction. During re-direct, Rivera identified Cortez-Hernandez as an unprovoked shooter, stating he was not involved in the prior physical altercation. He testified Cortez-Hernandez ran into the yard where Omar was standing, yelled a Mexican idiomatic phrase meaning \u201cI\u2019m going to finish you up,\u201d then \u201ctook out the gun and he pointed the gun, and ... started to move [it] around ... and he fired it. A few seconds went by, and he took it up again and he fired again.\u201d Rivera\u2019s testimony directly contradicted the testimony of Cortez-Hernandez and Jose Ontiveros on the issue of self-defense and served to corroborate the harmful testimony of Ruben Vasquez and Esteban Moreno. The court\u2019s ban on re-cross prevented Cortez-Hernandez from challenging any of Rivera\u2019s incriminating testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">I believe Rivera\u2019s testimony on re-direct, denied challenge on cross, necessarily contributed to Cortez-Hernandez\u2019s conviction. Accordingly, I would reverse his conviction on the grounds that the trial court violated his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">\n<em>TV. Evidentiary Objection to Denial of Re-cross</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Even if the constitutional error were not properly preserved, however, I believe the trial court\u2019s error is reversible pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-678. The majority cites Code \u00a7 8.01-678, but finds that Cortez-Hernandez\u2019s failure to proffer proposed cross-examination questions precludes appellate consideration of this assignment of error pursuant to Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">I disagree that a proffer is necessary in this case because the prejudice caused by the court\u2019s denial of re-cross-examination is apparent. The Commonwealth concedes the denial was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>error. Code \u00a7 8.01-678 permits reversal where it does <em>not </em>plainly appear that the parties had a \u201cfair trial on the merits____\u201d In my view, a fair trial on the merits presupposes the opportunity to cross-examine adversarial witnesses\u2014an opportunity denied to Cortez-Hernandez.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Undoubtedly, as the majority states, a proper proffer is required when a trial court <em>limits </em>the testimony of a witness and the proffer is required for the appellate court to determine whether the exclusion of the testimony prejudiced the party seeking it. <em>Graham v. Cook, </em>278 Va. 233, 249, 682 S.E.2d 535, 544 (2009). Where the trial court forecloses <em>altogether </em>any cross-examination of a crucial witness, however, a proffer is unnecessary to find prejudice. <em>See, e.g., Edwards v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 568, 572-73, 454 S.E.2d 1, 3 (1995) (finding prejudice in the absence of a proffer because there \u201cwas no way appellant could have proffered what a potential cross-examination answer would have been until he laid the initial foundation\u201d); <em>Craig v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 842, 845, 419 S.E.2d 429, 431 (1992) (finding prejudice without a proffer because the nature of the witness\u2019 response was unnecessary for the determination).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Cross-examination is the \u2018\u201cgreatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth.\u2019 \u201d <em>California v. Green, </em>399 U.S. 149, 158, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 1935, 26 L.Ed.2d 489 (1970) (citing 5 J. Wigmore, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 1367, p. 32). The opportunity for effective cross-examination is \u201c \u2018one of the safeguards essential to a fair trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pointer v. Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400, 404, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 1068, 13 L.Ed.2d 923 (1965) (quoting <em>Alford v. United States, </em>282 U.S. 687, 692, 51 S.Ct. 218, 219-20, 75 L.Ed. 624 (1931)).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Code \u00a7 8.01-678 safeguards a trial judge from reversal where it plainly appears that the parties had a fair trial on the merits. By foreclosing on Cortez-Hernandez\u2019s opportunity to cross-examine Rivera on the material issue of whether he was the unprovoked perpetrator of murder, however, the trial court denied Cortez-Hernandez a fair trial on the merits. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>Neither appellant\u2019s potential questions nor Rivera\u2019s expected responses are necessary to make this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">\n<em>V Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
