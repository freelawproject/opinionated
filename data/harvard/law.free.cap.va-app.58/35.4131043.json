After a bench trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>he was convicted of involuntary manslaughter, felony property damage, and one count of felony hit-and-run. On appeal, Scott challenges his convictions, arguing that the trial court erred because it (1) had insufficient evidence to convict him of involuntary manslaughter and felony hit-and-run; (2) imposed an excessive sentence upon him for involuntary manslaughter; and (3) concluded that criminally negligent conduct was sufficient to convict him of felony property damage under Code \u00a7 \u00eds^-mcB).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">We conclude Scott waived his right to appeal the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his convictions for involuntary manslaughter and felony hit-and-run by failing to raise these issues at trial. Further, Scott\u2019s sentence for involuntary manslaughter was not excessive. However, the trial court erred as a matter of law when it concluded that criminally negligent conduct was sufficient to convict Scott of felony property damage under Code \u00a7 18.2-137(B). Accordingly, we affirm the involuntary manslaughter and felony hit-and-run convictions, as well as the involuntary manslaughter sentence. However, we reverse the conviction for felony property damage, and we remand for re-sentencing on the lesser-included offense set forth in Code \u00a7 18.2-137(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">The relevant events leading to Scott\u2019s charges occurred late at night at a bar in Salem. Scott spent his evening at the bar, consuming four or five alcoholic drinks. Zane Blankenship and his brother also spent their evening at the bar drinking along with some other friends. At about 1:30 a.m., the bar announced \u201clast call\u201d and began herding customers outside. Witnessing a large crowd gathering outside the bar, a police officer parked his patrol car in a parking lot adjacent to the bar, leaving his headlights on to illuminate the area. Meanwhile, Scott left the bar and crossed the parking lot, headed toward his car. As he did so, Blankenship and several friends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>approached Scott. Apparently having some issue with Scott, Blankenship aggressively pushed Scott several times. Immediately thereafter, Scott got into his SUV, which was parked nearby, and recklessly drove out of the parking lot at a high speed<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> without his headlights on. His driving was so reckless that he almost lost control of his SUV. As he sped out of the lot, he struck and killed Blankenship, causing Blankenship to roll over the hood of Scott\u2019s SUV and shatter the windshield. According to the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, Scott also sideswiped Blankenship's brother, injuring his arm, and nearly struck Blankenship\u2019s friend, Eric Hughes. Despite striking Blankenship, Scott continued to speed out of the parking lot and hit the police car. In an attempt to readjust the path of his SUV after hitting the police car, Scott hit a parked SUV owned by Scott Guilliams. The value of the damage to Guilliams\u2019 SUV exceeded $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Scott was indicted for first-degree murder, malicious wounding, and attempted malicious wounding. He was also indicted for felony property damage under Code \u00a7 18,2-137(B) for the damage to Guilliams\u2019 SUV. Finally, he was indicted for three counts of felony hit-and-run.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At trial, the Commonwealth presented several witnesses and other evidence in support of its theory that Scott, at least indirectly through his other friends at the bar, had a dispute with Blankenship that started in the bar and escalated in the parking lot. According to the Commonwealth\u2019s theory, once Blankenship repeatedly pushed Scott in the parking lot, Scott threatened to get a gun and kill Blankenship, his brother, and his friends. The Commonwealth presented evidence that Scott blurted out \u201cwatch this\u201d to some bystanders after making this threat. Thus, the Commonwealth proposed that Scott\u2019s comment indicated he wished to carry out his threat to kill Blankenship and his friends, and he immediately did so by driving his car at high speed toward Blankenship.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>In contrast, Scott\u2019s defense rested on the proposition that he had no dispute with Blankenship or his friends and had no desire to fight or injure them. Instead, Scott claimed Blankenship wished to instigate a fight with him. This began in the parking lot when Blankenship repeatedly pushed him. According to Scott and other witnesses, after an aggressive push by Blankenship, Scott held out his hands with his palms out to indicate to Blankenship that he did not want to fight. Instead of saying \u201cwatch this\u201d after Blankenship pushed him, Scott testified that he probably said, \u201cF\u2014 this,\u201d indicating his frustration with Blankenship\u2019s bullying and, thus, simply indicating his desire to get away. Scott testified that while Blankenship pushed him, Scott heard someone say, \u201cGun.\u201d Hearing this, Scott feared for his safety. According to him, this fear caused him to frantically flee from the parking lot in his SUV. Scott admitted that he drove too fast and that he almost lost complete control of his SUV. However, he also testified that the police car\u2019s headlights blinded him as he drove out of the parking lot. Thus, Scott explained that, although he may have recklessly driven his car, he did so only to get away from the danger he perceived\u2014not to harm anyone. In that frantic rush to flee, he testified he was unable to see that he was about to strike Blankenship. He also testified that he did not see the police car until he actually struck it. Just like the Commonwealth, Scott introduced a significant amount of testimony and other evidence to support his theory of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Scott twice made a motion to strike the evidence, first after the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, and again after the close of all the evidence. During his first motion, Scott asked the trial court to strike the charge of felony property damage, arguing that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence failed to show \u201can intent to damage [Guilliams\u2019] vehicle.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>newed this request in his second motion, further arguing that there was \u201cno evidence that there was any intent [to damage] Mr. Guilliams\u2019 vehicle. It was clearly an accident.\u201d Scott also argued the evidence was insufficient to support the charges of murder, malicious wounding, and attempted malicious wounding. Notably, Scott\u2019s trial counsel said, \u201c[A]t this point[,] we would move to strike and argue that at most, the evidence supports involuntary manslaughter, [because there is] no evidence of a willful, deliberate, intentional act....\u201d She concluded by explaining, \u201cHe fled way too fast under the circumstances and at most at this juncture, it is involuntary manslaughter.\u201d Scott never argued the evidence was insufficient to support felony hit-and-run during either motion to strike, nor was the charge ever mentioned in either motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">The trial court denied each motion to strike. Following the motion to strike at the conclusion of all the evidence, the trial court said, \u201cThe defendant makes an interesting and one might think apparently valid argument with regard to the intentional property damage, except for the fact that the Court of Appeals of Virginia ... has said that even criminal negligence is sufficient to support a conviction under the statute.\u201d The trial court then proceeded to closing arguments, and again Scott argued he lacked the intent necessary to commit murder, malicious wounding, or attempted malicious wounding, explaining to the court that this was \u201can involuntary manslaughter case.\u201d He also argued that he lacked the intent necessary to commit felony property damage, and he again made no argument regarding felony hit-and-run.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">The trial court, sitting in place of a jury, found Scott guilty of involuntary manslaughter, felony property damage under Code \u00a7 18.2-137(B), and one count of felony hit-and-run. It acquitted him of malicious wounding and attempted malicious wounding. In rendering its judgment, the court explained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>that it had carefully considered the evidence, and concluded by saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-4\">The testimony about what Mr. Scott was doing is, with the exception of one witness, entirely consistent in that from the moment he began backing [up his SUV] through the moment he left the parking lot, he was going as fast as he could and had to back off slightly to avoid losing control when he went around the turn of the building. At 15 miles an hour, he covered 22 feet every second. At 25 miles an hour, 36 2/3rds feet.... I have doubt based on reason and the evidence that Mr. Scott intended to maim, disfigure, disable, or kill the two persons whom he is charged with maliciously wounding or attempting to maliciously wound. There is, from the evidence of a number of witnesses including one of those victims, reason to question whether the defendant could possibly have seen them. The intent, the specific intent to maim, disfigure, disable, or Mil is an element of the offense of malicious or unlawful wounding. I will find the defendant not guilty of those charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-5\">... I am not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the necessary intent to commit murder. I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the Mlling was the result of negligence so gross, wanton, and culpable as to show a recMess disregard of human life and without discussing it, that the elements of involuntary manslaughter have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Along with the sentences imposed for felony hit-and-run and felony property damage, the trial court sentenced Scott to ten years for involuntary manslaughter, with five years suspended. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">A. Hit-and-run and Involuntary Manslaughter Sufficiency</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">Scott argues the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions for involuntary manslaughter and felony hit- and-run. Because Scott never made these arguments at trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>we conclude that he has waived his right to challenge these convictions on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">Under Rule 5A:18,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cNo ruling of the trial court ... will be considered as a basis for reversal unless the objection was stated together with the grounds therefor at the time of the ruling....\u201d This rule \u201c\u2018require[s] that objections be promptly brought to the attention of the trial court with sufficient specificity that the alleged error can be dealt with and timely addressed and corrected when necessary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bazemore v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 203, 218, 590 S.E.2d 602, 609 (2004) (en banc) (quoting <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 126, 131, 380 S.E.2d 8, 10 (1989)). In order to preserve the question of sufficiency of the evidence in a bench trial, a defendant must present an appropriate argument in \u201c \u2018a motion to strike at the conclusion of all the evidence, present an appropriate argument in summation, or make a motion to set aside the verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>Delaney v. Commonwealth, </em>55 Va.App. 64, 66, 683 S.E.2d 834, 835 (2009) (quoting <em>Howard v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 473, 478, 465 S.E.2d 142, 144 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Here, Scott asks us to hold that the trial court erred when it ruled the evidence was sufficient to support convictions for involuntary manslaughter and felony hit-and-run. To do that, we must first conclude Scott asked the trial court to strike those charges. He did no such thing. He certainly asked the trial court to strike the first-degree murder charge when his counsel said, \u201c[A]t this pointf,] we would move to strike and argue that at most, the evidence supports involuntary manslaughter, [because there is] no evidence of a willful, deliberate, intentional act.\u201d However, this motion does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>also function as a motion to strike the involuntary manslaughter charge. It says nothing regarding the sufficiency of the evidence to support that crime, which does not require \u201ca willful, deliberate, intentional act,\u201d unlike first-degree murder. <em>Compare Clay v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 253, 257, 546 S.E.2d 728, 730 (2001) (describing first-degree murder as a \u201cwillful, deliberate, and premeditated\u201d killing), <em>with Noakes v. Commonwealth, </em>280 Va. 338, 345, 699 S.E.2d 284, 288 (2010) (describing involuntary manslaughter as an accidental killing occurring as the result \u201c \u2018of some unlawful, but not felonious, act\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018the improper performance of a lawful act\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Mundy v. Commonwealth, </em>144 Va. 609, 615, 131 S.E. 242, 244 (1926))). Rather, by making the motion, at best Scott\u2019s counsel merely asked the trial court to strike all of the homicide crimes <em>except </em>involuntary manslaughter. This became crystal clear when counsel concluded his second motion by saying, \u201c[A]t most at this juncture, it is involuntary manslaughter.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AY-\">Accordingly, Scott\u2019s second motion to strike never argued to the trial court the issue Scott now wishes us to decide in this appeal. Scott also never argued that the evidence was insufficient to support felony hit-and-run. In fact, we can find no place where Scott mentioned the phrase \u201chit-and-run\u201d anywhere in his two motions to strike or in his closing argument, or where he otherwise made any reference to this crime.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>strained reading of his argument below will not suffice\u2014Scott must have specifically challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to support felony hit-and-run, which he did not do.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, we hold that Scott did not properly object to the sufficiency of the evidence to support involuntary manslaughter or felony hit-and-run. Because he failed to properly object, he waived his right to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support the convictions for these crimes on appeal. Therefore, we affirm his convictions for these crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">B. Involuntary Manslaughter Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Scott also argues the trial court imposed an excessive sentence upon him when it sentenced him to ten years for involuntary manslaughter, with five years suspended. This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">We review the trial court\u2019s sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>Valentine v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 334, 339, 443 S.E.2d 445, 448 (1994). Given this deferential standard of review, we will not interfere with the sentence so long as it \u201c \u2018was within the range set by the legislature\u2019 \u201d for the particular crime of which the defendant was convicted. <em>Jett v. Commonwealth, </em>34 Va.App. 252, 256, 540 S.E.2d 511, 513 (2001) (quoting <em>Hudson v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 158, 160-61, 390 S.E.2d 509, 510 (1990)); <em>see also Valentine, </em>18 Va.App. at 339, 443 S.E.2d at 448 (holding that if the sentence does not exceed the maximum set by the legislature, \u201cthe sentence will not be overturned as being an abuse of discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>tion\u201d (quoting <em>Abdo v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 473, 479, 237 S.E.2d 900, 903 (1977))). Involuntary manslaughter is a Class 5 felony, Code \u00a7 18.2-36, punishable by imprisonment for one to ten years, Code \u00a7 18.2-10(e). Here, Scott was sentenced to ten years imprisonment, which falls within the statutory range set by the legislature. Thus, no abuse of discretion occurred, and we therefore affirm the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">C. Property Damage Under Code \u00a7 18.2-137(B)</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Scott finally assigns error to his conviction for felony property damage under Code \u00a7 18.2-137(B). He argues the trial court erred as a matter of law when it applied our decision in <em>Crowder v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 382, 429 S.E.2d 893, <em>aff'd en banc, </em>17 Va.App. 202, 436 S.E.2d 192 (1993), to convict him on the basis that \u201ceven criminal negligence is sufficient to support a conviction under the statute.\u201d Scott further argues the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction under the statute as properly understood. In contrast, the Commonwealth argues that Code \u00a7 18.2-187(B) punishes a volitional act performed by a person that causes damage to the property of another, without regard to whether the person specifically intends to damage the property by that act. We agree with Scott that the trial court erred as a matter of law when it interpreted Code \u00a7 18.2-137(B). Accordingly, we reverse Scott\u2019s conviction under that section. Because the trial court found as a matter of fact that Scott\u2019s behavior was criminally negligent, we remand for re-sentencing on the lesser-included offense set forth in Code \u00a7 18.2-137(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">The Commonwealth claims on appeal, as it did below, that our decision in <em>Crowder </em>controls this case. Based on this argument, the trial court relied on <em>Crowder </em>and rejected Scott\u2019s argument. The trial court reasoned that \u201cthe Court of Appeals of Virginia ... has said that even criminal negligence is sufficient to support a conviction under the statute.\u201d In 1993, we held in <em>Crowder </em>that Code \u00a7 18.2-137, as it was then written, made it a crime for a person to damage the property of another by a criminally negligent act. <em>Crowder, </em>16 Va.App. at 384-85, 429 S.E.2d at 894. At that time, Code \u00a7 18.2-137 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>merely provided that \u201cif any person <em>unlawfully </em>destroys, defaces [or] damages ... any property, real or personal, not his own, ... he shall be guilty of\u2019 a Class 1 misdemeanor if the damage is less than $1,000, or a Class 6 felony if the damage exceeds $1,000. Code \u00a7 18.2-137 (Supp.1993) (emphasis added); <em>see also Crowder, </em>16 Va.App. at 385, 429 S.E.2d at 894 (addressing only the misdemeanor charge). However, in 1999, the General Assembly amended Code \u00a7 18.2-137, such that it now reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-5\">A. If any person <em>unlawfully </em>destroys, defaces, [or] damages ... any property, real or personal, not his own, ... he shall be guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-6\">B. If any person <em>intentionally </em>causes such injury, he shall be guilty of (i) a Class 1 misdemeanor if the value of or damage to the property ... is less than $1,000 or (ii) a Class 6 felony if the value of or damage to the property ... is $1,000 or more.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">(Emphasis added). Obviously, Code \u00a7 18.2-137 has changed significantly since we decided <em>Crowder </em>in 1993. Thus, the Commonwealth\u2019s insistence that <em>Crowder </em>is dispositive of the issue before us is misguided. <em>Crowder </em>interpreted Code \u00a7 18.2-137 as it existed in 1993, not as it now exists after the 1999 amendment that substantially altered it. Because of that substantial alteration, we must interpret the statute anew.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">\u201c \u2018[A]n issue of statutory interpretation is a pure question of law which we review de novo.\u2019 \u201d <em>Evans v. Evans, </em>280 Va. 76, 82, 695 S.E.2d 173, 176 (2010) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Conyers v. Martial Arts World of Richmond, Inc., </em>273 Va. 96, 104, 639 S.E.2d 174, 178 (2007)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-9\">\u201cWhen the language of a statute is unambiguous, we are bound by the plain meaning of that language. Furthermore, we must give effect to the legislature\u2019s intention as expressed by the language used unless a literal interpretation of the language would result in a manifest absurdity. If a statute is subject to more than one interpretation, we must apply the interpretation that will carry out the legislative intent behind the statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AS0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Conyers, </em>273 Va. at 104, 639 S.E.2d at 178). Accordingly, \u201c \u2018[t]he plain, obvious, and rational meaning of a statute is to be preferred over any curious, narrow, or strained construction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration in original) (quoting <em>Commonwealth v. Zamani, </em>256 Va. 391, 395, 507 S.E.2d 608, 609 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">We must also note that when the legislature amends a particular statute, we normally presume that \u201c\u2018a change in law was intended.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wisniewski v. Johnson, </em>223 Va. 141, 144, 286 S.E.2d 223, 225 (1982) (quoting <em>Boyd v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 16, 20, 215 S.E.2d 915, 918 (1975)). \u201c \u2018[W]here the General Assembly acts in an area in which this Court has already spoken, it is presumed to know the law as the Court has stated it and to acquiesce therein.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bell v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 693, 699, 467 S.E.2d 289, 292 (1996) (quoting <em>Fortune v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 643, 650, 406 S.E.2d 47, 50 (1991)); <em>see also Powers v. Cnty. Sch. Bd., </em>148 Va. 661, 669, 139 S.E. 262, 264 (1927) (stating that we presume the legislature acts \u201c \u2018with full knowledge of the law as it stands bearing upon the subject with which it proposes to deal\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Sch. Bd. v. Patterson, </em>111 Va. 482, 488, 69 S.E. 337, 339 (1910))). Thus, when the legislature amends a statute following a court decision construing the statute, we presume the legislature amended the statute with that decision in mind. <em>Williams\u2019 Adm\u2019r v. Dean, </em>144 Va. 831, 842-43, 131 S.E. 1, 4 (1925); <em>see Bell, </em>21 Va.App. at 693, 467 S.E.2d at 292; <em>Powers, </em>148 Va. at 669, 139 S.E. at 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">When we consider these canons of statutory construction, we conclude that Code \u00a7 18.2-137(B) attaches criminal liability when a person performs a volitional act that damages the property of another <em>and </em>the person specifically intends to cause damage to the property by that act. Contrary to the Commonwealth\u2019s argument, Code \u00a7 18.2-137(B) does not criminalize the mere performance of a volitional act conducted in a criminally negligent manner that happens to damage the property of another. A plain reading of the statute, with due consideration to the words used and their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>context in the overall statutory scheme, assures us that the legislature intended this reading when it amended Code \u00a7 18.2-137 in 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">We begin our analysis with the first part of Code \u00a7 18.2-137. We first note that Code \u00a7 18.2-137(A) retains the pre-amendment <em>mens rea </em>language of the statute, attaching criminal liability when a person \u201cunlawfully\u201d damages the property of another. As we explained in <em>Crowder, </em>an \u201cunlawful\u201d act includes the volitional performance of \u201ca lawful act in a criminally negligent manner.\u201d <em>Crowder, </em>16 Va.App. at 385, 429 S.E.2d at 894 (citing several cases). Unlike the preamendment language, Code \u00a7 18.2-137(A) does not punish the act more severely based on the extent of the damage. Instead, Code \u00a7 18.2-137(A) simply makes unlawful property damage a Class 3 misdemeanor, which is punishable by \u201ca fine of not more than $500.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-ll(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">In contrast, Code \u00a7 18.2-137(B) retains different levels of punishment based on the extent of the damage caused to the property, just as the pre-amendment statute did. Further, unlike Code \u00a7 18.2-137(A) and the pre-amendment statute, Code \u00a7 18.2-137(B) makes it criminal for a person to \u201cintentionally cause [the] injury\u201d described in Code \u00a7 18.2-137(A). For that \u201cintentional ]\u201d damage, Code \u00a7 18.2-137(B) makes the person guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor if the damage is less than $1,000, or makes the person guilty of a Class 6 felony if the damage is $1,000 or more. Thus, a person who intentionally damages the property of another is subject to much stiffer penalties than a person who merely unlawfully damages the property of another. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-ll(a) (making a Class 1 misdemeanor punishable by \u201cconfinement in jail for not more than twelve months and a fine of not more than $2,500, either or both\u201d); Code \u00a7 18.2-10(f) (making a Class 6 felony punishable by imprisonment up to five years).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">In light of this scheme, it is apparent to us that Code \u00a7 18.2-137 distinguishes criminal liability based on the <em>mens rea </em>accompanying the proscribed act. In contrast to this plain reading of the statute, the Commonwealth would have us read <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>the statute so that criminally negligent conduct falls under Code \u00a7 18.2-137(B), even though that subsection uses the word \u201cintentionally.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This reading is problematic for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">First, by reading the statute in this manner, the Commonwealth renders Code \u00a7 18.2-137(A) meaningless. The word \u201cunlawfully\u201d must mean something different than the word \u201cintentionally.\u201d Because Code \u00a7 18.2-137(A) punishes a person less severely for \u201cunlawfully\u201d damaging the property of another, as opposed to \u201cintentionally\u201d damaging the property of another as proscribed by Code \u00a7 18.2-137(B), it follows that the word \u201cunlawfully\u201d must connote a less culpable mental state than the word \u201cintentionally.\u201d In general, the lowest level of <em>mens rea </em>is criminal negligence. <em>See Lewis v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 684, 687, 179 S.E.2d 506, 509 (1971) (explaining that generally the line between criminal and civil liability is drawn between criminal negligence and simple negligence); <em>Zirkle v. Commonwealth, </em>189 Va. 862, 868, 55 S.E.2d 24, 28 (1949) (explaining that criminal negligence must be proved in a criminal proceeding, not some lesser standard that may be appropriate in a civil proceeding); <em>Tubman v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 267, 274, 348 S.E.2d 871, 875 (1986) (explaining that a negligent act done without recklessness gives rise to only civil liability, but a reckless, or criminally negligent, act crosses the line into criminal liability). Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>the Commonwealth implausibly reads Code \u00a7 18.2-137(B) to punish the lowest <em>mens rea </em>with relatively high penalties. However, if Code \u00a7 18.2-137(B) punishes the lowest level of <em>mens rea </em>required for criminal liability, there is no lesser <em>mens rea </em>to which Code \u00a7 18.2-137(A) can apply. Therefore, the Commonwealth\u2019s reading of Code \u00a7 18.2-137(B) renders Code \u00a7 18.2-137(A) meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Second, the Commonwealth\u2019s reading ignores our traditional understanding of the word \u201cunlawfully\u201d and the conduct usually proscribed by that word. \u201cUnlawfully\u201d was the only <em>mens rea </em>term in the pre-amendment version of Code \u00a7 18.2-137. As we explained in <em>Crowder, </em>by using the word \u201cunlawfully,\u201d the pre-amendment statute attached criminal liability \u201cwhen property is damaged or destroyed during the commission of an unlawful act, which includes the performance of a lawful act <em>in a criminally negligent manner.\u201d Crowder, </em>16 Va.App. at 385, 429 S.E.2d at 894 (emphasis added) (citing several cases). Other cases have similarly construed this term to include criminally negligent conduct. <em>See, e.g., Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>278 Va. 523, 528, 685 S.E.2d 43, 45-46 (2009) (defining an unlawful act as one \u201cdemonstrating criminal negligence\u201d); <em>Gooden v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 565, 571, 311 S.E.2d 780, 784 (1984) (explaining that involuntary manslaughter requires the performance of an unlawful act, which includes a criminally negligent act). We see no reason to depart from the traditional understanding of the word \u201cunlawfully\u201d in this case. Thus, since \u201cunlawfully\u201d applies to criminally negligent conduct and since the legislature evidently intended its use of the word \u201cintentionally\u201d in Code \u00a7 18.2-137(B) to connote a higher level of <em>mens rea </em>than that covered by \u201cunlawfully\u201d in Code \u00a7 18.2-137(A), we reject the Commonwealth\u2019s interpretation of Code \u00a7 18.2-137(B) as applying to criminally negligent conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">For these reasons, we cannot adopt the Commonwealth\u2019s strained interpretation of Code \u00a7 18.2-137. In essence, the Commonwealth would have us give no effect to the legislature\u2019s significant amendment to Code \u00a7 18.2-137. In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>stead, it would have us continue to apply the statute as if it has not changed since 1993. However, as we have shown, the legislature\u2019s significant changes to Code \u00a7 18.2-137 have created a new statutory scheme that punishes a person differently based on the <em>mens rea </em>accompanying his act. Code \u00a7 18.2-137(B) attaches criminal liability when a person performs a volitional act that damages the property of another <em>and </em>the person specifically intends to cause damage to the property by that act. Code \u00a7 18.2-137(B) does not cover criminally negligent conduct\u2014instead, such conduct falls under Code \u00a7 18.2-137(A). Thus, the trial court erred as a matter of law when it interpreted Code \u00a7 18.2-137(B) as covering criminally negligent conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">As the trial court explained, it viewed Scott\u2019s actions as unintentional.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This is why the trial court acquitted Scott of malicious wounding, attempted malicious wounding, and murder. Those crimes all share one thing in common\u2014they require the specific intent to kill or to cause serious bodily injury, which the trial court was unable to find beyond a reasonable doubt. Nonetheless, the trial court concluded as a matter of fact that Scott\u2019s reckless driving amounted to \u201cnegligence so gross, wanton, and culpable as to show a reckless disregard of human life,\u201d i.e., that it was criminally negligent.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See Noakes, </em>280 Va. at 346, 699 S.E.2d at 288-89 (describing the performance of a lawful act in a manner that is \u201c \u2018so gross and culpable as to indicate a callous disregard of human life\u2019 \u201d as criminally negligent (quoting <em>Beck v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 1, 4, 216 S.E.2d 8, 10 (1975))). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>Thus, the trial court found Scott guilty of involuntary manslaughter because his criminally negligent conduct resulted in the death of Blankenship. Because that conduct also resulted in the damage to Guilliams\u2019 SUV, Scott still is criminally liable under Code \u00a7 18.2-137(A). Therefore, we remand to the trial court for re-sentencing under Code \u00a7 18.2-137(A).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that Scott waived his right to appeal the sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions for involuntary manslaughter and felony hit- and-run. We also conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it sentenced him to a term of imprisonment for involuntary manslaughter that was within the range set by the legislature. Finally, we conclude that the trial court erred as a matter of law when it incorrectly interpreted and applied Code \u00a7 18.2-137(B) and found Scott guilty under the statute. Therefore, we affirm Scott\u2019s convictions for involuntary manslaughter and felony hit-and-run, as well as Scott\u2019s sentence for involuntary manslaughter, but we reverse his conviction for felony property damage under Code \u00a7 18.2-137(B). Because Scott\u2019s actions make him criminally liable under Code \u00a7 18.2-137(A), we remand for re-sentencing under that subsection.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b85-9\">. We have condensed and re-ordered Scott\u2019s assignments of error so that we may more efficiently address them in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b86-6\">. One witness estimated Scott was driving 40 miles per hour.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b86-7\">. The Commonwealth later moved to <em>nolle prosequi </em>two of the indictments for felony hit-and-run.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b87-6\">. In an attempt to explain Code \u00a7 18.2-137(B) to the trial court, Scott\u2019s counsel said in his first motion that the section \"requires unlawful, felonious, and intentionally [sic]. That\u2019s not the disjunctive. That\u2019s the conjunctive. It requires all three.\u201d This incorrect and imprecise explanation does not do justice to the statutory scheme, as we explain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>in further detail below. <em>Compare </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-137(B) (making it a Class 1 misdemeanor or Class 6 felony for \"any person [to] intentionally cause[]\u201d damage to another\u2019s property, depending on the extent of the damage), <em>with </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-137(A) (making it a Class 3 misdemeanor to \"unlawfully\u201d damage another\u2019s property).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b90-6\">. Effective July 1, 2010, Rule 5A:18 was revised to state that \"[n]o ruling of the trial court ... will be considered as a basis for reversal unless an objection was stated with reasonable certainty at the time of the ruling____\u201d Because the proceedings below were completed prior to this revision taking effect, we will rely on the language of Rule 5A:18 that was then in effect. <em>See Fails v. Va. State Bar, </em>265 Va. 3, 5 n. 1, 574 S.E.2d 530, 531 n. 1 (2003) (applying the Rule of Court in effect at the time of the proceedings below).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b91-5\">. The Commonwealth claims Scott\u2019s trial counsel admitted his guilt when she characterized her client's actions as best fitting involuntary manslaughter. The Commonwealth would therefore have us hold that Scott may not challenge his conviction on appeal when he urged the trial court to find him guilty of the offense. In reply, Scott argues he never admitted he was guilty of any crime. Rather, he argued \"that the Commonwealth has not proven the necessary intent to prove murder or even voluntary manslaughter.\u201d We agree with Scott that he did not admit his guilt, but it does not follow that he preserved a sufficiency challenge to involuntary manslaughter. To do that, he needed to specifically attack the sufficiency of the evidence to support involuntary manslaughter, which he did not do.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b91-6\">. Before this Court, Scott argues the trial court erred for two reasons. First, he argues that Code \u00a7 46.2-894 makes a person\u2019s failure to stop at the scene of an accident criminal only when the person knows that the accident has resulted in the injury or death of another or has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>resulted in property damage. Second, he argues that an exception in Code \u00a7 46.2-894 shields him from criminal liability because he claims to have sustained injuries in the accident that prevented his compliance. These arguments were never made to the trial court, and therefore we do not reach their merits on appeal. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b92-9\">. At oral argument before this Court, Scott claimed he \u201cimplicitly\u201d argued the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction of felony hit-and-run based on the totality of his closing argument that emphasized his lack of intent. In making that argument, Scott virtually concedes that he failed to make the appropriate argument with the sufficient specificity required by Rule 5A:18. <em>See Bazemore, </em>42 Va.App. at 218, 590 S.E.2d at 609.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b97-6\">. The Commonwealth vaguely asserts in its brief that Code \u00a7 18.2-137(B) \"merely provides an enhanced punishment.\u201d At oral argument, the Commonwealth explained that it viewed the statute as giving a trial court the discretion to impose only a fine under Code \u00a7 18.2-137(A) when a person has exceedingly minor criminal culpability even though the <em>mens rea </em>required under both subsections is purportedly the same. However, the legislature certainly knows how to make a law giving trial courts such discretion if it wants to. <em>See, e.g., </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-869 (providing that \"upon the trial of any person charged with reckless driving <em>where the degree of culpability is slight, </em>the court in its discretion may find the accused not guilty of reckless driving but guilty of improper driving,\u201d which is a mere traffic infraction punishable by a fine (emphasis added)). We conclude the legislature did not intend to make such a law here. <em>Compare </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-869 (using specific language to give discretion to the trial court to give a reduced punishment for slight culpability), <em>with </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-137 (using no such language).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b99-6\">. Because of this finding, we leave for another day the question of whether an unintended consequence can be so probable and foreseeable as to be deemed intentional under the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b99-7\">. \" \u2018We are bound by the trial court's factual findings unless those findings are plainly wrong or unsupported by the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>McGhee </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>280 Va. 620, 623, 701 S.E.2d 58, 59 (2010) (quoting <em>Whitehead v. Commonwealth, </em>278 Va. 300, 306-07, 683 S.E.2d 299, 301 (2009)). Here, the trial court was not plainly wrong when it found that Scott\u2019s behavior was criminally negligent, and so that finding binds us on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b100-8\">. At oral argument, Scott consented to have the case remanded for re-sentencing for the lesser-included offense set forth in Code \u00a7 18.2-137(A). Because the evidence and the trial court\u2019s factual finding confirm Scott\u2019s guilt under Code \u00a7 18.2-137(A), and because Scott has consented to this relief, we remand the case for re-sentencing under Code \u00a7 18.2-137(A). <em>See Britt v. Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 569, 576, 667 S.E.2d 763, 766-67 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
