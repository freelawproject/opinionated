For the reasons stated, we agree with appellant that the commission committed reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">Anthony Sifford and Gena Sifford were married September 10,1988. Two children were born of that union, William Isaac Sifford, born October 2, 1989 (now an adult) and Hannah Faythe Sifford (a minor), born August 13, 1996. During the marriage, the parties purchased a home that they shared as their marital residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">During the marriage, Mr. Sifford worked full-time as a truck driver. Ms. Sifford worked part-time as a substitute teacher and gymnastics instructor, earning approximately $600 per month. She testified she was dependent on her husband\u2019s income. In January 2008, due to marital difficulties, the Siffords moved into separate bedrooms within their marital residence. Because of his job, Mr. Sifford would be away from home five or six days per week. When he was home he lived in the marital residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">The couple entered into a written settlement agreement on May 5, 2008, which stated the parties\u2019 intent to resolve their respective rights and duties as to custody and support of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>children, as well as support for each other. The agreement provided, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-4\">1. Vehicles\u2014Ms. Sifford was to make note payments on her vehicle, but Mr. Sifford was to carry liability insurance on that vehicle until the debt was paid or Ms. Sifford left the marital home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-5\">2. <em>Spousal </em>support\u2014Each spouse waived spousal support.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-6\">3. <em>Child </em>support\u2014Mr. Sifford was to pay no child support but was to pay \u201call expenses associated with the home and [] attempt to provide additional support for the minor child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-7\">4. <em>Health </em>insurance\u2014Mr. Sifford agreed to carry health, dental, and optometric insurance on Ms. Sifford and the children as long as they remained insurable under his policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">Ms. Sifford testified that Mr. Sifford paid the following expenses: house payment, health insurance, homeowner\u2019s insurance, life insurance (Ms. Sifford was the sole beneficiary of Mr. Sifford\u2019s policy), taxes, utilities, cable bill, and cell phone bill.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Ms. Sifford paid no rent to Mr. Sifford for her use of the basement quarters. Ms. Sifford testified she never reimbursed her husband for any of those payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">At the time she executed the agreement, Ms. Sifford testified she could not survive on the $600 per month she earned from her part-time employment. Ms. Sifford testified she paid her car payment, one credit card obligation, some groceries, her uninsured medical expenses, and her own clothing. On September 15, 2008, Ms. Sifford began working 35 hours per week as a teacher\u2019s aide, earning $11,100 per year. Mr. Sifford died on September 24, 2008 in a work-related accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">The parties shared a joint checking account into which the parties\u2019 paychecks were deposited. Ms. Sifford bought groceries, paid medical expenses for herself and Hannah, and paid for Hannah\u2019s clothing, all from that joint account.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>Ms. Sifford\u2019s claim for death benefits was denied by the deputy commissioner. The full commission affirmed the deputy commissioner\u2019s opinion, concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-4\">In this case, the couple agreed that, in lieu of child support, Anthony Sifford would pay the household expenses. The wife agreed to remain in the marital home, separate and apart, in order to protect the minor child from disruption. There is no evidence that the husband paid any additional money to his wife or that her \u201cstation in life\u201d required extra money from him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-5\">The evidence is that the couple reached a civil agreement to the benefit of their minor child. Now the child is entitled to benefits to replace Anthony Sifford\u2019s payment of household expenses. He paid the living expenses of the minor child and reached an agreement with Gena Sifford that she remain within the marital home to prevent any disruption in the child\u2019s life. The wife obtained a part-time job and has since obtained a better job. She is not earning what her husband earned, but this is not something we can consider.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-6\">This appeal follows.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">Appellant asserts the commission erred in determining Ms. Sifford was not entitled to death benefits under Code \u00a7 65.2-512. She argues she was \u201cactually dependent\u201d upon her husband at the time of his death, pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-515. The issue before us is whether appellant was \u201cactually dependent\u201d on Mr. Sifford.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">Under Code \u00a7 65.2-512(A)(l), if death results from an accident covered by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, the decedent\u2019s employer must pay death benefits \u201cto those persons presumed to be wholly dependent upon the deceased employee as set forth in subdivision A 1, A 2, and A 3 of \u00a7 65.2-515.\u201d Under Code \u00a7 65.2\u2014515(A)(1), a wife is conclusively presumed to be dependent \u201cupon a husband whom she had not voluntarily deserted or abandoned at the time of the accident<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>whom she lived at the time of his accident, if she is then actually dependent upon him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">To be \u201cactually dependent\u201d under the section, the wife \u201cneed only establish partial dependency.\u201d <em>Caudle-Hyatt, Inc. v. Mixon, </em>220 Va. 495, 499, 260 S.E.2d 193, 195 (1979). However, she must prove that her husband \u201ccontributed with some degree of regularity, and such contributions must have been relied upon by the claimant for reasonable necessaries consistent with ... her station in life.\u201d <em>Armada, Inc. v. Lucas, </em>2 Va.App. 414, 418, 345 S.E.2d 14, 16 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">In <em>Roanoke Belt, Inc. v. Mroczkowski, </em>20 Va.App. 60, 67, 455 S.E.2d 267, 271 (1995), we noted that \u201cfindings concerning the status of presumptive dependents are factual determinations.\u201d <em>See Kelly v. Pendleton Constr. Co., </em>182 Va. 191, 194, 28 S.E.2d 621, 623 (1944). However, we further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-7\">[T]he principal issues raised by this appeal relate not to the factual findings of the commission, but to its application of the law to those findings. Accordingly, these issues are mixed questions of law and fact. <em>Cf. Franklin Mortgage Corp. v. Walker, </em>6 Va.App. 108, 110, 367 S.E.2d 191, 192 (1988) <em>(en </em>banc) (finding that an injury arose out of and in the course of employment is a mixed question of law and fact). Accordingly, while we must defer to the factual findings of the commission with respect to Mrs. Mroczkowski\u2019s finances and work capacity, <em>cf. id. </em>at 110-11, 367 S.E.2d at 193, we review <em>de novo </em>the commission\u2019s application of the law to those findings in determining whether she was destitute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-8\"><em>Roanoke Belt, </em>20 Va.App. at 68, 455 S.E.2d at 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">How much Mr. Sifford paid Ms. Sifford, whether he paid regularly or sporadically, and whether Ms. Sifford relied on that money are factual determinations. But having made those factual determinations, whether Ms. Sifford was actually dependent on Mr. Sifford, i.e. the application of the law to those facts, is a legal determination, subject to <em>de novo </em>review. Like <em>Roanoke Belt, </em>the instant appeal does not contest the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>commission\u2019s factual findings, but only the application of the law to those facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">Here, the facts are not controverted. Indeed, the commission found that Mr. Sifford paid all household expenses, including but not limited to homeowner\u2019s insurance, the mortgage, utilities, and health insurance, that the parties owned a joint checking account which Ms. Sifford used to pay groceries, and that Ms. Sifford lived in the marital residence rent free.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The ultimate determination, under these facts, of whether Ms. Sifford was \u201cactually dependent\u201d on Mr. Sifford remains a legal determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">In <em>Mixon, </em>220 Va. 495, 260 S.E.2d 193, the Supreme Court of Virginia found the decedent\u2019s wife to be \u201cactually dependent,\u201d and therefore entitled to death benefits. Mr. and Mrs. Mixon had purchased a home together and commingled their funds. Ms. Mixon had been employed as a teacher for 30 years but testified, \u201cI could certainly have continued to live on what we (Mrs. Mixon and her child) made but I think what [her husband] brought in helped us live a little bit above that.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 497, 260 S.E.2d at 194. Under those facts, the Supreme Court of Virginia held \u201cthat the conclusive presumption of Code \u00a7 65.1-66 (now Code \u00a7 65.2-515) arises once actual dependency, even though only partial, has been established.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 499, 260 S.E.2d at 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">The <em>Mixon </em>Court defined dependency under what is now Code \u00a7 65.2-515 as meaning that \u201cthe claimant looked to and relied on the contributions of the employee, \u2018 \u201cin whole or in part, as a means of support and maintenance in accordance with his or her social position and accustomed mode of life.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Miller &amp; Long Co. v. Frye, </em>215 Va. 591, 594, 212 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>S.E.2d 258, 260 (1975) (quoting <em>Glassco v. Glassco, </em>195 Va. 239, 242, 77 S.E.2d 843, 845 (1953))). The Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-F\">The evidence in this case establishes that Lucille Mixon and her husband had both contributed funds towards the purchase of a new home, that they had commingled their funds, and that her husband\u2019s salary enabled them to \u201clive a little bit above\u201d the standard of living otherwise attainable. This evidence sufficiently demonstrates that, in actuality, she was at least partially dependent upon her husband. Consequently, under the language of Code \u00a7 65.1-66, she is conclusively presumed to be wholly dependent upon him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Agb\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">It is clear from <em>Mixon </em>that one need not be destitute or wholly dependent on the decedent to be \u201cactually dependent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">In <em>Armada, </em>this Court provided insight as to when the surviving spouse was not \u201cactually\u201d dependent upon her deceased husband. The contrast in facts between <em>Armada </em>and the present case is significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Mr. and Ms. Lucas had been separated prior to his death. Ms. Lucas moved in with her father after the separation. During the 46 months from their separation until Mr. Lucas\u2019 death, he made no monthly or other regular payments to Ms. Lucas. Her evidence of dependency was that Mr. Lucas would give her money when she needed it, but she was unable to quantify the amount; he occasionally paid her auto repair bills and took her to lunch from time to time. We concluded Ms. Lucas failed to establish \u201cshe relied on the decedent\u2019s contributions as a means of support in accordance with her accustomed life style.\u201d <em>Armada, 2 </em>Va.App. at 418, 345 S.E.2d at 16. We noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-7\">The few instances where Mr. Lucas gave Mrs. Lucas money occurred when she asked him for it. Mr. Lucas made no contributions with any degree of regularity, upon which Mrs. Lucas could have relied. She was employed full time and assisted in the support of her father. We hold that there was no credible evidence upon which the commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>could have relied in finding that Mrs. Lucas was actually dependent upon her husband.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 418-19, 345 S.E.2d at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">Here, in the present case, the commission erred in focusing on the purpose of the settlement agreement, rather than the effect of that agreement. The commission concluded the agreement was to benefit the child. We do not dispute that finding. However, the effect of the agreement was to provide regular support for Ms. Sifford as well. Clearly, Ms. Sifford was a beneficiary of that agreement, and as Commissioner Diamond indicated in the dissent, the majority did not assess Ms. Sifford\u2019s dependency.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">The uncontroverted evidence in this case supports Ms. Sifford\u2019s claim for death benefits. She relied upon her husband to maintain her accustomed standard of living. She lived in the marital home rent-free. Mr. Sifford paid all household expenses, including the mortgage, utilities, and cable bill. He also paid all taxes.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Mr. Sifford carried health, dental, and optometric insurance on both Ms. Sifford and the children. Mr. Sifford also paid for the insurance on Ms. Sifford\u2019s car and paid her cell phone bills. Ms. Sifford did not and was not expected to reimburse Mr. Sifford for any of these expenditures. The parties commingled their earnings into a joint checking account. Finally, Ms. Sifford testified she could not survive on her part-time earnings. This overwhelming, uncontroverted evidence clearly demonstrates that Ms. Sifford relied on Mr. Sifford for her reasonable necessaries. <em>See Armada, 2 </em>Va.App. at 418, 345 S.E.2d at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">Further, the commission\u2019s factual findings did not refute any of the facts. The fact that Ms. Sifford waived spousal support is of no moment in light of the fact that Mr. Sifford continued to support both his wife and their minor daughter. Whether a spouse voluntarily has agreed to forfeit spousal support is a matter that is legally distinct from the question of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>whether the spouse is actually dependent under Code \u00a7 65.2-512. The spouse\u2019s eligibility for benefits under Code \u00a7 65.2-512 hinges on the application of the statutory criteria, not a separate and unrelated agreement by the parties. This conclusion is bolstered by the remedial nature of the workers\u2019 compensation statute. <em>See, e.g., Corporate Res. Mgmt. v. Southers, </em>51 Va.App. 118, 126, 655 S.E.2d 34, 38 (2008) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Court-ordered spousal support is only one means of support and is not the exclusive means. Support is simply \u201csustenance and maintenance, esp., articles such as food or clothing that allow one to live in the degree of comfort to which one is accustomed.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1577 (9th ed.2009). It is further defined as \u201cone or more monetary payments to a current or former family member for the purpose of helping the recipient maintain an acceptable standard of living.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1578. Spousal support, or alimony, is \u201ca court-ordered allowance that one spouse pays to the other spouse for maintenance and support while they are separated, while they are involved in a matrimonial lawsuit, or after they are divorced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">The evidence is uncontroverted that Mr. Sifford supported his wife on a regular basis and that she relied on that support for reasonable necessaries. Ms. Sifford was actually dependent upon Mr. Sifford at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">The commission erred in finding Ms. Sifford was not actually dependent on Mr. Sifford and was therefore not entitled to death benefits after Mr. Sifford\u2019s death. We therefore reverse the commission\u2019s decision as it pertains to Ms. Sifford and remand for the commission to award Ms. Sifford death benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b770-10\">. Hannah Faythe Sifford and her adult brother, William Isaac Sifford, were awarded death benefits by the commission.
