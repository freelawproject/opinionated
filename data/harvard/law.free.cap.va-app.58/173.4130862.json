Morris, II, a commercial truck driver, operated a tractor-trailer in violation of vehicle width and load securing requirements. On appeal, Morris claims the court should have suppressed the evidence of his violations because the investigating police officer unlawfully stopped his tractor-trailer. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">When reviewing a denial of a suppression motion, we review the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, giving it the benefit of any reasonable inferences.\u201d <em>Glenn v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 413, 416, 642 S.E.2d 282, 283 (2007) <em>(en </em>banc) (citation omitted), <em>aff'd, 275 </em>Va. 123, 654 S.E.2d 910 (2008). This standard requires us to \u201cgive due weight to inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>Malbrough v. Commonwealth, 275 </em>Va. 163, 169, 655 S.E.2d 1, 3 (2008) (citation omitted). In doing so, we \u201cconsider facts presented both at the suppression hearing and at trial.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, 57 </em>Va.App. 267, 270, 701 S.E.2d 87, 89 (2010) (quoting <em>Testa v. Commonwealth, </em>55 Va.App. 275, 279, 685 S.E.2d 213, 215 (2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">In this case, the record shows Officer F.D. Godwin of the Virginia Beach Police Department was certified by the Commonwealth to inspect commercial tractor-trailer loads. While on a mid-morning patrol in December 2008, Officer Godwin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>observed what he described as an \u201coversized load\u201d travel down an interstate highway and onto a municipal road in Virginia Beach. On the trailer was a large prefabricated concrete wall. The width of the load extended more than one foot over each side of the trailer chassis. Atop the over-wide load, which was approximately one foot high, sat various unsecured boxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">Relying on his experience and training, Officer Godwin believed the trailer was the standard width of 8 feet, 6 inches. The load on this trailer, he testified, was \u201changing well more than a foot on each side\u201d\u2014thus bringing the rig\u2019s apparent width to more than 10 feet, 6 inches. Under Code \u00a7 46.2-1109, \u201c[n]o commercial vehicle shall exceed 102 inches [8 feet, 6 inches] in width when operating on any interstate highway or on any highway designated by the Commonwealth Transportation Board.\u201d <em>See also </em>Virginia Beach City Code \u00a7 21-1(a) (applying state restrictions to municipal roads). The officer also observed two escort vehicles and oversize load signage on the trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The officer stopped the tractor-trailer for exceeding the statutory maximum load width. During the stop, Officer Godwin discovered the trailer load was 12 feet, 4 inches wide\u2014well over the statutory maximum of 8 feet, 6 inches. The officer asked Morris, the tractor-trailer driver, if he had a special permit authorizing a load exceeding the maximum statutory width. Morris produced a \u201cblanket\u201d hauling permit, but it did not authorize transport of a trailer load exceeding the 12-foot \u201cmaximum width that can be hauled on a blanket permit.\u201d Morris did not have a special \u201csingle-trip\u201d permit authorizing loads wider than 12 feet. In addition, Officer Godwin observed some unsecured rebar sitting on top of the load that, he testified, was \u201ccapable of rolling around.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Officer Godwin cited Morris for violating Virginia Beach City Code \u00a7 21-1 in two respects: (i) by exceeding the maximum width limitations, City Code \u00a7 21-1<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (incorporating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>by reference Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-1105(A)(4), 46.2-1109, 46.2-1139(A)),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (ii) by failing to properly secure the trailer load, City Code \u00a7 21-1 (incorporating by reference Code \u00a7 46.2-1156).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the trial court, Morris moved to suppress the evidence, claiming Officer Godwin had no legal basis to stop his tractor-trailer. The trial court disagreed, denied the motion to suppress, and found Morris guilty of both traffic infractions.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">On appeal, Morris argues the trial court misapplied Fourth Amendment principles. \u201cTo allow for roving warrantless inspections,\u201d Morris argues, \u201cwhere an officer can pull over whomever he chooses, whenever he chooses, provides absolutely no restraints on an officer\u2019s discretion and is an affront on the Fourth Amendment.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 7-8. We appreciate the general premise but do not believe it fairly describes the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>A. <em>Standard of Appellate Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">Faced with a suppression motion, a court should not limit itself \u201cto what the stopping officer says or to evidence of his subjective rationale,\u201d <em>Raab v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 577, 583 n. 2, 652 S.E.2d 144, 148 n. 2 (2007) <em>(en banc) </em>(citation omitted), but instead should make \u201c \u2018an objective assessment of the officer\u2019s actions in light of the facts and circumstances confronting him at the time,\u2019 and not on the officer\u2019s actual state of mind at the time the challenged action was taken,\u201d <em>Maryland v. Macon, </em>472 U.S. 463, 470-71, 105 S.Ct. 2778, 2783, 86 L.Ed.2d 370 (1985) (quoting <em>Scott v. United States, </em>436 U.S. 128, 136, 98 S.Ct. 1717, 1723, 56 L.Ed.2d 168 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">For purposes of assessing the legality of an officer\u2019s actions, his \u201csubjective motivation is irrelevant.\u201d <em>Robinson v. Commonwealth, </em>273 Va. 26, 37, 639 S.E.2d 217, 223 (2007) (quoting <em>Brigham City v. Stuart, </em>547 U.S. 398, 404, 126 S.Ct. 1943, 1948, 164 L.Ed.2d 650 (2006)). A police officer\u2019s \u201caction is \u2018reasonable\u2019 under the Fourth Amendment, regardless of the individual officer\u2019s state of mind, \u2018as long as the circumstances, viewed objectively, justify [the] action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thomas, </em>57 Va.App. at 273, 701 S.E.2d at 90 (quoting <em>Stuart, </em>547 U.S. at 404, 126 S.Ct. at 1948). <em>Cf. Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>279 Va. 665, 673, 691 S.E.2d 801, 805 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">B. <em>Overwide Tractor-Trailer Loads</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Much of the argument on brief, by both Morris and the City of Virginia Beach focuses on the administrative search and seizure exception to the Fourth Amendment and its application to the commercial trucking industry. <em>See generally United States v. Ponce-Aldona, </em>579 F.3d 1218, 1226 (11th Cir.2009).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Morris argues the exception does not apply to the stop of his tractor-trailer, while the City argues that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>As an appellate court, we seek \u201cthe best and narrowest ground available\u201d for our decision, <em>Armstead v. Commonwealth, </em>56 Va.App. 569, 576, 695 S.E.2d 561, 564 (2010), and thus strive to resolve cases \u201con what we conceive to be the determinative points,\u201d Justice Herbert B. Gregory, <em>Shorter Judicial Opinions, </em>34 Va. L.Rev. 362, 365 (1948). Consistent with this commitment, we need not decide whether the administrative search and seizure exception would authorize a suspicionless seizure of Morris\u2019s tractor-trailer.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In this case, the facts observed by Officer Godwin provided a reasonable suspicion to stop Morris\u2019s tractor-trailer.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Officer Godwin observed a trailer load exceeding the 8 foot, 6 inch width maximum under Code \u00a7 46.2-1109. <em>See also </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-1105(A)(4) (clarifying width restriction applies to \u201cload thereon\u201d); Code \u00a7 46.2-1111 (\u201cNor shall such load exceed a total outside width as prescribed by \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-1105 through 46.2-1109.\u201d). By itself, Officer Godwin\u2019s observation established a <em>prima facie </em>violation of the statutory width maximum. Morris concedes on appeal this would be true, and thus reasonable suspicion would justify the stop, were it <em>not </em>for the fact that the officer also saw escort vehicles and oversize load signage on the trailer. <em>See </em>Oral Argument Audio at 18:12 to 19:53. The presence of these precautions, Morris argues, suggested he had the requisite permit\u2014there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>by rendering unreasonable any suspicion the officer would have otherwise had to stop his truck. <em>Id. </em>We disagree for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">First, underlying Morris\u2019s argument is an anomaly\u2014the contention that an officer must presume a tractor-trailer, in apparent violation of the statutory maximum width, is <em>necessarily </em>exempt from the statute <em>if </em>the operator has taken certain precautions (such as the use of escort vehicles and oversize load signage) ordinarily required by the permitting authorities. If this premise were true, it would mean an officer could reasonably question whether there was a permit <em>only when </em>he has reason to believe that, if there <em>were </em>one, it was being violated. To be sure, Morris concedes on appeal that is just what he is saying. <em>Id. </em>at 19:25-53; <em>see also id. </em>at 16:43 to 16:56, 17:41 to 18:10.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The argument fails because it proves too much: It assumes police officers can enforce the permit requirements but not the statutory requirement that there be a permit in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The permitting scheme for oversized tractor-trailers traveling the municipal roads of Virginia Beach comes from Virginia Beach City Code \u00a7 21-501(a). It authorizes the Virginia Beach City Manager \u201cin his discretion, upon application in writing and good cause being shown\u201d to issue permits authorizing oversize commercial vehicles. <em>Id. </em>The permit may restrict the \u201croute to be traversed\u201d and may impose \u201cany other requirements or conditions deemed necessary by the City Manager.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The permitting scheme, therefore, does not itemize exact precautions from which a police officer could (or, rather, must) assume the presence of the permit. All the more, observation of some permit-like precautions says noth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>ing about the tractor-trailer\u2019s compliance with any route restrictions, time limits, or oversize maximum width allowances.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">We faced an analogous situation in <em>Lawrence v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 95, 578 S.E.2d 54 (2003). There, an officer stopped an automobile displaying a license plate issued to another vehicle. Code \u00a7 46.2-715, we observed, required license plates assigned to a motor vehicle to be displayed only on that motor vehicle. Even so, under \u201ccertain conditions\u201d the Department of Motor Vehicles could issue a permit authorizing \u201cthe use of license plates on a vehicle other than the vehicle for which the license plates were issued.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 100, 578 S.E.2d at 56 (quoting Code \u00a7 46.2-719). The possibility that a permit might have been issued, however, did not preclude the officer from stopping the automobile to investigate whether the permit had in fact been obtained. The <em>prima facie </em>violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-715\u2014though subject to exceptions authorized by a special permit\u2014provided a \u201csufficient basis\u201d for the officer to conduct a brief, investigatory stop. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Second, Code \u00a7 46.2-1109 is not simply a licensing scheme. It is a safety statute making it presumptively unsafe for <em>any </em>commercial vehicle to exceed the statutory maximum of 8 feet, 6 inches. <em>See Specialized Carriers &amp; Rigging Ass\u2019n v. Virginia, </em>795 F.2d 1152, 1154-60 (4th Cir.1986) (noting Virginia \u201cregulates particularly and specially the transportation of overdimensional freight,\u201d because of the \u201cpatent hazard created by the overdimensional load on the highways\u201d); <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-1105(A)(4), 46.2-1111. No commercial vehicle operator has a presumptive right to be exempt from this limitation. To the contrary, \u201cit is assumed that the state legislature did not intend ... to allow, by permit, the movement of any and all vehicles or loads over the highways where such movements would exceed statutory limitations (especially where other forms of transportation are available or when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>loads can be reasonably reduced to meet statutory limits).\u201d 24 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 20-81-20(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">Only a showing of \u201cgood cause\u201d coupled with submission to additional precautions and limitations warrants the issuance of a special permit. Code \u00a7 46.2-1139(A); Virginia Beach City Code \u00a7 21-501(a). A tractor-trailer load in excess of Code \u00a7 46.2-1109\u2019s width maximum constitutes a <em>prima facie </em>statutory violation. The operator of the tractor-trailer may assert as an affirmative defense any special permit exempting him from the statute. Where, as here, incriminating conduct can be legally excused by an affirmative showing of a permit, an investigating officer has no legal duty to <em>presume </em>the excuse exists and thereby preclude any opportunity to determine whether it does or not. <em>See, e.g., Lawrence, </em>40 Va.App. at 100, 578 S.E.2d at 56 (refusing to require an officer to presume a vehicle operator had a special DMV permit to use a license plate on a different vehicle).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Finally, we bring the analysis to closure by placing it securely within the context of settled principles governing all investigatory stops. The degree of certitude required by the reasonable suspicion standard is \u201cconsiderably less than proof of wrongdoing by a preponderance of the evidence, and obviously less demanding than that for probable cause.\u201d <em>Perry v. Commonwealth, </em>280 Va. 572, 581, 701 S.E.2d 431, 436 (2010) (quoting <em>United States v. Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. 1, 7, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 1585, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989)). It follows that the mere \u201cpossibility of an innocent explanation\u201d does not necessarily exclude a reasonable suspicion that the suspect might be violating the law. <em>Raab, </em>50 Va.App. at 581-82, 652 S.E.2d at 146 (quoting 4 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure </em>\u00a7 9.5(b), at 482 (4th ed.2004)). To be sure, \u201cthe principal function of his investigation is to resolve that very ambiguity and establish whether the activity is in fact legal or illegal\u2014to \u2018enable the police to quickly determine whether they should allow the suspect to go about his business or hold him to answer charges.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 582, 652 S.E.2d at 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>In sum, Officer Godwin observed a trailer load exceeding the 8 foot, 6 inch maximum width prescribed by Code \u00a7 46.2-1109. By itself, this observation established a <em>prima facie </em>violation of the statute. Despite the hypothesis (which later turned out to be false) that the truck driver, Morris, might have obtained a special permit authorizing him to exceed the statutory maximum with his 12-foot-4-inch wide load, Officer Godwin had the legal right to stop Morris and briefly investigate to determine whether the requisite permit had in fact been issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Because Officer Godwin\u2019s investigatory stop cannot be deemed unreasonable as a matter of law, the trial court correctly denied Morris\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b223-7\">.
