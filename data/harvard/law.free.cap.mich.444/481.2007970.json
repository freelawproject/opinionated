Specifically, we must decide whether the Commissioner of Insurance erred in concluding that the bank\u2019s proposed business plan would violate MCL 500.1207(3); MSA 24.11207(3), MCL 500.2077(2); MSA 24.12077(2), MCL 500.1207(5); MSA 24.11207(5), and MCL 500.1242(3); MSA 24.11242(3). We hold that the commissioner\u2019s findings with respect to \u00a7\u00a7 1207(3), 2077(2), and 1207(5) are not supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence. We also hold that the commissioner improperly based his ruling on \u00a7 1242(3). Accordingly, we affirm the result reached by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Court of Appeals, albeit on somewhat different grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Ludington Savings Bank sought to acquire ownership of an existing insurance agency through its wholly owned subsidiary, Ludington Service Corporation (plaintiff).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff proposed to offer life, accident, health, annuities, personal and commercial property, and casualty insurance. Both the insurance and banking operations were to take place in the bank buildings. After preparing a business plan<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that attempted to separate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>bank\u2019s lending activities from plaintiff\u2019s insurance activities, plaintiff submitted the plan to the office of the Commissioner of Insurance and engaged in informal discussions with agency personnel. Subsequently, however, plaintiff learned that John R. Schoonmaker, the agency\u2019s director of legal resources, had sent a letter to Robert G. Howell, Executive Vice-President of the Michigan League of Savings Institutions, indicating that plaintiff\u2019s business plan could be in violation of the Insurance Code.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Plaintiff promptly filed suit in Ingham Circuit Court, seeking a declaratory judgment and requesting approval to operate the insurance agency in accordance with its proposed business plan.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Judge Thomas L. Brown dismissed the suit on the ground that plaintiff had not exhausted all its administrative remedies, noting that plaintiff either could seek a declaratory ruling from the commissioner or purchase the agency and contest the revocation proceedings if the commissioner sought to revoke the license.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Following the court\u2019s dismissal, plaintiff sought a declaratory ruling by the commissioner with regard to whether he would oppose the acquisition or later seek to revoke the license.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At some point, plaintiff apparently concluded that the commissioner was improperly delaying his decision,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>thereby provoking plaintiff to again file suit in Ingham Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-3\">Thereafter, on September 15, 1989, the commissioner issued his declaratory ruling in conjunction with his answer to plaintiff\u2019s complaint and filed both with the circuit court. In the declaratory ruling, the commissioner found that plaintiff\u2019s business plan would violate several sections of the Insurance Code.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Consequently, the commissioner moved for summary disposition on the basis of his findings. After rejecting several constitutional and procedural arguments,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Judge Brown affirmed the commissioner\u2019s declaratory ruling. Plaintiff appealed Judge Brown\u2019s ruling in the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">In three separate opinions, the Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>panel reversed both the commissioner\u2019s ruling and the circuit court\u2019s opinion. 194 Mich App 255; 486 NW2d 120 (1992). In the lead opinion, Judge Sawyer stated that he was not convinced that \"plaintiff would necessarily violate the code if the agency is operated according to the business plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 258. Judge Shepherd concurred in the result reached by Judge Sawyer, but on the ground that the commissioner\u2019s ruling lacked competent, material, and substantial supporting evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 268. Finally, Judge Connor dissented, asserting that the commissioner\u2019s decisions are entitled to substantial deference, and therefore, found competent, material, and substantial evidence to support the commissioner\u2019s ruling. <em>Id. </em>at 268-270.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">We granted leave to appeal, as well as various motions for leave to file briefs amici curiae.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">This case comes to the Court in an interesting procedural posture because, instead of waiting for the commissioner to act upon actual Insurance Code violations, plaintiff exercised its right to a declaratory ruling for advance instruction with respect to whether its proposed business plan would violate the Insurance Code. Essentially, plaintiff sought guidance and approval that would bind the commissioner <em>before </em>making a substantial investment in its proposed business venture. Section 63 of the Administrative Procedures Act specifically permits plaintiff to seek such relief.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Although this is a permissible remedy, we recognize the difficulty in isolating anticipatory violations of the Insurance Code solely on the basis of a proposed business plan.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-3\">Nonetheless, in reviewing the commissioner\u2019s findings, both the Michigan Constitution<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>applicable statute<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> direct this Court to examine the commissioner\u2019s authority to issue such a ruling as well as the entire record to determine whether the anticipated violations are supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence. <em>Metropolitan Council No 23 AFSCME v Oakland Co Prosecutor, </em>409 Mich 299, 330; 294 NW2d 578 (1980), quoting <em>Detroit v General Foods Corp, </em>39 Mich App 180, 190; 197 NW2d 315 (1972). This Court must uphold the commissioner\u2019s decision \" 'if it is supported by such evidence as a reasonable mind would accept as adequate to support the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kieffer v Dep\u2019t of Licensing &amp; Regulation, </em>169 Mich App 312, 315; 425 NW2d 539 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-3\">Moreover, we recognize that the office of Commissioner of Insurance is an administrative agency \"charged with the execution of the laws in relation to insurance . . . and to perform such other duties as may be required by law . . . .\u201d MCL 500.200; MSA 24.1200. Accordingly, this Court, in reviewing the record, will accord the commissioner\u2019s factual findings great deference. <em>Breuhan v Plymouth-Canton Community Schools, </em>425 Mich 278, 282-283; 389 NW2d 85 (1986), citing <em>Magreta v Ambassador Steel Co, </em>380 Mich 513, 519; 158 NW2d 473 (1968). Similarly, this Court will accord deference to the \" 'construction placed upon statutory provisions by any particular department of government for a long period of time . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>Southfield Police Officers Ass\u2019n v Southfield, </em>433 Mich 168, 177; 445 NW2d 98 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Against this backdrop, we review first the commissioner\u2019s holding that the bank\u2019s plan would violate \u00a7 1207(3) of the Insurance Code, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-6\">Except as provided in section 1212 and subsection (4), an agent shall not reward or remunerate any person for procuring or inducing business in this state, furnishing leads or prospects, or acting in any other manner as an agent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">The commissioner reasoned that the bank\u2019s plan would \"amount to procuring or inducing business or furnishing leads or prospects for the Agency,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>with profits inuring to the benefit of the bank via dividend payments.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Declaratory ruling at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">In addressing <em>THM, Ltd v Comm\u2019r of Ins, </em>176 Mich App 772; 440 NW2d 85 (1989), the commissioner stated that the same analysis is applicable in the instant case.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> He also suggested that this case could result in an even greater violation of \u00a7 1207(3) than in <em>THM. </em>The commissioner reasoned that the business plan\u2019s proposal to permit the bank to control and distribute the mailings, while allowing both companies to inform their customers of their affiliation, would violate \u00a7 1207(3)\u2019s prohibition against producing leads or prospects, as well as the prohibition against procuring and inducing business. Declaratory ruling at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>The Court of Appeals majority held that the commissioner erred in the application of this section. In his lead opinion, Judge Sawyer held that \u00a7 1207(3) was limited to a quid pro quo relationship where dividends are distributed in direct proportion to the amount of business referred. <em>Ludington Service, supra </em>at 259-260, citing <em>Lawyers Title Ins Corp v Chicago Title Ins Co, </em>161 Mich App 183, 193-194; 409 NW2d 774 (1987). Judge Sawyer went so far as to hold that <em>THM </em>was wrongly decided, concluding that \u00a7 1207(3) \"is not violated where an agency pays a dividend to a shareholder based upon the profits earned by the agency and the shareholder engages in promotion of the insurance agency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-3\">On the other hand, Judge Shepherd\u2019s concurrence advocated a more moderate approach. He rejected overruling <em>THM, </em>and instead rested his decision to reverse on the lack of competent, material, and substantial evidence.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In his opinion, the bank\u2019s business plan adequately addressed the concerns raised in <em>THM. Id. </em>at 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">We agree with Judge Shepherd that the bank\u2019s business plan satisfied the concerns raised in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number><em>THM. </em>Additionally, we agree that the record is devoid of any other competent, material, and substantial evidence necessary to support a violation of \u00a7 1207(3).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Finally, we are persuaded that the instant case is distinguishable from <em>Lawyers Title </em>and <em>THM.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">In <em>Lawyers Title, </em>the Court of Appeals considered a scheme whereby real estate brokers incorporated various title companies in which they were shareholders. The brokers then referred their clients exclusively to these title companies. The brokers/shareholders received dividends based upon the title companies\u2019 profits. In some instances, the dividends were proportionate to the amount of referral business expected to be generated by each broker. The Court of Appeals held that this constituted direct remuneration in violation of \u00a7 1207(3). <em>Id. </em>at 193-194.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">In <em>THM, </em>the Court of Appeals reached a similar conclusion. The plaintiff was a wholly owned subsidiary of a bank that wanted to set up an insurance agency to handle insurance needs incident to the bank\u2019s mortgage operations. The Court held that <em>Lawyers Title </em>was not limited to direct kickbacks, but held that the \"more business [the subsidiary] has, the more profit [the bank] would make regardless of whether any dividends are ever paid.\u201d <em>THM, supra </em>at 785.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">In the instant case, we are satisfied that the business plan avoids the direct kickback problem addressed in <em>Lawyers Title. </em>Similarly, we are satis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>fied that the business plan avoids the kickback problem addressed in <em>THM. </em>In <em>THM, </em>it was apparent that virtually all of the subsidiary\u2019s business would come directly from the bank\u2019s referrals pursuant to its lending activities. In the case at hand, however, the commissioner has yet to determine how much business will ensue directly or indirectly from bank referrals and accordingly constitute dividends inuring to the bank.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Nor has the commissioner pointed to any other evidence of remuneration between plaintiff and the bank. Absent such evidence, we cannot say that a \"kickback\u201d scheme as contemplated by \u00a7 1207(3) was in place.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-3\">Furthermore, because the bank seeks to acquire an existing insurance agency, at least some portion of the business will already be in existence, i.e., business unconnected to the bank\u2019s lending activities. Accordingly, we conclude that the bank has properly shielded its lending activities from its subsidiary\u2019s insurance activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Next, the commissioner ruled that the business plan would violate \u00a7 2077(2), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-6\">If an instrument requires that a purchaser, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>mortgagor or borrower furnish insurance of any kind on real property being conveyed or which is collateral security to a loan, the vendor, mortgagee or lender shall refrain from using or disclosing any such information to his own advantage or to the detriment of the purchaser, mortgagor, borrower, insurance company or agency complying with such requirement.[<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">The commissioner essentially held that the bank\u2019s informational mailings would violate \u00a72077(2) because it would be received by some customers who are required to obtain insurance as a condition of a mortgage. In short, the commissioner reasoned that the bank would use mortgage information improperly to its own advantage, and for the advantage of plaintiif.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">We disagree and hold that the record fails to demonstrate the necessary competent, material, and substantial evidence supporting a violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>\u00a7 2077(2). We are persuaded that the bank\u2019s business plan adequately addressed the concerns raised in <em>THM.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b691-3\">In <em>THM, </em>the Court found that the commissioner was concerned with direct targeting of mortgage customers according to expiration dates of their customers\u2019 insurance policies. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-4\">The commissioner found that insurance agents accordingly want access to information about expiration dates and that d&amp;n could supply that specific information. The commissioner also cited [the insurance agency\u2019s] proposed marketing strategy for the solicitation of d&amp;n customers which relied heavily upon exploitation of information about expiration dates of policies held by d&amp;n customers. The marketing strategy included direct mail solicitation, telephone solicitation, mailing pieces in d&amp;n outgoing mail and establishing an expiration-date system. <em>[Id. </em>at 778.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Thus, in <em>THM, </em>there was substantial evidence supporting the commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">However, in the instant case, the commissioner lacked the necessary direct evidence to find that there would be an improper use of information. As stated in <em>THM, </em>\u00a7 \"2077(2) is clear in that a lender is not to benefit from its knowledge that a borrower must have insurance on the real property which is collateral for the loan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 779. We agree that the plain meaning<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> of \u00a7 2077(2) only proscribes a lender from using insurance requirement information to its own advantage or to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>mortgagor\u2019s detriment.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that the bank\u2019s business plan clearly addressed \u00a7 2077(2) by proscribing the use of this information to the detriment of mortgagors and for the benefit either of the bank or plaintiff.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> A generalized and untargeted informational mailing to all customers<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> does not exploit the bank\u2019s knowledge that a specific borrower must have insurance as a condition of a loan. Absent direct targeting via mailings, the business plan cannot be said to violate \u00a7 2077(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Additionally, the commissioner relied on MCL 500.1207(5); MSA 24.11207(5) to support his theory that operations in accordance with this proposed business scheme would result in threats and intimidation of bank customers to purchase insurance through plaintiff.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Section 1207(5) states:_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>A person may not sell or attempt to sell insurance by means of intimidation or threats, whether express or implied. Except as provided in section 2077(4) a person may not induce the purchase of insurance through a particular agent or from a particular insurer by means of a promise to sell goods, to lend money, to provide services, or by a threat to refuse to sell goods, to refuse to lend money, or to refuse to provide services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-3\">The Court of Appeals majority was not in accord in its treatment of \u00a7 1207(5). Judge Sawyer held that the business plan does not threaten to refuse to lend money. Accordingly, he reasoned that the commissioner lacked substantial evidence to support his findings. He contended that \u00a7 1207(5) focuses on the actions of the insurance agents rather than the subjective beliefs of customers. Applying this analysis, he held that the business plan, as <em>presently formulated, </em>failed to demonstrate any intended use of threats or intimidation. <em>Id. </em>at 262-265.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">Judge Shepherd agreed that the commissioner lacked specific evidence to support his findings, but argued that reasonable subjective beliefs of customers regarding specific acts either of the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>tiff or the bank could be considered when evaluating whether threats or intimidation occurred. However, he held that the record failed to demonstrate substantial evidence with regard to specific acts, thereby failing to provide the necessary justification for the commissioner\u2019s ruling. <em>Id. </em>at 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">In reviewing \u00a7 1207(5), we note that the question of threats or intimidation centers only on the commissioner\u2019s fear that the bank will promise or threaten to refuse to lend money. On this issue, we agree with Judge Shepherd that the record lacks the necessary competent, material, and substantial evidence to support a violation of \u00a7 1207(5). We need not go so far as the Court of Appeals, however, in deciding whether \u00a7 1207(5) focuses only upon the insurance agent\u2019s actions or also considers a customer\u2019s reasonable subjective beliefs. We simply note that the commissioner is afforded great deference in this area. Nonetheless, under either view, the commissioner failed to point to any specific acts<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> on the part of the bank or plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Furthermore, we disagree with the commissioner\u2019s contention that the bank\u2019s proposed safeguards \"promise more than they deliver.\u201d He contends that the safeguards only prevent abuses by loan personnel taking mortgage applications, but not other types of loans. The commissioner also argues that nothing in the plan prohibits bank employees from soliciting business for the plaintiff before a formal loan application is submitted. Declaratory ruling at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">Although the proposed business plan may not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>the most precisely drafted document, we conclude that it clearly does implement safeguards for all loan applications, not just mortgage applications. Under its \"Communications\u201d section in its business plan, the bank states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-3\">2. The Savings Bank may advise the general public and its savings and mortgage customers that insurance services are available from the Service Corporation Agency and advise how to obtain more information about the insurance service, except that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-4\">a. such information shall not be occasioned by submission of any loan application, nor any inquiry about the availability, terms, and conditions of any loan. [Business Plan at 5.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Clearly, therefore, the plan proscribes conduct with regard to all loan activities by addressing both formal submissions of loan applications as well as inquiries.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Similarly, we are not persuaded by the commissioner\u2019s fear that \"even assuming the actual practice is in steadfast conformity with the business plan, an employee <em>of \\plaintiif\\ </em>could approach any loan customer right in the Bank at any point in a loan transaction and personally attempt to sell required insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">This abuse may occur in the future, but at this point the commissioner\u2019s concern is mere speculation, unsupported by substantial evidence. While the language of the business plan specifically addresses only what the bank would or would not do, the business plan and the announced intent of both the bank and plaintiff indicate that plaintiff would not and probably could not engage in such activities. With regard to the actual transfer of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>lending information, the business plan prohibits the bank from transferring it to plaintiff. Therefore, the likelihood of the plaintiff obtaining this information is minimal.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">However, were the plaintiff to conduct surveillance of loan applicants and thereafter solicit them to buy their insurance by means of a promise or threat of refusal to lend money via the bank, the commissioner would have adequate grounds to revoke the license under \u00a7 1207(5).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Until this occurs, the commissioner lacks sufficient facts to support a violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Finally, we disagree with the commissioner\u2019s conclusion that no adequate regulatory controls are possible to prevent the inherent pressure and intimidation that customers would endure where a subsidiary of a financial institution sells insurance to the financial institution\u2019s borrowers. Declaratory ruling at 9-10, citing <em>THM, supra </em>at 780.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>find that regulatory controls are possible and that the record supports the bank\u2019s intention to implement adequate safeguards in order to address \u00a7 1207(5). These intentions are illustrated by not requiring borrowers to purchase insurance from plaintiff, shielding all lending activities from insurance activities, conspicuously marking the separate areas and not displaying any insurance materials in loan application areas, not initiating discussions concerning insurance during the loan application process, and providing written disclosures if inquiries are made. Therefore, at this point, the commissioner lacks specific evidence supporting his claim that the plan permits inducement to purchase insurance by means of a promise or threat of refusal to lend money.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-3\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">Finally, while this Court affords deference to an agency\u2019s findings of fact, we can always review an agency\u2019s legal findings. Both the Michigan Constitution<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and the applicable statute<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> permit this Court to set aside the commissioner\u2019s findings if they are \"[i]n violation of the constitution or a statute,\u201d or \"[a]ffected by other substantial and material error of law.\u201d <em>Southfield Police, supra </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>175, citing MCL 24.306(l)(a), (f); MSA 3.560(206)(l)(a), (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Our reading of \u00a7 1242(3) persuades us that the commissioner improperly based his decision<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> on this section because it only empowers the commissioner to review the <em>granting and renewing </em>of a license. It does not apply to the acquisition of an <em>existing </em>insurance agency.
