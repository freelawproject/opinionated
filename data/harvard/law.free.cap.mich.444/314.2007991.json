In <em>Tousignant, </em>the \"health coverage\u201d was through a health care provider, an hmo. In the instant case, the health coverage was provided by the United States Coast Guard and the Veterans Administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">The Veterans Administration, like the hmo in <em>Tousignant, </em>is a health care provider. It does not appear whether the United States Coast Guard employs physicians or has health care facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>Plaintiff, Kenneth M. Owens, was injured in an automobile accident in December, 1982. The Coast Guard paid or caused to be paid the expense of providing health care to Owens until he was officially discharged from the Coast Guard in June, 1984. There is thus no issue concerning payment of medical expense, either at private or governmental hospitals, between the time of the accident and the date that Owens was discharged from the Coast Guard. Accordingly, there is no issue concerning payment of the expense incurred at the facilities of intervening plaintiff Herrick Memorial Hospital and Herrick Memorial Nursing Home between July 1, 1983, when Owens was discharged from the Ann Arbor Veterans Administration facility, and June, 1984, when the Coast Guard ceased payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">This litigation concerns whether Automobile Club Insurance Association, Owens\u2019 no-fault insurer, is subject to liability for medical expense incurred by Owens after he was discharged from the Coast Guard. Both the Veterans Administration and the acia have refused to pay inpatient medical expense incurred at Herrick after Owens\u2019 discharge from the Coast Guard, and have also refused to pay outpatient medical expense incurred at Saline Community Hospital incurred after Owens was discharged from Herrick.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">We hold that where the injured person,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Owens, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>is covered by a policy of no-fault automobile insurance, coordinated pursuant to \u00a7 3109a with other health coverage provided by United States military forces or the Veterans Administration, the no-fault insurer is not subject to liability for medical expense that the military forces or the Veterans Administration is required, under the other health coverage, to pay for or provide.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">While Owens was on authorized leave, visiting his parents, he struck a tree while driving his motor vehicle and suffered serious permanent injury, including brain damage. The health coverage with which his no-fault policy was coordinated was provided pursuant to federal law by the United States Coast Guard and the Veterans Administration in consequence of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">Owens was in a coma for a number of weeks. He was given emergency treatment at St. Joseph Hospital, and then transferred to Walter Reed Veterans Hospital in February, 1983, and remained there until April, 1983. He then was transferred to a Veterans Administration hospital in Ann Arbor in April, 1983, and remained there until July, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">Plaintiffs Joyce E. and Richard L. Owens are the parents and guardians of Kenneth Owens. In July, 1983, they authorized the transfer of their son to Herrick Hospital in Tecumseh, Michigan, for rehabilitation purposes, as suggested by a Veterans Administration neurologist. Owens remained at Herrick for almost two years, until June, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">The Coast Guard, as previously indicated, paid the medical expense incurred at Herrick until Owens was discharged in June, 1984. This action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>was commenced on June 18, 1984, shortly after the discharge. The bill at Herrick for the period June, 1984, through June, 1985, was approximately $110,000. The Veterans Administration and the acia each refused to pay for continued care at Herrick. Herrick was ultimately allowed to intervene in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">After Owens was discharged from Herrick in June, 1985, he returned to his parents\u2019 home and received outpatient care at Saline Community Hospital incurring expenses of approximately $70,000. Neither the Veterans Administration nor the acia have been willing to pay for those expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">Owens began receiving social security disability benefits in June, 1983, and, following his discharge from the Coast Guard, Veterans Administration disability benefits beginning in July, 1984. The no-fault policy was not coordinated with respect to work loss benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">The circuit court entered summary disposition in favor of Owens respecting the medical expense incurred at Herrick and Saline, and for work loss benefits. The court also awarded Owens attorney fees and interest under the no-fault act.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">The Court of Appeals affirmed in part, but reversed with respect to Herrick on the basis that there is a question of fact whether all the inpatient care at Herrick was necessary.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">Owens contends, as did Tousignant, that coordination does not require that a no-fault insured seek all medical care from the health insurer. We conclude, however, for the reasons stated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Tousignant,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that the legislative purpose that led to the enactment of \u00a7 3109a requires that an insured, who chooses to coordinate no-fault coverage with health care coverage provided by the military forces or the Veterans Administration, obtain payment and services from such a health care provider to the extent of the available health coverage.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">Owens, when he chose to coordinate, agreed in eifect to avail himself of health care coverage provided by the military forces or the Veterans Administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The acia contends that the health coverage provided by the United States Coast Guard and the Veterans Administration are benefits provided or required to be provided under the laws of the federal government within the meaning of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>\u00a73109(1),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and on that basis are to be subtracted from the medical expense benefits otherwise payable by a no-fault insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Because we hold that, when Owens chose to coordinate pursuant to \u00a7 3109a, he agreed to avail himself of health coverage provided by the military forces or the Veterans Administration, there is no need to consider the acia\u2019s arguments concerning the applicability of \u00a7 3109(1) of the no-fault act.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">The acia urges that <em>Morgan v Citizens Ins Co of America, </em>432 Mich 640, 648; 442 NW2d 626 (1989), should be reconsidered.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In <em>Morgan, </em>however, the insured had declined to coordinate his no-fault medical coverage with other health coverage. The issue there presented cannot properly be reconsidered except in a case where, in contrast with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>instant case,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the injured person is not covered by a no-fault policy coordinated with other health coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">The no-fault automobile liability act expresses the obligation of a no-fault insurer to pay for medical expense in the following language: Benefits are payable for <em>\"[allowable expenses </em>consisting of all reasonable charges incurred for <em>reasonably necessary </em>products, services and accommodations for an injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation.\u201d MCL 500.3107(l)(a); MSA 24.13107(l)(a). (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Owens has the burden of establishing that the services rendered by Herrick and Saline were \"allowable expenses,\u201d and that \"reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>charges\u201d were there \"incurred for reasonably necessary\u201d services.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Owens also has the burden of establishing that he sought to obtain appropriate services from the Veterans Administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Owens was transferred from the Veterans Administration facility in Ann Arbor to Herrick on the recommendation of a Veterans Administration neurologist who was treating him. The physician advised Owens\u2019 parents that he required the intensive and aggressive rehabilitation services that can be provided by an inpatient head injury center, such as Herrick. His opinion and recommendation showed that the services rendered by Herrick were allowable expenses and were reasonably necessary.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Owens also showed that efforts were made to obtain such services from the Veterans Administration. While Veterans Administration administrators said that inpatient facilities for closed head injuries were available somewhere under the auspices of the Veterans Administration, the Veterans Administration did not identify a Veterans Administration facility where such inpatient care could be provided, let alone a facility located within reasonable proximity of Owens\u2019 home and family.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>While Owens showed the need for inpatient services at Herrick, neither he nor Herrick established that he needed to stay at Herrick for two years. A physician employed by the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (champ\u00fas) opined that Owens did not need to stay for more than six months.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> His assertion is subject to question because he may have been operating under a cost containment standard more restrictive of the rights of the patient than the no-fault standard. Nevertheless, there was a genuine issue of material fact whether it was reasonably necessary for Owens to remain at Herrick for the entire two-year period, June, 1983, through June, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Turning to the outpatient services provided by Saline Community Hospital, Owens did not offer evidence that those services were allowable expenses incurred for reasonably necessary services. The acia, however, conceded that those services were reasonably necessary._</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>We agree, however, with the acia that Owens failed to discharge his obligation to establish that he sought to obtain such outpatient services from the Veterans Administration. Summary disposition thus should not have been entered in favor of Owens respecting the services provided at Saline.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">vi</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The acia contends that it is entitled to a setoff under \u00a73109(1)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> from no-fault work loss benefits otherwise due Owens for social security and Veterans Administration disability benefits received by him. Owens\u2019 no-fault policy was not coordinated respecting work loss benefits with \"other . . . accident coverage.\u201d The Court of Appeals awarded work loss benefits of $13,856.31 to Owens.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">The acia acknowledges that the total of the social security disability benefits and the total of the Veterans Administration disability benefits each exceed the $13,856.31 that it otherwise would owe Owens for work loss benefits, and that therefore it need only prevail either on the social security disability or Veterans Administration disability issue to have a complete setoff.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">In <em>Profit v Citizens Ins Co, </em>444 Mich 281; 506 NW2d 514 (1993), also decided today, we hold that social security disability benefits are government benefits under \u00a7 3109(1), rather than \"other health and accident coverage\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3109a.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The acia is therefore entitled to set off social security disability benefits against no-fault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>wage loss benefits with the result that, because the total of the social security disability benefits paid Owens exceeds the $13,856.31 in work loss benefits otherwise due Owens, the acia has no obligation to pay work loss benefits to Owens.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Because a social security disability setoff provides the acia a complete setoff for work loss benefits, we do not reach the question whether the acia would also be entitled to set off for Veterans disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Because there were substantial issues of law and fact, and therefore summary disposition was not appropriate, neither attorneys fees nor interest should have been awarded to Owens or Herrick.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">The case is remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b522-9\">Cavanagh, C.J., and Griffin and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b511-9\"> An insurer providing personal protection insurance benefits shall offer, at appropriately reduced premium rates, deductibles and exclusions reasonably related to <em>other health and accident coverage </em>on the insured.

This Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-11\">A surgical procedure performed in a military hospital may not, because of differences in quality and service, be duplicative of the medical service that an injured person could obtain and pay for with the no-fault medical expense benefit through the exercise of the choice in medical service providers preserved to injured persons under the no-fault act. <em>[Id., </em>p 648.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b517-9\"> In <em>Morgan </em>we reserved the question presented in <em>Tousignant </em>and the instant case whether a no-fault insurer is subject to liability for medical expense when the insured purchases a policy of no-fault automobile insurance coordinated with other health coverage, including health coverage provided by the military forces (or the Veterans Administration), and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-10\">We express no opinion whether an injured person who has contracted for a reduced premium under \u00a7 3109a (MCL 500.3109a; MSA 24.13109[1]), and thus has voluntarily agreed that other insurance will be primary for medical benefits, may seek recovery from a no-fault insurer unless he was unable to obtain medical care from a facility designated, pursuant to the contract with the primary insurer, by the primary insurer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-11\">Similarly, we express no opinion whether, <em>if </em>Morgan contracted for a reduced premium under \u00a7 3109a on the basis of medical benefits available through his employment <em>by the </em>federal government, he voluntarily agreed that such benefits would be primary and may not seek recovery from Citizens unless he was unable to obtain medical care from a facility designated by the federal government which, in that hypothesis, has or may have, in effect, become the primary insurer for the purpose of coordination under \u00a7 3109a. <em>[Id., </em>p 647, n 9.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b518-7\"> In <em>Nasser v ACIA, </em>435 Mich 33, 49; 457 NW2d 637 (1990), this Court held that it is the burden of the injured person to establish that the services were reasonably necessary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-8\">[A]n insurer is not <em>liable </em>for any medical expense to the extent that it is not a reasonable charge for a particular product or service, or if the product or service itself is not reasonably necessary.

[Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b518-9\"> Approximately six months after the automobile accident, Owens\u2019 family, in cooperation with the staff at the Veterans Administration facility in Ann Arbor, began planning for his discharge from the facility and for rehabilitation. Under federal law, the Veterans Administration must provide services for a veteran such as Owens seeking medical treatment. 10 USC 1071 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\"><em>A </em>Veterans Administration social worker responsible for planning Owens\u2019 discharge, discussed options with the Owens family. According to her deposition, the Veterans Administration would pay for two types of rehabilitation. The first was neurological service at another Veterans Administration hospital. The medical services administrator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>at the Veterans Administration facility in Ann Arbor testified on deposition that she had no idea where the closest center was, but that it <em>might </em>have been as close as Chicago.</p>\n<p id=\"asz-dedup-0\">The second option suggested by the social worker was contract nursing home care. The Veterans Administration would contract with a nursing home to pay for Owens\u2019 placement in a nursing home. He would receive rehabilitation therapy at the nursing home or at a Veterans Administration facility on an outpatient basis. There was, however, no showing that such therapy would have been the intensive, aggressive therapy that Owens\u2019 treating physician thought was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"Avm\">Owens\u2019 treating physician, Dr. Steven Levine, wrote a \"[t]o whom it may concern\u201d letter on behalf of the Owens family stating his opinion that Owens needed to be placed in a head injury center where he could receive intensive rehabilitation therapy. That letter, dated June 28,1983, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aos-dedup-0\">[Owens] is currently in need of extensive and aggressive rehabilitation that we cannot provide enough of here on the neurology service. We feel it is in Kenneth\u2019s best interest &amp; long term health goals to be placed in a specialty rehabilitation center, such as Tecumseh [Herrick hospital]. ... It is clear to us that a rehabilitation center would care for Kenneth in areas we cannot provide \u2014 i.e., daily \u2014 continuous rehabilitation atmosphere with similar patients.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b519-10\"> Dr. Levine stated in his deposition that placement in a \"continuous rehabilitation atmosphere with similar patients\u201d was necessary because at a rehabilitation center \"the morale, the people, the caretakers, the caregivers of the patients are more atuned [sic] to the daily needs, the minute-by-minute needs, of picking up subtle changes such as seizures in these patients . . . .\u201d Further, it was important for Owens to be with similar patients because of \u201cpsychosocial factors that interplay in a patient\u2019s recovery such as their morale, their spirit, their overall outlook for chances of recovery . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-11\">While the acia contends that Dr. Levine was the senior resident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>and not the physician in charge, Dr. Levine stated in his deposition that the letter represented the consensus of the physicians in the neurology department who were treating Owens. The acia has produced no evidence indicating that any of the treating physicians at the Veterans Administration would have recommended a different course of rehabilitation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b520-8\"><em> </em>Champ\u00fas is a supplemental program to the direct medical care system available to former members of the uniformed services.

Kogan wrote in a memorandum to champ\u00fas that Owens could have obtained the necessary services on an outpatient basis after December 31, 1983. He observed that Owens was out frequently on weekend and evening passes by January 1, 1984 and had shown that he could function outside the controlled and structured environment provided by Herrick.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">Kogan concluded, on the basis of the records showing the type of treatment provided, the nurses notes on Owens\u2019 condition and the frequent passes that inpatient medical treatment at Herrick was unnecessary after December 31, 1983.
