The prosecutor asserts that the testimony of the defendant\u2019s alleged victims, Todd F, Steven C, and John J, is admissible in each of the pending cases<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because it was not offered \"to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith,\u201d in violation of MRE 404(b). We evaluate this claim in light of the clarified standard articulated today: First, that the evidence be offered for a proper purpose under Rule 404(b); second, that it be relevant under Rule 402 as enforced through Rule 104(b); third, that the probative value of the evidence is not substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice; fourth, that the trial court may, upon request, provide a limiting instruction to the jury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Consequently, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals in each case and remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The evidentiary record consists of testimony given during the preliminary examination and two subsequent pretrial hearings held to determine the admissibility of the other acts evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The defendant was employed by Kent Client Services as a case manager, working with developmentally disabled young men. In October, 1987, as part of his employment, the defendant became the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>case manager for a mildly retarded male in his mid-twenties named Steven C.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Steven C testified that on more than one occasion he accompanied the defendant to a house in the country belonging to the defendant\u2019s brother. On October 4, 1988, at the house, the defendant asked Steven to take a shower. Following the shower, Steven said the defendant proceeded to masturbate him. After Steven ejaculated, the defendant asked Steven to rub lotion on the defendant\u2019s back. Steven said he complied because he saw that the defendant\u2019s pants were unzipped and was afraid of what the defendant might do.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">On October 5, 1988, Steven complained about defendant\u2019s conduct to an employee at Southwest Center, a sheltered workshop. This complaint was communicated to a recipient rights investigator and, eventually, to the defendant\u2019s supervisor, Fred Ward.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Mr. Ward testified that, following the complaint, he started to closely supervise the defendant. The defendant was specifically informed that future client contact should occur in essentially public places, including the sheltered workshop or licensed adult foster care homes. Mr. Ward stressed that, if client contact did occur at an individual\u2019s residence, it had to be documented closely on a timely basis and occur pursuant to the prearranged treatment plan. These instructions were documented in a letter in March 1989, which explicitly directed the defendant to inform his supervisor of any client activities that took place outside a workshop setting or an adult foster care home.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">The defendant was allowed to continue client contact under these restrictions, and, in May 1989, he became the case manager for a developmentally disabled male in his mid-twenties named Todd F.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>Todd testified that on several occasions between May 1989 and August 1989, he accompanied the defendant to the same house. There, the defendant watched Todd urinate and shower. Todd testified that defendant touched Todd\u2019s testicles on three occasions. He also testified that the defendant would wrestle with him and sit on his genitals for long periods of time. Todd said he objected to all these alleged activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">In August 1989, Todd informed the service coordinator of Southwest Center, Grant Sutton, that he had been to the defendant\u2019s brother\u2019s house and had wrestled with the defendant there. Mr. Sutton immediately contacted his supervisor and informed recipient rights of this conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Mr. Sutton testified that his concern was aroused for three reasons. First, he was aware of Steven C\u2019s accusations against the defendant. Second, Mr. Sutton believed it was questionable conduct for a case worker to wrestle with a client. Finally, he asserted that taking a client either to a case manager\u2019s own home or a relative\u2019s home was unacceptable and unprofessional conduct.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Following the second accusation, the defendant was suspended from client contact. Mr. Ward testified that during ensuing conversations, the defendant admitted he took Todd to his brother\u2019s house in violation of the conditions set forth in the memo.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">A police investigation was begun in the fall of 1989. Detective Bruce Fogerty testified that the defendant voluntarily came to the Wyoming Police Department where he was informed of his rights. Defendant waived those rights._</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Regarding Steven C, the defendant admitted taking Steven to his brother\u2019s house. He also admitted that he told Steven to take a shower on one occasion because Steven had a dental appointment and Steven smelled. Defendant denied that any sexual contact occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Regarding Todd F, the defendant admitted taking Todd to his brother\u2019s house. The defendant claimed that Todd had had out-patient surgery and that he was directed by Todd\u2019s doctor to look for blood in Todd\u2019s urine. Pursuant to those instructions, the defendant told Fogerty that he checked the toilet for blood after Todd urinated. The defendant admitted to tickling Todd under his arms, and on one occasion physically sitting on him. However, the defendant denied sitting on Todd\u2019s intimate areas. He asserted that any contact occurring with those areas was inadvertent or accidental. The defendant denied he ever touched Todd\u2019s testicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">During his investigation, Detective Fogerty uncovered another allegation of sexual misconduct involving the defendant and another of his clients, John J. This third case is uncharged at this time. Because this allegation came to light after Detective Fogerty\u2019s conversation with the defendant, he was not questioned about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">John J testified that the defendant was his caseworker. Although not identifying a specific time, John said that on one occasion the defendant told him to take a shower while both were at John\u2019s residence. Following the shower, the defendant touched John\u2019s penis, masturbating him. In response, John slapped the defendant\u2019s hand and told him to leave. The defendant then pulled his pants down a little bit and asked John to put cologne on the defendant\u2019s back. On another occasion, while the defendant and John were in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>defendant\u2019s car, the defendant told John that they were going to his brother\u2019s house. The defendant then reached for John\u2019s penis. John slapped the defendant\u2019s hand before contact was made. John also testified that he was acquainted with Steven C, who had warned him about the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">After the defendant was bound over on the charge of second-degree criminal sexual conduct,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the prosecutor filed a memorandum concerning the admissibility of evidence under MRE 404(b). Relying on <em>People v Engelman, </em>434 Mich 204; 453 NW2d 656 (1990), the prosecutor argued that the defendant\u2019s conduct toward each of the three alleged victims was admissible in each of the pending cases because it did not violate MRE 404(b). The trial court held that the prosecutor could not introduce evidence of other misconduct in either Todd\u2019s or Steven\u2019s case. The prosecutor appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the ruling of the trial court in an unpublished opinion per curiam, decided January 23, 1992 (Docket No. 138141). A divided panel held that, because the misconduct evidence was not \"probative of a matter 'in issue,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 2, it was inadmissible under the test enunciated in <em>People v Golochowicz, </em>413 Mich 298, 308; 319 NW2d 518 (1982). \"Consequently, allowing the evidence would frustrate the policy underlying the general exclusion of similar acts evidence . . . .\u201d <em>VanderVliet, supra </em>at 3. The Court of Appeals also held that the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by its prejudicial effect. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">Presiding Judge Doctoroff dissented. Relying on <em>People v Engelman, supra, </em>Judge Doctoroff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>concluded that \"[t]he similar acts evidence in this case clearly establishes defendant\u2019s scheme, plan or system, and is material as proof that the charged act was committed,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>id. </em>at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">We granted leave to appeal, 440 Mich 871 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"az-dedup-0\">We begin the substantive portion of this opinion with a general discussion of the law regarding other acts evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"AQ\">Logical relevance is determined by the application of Rules 401 and 402.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A-\">MRE 401 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AK\">\"Relevant evidence\u201d means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">MRE 402 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-12\">All relevant evidence is admissable, except as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>otherwise provided by the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of the State of Michigan, these rules, or other rules adopted by the Supreme Court. Evidence which is not relevant is not admissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Rules 401 and 402 define the universe of evidence that is logically relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">[I]f the item of evidence satisfies the normal standards for logical relevance, most courts resist defense attempts to impose additional spurious requirements purportedly based on \"logical relevance.\u201d At one time, several American jurisdictions adhered to the view that an inference cannot be based upon another inference. That view made it difficult to introduce evidence which relied on lengthy chains of inference for its logical relevance. In particular, that view made it difficult to introduce uncharged misconduct evidence which relied on intermediate inferences for its relevance. Modernly, the courts have discredited the \"no inference on an inference\u201d rule. The acid test is logical relevance, and a logically relevant act is admissible even when the finding of logical relevance requires a long chain of intervening inferences. [Imwinkelried, Uncharged Misconduct Evidence, \u00a7 2:17, pp 45-46.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">Simply stated, \"[l]ogical relevance is the 'touchstone\u2019 of the admissability of uncharged misconduct evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">Rule 404<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> is a rule of legal relevance, defined as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>a rule limiting the use of evidence that is logically relevant.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, Rule 404 presumes a showing of logical relevance. It is only then that considerations of legal relevance are implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">On its face, Rule 404 limits only one category of logically relevant evidence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As we explained in</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-15\">Article IV of the Rules of Evidence deals with the relevancy of evidence. Rules 401 and 402 establish the broad principle that relevant evidence \u2014 evidence that makes the existence of any fact at issue more or less probable \u2014 is admissible unless the Rules provide otherwise. Rule 403 allows the trial judge to exclude relevant evidence if, among other things, \"its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\u201d Rules 404 through 412 address specific types of evidence that have generated problems. Generally, these latter Rules do not flatly prohibit the introduction of such evidence but instead limit the purpose for which it may be introduced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number><em>Engelman, supra </em>at 212-213:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-4\">\"[ojnly one series of evidential hypotheses is forbidden in criminal cases by Rule 404: a man who commits a crime probably has a defect of character; a man with such a defect of character is more likely ... to have committed the act in question.\u201d [Citing 2 Weinstein, Evidence, \u00b6 404(8), p 404-52.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">If the proponent\u2019s only theory of relevance is that the other act shows defendant\u2019s inclination to wrongdoing in general to prove that the defendant committed the conduct in question, the evidence is not admissible. The reason for the prohibition is twofold. As noted in <em>Engelman, supra </em>at 213, n 16, quoting Imwinkelried, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2:18, pp 48-49:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">\"[T]he thrust of this theory is the use of the defendant\u2019s uncharged misconduct as circumstantial proof of conduct. More specifically, the forbidden theory rests on two inferences that pose serious legal relevance issues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-7\">\"[T]he first step in this theory of logical relevance is inferring the defendant\u2019s character from the defendant\u2019s prior misdeeds. Rule 404(b) refers to this step as introducing the uncharged acts 'to prove the character of a person.\u2019 This step poses the legal relevance danger of prejudice. In the process of deciding whether to draw the inference, the jury must focus on the type of person the defendant is. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-8\">\"The second step in this theory of logical relevance compounds the legal relevance dangers. The second step is inferring the defendant\u2019s conduct on a particular occasion from his or her subjective character. In the words of Rule 404(b), the plaintiff or prosecutor introduces the evidence of the defendant\u2019s subjective character 'in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-9\">\"When the proponent uses the defendant\u2019s subjective character as proof of conduct on a particular occasion, there is a substantial danger that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>jury will overestimate the probative value of the evidence.\u201d[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Rule 404(b) limits the use of logically relevant evidence <em>only </em>when both steps of the process are violated. Therefore, if the proffered other acts evidence is logically relevant, and does not involve the intermediate inference of character, Rule 404(b) is not implicated. <em>Engelman, supra </em>at 216. If the evidence is relevant to a fact in issue (facta probantia), there may be no inference to conduct. See Imwinkelried, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2:21, p 55. The question is not whether the evidence falls within an exception to a supposed rule of exclusion, but rather whether the \"evidence [is] in any way relevant to a fact in issue\u201d other than by showing mere propensity, Stone, <em>The rule of exclusion of similar fact evidence: America, </em>51 Harv L R 988, 1004 (1938). \"Put simply, the rule is <em>inclusionary </em>rather than exclusionary.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Engelman, supra </em>at 213. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>Thus, the Court of Appeals reference to \"the general exclusion of similar acts evidence\u201d is mistaken. There is no policy of general exclusion relating to other acts evidence.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> There is no rule limiting admissibility to the specific exceptions set forth in Rule 404(b). Nor is there a rule requiring exclusion of other misconduct when the defendant interposes a general denial. Relevant other acts evidence does not violate Rule 404(b) unless it is offered solely to show the criminal propensity of an individual to establish that he acted in conformity therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">iii</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">The Court of Appeals conclusion that <em>Golocho-wicz, supra, </em>created a rule of general exclusion allowing admission of other acts evidence only for the purposes set forth in the rule,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> failed to acknowledge the inclusionary theory of admissibility. Rule 404(b) permits the judge to admit other acts evidence <em>whenever </em>it is relevant on a noncharac-ter theory. The <em>Golochowicz </em>\"test\u201d does not set the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>standard for the admissibility of other acts evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">The exclusionary approach was explicitly rejected in <em>Engelman, supra </em>at 212:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\">Properly understood, MRE 404(b) is a nonexclusive list of examples of situations in which the general rule excluding character evidence, MRE 404(a), is not offended because the evidence is probative of some fact other than the defendant\u2019s criminal propensity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-6\"><em>People v Golochowicz, </em>was a homicide case in which \"the only conceivable justification for admission of . . . similar-acts evidence [was] to prove the identity of the perpetrator . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 310. Emphasizing that the purpose of the evidence was to show <em>identity, </em>the <em>Golochowicz </em>Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-7\">It [was] because of the combined value of those two factors, the unique and uncommonly distinctive style employed by the defendant in committing the \"substantially proved\u201d uncharged similar offense, and the same distinctive <em>modus operandi </em>employed in the charged offense, that the jury is permitted to infer, if it believes the evidence, that both crimes were the handiwork of the same person, the defendant. <em>[Id. </em>at 311.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-8\"><em>Golochowicz </em>identifies the requirements of logical relevance when the proponent is utilizing a <em>modus operandi theory </em>to prove identity.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>However, the <em>Golochowicz </em>approach to modus operandi cases to show identity is not a \"conceptual template\u201d to \"mechanically test\u201d all misconduct evidence barring use of other permissible theories of logical relevance.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 314.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">If we ask, does [the] misconduct have to exhibit striking similarity with the misconduct being investigated, the answer is, only if similarity is relied on. Otherwise not. There are only two classes of case[s] [those in which similarity is relied on and those in which it is not], and they do not depend on the nature of the evidence, but on the nature of the argument. [Elliott, <em>The young person\u2019s guide to similar fact evidence </em>\u2014 I, 1983 Crim L R 284, 288.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">The method of analysis to be employed depends on the purpose of the offer and its logical relevance.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">Turning from the theory of logical relevance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>illustrated by <em>Golochowicz </em>to the specifics of the four-pronged test it enunciated, we note that we have not defined the standard for assessing the first requirement of <em>Golochowicz, </em>that there be \"substantial evidence\u201d that the defendant<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> committed the other act. However, as the Court of Appeals has recognized, <em>People v Sorscher, </em>151 Mich App 122; 391 NW2d 365 (1986), a heightened standard of logical relevance is not required either by the explicit language of Rule 404(b) or by any other rule. Additionally, the United States Supreme Court has unanimously held that neither the language nor the legislative history of FRE 404 supports such a conclusion. <em>Huddleston v United States, </em>485 US 681; 108 S Ct 1496; 99 L Ed 2d 771 (1988).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>The second requirement in <em>Golochowicz, </em>that a special circumstance or quality exist, \"refers to the relationship between the charged and uncharged offenses which supplies the link between them and assures thereby that evidence of the separate offense is probative of some fact other than the defendant\u2019s bad character,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 310. This language does not require a showing of distinctive similarity between other acts and the charge at issue in every instance where Rule 404(b) evidence is proffered. Where the proponents\u2019 theory is not that the acts are so similar that they circumstantially indicate that they are the work of the accused,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> similarity between charged and uncharged conduct is not required. As we recognized in <em>Engel-man, </em>the special link or circumstance is simply the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>inference other than to character. The trial court and the Court of Appeals erroneously concluded that Rule 404(b) relevance requires a high level of similarity between the proffered other acts evidence and the act charged. This approach misreads Golochowicz,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>Engelman, </em>and other precedent of this Court.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The third \"prong\u201d of the <em>Golochowicz </em>\"test,\u201d that the proffered evidence be relevant to some matter in issue, neither limits other acts evidence to the issue of identity nor restricts a determination that the other acts evidence is relevant to a matter in issue until the defendant actually raises the issue at trial. In all cases, the question is relevancy to a fact in issue. Where the trial court can reliably determine that a fact will be in issue before trial, it may determine admissibility. As we explained in <em>Engelman, supra, </em>the matter in issue might very well be the commission of the charged offense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>If it could be shown in this case that defendant did indeed follow a common scheme or plan in committing such acts against young children, it would defy logic to limit the use of that evidence to proof of identity or state of mind. The former will never be in dispute where the defendant and the victim know each other, and the defendant\u2019s state of mind is not an element of many of the offenses set forth in the criminal sexual conduct act. Yet, in many cases such evidence might be not only relevant to the determination of defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence, but also material in the sense required by <em>Golochowicz, </em>as proof that the act was committed. As explained in 2 Wigmore, Evidence (Chadbourn rev), \u00a7 304, p 249, \"[w]hen the very doing of the act charged is yet to be proved, one of the evidential facts receivable is the person\u2019s design or plan to do it ... .\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 220-221.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">Finally, to the extent that <em>Golochowicz </em>or <em>Engel-man </em>have been understood to have superimposed a heightened prejudice versus probative weighing of the evidence under 404(b), that view is simply unfounded.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The fourth prong of <em>Golochowicz </em>is merely a restatement of the Rule 403 test<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> applied to all evidence to determine its legal relevance.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> No authority has been cited for the proposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>that the balancing process is other than that required by Rule 403, and there is no evidence that this Court intended a more restricted formulation of the balancing process than that contained in the federal rule, which does not include any superannuated weighing requirement.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Moreover, the Supreme Court\u2019s observation in <em>Huddleston </em>that a heightened standard of logical relevance is inconsistent with the inclusive view of the admiss-ability of other acts evidence, is equally applicable here.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Our focus in <em>Engelman </em>on logical relevance and the inclusive view of other acts evidence, clarified and limited the expansive reading of <em>Golochowicz </em>advocated by the defense and endorsed by the majority of the Court of Appeals. <em>Golochowicz </em>is not the general test for other acts evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">We conclude this discussion of the general principles applicable to other acts evidence with some ruminations on the remarkable tenacity of the \"similar act\u201d formulation of Rule 404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">Beyond the historical, philosophical, and legal dispute regarding whether the rule should be interpreted as inclusionary or exclusionary, there are several reasons that might explain why the <em>Golochowicz </em>formulation is so hearty a vine in the garden of our jurisprudence.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">At a psychological level, the <em>Golochowicz </em>for<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>mula addresses the fear, which most lawyers and many judges share, that jurors will give misconduct evidence more weight than deserved. This fear conflicts with the intuitive sense that some bad acts evidence is so powerfully probative that it would pervert the truth-seeking process to prevent a jury from using what looks like ordinary common sense. Moreover, the <em>Golochowicz </em>formulation expresses a linear perspective of admissibility, which, while it \"fits\u201d the profession\u2019s visceral anxiety regarding misconduct evidence, fails to acknowledge both that the theory of Rule 404(b) is comprehensive<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and that the foundation of the rule is the familiar theory of multiple admissibility: evidence that is admissible for one purpose does not become inadmissible because its use for a different purpose would be precluded.

The bench and bar do not have to struggle with the complexity of multiple theories of admissibility as applied in discrete instances, and the trial court does not have to make the weighing of substantial prejudice versus probative weight contemplated by Rule 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">As the previous discussion illustrates, the bright-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>line approach to other acts evidence is inadequate in assessing relevance under Rule 404(b). In place of the four-pronged test of <em>Golochowicz, </em>we direct the bench and bar to employ the evidentiary safeguards already present in the Rules of Evidence, as identified by the unanimous United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Huddleston:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-6\">[FJirst, from the requirement of Rule 404(b) that the evidence be offered for a proper purpose; second, from the relevancy requirement of Rule 402\u2014 as enforced through Rule 104(b); third, from the assessment the trial court must make under Rule 403 to determine whether the probative value of the similar acts evidence is substantially outweighed by its potential for unfair prejudice, see Advisory Committee\u2019s Notes on Fed Rule Evid 404(b), 28 USC App, p 691; S Rep No 93-1277 at 25; and fourth, from Federal Rule of Evidence 105, which provides that the trial court shall, upon request, instruct the jury that the similar acts evidence is to be considered only for the proper purpose for which it was admitted. [Huddleston, <em>supra </em>at 691-692.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">The evidence must be relevant to an issue other than propensity under Rule 404(b), to \"protect[] against the introduction of extrinsic act evidence when that evidence is offered <em>solely </em>to prove character.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687. (Emphasis added.) Stated otherwise, the prosecutor must offer the other acts evidence under something other than a character to conduct theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">Second, as previously noted, the evidence must be relevant under Rule 402, as enforced through Rule 104(b), to an issue or fact of consequence at trial. 2 Weinstein &amp; Berger, Evidence, \u00b6 404[08], p 404-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">Third, the trial judge should employ the balanc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>ing process under Rule 403. Other acts evidence is not admissible simply because it does not violate Rule 404(b). Rather, a \"determination must be made whether the danger of undue prejudice [substantially] outweighs the probative value of the evidence in view of the availability of other means of proof and other facts appropriate for making decision of this kind under Rule 403.\u201d 28 USCA, p 196, advisory committee notes to FRE 404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Finally, the trial court, upon request, may provide a limiting instruction under Rule 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">The relationship of the elements of the charge, the theories of admissibility, and the defenses asserted governs what is relevant and material. It is to this relationship and what it dictates for the evidence in these cases that we now turn.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">We deal first with the charge involving Todd F. At oral argument, the prosecutor and the defense acknowledged that the defendant had answered the criminal sexual contact charges with a general denial and had not asserted accident or mistake. While acknowledging that the defendant\u2019s theory at trial will not contest that the defendant was present at the times and places alleged, and suggesting he will question the \"lack of veracity\u201d of witnesses Todd F and Steven C, the defense contends that the defendant\u2019s general denial prevents the other acts evidence from being relevant to a matter in issue in the case of Todd F. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">The defendant is charged with two counts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>second-degree criminal sexual conduct.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The statute requires the prosecutor to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that sexual contact occurred. To prove sexual contact, the prosecutor must show that the defendant intentionally touched Todd\u2019s genitals or the clothing covering Todd\u2019s genital parts, and that this touching \"can reasonably be construed as being for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">During the preliminary examination and pretrial hearings, the prosecutor presented Todd F\u2019s testimony that the defendant sat on Todd\u2019s genitals for extended periods of time while they wres-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>tied. Detective Fogerty testified that the defendant admitted to sitting on Todd on one occasion, that no sexual contact occurred, or that any contact with Todd\u2019s private areas was inadvertent or accidental. The defendant\u2019s supervisor Fred Ward testified that before the defendant took Todd to his brother\u2019s house, he had been informed that client contact should occur in public settings and had been directed to advise and document client contacts outside such a setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The defendant\u2019s admission to Detective Fogerty that he had tickled Todd, and that any contact between himself and Todd\u2019s private areas was accidental, together with Ward\u2019s testimony that defendant admitted that he had taken Todd to his brother\u2019s home despite a written directive not to do so except in accord with specified procedures, assures the relevancy of Steven C\u2019s testimony, the general denial notwithstanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">As the United States Supreme Court recently explained in <em>Estelle v McGuire, </em>502 US 62; 112 S Ct 475, 480-481; 116 L Ed 2d 385 (1991), a defendant\u2019s general denial of the charged act does not prevent a matter from being at issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-7\">In holding the prior injury evidence inadmissible, the Court of Appeals also relied on the theory that, because no claim was made at trial that Tori died accidentally, the battered child syndrome evidence was irrelevant and violative of due process. . . . This ruling ignores the fact that the prosecution must prove all the elements of a criminal offense beyond a reasonable doubt. In this second degree murder case, for example, the prosecution was required to demonstrate that the killing was intentional. ... By eliminating the possibility of accident, the evidence regarding battered child syndrome was clearly probative of that essential element, especially in light of the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>McGuire had claimed prior to trial that Tori had injured herself by falling from the couch. The Court of Appeals, however, ruled that the evidence should have been excluded because McGuire did not raise the defense of accidental death at trial. But the prosecution\u2019s burden to prove every element of the crime is not relieved by a defendant\u2019s tactical decision not to contest an essential element of the oifense. In the federal courts \"[a] simple plea of not guilty . . . puts the prosecution to its proof as to all elements of the crime charged.\u201d <em>Mathews v United States, </em>485 US 58, 64-65; 108 S Ct 883, 887; 99 L Ed 2d 54 (1988).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">In Michigan, as in the federal courts, a plea of not guilty puts the prosecution to its proofs regarding all elements of the crime charged. MCR 6.301(A); <em>People v Eddington, </em>387 Mich 551; 198 NW2d 297 (1972). Thus, a tactical general denial by a defendant does not prevent the prosecutor from introducing other acts evidence at trial. The other acts evidence is relevant to, and probative of, the defendant\u2019s innocent intent in the Todd F case.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> We therefore hold that the trial court erred in determining that the testimony of Steven C and John J was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">A general denial presumptively puts all elements of an oifense at issue. While it does not automatically entitle the prosecutor to a pretrial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>ruling that the proffered evidence is admissible, the defense may not bar such evidence where it disputes the material fact of consequence to which the other acts evidence is relevant. In short, a defense need not be formally set up to create an issue clearly within the facts. 2 Wigmore, Evidence (Chadbourn rev), \u00a7 307, p 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The consequential fact, i.e., defendant\u2019s innocent intent, is more than a plausible or speculative defense in the Todd F case. Moreover, Steven C\u2019s testimony is sufficiently similar<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> to Todd F\u2019s testimony to make it objectively less probable that the defendant acted with innocent intent in the Todd F case.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> When other acts are offered to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>intent, logical relevance dictates only that the charged crime and the proffered other acts \"are of the same general category.\u201d Imwinkelried, Uncharged Misconduct Evidence, \u00a73:11, p 23.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Evidence of both of the alleged assaults is logically relevant and probative of the defendant\u2019s intent in the Todd F case because it negates the otherwise reasonable assumption that the contact described in testimony by Todd F was accidental,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> as op<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>posed to being for the purpose of sexual gratification. Finally, evidence of the assault of Steven C is not only relevant, but highly probative of the defendant\u2019s intent in taking Todd to his brother\u2019s house. Without such evidence, the factfinder would be left with a chronological and conceptual void regarding the events surrounding Ward\u2019s directive to the defendant, <em>United States v Ostrowsky, </em>501 F2d 318, 322 (CA 7, 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The other acts testimony of Steven C<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> is relevant under Rule 404(b). However, because Rule 403 determinations are best left to a contemporaneous assessment of the presentation, credibility, and effect of testimony,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> we remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"AIn\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The testimony provided in the Todd F case by the defendant\u2019s supervisor, Fred Ward, that the defendant had been allowed to continue client contact on the specific condition that such contact occur in public or on a documented basis pursuant to a treatment plan, and that the defendant had admitted to Ward that he nonetheless took Todd to his brother\u2019s house without documentation, does not implicate Rule 404(b) and is admissible for its bearing on the defendant\u2019s state of mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The defendant\u2019s conduct on the job, including his failure to comply with Ward\u2019s instructions and to document his nonpublic contact with clients, did not amount to a civil or criminal legal wrong. Therefore, Ward\u2019s testimony is admissible for its probative force to prove the accusation against the defendant, Rule 401, <em>United States v Hatch, </em>926 F2d 387 (CA 5, 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">However, to underscore our observation that Rule 404 is not a combination lock requiring particular numbers to be spun<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> before the door to admissibility swings open, we observe that even assuming the defendant\u2019s violation of Ward\u2019s directive is another wrong \"act,\u201d admission would not violate Rule 404(b). The defendant does not dispute that he was present at the times and place alleged. Thus, the uncontested violation of Ward\u2019s directive bears directly on the credibility of the defendant\u2019s general denial and is relevant to the defendant\u2019s state of mind.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> In this configuration, there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>requirement that the other act bear any similarity to the charged act. Because there is no inference to character, and because the evidence is powerfully probative of a primary issue in dispute, the defendant\u2019s state of mind, we hold that Ward\u2019s testimony would be admissible even if it were another act within the meaning of Rule 404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">We deal next with the admissibility of the other acts evidence in the charge involving Steven C.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">During the preliminary examination and pretrial hearings, Steven C testified that the defendant asked him to take a shower, and that following that shower the defendant proceeded to masturbate Steven. The alleged assault occurred at the defendant\u2019s brother\u2019s house while the defendant was Steven\u2019s caseworker. Detective Fogerty testified that while the defendant admitted taking Steven to his brother\u2019s house and asking him to take a shower, he denied any sexual contact occurred. The defendant answered these charges with a general denial. Under Rule 404(b), the defendant\u2019s general denial makes presumptively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>relevant other acts evidence bearing on an issue other than propensity. Accordingly, as in the Todd F case, the trial court and the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that other acts testimony was not admissible because the defendant had not formally indicated what would be contested at trial.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">In <em>Engelman, </em>we rejected the defendant\u2019s contention that the proffered evidence was inadmissible because the defendant had denied commission of the offense and had not put in dispute his identity or state of mind;<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> \"[c]learly, such a scheme, plan, or system on the defendant\u2019s part, if properly established, would serve as the intermediate inference necessary to ensure that the evidence sought to be admitted is not character evidence, and thus not necessarily excluded under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>rule,\u201d <em>supra, </em>p 220. When relevance to an issue other than mere propensity is found, Rule 404(b) is not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">In the Steven C case, as in the Todd F case, the evidence of both other acts is relevant because the defense is a general denial. Sexual purpose is an element of the offense, see <em>United States v Marin-Cifuentes, </em>866 F2d 988 (CA 8, 1989), and the testimony is sufficiently similar to be relevant to intent under the theory of improbability.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Huddleston, </em>other acts evidence is especially pertinent where the trial court determines that the issue \"involves the actor\u2019s state of mind and the only means of ascertaining that mental state is by drawing inferences from conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Thus, the relevance requirement of Rule 404(b) is not violated by introduction of the other acts evidence in the Steven C case. However, as with the admissibility of Steven C\u2019s and John J\u2019s testimony in the Todd F case, the record is insufficient to reliably assess the probative value of the evidence under Rule 403.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Moreover, because <em>Golo-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number><em>chowicz </em>erroneously linked relevance to the issues actually disputed at trial, <em>id. </em>at 316, we are concerned that the pretrial posture of the defense may have been detrimentally affected by the notion that a general denial precludes all offers of Rule 404(b) evidence. Fairness requires remand to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">vi</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">On remand, the trial court is to further explore and identify the probative value of the other acts evidence in the Todd F and Steven C cases to the fact of consequence, i.e., mens rea, and determine whether the probative value of the other act testimony. is \"substantially outweighed\u201d by its potential for unfair prejudice, MRE 403.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> The parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>must also be afforded the opportunity to further support or rebut other theories, such as modus operandi and unlikely coincidence, for relevancy to actus reus.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> However, we caution the bench and bar that other acts evidence must move through a permissible intermediate inference, such as mens rea, lack of accident, or common plan or scheme, to be relevant to actus reus. Absent such an intermediate inference, the other acts evidence bears only on propensity and is inadmissable.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The source of the burden imposed on trial courts when assessing relevance under Rule 404(b) and admissibility under Rule 403 is not in abstract propositions of governing law. The root of the problem is the inherent complexity of evaluating the life of the modern day trial within a shifting mosaic of consequential facts, relevance of the evidence, state of the proofs, and predictions about the state of mind of the factfinder.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-7\">In the formalistic days of the common law, ascertaining the hypothesis which governed a particular controversy was \u2014 in theory at least \u2014 simple; one looked to the pleadings. A line of proof could not be directed to a proposition unless it had been placed in issue by the pleadings, and thus had been explicitly labeled as a consequential fact. [1 Weinstein, Evidence, \u00b6 401(04), p 401-27.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">Amendment of the pleadings to conform with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>the proofs is now universally accepted,<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> and in Michigan authorized by MCL 600.2301; MSA 27A.2301, and MCR 6.112(G). Adding to the complexity of \"ascertaining the hypothesis\u201d that governs a trial under contemporary standards for amendment of the pleadings, the trial courts of this state must also evaluate the admissibility of other acts evidence against the backdrop of the law governing included and cognate offenses. The defendant is not required to contest an element of the charged offense to create an issue of fact regarding necessarily included offenses deemed to be encompassed by the information. <em>People v Ora </em>Jones, 395 Mich 379; 236 NW2d 461 (1975).<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Furthermore, the doctrine of cognate offenses seemingly permits a disputed issue to be raised by the testimony of any witness, irrespective of whether the theory of defense actually encompasses the evidentiary theory that testimony might create. <em>People v Beach, </em>429 Mich 450, 490; 418 NW2d 861 (1988). Finally, the trial court may not instruct a jury that uncontested elements of an offense are established. <em>People v Reed, </em>393 Mich 342; 224 NW2d 867 (1975). These considerations exclude a formalistic approach that defines consequential facts either by reference to the pleadings alone or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>by reference to those facts expressly made material at trial.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> They also define the parameters of the dilemma, which, simply stated, is that no judge can be expected to correctly assess the evi-dentiary issue unless and until the court is presented with a concrete theory of defense that allows the court to determine relevancy. Without such a concrete presentation, a defendant\u2019s general posture, as here, requires the trial judge to assume the relevancy of other acts proffered under noncharacter theories of admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">These considerations underscore the wisdom of embracing an approach to discovery, undertaken by many state courts and the federal judiciary, which promotes reliable decision making. To assist the judiciary in this extraordinarily difficult context and to promote the public interest in reliable fact finding, we intend to adopt a modification of Rule 404(b). We require the prosecution to give pretrial notice of its intent to introduce other acts evidence at trial,<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> and authorize the trial judge, consistent with the law in ten other states,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> to require the defendant to articulate his theory or theories of defense.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Where pretrial procedures, including requests for offers of proof,<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> do not furnish a record basis to reliably determine the relevance and admissibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>of other acts evidence, the trial court should employ its authority to control the order of proofs,<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> require the prosecution to present its case in chief, and delay ruling on the proffered other acts evidence until after the examination and cross-examination of prosecution witnesses. If the court still remains uncertain of an appropriate ruling at the conclusion of the prosecutor\u2019s other proofs, it should permit the use of other acts evidence on rebuttal, or allow the prosecution to reopen its proofs after the defense rests, if it is persuaded in light of all the evidence presented at trial, that the other acts evidence is necessary to allow the jury to properly understand the issues, <em>United States v Colon, </em>880 F2d 650 (CA 2, 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">We strongly encourage this flexible approach to determining admissability. The probative value of other acts evidence and its true potential for prejudice is often unclear until the proofs are actually presented. Other acts evidence relevant to elements technically at issue because of a not guilty plea may initially have only marginal probative value in comparison to the potential prejudice generated by the evidence. Where, for example, the real issue contested is whether the act was committed, and the prosecution\u2019s claim is that the disputed issue of mens rea requires admission of other acts evidence in the case in chief, the trial court should defer the ruling on admissability where the jury would be likely to determine criminal state of mind from the doing of the act, allowing admission in the case in chief only if the evidence of other acts meets the standards for admission as proof of actus reus. On the other hand, in some cases the cross-examination of witnesses in the case in chief may make it clear that the intent with which the act was committed is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>likely to be a matter of significant concern to the factfinder. The prosecutor should not be allowed to introduce other acts evidence only because it is technically relevant, nor should the defendant be allowed to interdict proofs that are highly probative of a truly contested issue. By waiting to determine the admissability of other acts evidence relevant to an element only technically at issue, the trial court is able to forestall gamesmanship by the parties and insure the admission of evidence that possesses significant probative value. The ultimate goal is an enlightened basis for the trial court\u2019s conclusion of relevance and for the attendant inquiry under MRE 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">We reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals. The testimony of Fred Ward is relevant and admissible in the Todd F case. The testimony of Steven C and John J is relevant in the Todd F case. The testimony of Todd F and John J is relevant in the Steven C case. We remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b285-6\">Brickley, Riley, Griffin, and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b285-7\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqa\"><em>(separate </em>opinion). It is difficult to argue with much of what is said in the majority opinion.

The United States Supreme Court did not there hold or say that \"a defendant\u2019s general denial of the charged act does not prevent a matter from being at issue.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The holding reported in that case, as set forth in the syllabus in the United States Supreme Court Reports, Lawyers\u2019 Edition, Second Series, report, was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-4\">Introduction of evidence to prove \"battered child syndrome\u201d at California murder trial for allegedly killing infant, and jury instruction as to evidence\u2019s use, held not to violate <em>due process. </em>[116 L Ed 2d 385. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-5\"><em>Estelle v McGuire </em>is one of many decisions in which the United States Supreme Court has limited the use of federal habeas corpus to review state court decisions on asserted federal constitutional grounds. The United States Supreme Court in <em>Estelle v McGuire </em>held only that the Due Process Clause did not prevent the use made of other acts evidence in that case. The United States Supreme Court did not preclude the adoption, in the federal courts or in other state courts of standards more protective of the accused\u2019s right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">My concern with the majority opinion is that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>does not stress that the other acts evidence must be probative of a <em>disputed material </em>issue.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">The issue in the instant case is more like the issue presented in <em>People v Engelman, </em>434 Mich 204; 453 NW2d 656 (1990), than the issue presented in <em>People v Golochowicz, </em>413 Mich 298; 319 NW2d 518 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">In <em>Golochowicz, </em>there was no dispute that a crime had been committed. The disputed issue was whether Golochowicz had committed it. Other acts evidence was used to identify him as the perpetrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">In <em>Engelman, </em>the issue was whether, as here, a crime had been committed. The prosecutor sought to introduce other acts evidence \u2014 a photograph of the defendant standing next to a nude young woman \u2014 to show that Engelman, who was charged with third-degree criminal sexual conduct, had placed his mouth on the penis of a fifteen-year-old boy. This Court held, in an opinion by Justice Boyle, signed by Chief Justice Riley and Justices Brickley and Griffin, and in a concurring opinion which I wrote, signed by Justices Cavanagh and Archer, that the other acts evidence (a photograph) was not admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">This case is much like <em>Engelman </em>in the sense that VanderVliet is charged with criminal sexual conduct, and the disputed issue is not identity, as in <em>Golochowicz, </em>but whether he engaged in criminal sexual conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">Steven C testified that VanderVliet asked him to take a shower, and that, following the shower, VanderVliet masturbated him and he ejaculated.

In some applications it overlaps the exception for knowledge in that proof that the defendant was aware of the nature of an act at an earlier point in time makes it unlikely that he would have forgotten that information at the time of the charged crime. Often the absence of mistake or accident is proved on a notion of probability, i.e., how likely is it that the defendant would have made the same mistake or have been involved in the same fortuitous act on more than one occasion. The relevance of other crimes for this purpose depends very much on the nature of the act involved; one might inadvertently pass more than one counterfeit bill but two accidental shootings of the same victim seem quite unlikely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-10\">The justification for admitting evidence of mistake or accident is the same as for the other exceptions involving proof of the defendant\u2019s state of mind. When offered for this purpose, no inference to any conduct of the defendant is required and, in addition, in many cases the evidence does not require any inference as to the character of the accused. [22 Wright &amp; Graham, n 35 <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 5247, pp 517-518.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">For further examples, see Imwinkelried, Uncharged Misconduct Evidence, \u00a7 5:10, p 26:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-12\">There are numerous hypothetical and actual examples of the use of uncharged misconduct to disprove a claimed accident. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Wigmore\u2019s hypothetical of the three shots is a leading illustration. The defendant claims that he accidentally discharged the rifle in the victim\u2019s direction on each occasion; but as the number of \"accidental\u201d discharges increases, the claim of accident becomes less believable. The courts often admit uncharged misconduct in child abuse cases when the defendant claims that he or she accidentally injured the child. If the defendant claims that he accidentally touched a child\u2019s genital organs, evidence of the defendant\u2019s similar uncharged sexual misconduct is admissible to prove the defendant\u2019s lewd intent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1\">If the defendant claims that she intended to merely discipline her child, evidence of uncharged misconduct may be admissible to establish the defendant\u2019s intent to injure the child. If the defendant claims that he accidentally bumped into or ran down the victim, evidence of the defendant\u2019s other assaults on the same or similar victims is admissible to show intent.

Announcement of a new \"clarified standard\u201d is not necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"A-c\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">Under the federal rule, other acts evidence is admissible if the evidence is logically relevant, FRE 401, and probative of an issue other than propensity, FRE 404. The federal rule also requires enough evidence for the judge to find that the jury could reasonably conclude by a preponderance of the evidence that the other act occurred, FRE 104(b). The judge then must weigh the probative value against potential undue prejudice as required by FRE 403. If requested, the judge also must give a limiting instruction to the jury, FRE 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">The Michigan rule, though using language different from the federal rule, encompasses nearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>identical requirements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In Michigan, all questions involving the admissibility of other acts evidence require the judge to apply MRE 401 and 402, as enforced through MRE 104(b), 403, and 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The factors outlined in <em>People v Golochowicz, </em>413 Mich 298, 309; 319 NW2d 518 (1982), serve only to restate the existing evidentiary rules. The first factor, which requires substantial evidence that the defendant committed the other act, is enforced through MRE 402 and 104(b). The second factor, which requires the other act to have a special quality relevant to the charged offense and the purpose for admitting the evidence, is required by the language of MRE 404(b) and the corresponding statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The third factor simply is a restatement of the MRE 401 and 404 relevancy requirements, and the fourth factor is a restatement of the MRE 403 balancing test.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The difficulty in applying the evidentiary rules is that the relevance and special quality requirements will vary, depending on the purpose for admitting the evidence. <em>Golochowicz </em>and earlier cases explain the general evidentiary rules and how to apply them when deciding whether to admit other acts evidence. But, the precedential value of each case is limited to interpretations of the general rules, and to their application to cases involving the same purpose for admitting the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\"><em>Golochowicz </em>is an identity case under MRE 404(b). Thus, other than to examine interpretation of the general rules, and to examine application of the relevancy and similarity requirements to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>identity case, <em>Golochowicz </em>will not apply.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because this case is not an identity case, application of <em>Golochowicz </em>is limited. The general test is applicable, however, and there are cases interpreting the individual purposes for admitting the evidence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The majority explains that the federal rule, through FRE 104(b), requires the judge to decide whether the jury reasonably could find that the other act occurred by a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Ante </em>at 68, n 20. Then the majority states that Michigan wrongly adopted a \"substantial evidence\u201d requirement because there is no basis or language in Rule 404(r) or the corresponding statute. <em>Id. </em>at 66-68. The majority fails to recognize, however, that Michigan has a corresponding Rule 104(b), and thus may have the same requirement as the federal rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Both jurisdictions require evidence that the defendant committed the other act. But this Court has not interpreted MRE 104(b) and has not defined \"substantial evidence\u201d in the context of other acts evidence. The term has been defined in another context, however.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>In <em>Soto v Director of Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>73 Mich App 263, 271; 251 NW2d 292 (1977), the Court explained that substantial evidence \" 'means evidence which a reasoning mind would accept as sufficient to support a conclusion. \"It consists of more than a mere scintilla of evidence but may be somewhat less than a preponderance\u201d of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The rule does not require the judge or the jury to evaluate or weigh conflicting evidence. Thus, \"substantial evidence\u201d as defined in <em>Soto </em>is less restrictive than the federal standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Another possible interpretation is that Michigan\u2019s standard is the same as the federal standard described in <em>Huddleston v United States, </em>485 US 681, 687; 108 S Ct 1496; 99 L Ed 2d 771 (1988). See <em>ante </em>at 68, n 20.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To reach that conclusion, we must examine the origin of the term \"substantial evidence\u201d as used in other acts evidence cases. In <em>Golochowicz </em>at 309, we merely accepted the Court of Appeals adoption of the four safeguards in <em>People v Wilkins, </em>82 Mich App 260; 266 NW2d 781 (1978).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals in <em>Wilkins </em>stated that \"there must be substantial evidence that the defendant actually perpetrated the bad act sought to be introduced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 267. The Court cited <em>People v Davis, </em>343 Mich 348; 72 NW2d 269 (1955), and McCormick, Evidence (2d ed), \u00a7 190, to support the use of the \"substantial evidence\u201d requirement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">In <em>Davis, </em>we stated that \"we are in agreement with defense counsel that such acts if admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>may bear on intent only if the jury is first convinced that they had been perpetrated by the accused,\u201d and that the jury is the sole judge of the witnesses\u2019 credibility. <em>Id. </em>at 365. McCormick used the phrase \"substantial evidence,\u201d to differentiate between a substantial evidence rule and a clear and convincing evidence rule. McCormick did not define substantial evidence, but merely cited <em>People v Albertson, </em>23 Cal 2d 550, 557-581; 145 P2d 7 (1944). McCormick, \u00a7 190 at 452, n 51. <em>Albertson </em>also does not provide a clear definition of \"substantial evidence,\u201d but does provide several examples of standards upon which other courts have relied.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The theories range from \"more than a mere suspicion\u201d to \"clear and convincing\u201d evidence requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">Although we used the term \"convince\u201d in <em>Davis, </em>the <em>Wilkins </em>Court intuitively recognized that a clear and convincing evidence requirement is too <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>restrictive, and thus adopted McCormick\u2019s phrase, \"substantial evidence.\u201d For <em>Davis, Wilkins, </em>and McCormick to be read consistently, \"substantial evidence\u201d must mean something more than a mere suspicion,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> but less than clear and convincing evidence. The <em>Huddleston </em>interpretation presents a standard that falls in the middle of the range.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">If the majority agrees with the <em>Soto </em>definition of \"substantial evidence,\u201d then the federal standard for enforcing Rule 104(b) is more restrictive. If the majority agrees that the <em>Huddleston </em>interpretation of Rule 104(b) is consistent with the term \"substantial evidence\u201d as used in McCormick and <em>Davis, </em>then the standards for enforcing Rule 104(b) are the same under the federal and Michigan rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The requirement that the other act be similar or have a special quality related to the charged act also is required by the federal rule. The majority explained that \"[t]he need for other acts to be similar to one another . . . derives from the requirements of logical relevance . . . .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 79, n 34. Because logical relevance must be determined before admitting the other acts testimony, the similarity or special quality requirement applies to both the federal and the Michigan rules.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>I agree with the majority\u2019s statement that there is a \"mistaken assumption that all other acts needed to be similar.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 79, n 34. The requirement is that the other act is similar <em>or </em>has a special quality relating to the charged act.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The majority provides several examples that further illustrate the similarity or special quality requirement. Similarly, several Michigan cases have interpreted the requirement as applied to the specific purpose for admitting the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">The majority also discusses whether Rule 404(b) is exclusionary or inclusionary. Although it seems that \"exclusionary\u201d is the logical characterization,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> I believe the distinction is one without a difference,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and only causes confusion. The judge must consider the evidence and apply the eviden-tiary rules to decide whether to admit it. Facts are facts, and evidence is evidence, The facts and evidence do not suddenly change on the basis that the rule is exclusionary or inclusionary. The evi-dentiary rules must be applied to the facts and evidence, and whether the rule is inclusionary or exclusionary does not alter the facts, the evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>the rules, or the manner in which the rules are applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Furthermore, <em>all </em>other acts evidence has the underlying inference that the defendant is a bad person. Thus, as a general rule, the evidence should be excluded. But, if the evidence also is introduced for another purpose, the intermediate inference,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and it meets the evidentiary safeguards, the evidence should be admitted.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In cases where it is a close call whether to admit the evidence, Michigan precedent suggests that the court should err in favor of exclusion. The reason for excluding \"similar bad-acts evidence for substantive purposes is the desire to avoid the danger of conviction based upon a defendant\u2019s history of other misconduct rather than upon the evidence of his conduct in the case . . . .\u201d <em>Golochowicz </em>at 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Michigan\u2019s evidentiary rules concerning other acts testimony are capable of clear explanation, and the standards for enforcing the Michigan rules are closely similar to, if not the same as, the federal standards. The Michigan Rules of Evidence and the cases interpreting them are not based on federal law. The comment to the proposed Michigan Rules of Evidence explains that \"MRE 404(b) is consistent with prior Michigan law. <em>People v Smith, </em>388 Mich 93; 200 NW2d 196 (1972); <em>People v Spillman, </em>63 Mich App 256; 234 NW2d 475 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>(1975); MCL 768.27; MSA 28.1050.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>In re Proposed Michigan Rules of Evidence, </em>399 Mich 951, 974 (1977).

Thus, if evidence is excluded because of Rule 404, the rule is exclusionary. Other acts testimony may be admissible, notwithstanding Rule 404. Any evidence that attempts to prove the character of the defendant is excluded. Thus, while evidence must pass muster under Rules 401 and 403, the evidence also must satisfy Rule 404(b) or be excluded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b297-10\"> Admittedly, there might be a philosophical difference, but that does not effect the legal and logical analysis required to determine when to admit other acts evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b298-7\"> See <em>Engelman, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b298-8\"> The majority admits that MRE 404(b) \" 'is a nonexclusive list of examples of situations in which the <em>general rule excluding character evidence, </em>MRE 404(a), is not offended because the evidence is probative of some fact other than the defendant\u2019s criminal propensity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante </em>at 66.

The majority failed to realize, however, that the safeguards assist in determining whether the general rule is offended and whether the evidence is admitted to show something other than the defendant\u2019s criminal propensity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b299-7\"> The text of the statute reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-8\">In any criminal case where the defendant\u2019s motive, intent, the absence of, mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant\u2019s scheme, plan or system in doing an act, is material, any like acts or other acts of the defendant which may tend to show his motive, intent, the absence of, mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant\u2019s scheme, plan or system in doing the act, in question, may be proved, whether they are contemporaneous with or prior or subsequent thereto; notwithstanding that such proof may show or tend to show the commission of another or prior or subsequent crime by the defendant.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b299-9\"> The apparent motive in adopting the new rule is to extirpate the existing safeguards planted by this Court years ago. A full analysis and comparison of the two rules, however, suggests that the federal rule really is the same, if not more restrictive than Michigan\u2019s rule. Thus, in my view, the majority accomplishes nothing more than adding to the already confused state of this jurisprudentially significant issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
