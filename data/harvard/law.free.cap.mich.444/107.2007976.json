For approximately <em>12V2 </em>of those years, Mr. Schippers was employed at the SPX-Sealed Power Division. In August 1986, Mr. Schippers transferred from Sealed Power to another division within spx, the Hy-Lift Division, which had only one truck and one driver, Mr. Schippers.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">Spx leased its trucks, including the truck driven by Mr. Schippers, from defendant Ryder Truck Rental. As part of the lease agreement between spx and Ryder, spx agreed to operate the trucks in a safe and careful manner.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On January 28, 1987, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Ryder\u2019s district controller, Peter Stanley, sent a letter to Hy-Lift\u2019s production control manager, Larry Bozik, informing him that Mr. Schippers had been involved in three accidents and that Ryder was placing Mr. Schippers on probation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hy-Lift\u2019s employee relations manager, Patrick E. Goresch challenged the basis for Ryder\u2019s decision and requested proof to establish its claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Ryder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>never sent the requested information and nothing further occurred until August 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">On August 6, 1987, approximately one year after his transfer to Hy-Lift, Mr. Schippers was involved in a traffic accident. While Mr. Schippers claims that the accident was caused by a \"steering malfunction,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> an investigation conducted by Ryder indicated that the accident occurred because Mr. Schippers fell asleep at the wheel. In any event, Ryder notified spx that, pursuant to the lease agreement, it was requesting that Mr. Schip-pers not be permitted to operate any of its vehicles. Ryder further warned spx that if it allowed Mr. Schippers to operate any of its vehicles, then spx would be in breach of contract and liable for all personal injury and property damage resulting from any accident involving Mr. Schippers after the date of the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Following receipt of this letter, spx initiated its own investigation. The investigation revealed that this was not Mr. Schippers\u2019 first accident; it was only \"one of many which occurred while Schippers was a truck driver for spx.\u201d On the basis of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>investigation, an spx risk-management employee, James Sheridan, determined that of all spx truck drivers employed, Schippers presented the greatest risk to the enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Mr. Schippers was terminated on September 4, 1987. He commenced this action against spx in Muskegon Circuit Court, on June 15, 1988, claiming that his discharge violated his employment agreement, which provided for discharge only for cause and negligent evaluation. The trial court granted spx\u2019s motion for summary judgment on both counts, but the Court of Appeals reversed. 186 Mich App 595; 465 NW2d 34 (1990). Spx filed an application for leave to appeal in this Court, which, in lieu of granting leave, remanded to the Court of Appeals for reconsideration in light of <em>Rowe v Montgomery Ward &amp; Co, Inc, </em>437 Mich 627; 473 NW2d 268 (1991). 439 Mich 895 (1991). On remand, the Court of Appeals reaffirmed its original holding. 194 Mich App 52; 486 NW2d 89 (1992). We subsequently granted spx\u2019s application for leave to appeal, 441 Mich 881 (1992), and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">B. <em>ROOD V GENERAL DYNAMICS CORP</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">The plaintiff, Dr. Richard Rood, began working for Chrysler Corporation at its Hamtramck plant in 1968 as a per diem plant physician. In 1970, he converted to a salaried employee at the urging of his supervisor, Dr. George Olson. Dr. Rood\u2019s employment responsibilities included the performance of physicals for newly hired workers and workers returning to work, and workers\u2019 compensation evaluations. He also was responsible for providing general medical care for plant employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">In 1972, Dr. Rood was promoted to senior plant physician at the Hamtramck plant. This position <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>required the supervision of other doctors and nurses. He performed this function until Chrysler closed its Hamtramck plant in 1980 and transferred Dr. Rood to the Detroit tank plant, where he assumed the role of plant physician, working under the direct supervision of the personnel manager, Owsley Spiller.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Chrysler sold the Detroit tank plant in March 1982 to the defendant, General Dynamics Land Systems (gdls), which retained the entire plant medical department, including Dr. Rood as plant physician. As a result, Dr. Rood continued to report to Mr. Spiller, and his duties remained essentially the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Gdls had three plants in separate states<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and each plant had its own plant physician who reported to nonmedical personnel. The new vice president of human resources, Donald Norman, testified that he desired to create a more efficient means of handling the various medical facilities at the three plants. As a result, he established the position of division medical director to oversee all the division\u2019s medical personnel, and only that person reported to Mr. Norman. When filling this new position, Mr. Norman bypassed Dr. Rood<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>hired another doctor, Dr. Charles R. Harper, who had an extensive background as a medical director in other corporations. Gdls contends that, after hiring Dr. Harper, an economic concern developed. At the time of his termination, Dr. Rood\u2019s annual salary was $59,000 and Dr. Harper\u2019s starting salary was $70,000. According to Mr. Norman, it was not economically feasible for gdls to have both a full-time plant physician and a division medical director. He, therefore, purportedly decided that the division medical director would perform both the division-wide responsibilities as well as the duties of the plant physician at the Detroit plant and Dr. Rood\u2019s position was eliminated. Dr. Rood challenges the reasons for his dismissal, however, claiming that the hiring of Dr. Harper was solely to replace him.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In any event, in December 1984, the then-director of personnel relations, William Pagen, informed Dr. Rood that gdls \"had decided to replace\u201d him and that he could either submit a letter of resignation or be fired.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Dr. Rood submitted his letter of resignation that became effective on January 4, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Dr. Rood filed this action in Macomb Circuit Court on December 29, 1987, claiming that his discharge violated his employment agreement, negligent evaluation, and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. On gdls\u2019 motion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>the circuit court dismissed plaintiff\u2019s negligent evaluation and breach of good-faith and fair-dealing claims for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted. MCR 2.116(C)(8). Because Dr. Rood did not appeal this determination, the case proceeded through discovery on only the breach of implied contract claim.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Following discovery, gdls filed a motion for summary judgment, which the trial court granted. Dr. Rood appealed in the Court of Appeals, which reversed in a split decision.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Unpublished opinion per curiam, decided December 27, 1990 (Docket No. 117470). Gdls filed an application for leave to appeal in this Court, which, in lieu of granting leave, remanded to the Court of Appeals for reconsideration in light of <em>Rowe. </em>439 Mich 851 (1991). On remand, the Court of Appeals, in yet another split decision,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> reversed its original holding. Unpublished opinion per curiam, decided February 19, 1992 (Docket No. 145598). We subsequently granted Dr. Rood\u2019s application for leave to appeal, 441 Mich 880 (1992), and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Employment contracts for an indefinite<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> duration are presumptively terminable at the will of either party for any reason or for no reason at all. <em>Lynas v Maxwell Farms, </em>279 Mich 684, 687; 273 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>NW 315 (1937).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This presumption is not, however, \"a substantive limitation on the enforceability of employment contracts but merely a rule of 'construction.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Toussaint v Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Michigan, </em>408 Mich 579, 597; 292 NW2d 880 (1980). \"The presumption does not prevent proof of actual intent and should not be employed to permit unjustified evasions of promissory liability.\u201d <em>Rowe </em>at 676, n 14 (Boyle, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">To overcome the presumption of employment at will, a party must present sufficient proof either of a contractual provision for a definite term<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> of employment or a provision forbidding discharge absent just cause. <em>Rowe </em>at 636-637. Such provisions may become part of an employment contract as a result of \"explicit\u201d promises, Perritt, Employee Dismissal Law &amp; Practice (2d ed), \u00a7 4.1, p 173, or promises implied in fact.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Rowe </em>at 668 (Boyle, J., concurring). As recognized in <em>Toussaint, </em>however, employer policies and procedures may also become a legally enforceable part of an employment relationship <em>if </em>such policies and procedures instill \"legitimate expectations\u201d of job secu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>rity<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> in employees. <em>Toussaint </em>at 615.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In other words, there are two alternative theories of enforceability that may support a claim of wrongful discharge in Michigan. While the first theory is grounded solely on contract principles \"relative to the employment setting,\u201d <em>Rowe </em>at 632, the second theory is grounded solely on public policy considerations. As Justice Boyle noted in her concurring opinion in <em>In re Certified Question (Bankey v Storer Broadcasting Co), </em>432 Mich 438, 458; 443 NW2d 112 (1989), \"the pure legitimate expectations leg of <em>Toussaint </em>was founded on the Court\u2019s common-law authority to recognize\u201d enforceable obligations that arise \" 'outside the operation of normal contract principles.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">a. \"contract theory\u201d of <em>toussaint</em></p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">1. APPLICABLE LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">Contractual liability is consensual. 1 Farns-worth, Contracts, \u00a7 3.1, p 160. A basic requirement of contract formation is that the parties mutually assent to be bound. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Rowe, </em>this Court recognized \"the difficulty in verifying oral promises,\u201d <em>Rowe </em>at 641, especially in the employment relations context, because individuals often harbor \"optimistic hope of a long relationship\u201d that causes them to misinterpret their employer\u2019s oral statements as manifestations of an intention to undertake a commitment in the form of a promise of job security. <em>Rowe </em>at 640. Accordingly, and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>an effort to recognize oral contracts for job security only where the circumstances suggest both parties intended to be bound, <em>id. </em>at 636, the <em>Rowe </em>Court held that \"oral statements of job security must be clear and unequivocal to overcome the presumption of employment at will.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">In deciding whether a party has assented to a contract, we follow the objective theory of assent, focusing on how a reasonable person in the position of the promisee would have interpreted the promisor\u2019s statements or conduct. Calamari &amp; Per-illo, Contracts (3d ed), \u00a72-2, p 27. As Professor Farnsworth stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-6\">Since it is difficult for a workable system of contract law to take account of assent unless, there has been an overt expression of it, courts have required that assent to the formation of a contract be manifested in some way, by words or other conduct, if it is to be effective. <em>[Id. </em>at \u00a7 3.1, pp 160-161.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Otherwise stated, to determine whether there was mutual assent to a contract, \"we use an objective test, 'looking to the expressed words of the parties and their visible acts,\u2019 \u201d <em>Rowe </em>at 640, quoting <em>Goldman v Century Ins Co, </em>354 Mich 528, 535; 93 NW2d 240 (1958), and ask whether a reasonable person could have interpreted the words or conduct in the manner that is alleged. Thus, we begin our analysis by looking \"to all the relevant circumstances surrounding the transaction, including all writings, oral statements, and other conduct by which the parties manifested their intent.\u201d <em>Rowe </em>at 641.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">(A) <em>SCHIPPERS</em></p>\n<p id=\"AN5\">(i) EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">Viewed in a light most favorable to Mr. Schip-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>pers, the relevant evidence is as follows: Mr. Schip-pers was employed at Sealed Power for approximately <em>12V2 </em>years before transferring to Hy-Lift. Before Mr. Schippers transferred to that division, Hy-Lift did not have a truck or a driver and relied totally on Sealed Power for its transportation needs.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In an effort to save money and to gain additional control over its transportation needs, Hy-Lift decided to lease a truck from Ryder and approached Mr. Schippers about his willingness to transfer from Sealed Power to Hy-Lift. Although Hy-Lift had its choice of Sealed Power drivers, it wanted Mr. Schippers because he had driven for Hy-Lift, knew the routes, and was considered the most reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Mr. Schippers was one of seven drivers at Sealed Power, and he was second in seniority. Consequently, before deciding to make the switch to Hy-Lift, Mr. Schippers \"consulted\u201d with three of Hy-Lift supervisors, including his immediate supervisor, Mr. Bozik, and the general manager of Hy-Lift, Mr. Overway, about \"job security.\u201d During these conversations, Roy Overway told him that \"as far as he was concerned, unless something was really wrong, [Mr. Schippers] would be there for retirement\u201d' and that \"Mr. Bosik [sic] went so far as to make the comment that as long as [Hy-Lift] had a truck, [he] would be the driver.\u201d Moreover, Mr. Schippers states that he was given \"similar\u201d assurances from another \"management person\u201d at Hy-Lift, Perry Abbes, although he was unable to recall his exact words.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">At the time of transfer, spx had issued an employee \"Information Handbook.\u201d On page one, the handbook provides:_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>We are proud of our people and recognize their value through steady employment, fair wages, good working conditions, unusually broad benefit programs, and recognition as individuals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-5\">Sealed Power has adopted overall policies of employment and standards of conduct which are <em>fair </em>to all employees and in the best interest of the company. <em>These policies and standards spell out your responsibilities to the company and the company\u2019s responsibility and obligations to you. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The handbook also provides that \"[t]he company, by its actions and attitudes, will endeavor to maintain a spirit of good will, loyalty and harmony among all persons in the organization.\u201d In addition, the handbook provides for a sixty-day probationary period for \"[a]ll newly hired employees\u201d and lists \"prohibited\u201d \"practices,\u201d which <em>\"may\u201d </em>result in \"disciplinary action up to and including discharge . . . .\u201d One prohibited practice is \"[involvement in chargeable accidents . . . .\u201d The list of prohibited practices does not, however, purport to be exhaustive: \"There may be other instances than those noted . . . where common sense will indicate any necessary action that should be taken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">\"In [conclusion,\u201d the handbook contains the following disclaimer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-8\">The contents of this manual are presented as a matter of information only. While Sealed Power believes wholeheartedly in the plans, policies and procedures described here, they are not conditions of employment. Sealed Power reserves the right to modify, revoke, suspend, terminate, or change any or all such plans, policies, or procedures, in whole or in part, at any time, with or without notice. The language used in this manual is not intended to create, nor is it to be construed a contract between Sealed Power and any one or all of its employees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>It also appears that there existed an informal management policy at Hy-Lift that purported to require \"good reason\u201d before terminating any employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">(\u00dc) ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Spx argues on appeal that the Court of Appeals failed to properly apply this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Rowe. </em>Specifically, spx contends that the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the circuit court\u2019s grant of summary disposition upon finding that Mr. Schippers had failed to present sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption of employment at will. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">The basis of Mr. Schippers claim of a contract implied in fact centers on certain oral statements made to Mr. Schippers during various conversations with Hy-Lift management before he transferred from Sealed Power to Hy-Lift. Mr. Schip-pers characterizes these conversations as specific negotiations regarding job security, and the oral statements of his supervisors as promises of termination only for just cause. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">When approached about formally transferring to Hy-Lift, Mr. Schippers expressed concern about Hy-Lift\u2019s commitment to maintaining its trucking operation to three of his supervisors, including the general manager of Hy-Lift, Roy Overway and his immediate supervisor, Mr. Bozik.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> It was in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>context that Mr. Overway told Mr. Schippers that \"unless something really was wrong, [he] would be there for retirement,\u201d and Mr. Bozik stated that \"as long as [we] have a truck, [you] would be the driver.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Only by taking the statements completely out of context could a reasonable juror interpret them in the manner that Mr. Schippers asserts \u2014 as prom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>ises to terminate \"only if something was really wrong,\u201d i.e., for just cause. The record shows discussions concerning job security in the sense of Hy-Lift\u2019s resolve in maintaining its trucking function, but there is no evidence whatsoever that indicates that the parties even discussed job security in the sense of requiring just cause for Mr. Schippers\u2019 termination.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">The context in which the statements were made to Mr. Schippers is distinguishable from the context in which the statements were made to the plaintiff in <em>Toussaint. </em>Mr. Toussaint had several interviews with company representatives before being hired as an assistant to the company treasurer of Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Michigan (bcbsm). He was subsequently hired following an interview with the company treasurer, Mr. Allen R. Schaedel, in which Mr. Toussaint specifically inquired about job security:_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>\"Mr. Schaedel had indicated to me that as long as I did my job, that I would be with the company [until retirement]; showed me a number of documents \u2014 I had asked the question about how secure a job it was and he said that if I came to Blue Cross, I wouldn\u2019t have to look for another job because he knew of no one ever being <em>discharged.\u201d [Id. </em>at 640-641. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Unlike the facts of this case, both Mr. Toussaint\u2019s inquiry and Mr. Schaedel\u2019s response indicate a discussion concerning the likelihood of Mr. Tous-saint being discharged. Here, the evidence indicates that Mr. Schippers\u2019 only concern was losing his job as a result of Hy-Lift discontinuing its trucking function. Given that Mr. Schippers\u2019 inquiries were restricted to this subject, his supervisors\u2019 statements simply cannot be interpreted as assent to a contract providing for termination only for just cause. See <em>Rowe </em>at 641. Indeed, viewing the statements in context makes clear that the language referred to management\u2019s intentions regarding the permanency of the trucking function at Hy-Lift and not to the sufficiency of the grounds required to terminate Mr. Schippers.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Despite the context in which the statements were made, however, Mr. Schippers insists that his interpretation of the statements was reasonable, given the uniqueness of his position, the apparent custom and practice of Hy-Lift to discharge only for cause, and the written statements contained in the employee \"Information Handbook.\u201d Although we might assume that a person who gives up seniority by transferring from a division with six other drivers might desire just-cause employment, this is an insufficient basis on which to base a finding of specific negotiations regarding such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>term.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Likewise, although it may be reasonable for an employer to offer a driver who is both reliable and familiar with its route just-cause employment to induce the relinquishment of seniority and to transfer to a division with only one truck, that possibility alone is insufficient to permit a reasonable inference that such an offer in fact was made. Nor does the apparent existence of an informal policy purporting to require \"good reason\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> to discharge provide sufficient objective support for Mr. Schippers\u2019 interpretation of the statements. The record does not indicate that Mr. Schippers was even aware of this policy. More importantly, however, it would be unreasonable to interpret the statements as objective manifestations of this in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>formal discharge policy, given the context in which the statements were made. Further, we reject Mr. Schippers\u2019 contention that the written statements contained in the employee \"Information Handbook,\u201d provide objective support for his interpretation of his supervisors\u2019 statements. While the handbook may promise fairness and contain policies designed \"to maintain a spirit of good will, loyalty and harmony among all persons in the organization,\u201d such promises and policies are not inconsistent with employment at will.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">In sum, although there were discussions concerning job security in the sense of Hy-Lift retaining its trucking function, there is absolutely no evidence suggesting that the parties ever discussed job security in the sense of requiring just cause for Mr. Schippers\u2019 termination. As stated in <em>Rowe, </em>oral statements of job security, when viewed in light of surrounding circumstances, \"must clearly permit a construction which supports the asserted meaning.\u201d <em>Rowe </em>at 641. Neither Mr. Overway\u2019s nor Mr. Bozik\u2019s statements, when viewed in context, evidence a clear intention on the part of Hy-Lift to create a contract to terminate Mr. Schip-pers only for cause. Consequently, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, we hold that there is simply insufficient evidence to permit a reasonable jury to find that a reasonable promisee would interpret the language or conduct of Mr. Schippers\u2019 supervisors as a promise forbidding discharge absent just cause. Viewed in context, the oral statements are insufficient to rise to the level of an agreement for just-cause employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">(B) <em>ROOD</em></p>\n<p id=\"Am\">(i) EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to Dr. Rood, we find that sometime after Chrysler <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>sold the tank plant to gdls, Dr. Rood had a conversation with gdls\u2019 director of corporate health and safety, William Persky, regarding job security. During this conversation, Mr. Persky assured Dr. Rood that his \"job is fine, it\u2019s secure.\u201d Further, Dr. Rood\u2019s immediate supervisor, Mr. Spiller, assured Dr. Rood that his job was secure and that he was \"a key player\u201d and \"one of the basic components of the organization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">During Dr. Rood\u2019s employment, gdls utilized what it called a \"Performance and Career Evaluation Program.\u201d The stated purpose of this program was set out in a cover letter accompanying the instructions to the program, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-7\">We, the people of [gdls], are this company\u2019s greatest resource and most valuable asset.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-8\">In recognition of this fact the leaders of gdls are committed to enhance organizational and personal effectiveness, productivity, and operational efficiency by the on-going development of gdls employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-9\">To reach this goal we have designed a Performance Appraisal and Career Development format that involves you and your supervisor in a constructive dialog about your work performance and your work and career goals. It is the intent of this instruction booklet to briefly explain the procedure and the changes in the appraised system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">Two \"workbooks\u201d accompanied this program: (1) a \"Performance Evaluation Workbook,\u201d and (2) a \"Career Expression Workbook.\u201d Completed annually, \"[t]he Performance Evaluation Workbook is ... a tool to help everyone involved reach an understanding of what is expected and how they are meeting those expectations.\u201d The \"Career Expression Workbook,\u201d which is completed at the same time that an employee\u2019s performance is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>rated, \"is designed to clearly establish [the employee\u2019s] longhand short term career goals.\u201d The Career Expression Workbook asks employees to specify their long and short term career goals. Specifically, employees are asked to \"[l]ist positions in the corporation that [they] feel presently qualified for or will be qualified for in the next 5 to 10 years,\u201d as well as \"any job changes [they] feel are possible in the next 3 to 24 months.\u201d The workbook also asked employees to engage in a self analysis and to \"[l]ist those areas in which [they] feel self-improvement is required to achieve [their] long [and short] term career goal.\u201d Lastly, the employee is asked to list areas in which they feel gdls can \"help [them] attain those goals.\u201d Once the workbook is completed, it is submitted to the employee\u2019s supervisor, and the supervisor is required to comment on \"career entries and recommend[ ] steps to help [employees] attain [their] goals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">In April 1983, and again in April 1984, Dr. Rood received \"above average\u201d performance evaluations. While the first evaluation resulted in an \"advancement potential\u201d rating of \"p,\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> the second evaluation resulted in an \"advancement potential\u201d rating of \"k.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The first evaluation was signed by Mr. Spiller and the second evaluation was confirmed by Donald Norman. In his 1983 Career Expression <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Workbook, Dr. Rood expressed an interest in attaining the position of medical directos and his immediate supervisor, Mr. Spiller, confirmed his promotion potential, stating that \"[Dr. Rood], in [his] judgement, is ready now.\u201d Again, in 1984, Dr. Rood expressed an interest in a medical director\u2019s position. This time, in confirming his promotion potential, Mr. Spiller wrote that he \"[s]hould definitely be considered for the Director\u2019s job \u00bft Division level.\u201d Moreover, following each of the above performance evaluations, Dr. Rood was given a \"merit increase.\u201d \"Merit increases\u201d are defined in the Corporate Industrial Relations Policy and Practice manual as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\">A merit increase is an individual salary increase awarded in recognition of progressive performance improvement and prospects for future achievement. Merit increases are earned and are not to be awarded on the basis of length of service or by the lapse of time since the last increase or by other factors unrelated to performance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">In addition to the positive feedback that Dr. Rood was receiving, including verbal assurances of job security, two \"above average\u201d performance evaluations, and two \"merit increases,\u201d Dr. Rood stresses a complete lack of negative feedback, concerning his performance. No one at gdls had ever informed Dr. Rood of any performance related problems, although the \"Performance Evaluation Workbook,\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-8\">An action plan <em>must </em>be developed for every employee evaluated as needing improvement to meet job requirements. A plan should also be developed for each employee meeting or exceeding job requirements but who could perform better. The plan should identify specific goals or objectives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>to be achieved within a specific time period and indicate whether training, education or additional support or assistance from the supervisor would be helpful. Be specific enough so that both employee and supervisor know when the action plan has been accomplished. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">Gdls also promulgated and issued a \"Guide to Good Conduct,\u201d which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-5\">[Gdls] expects that the very highest standards of behavior and conduct will be observed by its employees. Employees are expected to conduct themselves while on Corporation time, business or premises in a manner that promotes the safety and welfare of employees, encourages congenial work habits, and protects personal and Corporation property. <em>Misconduct </em>may result in disciplinary action ranging from reprimand to discharge. Some examples of misconduct, <em>which are not all inclusive, </em>are listed below. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">There are thirty-one examples of \"misconduct\u201d listed in the guide and there is no mention of employment at will.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Lastly, gdls promulgated and issued an \"Industrial Relations\u201d policy and procedure guide, containing \"Standard Practice 2-415\u201d (sp 2-415), which was \"[applicable to all Management and Management Support employees who are to be affected by a reduction in the workforce or circumstances which dictate involuntary termination.\u201d The stated purpose of this standard practice was \"[t]o establish a uniform method of coordinating and effecting the layoff or involuntary termination of Management and Management Support employees.\u201d Sp 2-415 defined \"layoffs\u201d and \"Involuntary Terminations,\u201d in the \"Definitions\u201d section as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>[(1)] <em>Layoff [:] </em>A separation of known or indefinite duration initiated by the Division because of a required or desired reduction in the workforce.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\">[(2)] <em>Involuntary </em>Termination[:] Discharge for reasons of <em>misconduct </em>or <em>unacceptable performance. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Sp 2-415 also provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-8\">V.B. <em>Involuntary Terminations</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-9\">1.

The Industrial Relations representative in attendance when termination action is taken summarizes the event in writing for the record and forwards a copy to the Director \u2014 Personnel Relations for retention and distribution as deemed appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">According to Mr. Norman, a standard practice is an official statement of formal corporate policy. There were no other definitions of involuntary termination ever issued, there are no disclaimers indicating that any of the distributed materials were not to be construed as employment contracts, and there is no mention in any of the distributed materials of employment at will. This policy became effective on January 12, 1984. It is undisputed that Dr. Rood fell within this group of employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Five months after receiving a \"k\u201d performance rating, Dr. Rood was forced to resign to make way for Dr. Richard Harper. In his first amended complaint, Dr. Rood alleged that his termination breached his employment contract that provided for termination only for just cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">(\u00dc) ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">Dr. Rood argues on appeal that the Court of Appeals erred in ruling that his claim of breach of implied contract, providing for termination only for just cause, was insufficient as <em>a </em>matter of law. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">Dr. Rood does not contend that gdls explicitly promised him either just-cause employment or that his position would never be eliminated. Nevertheless, he asserts that the oral statements of Mr. Persky and Mr. Spiller, when coupled with gdls\u2019 published policies and procedures and his favorable evaluations and merit pay increases, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>gave rise to a just-cause employment contract implied in fact, providing that his job was secure absent a layoff, misconduct, or unacceptable performance. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Shortly after gdls acquired the Detroit tank plant, Dr. Rood became aware of a \"paper circulating around,\u201d which appeared to be part of a company document. Contained in this paper was a statement \"to the effect that the nurses were secure, [but] that the doctor was questionable or undecided.\u201d Interpreting the paper to reflect gdls\u2019 intention with regard to the disposition of employees of the newly acquired company, Dr. Rood became concerned. Consequently, he confronted Mr. Persky about the comment in the paper and was told that it had nothing to do with his job, that his \"job [was] fine, it\u2019s secure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">A reasonable juror simply could not find that a reasonable employee in Dr. Rood\u2019s position would have interpreted the statement \"[y]our job is fine, it\u2019s secure,\u201d in context, as a promise of just-cause employment. The statement was made in response to an inquiry about whether gdls had the present intention to eliminate certain employees following the acquisition of the Detroit tank plant, and not in response to an inquiry concerning when or how Dr. Rood\u2019s employment might otherwise be terminated. Indeed, when asked whether Mr. Persky had ever told him at this meeting that he would be discharged only for just cause, Dr. Rood stated: \"I don\u2019t think the subject came up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">Mr. Spiller\u2019s statements to Dr. Rood that his \"job [was] secure\u201d and that he was \"a key player\u201d and \"one of the basic components of the organization\u201d are likewise insufficient to permit a reasonable juror to find that a reasonable promisee would interpret these statements as a promise of just-cause employment. The statements were made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>at one of Dr. Rood\u2019s performance evaluations and again when Dr. Rood was asked to attend a board of directors meeting being held in Detroit. When asked whether Mr. Spiller ever told him during these meetings or any subsequent meetings that he would only be discharged for good or just cause, Dr. Rood stated: \"I don\u2019t think the subject of discharge came up.\u201d A reasonable employee could not interpret an employer\u2019s statements, such as these, which merely commend an employee\u2019s performance, as promises of job security, <em>MCI Telecommunications Corp v Warner, </em>897 F2d 703, 707 (CA 4, 1990) (applying Virginia law). Nor could a reasonable employee interpret a statement that follows a positive evaluation to the affect that your \"job is secure\u201d as an intent to enter a just-cause employment contract with that employee. As stated in <em>Warner </em>at 707, such statements</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-5\">only infer[] that [the employee] was doing a good job and that those around him could not envision a person of that merit being fired. It does not create a factual issue. over the status of his employment relationship.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Lastly, although we find in part B(2)(b) that gdls\u2019 written policies and procedures could reasonably give rise to legitimate expectation of just-cause employment, we do not find that these policies and procedures evidence a clear intention on the part of gdls to create a <em>contractual </em>just-cause employment relationship with <em>all </em>of its management employees. As stated in <em>Bankey </em>at 455-456:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-7\">It is one thing to expect that a discharge-for-cause policy will be uniformly applied while it is in effect; it is quite a different proposition to expect that such a personnel policy, having no fixed duration, will be immutable .... The very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>definition of \"policy\u201d negates a legitimate expectation of permanence. ... In other words, a \"policy\u201d is commonly understood to be a flexible framework for operational guidance, not a perpetually binding contractual obligation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">We do not mean to suggest that the provisions contained in employee handbooks can never become a part of an employment contract. <em>Toussaint, </em>of course, held otherwise. See <em>id. </em>at 613. This case is, however, distinguishable from <em>Toussaint. </em>Mr. Toussaint was given his bcbsm employee manual following a specific inquiry about the likelihood of his being discharged. This fact provided objective evidence to support an inference that the parties intended the handbook provisions, setting forth bcbsm\u2019s discharge-for-cause policy, to become a part of Mr. Toussaint\u2019s employment contract. See <em>Rowe </em>at 641. In this case, there is no evidence in the record to suggest that Dr. Rood received his handbooks in such a manner. Indeed, it appears that he received the handbooks in exactly the same way as all other gdls management employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">In such circumstances, our inquiry is not limited to the question whether the employer sufficiently manifested an intention to enter a single contractual just-cause employment relationship with the party before the Court, but, rather whether the employer has sufficiently manifested an intention to enter such a relationship with all employees subject to the relevant policies and practices.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Otherwise stated, a finding that the employee policy of discharge for cause contained in the gdls employee handbooks became a part of Dr. Rood\u2019s employment contract would necessarily constitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>a finding that it became a part of the employment contract of every manager who had been employed at gdls when the handbooks were in effect. Such a commitment should not be lightly inferred. Accordingly, we hold that where an employer establishes a policy of discharge for cause, it may become part of an employment contract only when the circumstances (e.g., the language in the handbook itself, or an employer\u2019s oral statements or conduct) clearly and unambiguously indicate that the parties so intended. In this case, there is no evidence, other than the mere promulgation and dissemination of the employee handbook that merely implies a discharge for cause policy, from which a reasonable juror could infer that gdls manifested an intention to enter a \"perpetually binding contractual obligation\u201d with <em>all </em>of its management employees. Such evidence is insufficient as a matter of law. To hold otherwise, would deter the socially desirable and commercially beneficial use of employee handbooks.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">b. \"legitimate expectations theory\u201d of</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">\n<em>TOUSSAINT</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A7y\">1. APPLICABLE LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">As noted above, the legitimate expectations theory of <em>Toussaint </em>is not based on traditional contract analysis.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The rationale for judicial enforcement of employer policies and procedures relating to employee discharge is simply the intuitive recognition that such policies and procedures tend to enhance the employment relationship and encour<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>age an \"orderly, cooperative and loyal work force\u201d <em>Toussaint </em>at 613, for the ultimate benefit of the employer.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> In short, in addition to the traditional grounds for enforcing promises, this perceived employer benefit is recognized under <em>Toussaint </em>as a sufficient, and independent, basis for enforcing promises of job security contained in employer policy statements that are disseminated either \"to the work force in general or to specific classifications of the work force, rather than to an individual employee.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> <em>Bankey </em>at 443, n 3. As stated in <em>Toussaint, </em>\"[hjaving announced the policy, presumably with a view to obtaining the benefit of improved employee attitudes and behavior and improved quality of the work force, the employer may not treat its promise as illusory.\u201d <em>Toussaint </em>at 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">The first step in analyzing a legitimate expectations claim under <em>Toussaint, </em>is to determine, <em>what, </em>if anything, the employer has promised. Promises, like contracts, may be either express or implied. See n 17. The Second Restatement of Contracts, \u00a7 2(1), defines a \u201d[p]romise\u201d as \"a manifestation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>intention to act or refrain from acting in a <em>specified way, </em>so made as to justify a promisee in understanding that a commitment has been made.\u201d (Emphasis added.) As is readily apparent, not all policy statements will rise to the level of a promise. For instance, an employer\u2019s policy to act or refrain from acting in a specified way <em>if </em>the employer chooses is not a promise at all. Also apparent in the definition of a promise is the need for specificity. The more indefinite the terms, the less likely it is that a promise has been made. And, if no promise is made, there is nothing to enforce.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Once it is determined that a promise has been made, the second step is to determine whether the promise is reasonably capable of instilling a legitimate expectation of just-cause employment in the employer\u2019s employees. In this regard, w\u00e9 note that only policies and procedures reasonably related to employee termination are capable of instilling such expectations.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">The proper disposition of these cases requires a discussion of our decisions in <em>Toussaint </em>and <em>Renny v Port Huron Hosp, </em>427 Mich 415; 398 NW2d 327 (1986). In <em>Toussaint, </em>this Court held that a reasonable juror could find that a reasonable employee could interpret the employee handbook there involved as the employer\u2019s commitment to discharge employees covered by the handbook for just cause only. The employee handbook contained an <em>express </em>statement of company policy, providing that bcbsm would \"release employees for just cause only,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 656, along with elaborate and specific disciplinary procedures leading up to and including discharge. <em>Id. </em>at 651-655. In <em>Renny, </em>this Court also found that the employee handbook was reasonably capable of instilling legitimate expectations of just-cause employment in the employer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>employees. Although the employee handbook in <em>Renny </em>did not contain an express discharge-for-cause-only policy statement as did the handbook in <em>Toussaint, </em>it did provide a specific list of disciplinary violations and the penalties for each along with an optional grievance procedure. <em>Renny </em>at 430-431. Of particular significance to this Court in <em>Renny </em>was the statement contained in the \"Management Rights\u201d section of the employee handbook, which provided that, although the employer retained the exclusive right to discharge employees, that right was <em>expressly </em>made \"subject ... to the regulations and restrictions outlined in th[e] Employee Handbook.\u201d <em>Renny </em>at 427. In neither <em>Toussaint </em>nor <em>Renny </em>did the employee handbook contain a statement expressly retaining the employer\u2019s common-law right to terminate employees at will.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The common thread running through our decisions in <em>Toussaint </em>and <em>Renny </em>is the presence of clear and specific employer policy statements, regarding employee discharge. Otherwise stated, the handbooks in both <em>Toussaint </em>and <em>Renny </em>contained statements reasonably capable of being interpreted as promises to discharge only for just cause. Consistent with <em>Toussaint </em>and <em>Renny, </em>we therefore hold that, in all claims brought under the legitimate expectations theory of <em>Toussaint, </em>the trial court should examine employer policy statements, concerning employee discharge, if any, to determine, as a threshold matter, whether such policies are reasonably capable of being interpreted as promises of just-cause employment. If the employer policies are incapable of such interpretation, then the court should dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s complaint on defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition. MCR 2.116(C)(10). If, however, the employer\u2019s policies relating to employee discharge are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>capable of two reasonable interpretations, the issue is for the jury. With these principles in mind, we now turn to the cases at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">2. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"A1t\">(A) <em>SCHIPPERS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Applying these principles, we are convinced that a reasonable juror could not find that the spx\u2019s handbook gave rise to legitimate expectations of just-cause employment. The handbook contains no mandatory provisions or specific procedures, regarding employee discharge. Although it purports to adopt \"overall policies of employment and standards of conduct which are fair to all employees,\u201d such statements are insufficient to permit a reasonable inference that spx intended to give up its right to discharge employees at will. A promise of fairness, without more, is too vague to judicially enforce.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">The probationary period for newly hired employees is likewise insufficient to overcome the presumption of employment at will. The spx probationary period has nothing to do with employee discharge but, rather merely marks the time when new employees are eligible for other company benefits, including seniority, paid holidays, and eligibility for vacation and military leave. See <em>Johnston v Panhandle Cooperative Ass'n </em>225 Neb 732, 740-741; 408 NW2d 261 (1987). Nor does the work performance section of the handbook relate to or in any way promise continued employment. Rather, this section merely informs employees that, in exchange for satisfactory work performance, spx will provide \"good working conditions, an excellent security program and pay wage rates that compare favorably with area practices for similar work.\u201d It is clear that the \"security pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>gram\u201d mentioned in the \"Work Performance\u201d section of the handbook is the \"Your Personal Security Program\u201d section that concerns employee benefits, such as health and accident insurance, family death benefits, and pension plan. Lastly, although the \"Standard Shop Rules and Regulations\u201d do provide examples of conduct that may result in discipline \"up to and including discharge,\u201d the list does not purport to be all inclusive. A nonexclusive list of common-sense rules of behavior that can lead to <em>disciplinary action or discharge, </em>clearly reserves the right of an employer to discharge an employee at will. <em>Bauer v American Freight System, Inc, </em>422 NW2d 435, 438 (SD, 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Because the policies expressed in the handbook cannot reasonably be interpreted as a promise on the part of spx to limit its right to terminate its employees at will, it is immaterial whether Mr. Schippers\u2019 accident was chargeable or nonchargeable. Spx retained the right to terminate his employment for any reason or for no reason at all. Because we find that a reasonable juror could not find that the policies contained in the spx employee handbook would instill legitimate expectations of just-cause employment, we need not reach the question whether a disclaimer of intent to create contractual liability contained in an employee handbook is sufficient to disclaim liability under the legitimate expectations theory of <em>Tous-saint.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">(B) <em>ROOD</em></p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">We cannot find that the GDLS Guide to Good Conduct, alone, is. reasonably capable of being interpreted as a promise that only \"misconduct\u201d will result in discharge. <em>Bauer </em>at 438. Nor can we find that either the annual employee evaluation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>policy,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> or the policy related to merit pay increases,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> individually, are reasonably capable of such an interpretation. But when all of the gdls policies are considered together with sp 2-415, we believe that a reasonable juror could find that the overall employee policies could reasonably instill a legitimate expectation of just-cause employment in gdls management and management support personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Sp 2-415 clearly states that its purpose is \"[t]o establish a uniform method of coordinating and effecting the layoff or involuntary termination of Management and Management Support employees.\u201d The phrase \"involuntary termination\u201d is specifically defined, as \"[discharge for <em>reasons of misconduct </em>or <em>unacceptable performance.\u201d </em>Further, sp 2-415 purports to require \"[t]he highest level review of events leading to a Management or Management Support involuntary termination . . . <em>before </em>taking action.\u201d (Emphasis added.) These statements are sufficiently clear to warrant a reasonable employee to expect that the company had elected, at least temporarily, to limit its involuntary termination discretion with respect to management and management support personnel to misconduct or unacceptable performance.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>As stated in <em>Valentine v General American Credit, Inc, </em>420 Mich 256, 258; 362 NW2d 628 (1984), \"[e]mployers and employees remain free to provide, or not to provide, for job security.\u201d Employers also remain free to establish, or not to establish, personnel policies and procedures. In <em>Toussaint </em>at 619, we noted that \"[a]n employer who establishes no personnel policies instills no reasonable expectations\u201d of just-cause employment in its employees. Nevertheless, if an employer elects to create policies and procedures that are reasonably capable of being interpreted as promises to refrain from discharging employees absent just cause, it is for the jury to determine whether such policies and procedures instilled a legitimate expectation of just-cause employment.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">There are two alternative theories of enforceability that may support a claim for wrongful discharge in Michigan: (1) contract, and (2) public policy. We find that neither plaintiff provided sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption of employment at will under the contract theory. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>do find, however, that a reasonable jury could find that gdls\u2019 written policies and procedures could have instilled a legitimate expectation of just-cause employment in plaintiff Rood.

To find such a contract, a reasonable jury must be able to conclude that a reasonable person in Mr. Schippers\u2019 position could have reasonably interpreted the statement not only as a manifestation of Hy-Lift\u2019s intention to give up its right to terminate Mr. Schippers at will, but also as a manifestation of intent to terminate his employment <em>only </em>if Hy-Lift ceased its trucking function. In other words, interpreted literally, it may appear that Hy-Lift promised Mr. Schippers that he would be the driver of the truck, regardless of continued licensure, insubordination, absenteeism, or even theft of company property. As Justice Griffin wrote in <em>Bullock v Automobile Club of Michigan, </em>432 Mich 472, 517; 444 NW2d 114 (1989) (concurring in part and dissenting in part):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-8\">Surely, a modicum of realism and common sense is needed. An assurance such as that . . . simply cannot be separated from the realities of the working world.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">Further, once the statement \"unless something was really wrong\u201d is viewed in context and properly interpreted to relate only to matters that may negatively influence either Hy-Lift\u2019s willingness or ability to continue its trucking operation, it becomes equally clear that Mr. Schippers was not offered employment subject to termination only when, and if, he reached the age of retirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b320-6\"> In this regard, we would note that Mr. Schippers does not allege to have had a contract for just-cause employment at Sealed Power. As previously mentioned, his only concern about transferring to Hy-Lift was his loss of seniority. At Sealed Power, Mr. Schippers had a certain level of comfort in knowing that if the availability of work declined, or if Sealed Power decided to reduce the number of its trucks, then there were five other drivers that would be laid off before him. Hy-Lifl\u2019s promise to retain its trucking function would, however, seem to have provided Mr. Schippers with virtually the same job security at Hy-Lift as he enjoyed at Sealed Power.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b320-7\"> Mr. Overway\u2019s deposition testimony provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-8\"><em>Q. </em>Do you feel that you can be terminated from Sealed Power for any reason?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-9\"><em>A. </em>For any reason?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-10\"><em>Q. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-11\"><em>A. </em>No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-12\"><em>Q. </em>Do you feel they have to give you a good reason?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-13\"><em>A. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-14\"><em>Q. </em>Is that the custom and practice that you have seen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-15\"><em>A. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-16\"><em>Q. </em>And how long have you been there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-17\"><em>A. </em>Since \u201961.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-18\"><em>Q. </em>Has that been the practice since \u201961?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-19\"><em>A. </em>To my knowledge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-20\"><em>Q. </em>Is that the practice in Hy-Lift Division?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-21\"><em>A. </em>Yes, it is.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b323-6\"> The second highest rating that an employee can receive, a \"p\u201d means \" 'Potential\u2019 \u201d and \"assumes the individual ... is qualified at present (or will likely be qualified in the foreseeable future) for a higher level position.

It appears on review of the records that there is a material question of fact whether a just-cause employment relationship existed between the parties.

These policies and standards spell out your responsibilities to the company and the company\u2019s responsibility and obligations to you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">The handbook also contains the following disclaimer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-10\">The contents of this manual are presented as a matter of information only. While Sealed Power believes wholeheartedly in the plans, policies and procedures described here, they are not conditions of employment. Sealed Power reserves the right to modify, revoke, suspend, terminate, or change any or all such plans, policies, or procedures, in whole or in part, at any time, with or without notice. The language used in this manual is not intended to create, nor is it to be construed a contract between Sealed Power and any one or all of its employees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">The handbook provides further that \"The company, by its actions and attitudes, will endeavor to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>maintain a spirit of good will, loyalty and harmony among all persons in the organization.\u201d Finally, the handbook establishes a sixty-day probation period and a list of shop rules and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">Schippers also presented the deposition testimony of Roy Overway, the general manager of the Hy-Lift division, that \u2014 at least since 1961 when Overway began working for the company \u2014 it was the custom and practice of the Hy-Lift division to discharge employees only for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Schippers testified on deposition to oral assurances regarding job security made to him while he was considering whether to transfer from spx\u2019s Sealed Power division to its Hy-Lift division. As noted by the majority, Schippers was concerned whether Hy-Lift \u2014 which had previously contracted its trucking operations \u2014 was committed to maintaining its own trucking operation. He made inquiries about \"job security\u201d before accepting the transfer. According to his deposition testimony, he was assured by Roy Overway, in response to these inquiries, that \"unless something was really wrong, [he] would be there for retirement.\u201d Similarly, Schippers testified that his direct supervisor, Larry Bozik told him that \"as long as they had a truck, I would be the driver.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The majority finds that \"a reasonable j\u00fcror could not find that the spx\u2019s handbook [probationary period or shop rules and regulations] gave rise to legitimate expectations of just-cause employment.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 141. At the risk of appearing unreasonable, I conclude that, reasonable minds can differ whether the provisions of the handbook, the probationary period, the shop rules and regulations, and the custom and practice of Hy-Lift to terminate only for cause, considered individually or together, create a reasonable expectation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>termination only for cause under the contract theory of <em>Toussaint </em>Summary disposition of this claim is inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The majority also disagrees with Schippers\u2019 characterization of the oral assurances made to him regarding job security with Hy-Lift. According to the majority, these statements only meant that Hy-Lift was resolved to maintain its trucking function, and, therefore, no reasonable juror could interpret these statements as promises to terminate Schippers \" 'only if something was really wrong,\u2019 i.e., for just cause.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 124. Again, I disagree. Whether these statements of assurance regarding Schippers job security created a reasonable expectation of just-cause employment under the legitimate expectation prong of <em>Toussaint </em>is a question of fact on which reasonable minds could differ. Therefore, it is properly for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">The majority finds that General Dynamics\u2019 Guide to Good Conduct, annual employee evaluation policy, merit pay increase policy, and Standard Practice 2-415, taken together, would allow ''a reasonable juror [to] find that the overall employee policies could reasonably instill a legitimate expectation of just-cause employment in gdls management and management support personnel.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 143.1 agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">In addition, however, Dr. Rood asserts that oral representations he received, coupled with gdls\u2019 policies and procedures and his favorable evaluations<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and merit pay increases, gave rise to an implied just-cause employment contract under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>contract theory of <em>Toussaint. </em>The first such assurance was given to Rood by William Persky, gdls\u2019 director of corporate health and safety, during a discussion regarding job security,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that his \"job is fine, it\u2019s secure.\u201d Similarly, Rood\u2019s immediate supervisor, Mr. Spiller, assured him that his job was secure and that he was \"a key player\u201d and \"one of the basic components of the organization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The majority concludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">A reasonable juror simply could not find that a reasonable employee in Dr. Rood\u2019s position would have interpreted the statement \"[y]our job is fine, it\u2019s secure,\u201d in context, as a promise of just-cause employment. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\">Mr. Spiller\u2019s statements to Dr. Rood that his \"job [was] secure\u201d and that he was \"a key player\u201d and \"one of the basic components of the organization\u201d are likewise insufficient to permit a reasonable juror to find that a reasonable promisee would interpret these statements as a promise of just-cause employment. <em>[Ante, </em>p 134.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">I conclude, however, that, considered with the policies and procedures of the company, which the majority finds to be sufficient to sustain a claim under the legitimate expectations prong of <em>Tous-saint, </em>the assurances given to Rood are sufficient to create a question of fact whether a just-cause employment relationship existed between Rood and General Dynamics under the contract theory prong of <em>Toussaint.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">In sum, the evidence presented by Rood and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Schippers is sufficient to create a question of material fact for the jury whether oral assurances, written company policies, and company procedures and practices gave rise to a contract of just-cause employment under either prong of <em>Toussaint. </em>It cannot properly be said that all reasonable persons would agree that no such contract was created between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals in <em>Rood </em>and affirm in <em>Schippers, </em>and remand both cases for trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b342-9\"> As noted by the majority, Dr. Rood consistently received good evaluations and his promotional potential was well rated.
