We hold that a reviewing court should accept findings supported by substantial evidence. Because the common-law substantial evidence test satisfies the minimum constitutional requirements for judicial review of administrative agency findings, we need not reach the question whether Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28 applies.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The decision of the Muskegon Civil Service Commission was supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, we remand the case to the circuit court for entry of judgment in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-4\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">The appellant, Marcia Payne, worked for the City of Muskegon in several clerical and administrative positions. In December, 1988, she transferred to the position of administrative secretary for the city\u2019s personnel director, Truman Forest, at the request of Mr. Forest.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">The personnel department records information about city employees and their status in four cross-referenced files, each having a different purpose: the employee\u2019s personnel file; a quick-reference index consisting of a 3 by 5 card for each employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>that does not contain all the information from the personnel file; the \"brown book,\u201d organizing collective personnel actions taken by date; and the \"grey book,\u201d containing special lists, such as department lists and equal opportunity lists. For example, the brown book would be consulted to respond to an inquiry regarding the number of employees who would be on vacation on a certain day, and the quick-reference index would be used to learn an employee\u2019s telephone number. In February, 1989, Forest gave Payne a document confirming that each new hiring or status change must be recorded in all four indexes.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">On Friday, June 3, 1989, Forest returned to the office to discover several things amiss: promotional announcements that should have been posted on the bulletin board were not, a number of completed employment applications remained on Payne\u2019s desk rather than being locked away to protect their confidentiality, and a number of items from the April and May Muskegon Civil Service Commission meetings had not been filed and recorded. In an effort to correct these problems, Forest wrote the plaintiff a letter of reprimand detailing the assignments she had not completed, including the specific items from the minutes of the April and May commission meetings that had not been recorded. The letter cited the plaintiff for violating Rule X, \u00a7 3(i) of the Mus-kegon Civil Service Rules, and instructed her to schedule her work so that she could record the information from the minutes within seventy-two hours of each meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">Approximately a week later, under the assumption that the plaintiff had completed the assignments detailed in the June 5 letter, Forest decided that she had passed her probation period. In an addendum to her performance evaluation, he wrote that although Payne had been \"quick to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>grasp the overall 'flow\u2019 of the operation,\u201d and thus received satisfactory marks in most categories, her performance was lacking in two areas: proofreading and filing. Regarding the latter, Forest explained that \"[p]roperly securing the records of the Civil Service department is our single most important task. The employees of the city must have confidence in our system and believe that our records are accurate and secure. You must commit yourself to doing this less-than-glamorous task in a timely and accurate manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\">Upon returning from vacation on July 10, Forest discovered several employment applications on Payne\u2019s desk. This discovery prompted him to check whether the plaintiff had completed filing the items listed in the June 5 warning letter. She had not. In addition, the plaintiff had not yet recorded many items from the June 26 meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">Payne returned from her own vacation on July 17, and told Forest that part-time employee Larry Townsend, not herself, was responsible for leaving the applications unsecured. After considering the entire situation, Forest decided to terminate the plaintiff\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">Payne appealed to the Muskegon Civil Service Commission. At the hearing, plaintiff submitted that termination was too harsh a penalty, but admitted that, as of July 17, she still had not performed some of the work she was warned about failing to complete in the June 5 letter. Specifically, plaintiff acknowledged that she had failed to enter items from April and May in the record reflecting collective personnel action by date and had not entered items from the June meeting in either that record or the employee quick reference index. The rules of the Muskegon Civil Service Commission provide that failure to perform work after being warned is a \"Group 3 Offense,\u201d which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>is grounds for immediate discharge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The commission denied the plaintiff\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">The plaintiff then petitioned the Muskegon Circuit Court for an order of superintending control. The circuit court reviewed the record of the hearing for competent, material, and substantial evidence, and ruled that there was insufficient evidence to support the plaintiff\u2019s termination. The court set aside the plaintiff\u2019s discharge and remanded the case to the commission to impose a less severe penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">The city appealed, arguing among other things that the circuit court applied the wrong standard of review. The Court of Appeals agreed and reversed in a per curiam opinion, holding that the proper standard was \"any competent evidence to support the findings made below.\u201d 193 Mich App 620, 623; 484 NW2d 759 (1992). The Court remanded the case, instructing the circuit court not to substitute its judgment for the civil service commissioners\u2019 \"[i]f there is any competent evidence on the record that the plaintiff, after a warning, failed to perform her work completely . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>We granted leave. 442 Mich 925 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"A6Xf\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">Decisions of municipal civil service commissions are reviewed through original actions for superintending control. See, e.g., <em>Beer v Frazier Civil Service </em>Comm, 127 Mich App 239, 243; 338 NW2d 197 (1983); <em>Rinaldi v Livonia, </em>69 Mich App 58, 69; 244 NW2d 609 (1976). Superintending control is available only where the party seeking the order does not have another adequate remedy. MCR 3.302(B). An appeal would be an adequate remedy, and a complaint for superintending control must be dismissed when one is available. MCR 3.302(D)(2). Because the Legislature has not provided for appeal from municipal civil service boards, <em>Robertson v </em>Detroit, 131 Mich App 594, 597; 345 NW2d 695 (1983), review is by complaint for superintending control.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">The standard for issuing an order of superintending control depends on the type of suit involved. Superintending control replaced the common-law extraordinary writs \u2014 \"the writs of certiorari and prohibition and the writ of mandamus when directed to a lower court or tribunal.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> MCR 3.302(C). See also Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 13 (\"The circuit court shall have . . . power to issue, hear and determine prerogative and remedial writs\u201d). These writs were issued in different circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>stances and according to different standards.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We agree with the plaintiff that the common-law standard of review of the factual findings of municipal civil service agencies is the substantial evidence test.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">Prior to the creation of superintending control, Michigan courts reviewed the decisions of municipal civil service boards through certiorari. See <em>Detroit Public Welfare Comm v Detroit Civil Service Comm, </em>289 Mich 101, 106-107; 286 NW 173 (1939); <em>Schubert v Dearborn Civil Service Bd, </em>311 Mich 553, 561; 19 NW2d 96 (1945); <em>O\u2019Dell v Flint Civil Service Comm, </em>328 Mich 631, 636-637; 44 NW2d 157 (1950). Certiorari was the common-law method of correcting errors of administrative agencies. See, generally, <em>Town of Reading v Attorney General, </em>362 Mass 266; 285 NE2d 429 (1972); <em>Rhodes v Woodstock, </em>132 Vt 323; 318 A2d 170 (1974); <em>Park Hosp Dist v Larimer Co Dist Court, </em>192 Colo 69; 555 P2d 984 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">The writs were issued less frequently in criminal cases than in civil cases. \"A jurisdiction may ordinarily treat the writs as flexible devices allowing review of a wide range of nonappealable orders, but sharply restrict that flexibility in the context of criminal cases.\u201d 3 LaFave &amp; Israel, Criminal Procedure, \u00a7 26.4(c), p 228. This principle is reflected in <em>In re People v Burton, </em>429 Mich 133, 139; 413 NW2d 413 (1987), and <em>Genesee Prosecutor v Genesee Circuit Judge, </em>386 Mich 672; 194 NW2d 693 (1972). The trial court in <em>Burton </em>had granted the defendant a new trial. The prosecutor sought interlocutory review by asking the Court of Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>peals to issue a writ of certiorari. This Court, in determining whether to intervene, instead applied the standard traditionally associated with mandamus:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the writ should be issued only \" 'if the inferior tribunal, upon the record made, had jurisdiction, whether or not it exceeded that jurisdiction and proceeded according to law.\u2019 \u201d 429 Mich 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\">Unification of the writs under superintending control did not change the scope of review.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Drouillard v Roseville, </em>9 Mich App 239, 243; 156 NW2d 628 (1967); <em>Scallen v State Health Comm\u2019r, </em>376 Mich 64, 71; 135 NW2d 426 (1965) (Souris, J., dissenting). Instead, the purpose , of acts that abolished these classifications was, as eloquently explained by the Court of Appeals of New York, \"to wipe out technical distinctions which had been a snare for suitors approaching the court for relief and which, at times, hampered the court in granting relief for proven grievances.\u201d <em>Newbrand v Yonkers, </em>285 NY 164, 174; 33 NE2d 75 (1941). In Michigan, the unification of these writs was likewise intended to \"eliminate frequent mistakes in the choice of remedies.\u201d <em>Lorland Civic Ass\u2019n v DiMatteo, </em>10 Mich App 129, 137; 157 NW2d 1 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">Given that the scope of review in complaints for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>superintending control was not altered by changing the name of the pleading, circuit courts should assume superintending control over a municipal civil service board in the same circumstances that the writ of certiorari traditionally would have issued \u2014 when the record of the adjudicative hearing does not contain substantial evidence to support the finding.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AEp\">Review by certiorari involved more than asking whether the lower court or tribunal clearly abused its power. The standard Michigan formulation of this principle is found in <em>Jackson v People, </em>9 Mich 111, 119 (1860). After an extensive review of common-law authority, Justice Campbell, with Justice Christiancy concurring, concluded \"that the usual office of the common law writ is to inquire into something more than jurisdiction.\u201d While the reviewing court addresses only questions of law, these questions include whether the record support the findings of the lower court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Arxm\">[I]n examining into the evidence the appellate court does so not to determine whether the probabilities preponderate one way or the other but simply to determine whether the evidence is such that it will justify the finding as a legitimate inference from the facts proved, whether that inference would or would not have been drawn by the appellate tribunal. . . . \"[A]ll the facts necessary to subject the party to the penalty imposed by the act of parliament must appear upon the information, and must be established by proof.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 120.[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b885-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>See also <em>In re Fredericks, </em>285 Mich 262, 267; 280 NW 464 (1938) (on certiorari, the court will \" 'review the evidence to ascertain only whether there was reasonable ground for the decision made\u2019 \u201d); <em>Erlandson v Genesee Co Employees\u2019 Retirement Comm, </em>337 Mich 195, 202; 59 NW2d 389 (1953); <em>State Bar Grievance Administrator v Estes, </em>390 Mich 585, 601-602; 212 NW2d 903 (1973) (Levin, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\">Review in the nature of certiorari meets the requirements for review of certain administrative agency decisions set forth in the Constitution of 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28. See <em>Estes </em>at 591-592. In <em>Estes, </em>we held that we would not substitute our judgment for that of the State Bar Grievance Board if its findings were supported by substantial evidence on the record. <em>Id. </em>at 593, 597. We have further recognized, as has the Court of Appeals, that the state and federal definitions of substantial evidence both set forth the same principle. See <em>Soto v Director, Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>73 Mich App 263, 271; 251 NW2d 292 (1977), and <em>Russo v Dep\u2019t of Licensing &amp; Regulation, </em>119 Mich App 624, 631; 326 NW2d 583 (1982), adopted by this Court in <em>Turner v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number><em>Washtenaw Co Rd Comm, </em>437 Mich 35, 37; 467 NW2d 4 (1991); see also <em>MERC v Detroit Symphony Orchestra, Inc, </em>393 Mich 116, 127; 223 NW2d 283 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">iii</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">The plaintiff argues that we should affirm the circuit court\u2019s decision because the record of the commission\u2019s hearing did not contain sufficient evidence to support her discharge. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">When reviewing the decision of an administrative agency for substantial evidence, a court should accept the agency\u2019s findings of fact if they are supported by that quantum of evidence. A court will not set aside findings merely because alternative findings also could have been supported by substantial evidence on the record. See <em>Arkansas v Oklahoma, </em>503 US \u2014, \u2014; 112 S Ct 1046; 117 L Ed 2d 239, 259 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">\"Substantial evidence\u201d has a classic definition: the amount of evidence that a reasonable mind would accept as sufficient to support a conclusion. While it consists of more than a scintilla of evidence, it may be substantially less than a preponderance. <em>Tomczik v State Tenure Comm, </em>175 Mich App 495, 499; 438 NW2d 642 (1989); <em>Detroit Symphony Orchestra </em>at 122. Although we do not reach the constitutional question, the substantial evidence standard found in Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28, does not depart from this definition, at least according to its drafters.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In <em>Detroit Symphony Or</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number><em>chestra, </em>the Court explained that review under the constitutional substantial evidence standard is not de novo review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-5\">The cross-fire of debate at the Constitutional Convention imports meaning to the \"substantial evidence\u201d standard in Michigan jurisprudence. What the drafters of the Constitution intended was a thorough judicial review of administrative decision, a review which considers the whole record \u2014 that is, both sides of the record \u2014 not just those portions of the record supporting the findings of the administrative agency. Although such a review does not attain the status of <em>de novo </em>review, it necessarily entails a degree of qualitative and quantitative evaluation of evidence considered by an agency. Such review must be undertaken with considerable sensitivity in order that the courts accord due deference to administrative expertise and not invade the province of exclusive administrative fact-finding by displacing an agency\u2019s choice between two reasonably differing views. Cognizant of these concerns, the courts must walk the tightrope of duty which requires judges to provide the prescribed meaningful review. <em>[Id. </em>at 124.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">In practice, as Professor Davis illustrates, the scope of review depends on factors other than judicial fidelity to a verbal formula. 5 Davis, Administrative Law (2d ed), \u00a7 29.3, pp 340-344. In the words of Justice Frankfurter, the substantial evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>dence requirement \"does not furnish a calculus of value by which a reviewing court can assess the evidence.\u201d <em>Universal Camera Corp v NLRB, </em>340 US 474, 488; 71 S Ct 456; 95 L Ed 456 (1951). Substantial evidence review, like standing requirements in Article III of the United States Constitution, \"cannot be defined so as to make application ... a mechanical exercise.\u201d <em>Allen v Wright, </em>468 US 737, 751; 104 S Ct 3315; 82 L Ed 2d 556 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">Attempts to clarify the standard of review by embroidering the formula with more elaborate verbalisms may be more harmful than helpful. According to Professor Davis, the formula \"alone is not harmful, but it becomes harmful when it takes the place of analysis that shows why the court reviews in a particular manner or degree . ...\u201d 5 Davis, <em>supra </em>at 340. An understanding of the reasons behind judicial review of administrative decisions is the base line for determining the scope of judicial inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">The underlying purpose of judicial review of the factual findings of administrative agencies relates to the comparative expertise of the two institutions. A court is expert at adjudication \u2014 determining disputed facts by holding hearings. A municipal civil service board, on the other hand, the administrative agency in this case, is expert at determining job requirements for a city employee. To this end, the agency may establish qualifications and rules for employee conduct on the job. These rules might be considered promises to employees that their jobs will be secure as long as they perform them acceptably, and that this security is not subject to, in Professor Nozick\u2019s words, \"[t]he [z]igzag of [pjolitics.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In that sense, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>province of a city\u2019s civil service commission, should it choose to have one at all, is to decide what qualifications and behavior the city will require of its employees and how much security it will promise them. The role of the reviewing court is to ensure that the city\u2019s employees receive what they have been promised by reviewing whether there was substantial evidence to support the agency\u2019s factual determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\">In this case, the rules of the Muskegon Civil Service Commission provide that an employee who fails to perform work after being warned may be terminated. See <em>ante, </em>p 686, n 2. The agency found<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that the plaintiff violated this rule. The circuit court should have accepted this finding because the plaintiff concedes that as of July 17 she had not performed some of the very work she was warned about failing to complete in the letter of June 5. As a result of her failure, some of the items from April and May had not yet been properly recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">The plaintiff also complains, as she has throughout this matter, that the Muskegon Civil Service Commission should have imposed a less severe penalty. She notes that her actions could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>been characterized as a Group 1 or Group 2 offense, which would not be grounds for termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">The determination of the appropriate penalty did not involve any questions of fact because the commission\u2019s rules allow it to terminate the plaintiff under the facts she conceded.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Consequently, this determination is not subject to substantial evidence review. Cf. <em>NLRB v Curtin Matheson </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number><em>Scientific, Inc, </em>494 US 775, 778, n 2; 110 S Ct 1542; 108 L Ed 2d 801 (1990) (substantial evidence review applies only to evidentiary questions); <em>Deering v Unionville-Sebewaing Area Schools, </em>97 Mich App 629, 631; 296 NW2d 131 (1980) (factual findings must be supported by substantial evidence). The only issue is the legal question whether a city may terminate an employee who failed to perform work after being warned. We hold that nothing in Michigan law requires a city to retain such an employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">The rule-making authority of municipal civil service commissions, unlike other administrative agencies, is not restricted. Most administrative agencies, for example the Teacher Tenure Commission, see MCL 38.71 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 15.1971 <em>et seq., </em>must follow the commands of the statute that created them. A city civil service commission, on the other hand, is free from statutory restrictions. In fact, a city need not have a civil service system at all. See Const 1963, art 11, \u00a7 6; MCL 117.4i(h); MSA 5.2082(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">City employees, like other employees, may be terminated at will unless distinguishing circumstances dictate otherwise. See <em>Rowe v Montgomery Ward &amp; Co, Inc, </em>437 Mich 627; 473 NW2d 268 (1991). To the extent that a civil service system presents distinguishing circumstances, employees can expect to retain their jobs as long as they follow the rules of the civil service commission.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In this case, our review for substantial evidence reveals that the commission followed its own rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">Contrary to the assertion in the dissenting opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>ion, we do not evaluate the employment policies of defendant unless they are alleged to violate the law. There has been no such allegation in this case. Hence, this Court must only determine whether sufficient factual evidence supported the defendant\u2019s charges of misconduct. While some sympathetic evidence existed to support the circuit court\u2019s resolution of the case, that court erred by substituting its judgment for that of an employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">We remand the case to the circuit court for entry of judgment in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<judges id=\"b892-8\">Cavanagh, C.J., and Brickley, J., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b877-7\"> See <em>Lissee v Secretary of State, </em>388 Mich 32, 40-41; 199 NW2d 188 (1972). The wisdom of this rule is underscored by the unique conclusion of the concurring opinion that \"[t]he failure of the Legislature to implement the program is simply unconstitutional inaction.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 717. There may be cases in which this Court has so held. However, no authority is cited for the proposition. If the Legislature exempted an agency from the coverage of art 6, \u00a728, the constitutional question would be presented. However, given that it is unnecessary to answer this question and that neither party has argued this position, to decide that this Court may require legislators to vote for bills and the governor to sign them is inconsistent with our historic sensitivity to issues of separation of power. See, e.g., <em>Shavers v Attorney General, </em>402 Mich 554, 638; 267 NW2d 72 (1978) (delaying the entry of an order for eighteen months so that the Legislature could correct constitutional defects in the no-fault act).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b880-6\"> The pertinent part of Rule X, \u00a7 3 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-7\">The following, by way of example only and not as an exclusive list, are declared to be causes for disciplinary action or removal from the classified service of the City of Muskegon.

Justice Campbell, with Justice Christiancy concurring, elaborated regarding the deferential nature of the writ:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-8\">It was held by this Court in <em>Berry v.Lowe, </em>10 Mich 9 [1862], that the Circuit Court could not reverse the judgment of [a lower tribunal on a writ of certiorari] on the evidence, unless no proof could be found in the case which, if believed, would maintain it. If there is a conflict of testimony, and still evidence has been put in which covers the whole case, so far that, if believed, it would warrant a verdict, the court above must respect the finding, whether it is, or not, such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>would have been made by the appellate court if it had power to weigh the evidence. <em>[Welch v Bagg, </em>12 Mich 41, 45 (1863).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">In other words, \"[i]f the alleged error is a total want of evidence to prove some fact necessary to sustain the judgment, the Court will look into the testimony to see whether there was such evidence or not.

Yet, this Court, relying on the intentions of the framers and ratifiers of the provision, has defined \"substantial evidence\u201d as requiring more than the review required by the writ of certiorari:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-6\">The cross-fire of debate at the Constitutional Convention imports meaning to the \"substantial evidence\u201d standard in Michigan jurisprudence. What the drafters of the Constitution intended was a thorough judicial review of administrative decision, a review which considers the whole record \u2014 that is, both sides of the record \u2014 not just those portions of the record supporting the findings of the administrative agency. Although such a review does not attain the status of <em>de novo </em>review, it necessarily entails a degree of qualitative and quantitative evaluation of evidence considered by an agency. Such review must be undertaken with considerable sensitivity in order that the courts accord due deference to administrative ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>pertise and not invade the province of exclusive administrative fact-finding by displacing an agency\u2019s choice between two reasonably differing views. Cognizant of these concerns, the courts must walk the tightrope of duty which requires judges to provide the prescribed meaningful review. <em>[MERC v Detroit Symphony Orchestra, Inc, </em>393 Mich 116, 124; 223 NW2d 283 (1974).][<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">While not an examination de novo, the substantial evidence standard involves more stringent review than the scintilla rule or any evidence standard of the writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">Nevertheless, as the lead opinion and dissent note, this Court has on occasion referred to the standard to be applied during a writ of certiorari as a \"substantial evidence\u201d standard. See, e.g., <em>Detroit Public Welfare Comm v Detroit Civil Service Comm, </em>289 Mich 101, 108; 286 NW 173 (1939); <em>Schubert v Dearborn Civil Service Bd, </em>311 Mich 553, 561; 19 NW2d 96 (1945); <em>O'Dell v Flint Civil Service Comm, </em>328 Mich 631, 636-637; 44 NW2d 157 (1950). These cases, however, in practice utilize the scintilla rule. In <em>Detroit Welfare Comm, supra </em>at 106-107, for example, the Court noted that \"[c]ertiorari is an appropriate remedy to get rid of a void judgment, one which there is no evidence to sustain.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Similarly, <em>Schubert </em>explained that \" '[o]n certiorari this court may not review questions of fact. It is not at liberty to determine disputed facts, nor to review the weight of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 561, quoting <em>Carroll v Grand </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number><em>Rapids City Comm, </em>266 Mich 123, 125; 253 NW 240 (1934) (citations omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">The lead opinion and dissent rely upon such cases to argue that the \"substantial evidence\u201d standard has been historically utilized by the writ of certiorari, but the standard, at best, was simply mislabeled \"substantial.\u201d Regardless of its labeling, the substantial evidence test formulated by art 6, \u00a728 is not satisfied by the review entailed under the traditional writ of certiorari. Indeed, on the eve of the ratification of the constitution, this Court disclaimed any weighing of the evidence in cases involving certiorari. <em>Bedwell v Employment Security Comm, </em>367 Mich 415, 421-422; 116 NW2d 920 (1962), quoting <em>Peadon v Employment Security Comm, </em>355 Mich 613, 631; 96 NW2d 281 (1959).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The substantial evidence standard envisioned by the framers and ratifiers of art 6, \u00a7 28 is more stringent than a mere cursory review for a scintilla of evidence. After all, the substantial evidence test of art 6, \u00a7 28 mandates meaningful evaluation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>of the \"qualitative and quantitative\u201d aspects of the evidence relied upon by the lower tribunal, whereas the writ of certiorari prohibits any such evaluation. To equate the two standards of review is improper because it either significantly strengthens the scrutiny under certiorari or significantly weakens the scrutiny of art 6, \u00a7 28. Hence, the ratifiers and framers of the constitution did not envision that the substantial evidence standard of art 6, \u00a7 28 would be satisfied by the review undertaken in a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">The lead opinion, however, also notes that this Court found in <em>State Bar Grievance Administrator v Estes, </em>390 Mich 585, 592; 212 NW2d 903 (1973), that \"[r]eview in the nature of certiorari meets\u201d the constitutional standard of art 6, \u00a7 28. That Court, however, not unlike the lead opinion, simply failed to examine the nature of the writ of certiorari as compared to the standard of review necessitated by art 6, \u00a7 28. See, <em>id. </em>at 601-602 (Levin, J., concurring) (noting the difference between review under art 6, \u00a7 28 and under the writ of certiorari).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">As the author of the lead opinion has previously explained, limiting the review on certiorari to \"errors of law and . : . whether 'the inferior tribunal, upon the record, made, had jurisdiction, whether or not it exceeded that jurisdiction and proceeded according to law,\u2019 \u201d is essential because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-7\">[a]n appeal and a writ of superintending control are, functionally and conceptually, different. An appeal is primarily a device for correcting legal error which occurs in the course of litigation. A writ of superintending control, on the other hand, is \"designed to correct errors so gross as to be almost foreign to the judicial system.\u201d Note, <em>Supervisory and advisory mandamus under the all writs act, </em>86 Harv L R 595, 626 (1973). The former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>primarily protects the interests of the particular litigants as the final stage of the process through which justice is achieved.

Yet, the lead opinion does just that by elevating the scrutiny under the writ to the standard of art 6, \u00a7 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">A proper construction of the Michigan Constitution reveals that art 6, \u00a7 28 is applicable in the instant case. Art 6, \u00a7 28 mandates in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-10\">All final decisions, findings, rulings and orders of any administrative officer or agency existing under the constitution or by law, which are judicial or quasi-judicial and affect private rights or licenses, shall be subject to direct review by the courts as provided by law. This review shall include, as a minimum, the determination whether such final decisions, findings, rulings and orders are authorized by law; and, in cases in which a hearing is required, whether the same are supported by competent, material and substantial evidence on the whole record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b900-11\">The purpose of constitutional construction is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>determine the intent of the ratifiers at the time of its adoption. <em>Lockwood v Comm\u2019r of Revenue, </em>357 Mich 517, 555; 98 NW2d 753 (1959). While the best source of this intent is the plain meaning of the document,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> often \"we must take into consideration the times and circumstances under which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>State Constitution was formed \u2014 the general spirit of the times and the prevailing sentiments among the people.\u201d <em>People v Harding, </em>53 Mich 481, 485; 19 NW 155 (1884). See also <em>Traverse City School Dist v Attorney General, </em>384 Mich 390, 405; 185 NW2d 9 (1971). Thus, an examination of the framers\u2019 comments during the constitutional convention is appropriate if the intentions of the ratifiers are ambiguous and the comments reveal the object of a particular provision. <em>Regents of the Univ of Michigan v Michigan, </em>395 Mich 52, 60; 235 NW2d 1 (1975). Such interpretation is necessary because \"[ejvery constitution has a history of its own which is likely to be more or less peculiar; and unless interpreted in the light of this history, is liable to be made to express purposes which were never within the minds of the people in agreeing to it. This the court must keep in mind when called upon to interpret it; for their duty is to enforce the law which the people have made, and not some other law which the words of the constitution may possibly be made to express.\u201d <em>Harding, supra </em>at 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">Defendant does not dispute that it is an administrative agency \"existing under the constitution or by law\u201d that exercises at least quasi-judicial powers that affect private rights.

Finding that no legislation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>authorized such an appeal, the Court refused to recognize an appeal as a matter of right. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Sim\u00fcarly, the Court of Appeals in <em>Eckstein, supra </em>at 245, refused to apply art 6, \u00a728 because \"no statute or court rule authorizes any form of appeal to circuit court from the decisions of municipal administrative agencies such as the\u201d Oakland County Personnel Appeal Board.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">Yet, the constitution mandates only that direct review be provided by law and the substantial evidence standard apply to such review. The Legislature has provided review through the superintending writ,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which standard of review then becomes constitutionally modified by art 6, \u00a7 28. See, e.g., <em>Martin, supra </em>at 539; <em>Justewicz, supra </em>at 559-560; <em>Choike, supra </em>at 707-708. Defendant\u2019s argument that there is no review of agency matters provided by law is simply denied by the superintending writ statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">Furthermore, even if the Legislature failed to provide any form of review, the circuit court would be forced to craft such a reviewing mechanism. The constitutional language is unambiguous: \"All final decisions ... of any . . . agency . . . <em>shall </em>be subject to direct review . . . .\u201d Art 6, \u00a7 28 (emphasis added). Similarly, the Address to the People clearly states that art 6, \u00a7 28 \"provides that decisions, findings, rulings and orders of administrative officers or agencies which affect private <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>rights be subject to judicial review.\u201d 2 Official Record, Constitutional Convention 1961, p 3389. The intention of the ratifiers and framers was clearly expressed by the mandatory language of the provision. As of the adoption of the constitution, all administrative agencies exercising quasi-judicial power became subject to judicial review.

In the opinion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>committee a constitutional provision is necessary in order to assure a judicial review of administrative agencies and appended thereto a minimal scope of review. [1 Official Record, <em>supra, </em>p 1443.][<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">Other delegates noted that administrative \"abuse\u201d occurred and that \"it has thereby become necessary to protect the people in their right of appeal and their right to be heard in another branch of the government, namely, the judicial branch, on matters affecting their person, their property or their business.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 1444 (comments of Iverson).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The purpose of the provision, therefore, was to \"grant the citizens of this state a right of review of a determination by an administrative body,\u201d <em>id., </em>p 1467, and to \"negate the possibility of conclusive findings of fact on the part of an admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>istrative agency.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 1442 (comments of Kroli-kowski).

Perhaps most telling, delegate Mahinske remarked that \"whether or not the legislature provides for [the substantial evidence standard] in the establishment of one of these bodies, we have [the standard].\u201d 1 Official Record, <em>supra, </em>p 1464.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, ensuring judicial review of the actions of administrative agencies that affect the rights of Michigan citizens was the very intent of the convention. The constitution, therefore, mandates review, but permits the Legislature to implement the details of the appellate process. \"The phrase 'as provided by law\u2019 clearly vests the Legislature with the authority to exert substantial control over the mechanics of how administrative decisions are to be appealed.\u201d <em>McAvoy, supra </em>at 443. Obviously the constitutional convention did not wish to delve into the details of appellate procedure, e.g., venue, the statute of limitations, or the number of days by which an appeal must be filed, but it clearly intended to ensure that some appellate procedure exist. Indeed, the comments of the convention and the Address to the People reveal that the purpose of the provision was to ensure that the substantial evidence standard of review applied to administrative agencies because the Legislature had failed to do so in some instances. The failure of the Legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>ture to follow the mandate of the constitution compels the judicial branch to permit judicial review, not abandon it. To now deprive the citizenry of significant judicial review because the Legislature again failed to act in light of the provision makes the constitutional mandate all but a mockery.

Justice Cooley elaborated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-6\">For as the constitution does not derive its force from the convention which framed, but from the people who ratified it, the intent to be arrived at is that of the people, and it is not to be supposed that they have looked for any dark or abstruse meaning in the words employed, but rather that they have accepted them in the sense most obvious to the common understanding, and ratified the instrument in the belief that that was the sense designed to be conveyed.

The review by this Court was not solely to determine whether there was <em>any competent evidence </em>to support the decision, but rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>was to determine whether there was <em>substantial evidence </em>to support the decision.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">Now, however, for reasons about to be stated, the constitutional standard, \"competent, material and substantial evidence on the whole record,\u201d is applicable to judicial review of a decision discharging a civil service employee following a hearing required by the rules and regulations of the civil service commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">The board contends that the constitutional standard applies only to state administrative agencies, not municipal administrative agencies. It is urged that an administrative agency does not \"exist under the constitution or by law\u201d unless the administrative agency is created by the constitution or by an act of the Legislature. I would not read the words \"existing under the constitution or by law\u201d so narrowly.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>I would hold that an agency \"exists under the constitution or by law\u201d at least where the constitution or an act of the Legislature provides for a governmental function to be discharged by the agency, and that the constitutional standard governs judicial review where there are provisions for a hearing respecting the exercise of the governmental function and for decisions, findings, rulings, or orders following the hearing that are judicial or quasi-judicial and affect private rights or licenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">In the instant case, both the constitution and an act of the Legislature authorize local units of government to provide for a merit or civil service system for their employees.

Similarly, in stating that the charter of a city may provide for a system of civil service, the Legislature indicated that the details of the system were to be spelled out in the charter or pursuant to its provisions. The framers of the constitution and the Legislature thereby indicated that local units of government were authorized to provide for the particular terms and provisions of their merit or civil service systems. An agency created and acting under rules and regulations adopted pursuant to such a delegation of authority is an agency \"existing under the constitution or by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b919-8\">The City of Muskegon, in establishing a civil service system and rules and regulations therefor pursuant to the delegation of authority set forth in the constitution and in the Home Rule Act, acted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>\"under the constitution or by law.\u201d The resulting Muskegon Board of Civil Service Commissioners is an \"agency existing under the constitution or by law\u201d within the meaning of art 6, \u00a7 28.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">The Muskegon civil service rules and regulations provide for a hearing when an employee appeals from a decision discharging the employee from employment by the city. The decision of the Mus-kegon Board of Civil Service Commissioners sustaining the disciplinary action against Payne is a quasi-judicial decision affecting her \"private\u201d rights under the Muskegon civil service system.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">The question whether an appeal by a local governmental employee from a decision of a civil service commission would be subject to judicial review in accordance with the \"competent, material and substantial evidence\u201d standard arose at the Constitutional Convention. Speaking for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>committee of the Constitutional Convention that formulated the new constitutional standard, a delegate indicated that it was contemplated that there would be judicial review of the decision of a municipal civil service commission pursuant to the new constitutional standard. Specifically, the delegate responded in the affirmative to the question whether, on appeal to a court from a decision of a local civil service commission disciplining a governmental employee, such as a policeman, there would be a \"greater test\u201d than whether \"the facts in the record clearly tend by competent evidence\u201d and \"fair probative value\u201d to support the finding of the civil service commission.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"AI_\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">I turn to a consideration of whether the decision to discharge Payne was supported by competent, material and substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b922-7\">The board\u2019s rules and regulations provide that there are three groups of offenses. Group one includes the least severe offenses, such as habitual tardiness, unexcused absences, abusive coffee breaks. Group one also includes as an offense \"[fjaulty work.\u201d An employee who commits one group-one offense may receive a warning. An employee who commits repeated group-one offenses is not subject to discharge until the fifth offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-8\">Group two concerns the next most severe offenses, such as injurious or dangerous pranks, fighting on the premises, and wilful destruction of city property. An employee who commits a single group-two offense is subject to a three-day suspension without pay. A repeated group-two offender is not subject to discharge until the third offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-9\">Group three includes the most serious transgressions, such as violations of the Civil Rights Act, knowingly falsifying records, consumption of alcoholic beverages on the job. Group three also includes the offense of failing to perform work duties completely and efficiently after receiving a warn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>ing. A person who commits a group-three offense is subject to immediate discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">The rules and regulations provide that the board may treat a group-three offense as a group-two or a group-one offense, and may treat a group-two offense as a group-one offense. The board could thus have treated Payne\u2019s failure to perform her duties as a group-one or a group-two offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b923-8\">Payne received a letter of reprimand in early June, 1989, concerning her failure to record certain information and her failure to keep secure a number of employment applications. Seven days later, she received a review with ratings ranging from acceptable to outstanding in eighteen of twenty areas of job performance.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b923-9\">Payne was discharged July 17 because she had not rectified the deficiency in recording information and had again left employment applications unsecured on her desk.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-10\">Truman Forest\u2019s belief that Payne had again left applications unsecured on her desk was mistaken. Another employee had left the applications on Payne\u2019s desk after she had left on vacation. Forest refused to provide Payne an opportunity to show that another employee had left the applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>tions on her desk. At the hearing before the board, Forest insisted that he would have discharged Payne even if he had known that she had not left the applications unsecured.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">While Payne\u2019s failure to update the department\u2019s records may have justified some disciplinary response, I agree with the circuit judge that there was not competent, material and substantial evidence on the whole record justifying dismissal. Updating the department\u2019s records was an important task, but Payne\u2019s failure was not tantamount to a group-three offense, such as violation of the Civil Rights Act, stealing city property, or drinking on the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">Payne was on vacation for the two-week period preceding her discharge on July 17. Thus, less than a month intervened between the warning in early June and the date she left on vacation. The record shows that there were a number of tasks that were given to her to perform in that approximately four-week period and that she in good faith thought that they had a higher priority.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">The lead opinion holds that the penalty assessed by the board is \"not subject to substantial evidence review,\u201d stating that \"[t]he determination of the appropriate penalty did not involve any questions of fact because the commission\u2019s rules allow it to terminate the plaintiff under the facts she conceded.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">The lead opinion\u2019s holding ignores that the constitutional standard, \"competent, material, and substantial evidence on the whole record\u201d applies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>not only to findings of fact but also to <em>\"decisions,\u201d </em>\"rulings\u201d and \"orders.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A69c\">The lead opinion adverts to cases in other jurisdictions, including federal cases, but on the central question whether the <em>decision </em>of the Board of Civil Service Commissioners, or only its findings of fact, are subject to judicial review, the Court cites no authority for its conclusion that the decision itself is not subject to judicial review.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>Contrary to the suggestion in the lead opinion, federal courts do review an agency\u2019s decision discharging an employee to determine whether the punishment was proportionate. In <em>Brown v United States Postal Service, </em>860 F2d 884 (CA 9, 1988), the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed a decision of the United States District Court affirming a decision of the Federal Employee Appeals Authority upholding the Postal Service\u2019s decision to discharge Brown. The court said that it defers to an agency\u2019s judgment \"unless the penalty is so harsh or disproportionate to the offense as to constitute an abuse of discretion,\u201d and that in \"determining whether a penalty is disproportionate to the offense,\u201d courts consider a number of factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-5\">\"We have said that we will defer to the judgment of the agency as to the appropriate penalty for employee misconduct, unless its severity appears totally unwarranted in light of such factors as the range of permissible punishment specified by statute or regulation, the disciplined party\u2019s job level and nature, his record of past performance, the connection between his job and the improper conduct charges, and the strength of the proof that the conduct occurred.\u201d <em>[Id., </em>p 888.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">The court said that although substantial evidence supported the determination that Brown had wil-fully failed to follow established postal procedures in handling postage-due transactions, and such \"misconduct was serious in light of Brown\u2019s duties at the cash drawer, our analysis of the other factors persuades us that Brown\u2019s termination was too harsh, particularly given that the usps could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>have transferred him to non-cash handling duties.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 888.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>The Ninth Circuit, paralleling the decision of the circuit judge in this case, reversed Brown\u2019s dismissal, declared that he was entitled to back pay and reinstatement of employment in some capacity in the Postal Service, and remanded the case for reconsideration of the appropriate disciplinary action.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">In three cases decided after the adoption of the 1963 Constitution, this Court, without referring to Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28, reversed <em>decisions </em>of a municipal civil service commission sustaining the discharge of employees because this Court found that the penalty of discharge was disproportionate to the offense.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">In <em>Fannon v Southfield, </em>405 Mich 558; 275 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>NW2d 256 (1979), the Southfield Civil Service Commission affirmed a <em>decision </em>to discharge Fannon for violating five of the city\u2019s civil service rules. The circuit court and the Court of Appeals affirmed. This Court reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">This Court first dismissed four of the five charges against Fannon. The Court, however, sustained the commission\u2019s finding \"of Fannon\u2019s culpability for failing to directly answer questions as to the release of\u201d a list of names. <em>Id. </em>at 561-562. The commission\u2019s rules provided that this offense was one punishable by discharge.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Nonetheless this Court held that \" '[discharge was manifestly an excessive and arbitrary discipline unjustified on this record.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>p 560.
