Grimm and his former law firm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In September of 1974, Grimm was appointed a judge of the Mus-kegon Circuit Court. Following his appointment, Grimm advised the Zatolokins that he would be unable to continue representing their interests. Attorney Forsythe and the law firm in which he was affiliated succeeded Grimm and assumed representation of the Zatolokins.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">In March of 1976, Forsythe apprised the Zatolo-kins that their claims on their earlier investments were no longer collectible. He recommended that the investments be written off as bad debts for federal income tax purposes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Subsequently, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>Zatolokins brought suit against attorneys Grimm and Forsythe and their respective law firms.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-3\">Eventually, the case against Grimm and his law firm was settled. Plaintiffs in these actions defended the lawsuit on behalf of the insured and contributed to the settlement. However, pursuant to its contract with the insured, American Home neither defended the lawsuit nor contributed to the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">Accordingly, plaintiffs brought suit seeking a proration of the defense and settlement costs among the three insurers on the basis of their respective policy limits. Judge Kolenda applying the <em>Lamb-Weston </em>rule found in favor of the plaintiff insurers and entered judgments of $120,254.25 for St. Paul, and $106,640.56 for cna.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals reversed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">The Court of Appeals applied the majority rule and reasoned that pro-rata and excess \"other insurance\u201d clauses can be reconciled by assigning primary liability to the insurers whose policies contain pro-rata clauses and excusing the insurer whose policy contains an excess clause, unless liability exceeds the pro-rata insurer\u2019s limits.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In the present case, the malpractice lawsuit was settled for less than the limits of plaintiffs\u2019 policies. Therefore, the Court of Appeals ruled that American Home had no obligation either to defend or to indemnify. We subsequently granted leave to appeal and now affirm the Court of Appeals decision. On August 20, 1993, we granted leave.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>n</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Before addressing the arguments some brief background may be instructive. Broadly defined, insurance is a contract by which one party, for a consideration, assumes particular risks of the other party.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The parties have the right to employ whatever terms they wish, and the courts will not rewrite them as long as the terms do not conflict with pertinent statutes or public policy. <em>Auto-Owners Ins Co v Churchman, </em>440 Mich 560, 566-567; 489 NW2d 431 (1992).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">Included in many of these contracts are \"other insurance\u201d clauses. These clauses originated in the area of property insurance and were designed to protect the insurer from the moral hazards of fraud and carelessness incident to the over-insurance of property.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \"Other insurance\u201d clauses are provisions inserted in insurance policies to vary or limit the insurer\u2019s liability when additional insurance coverage can be established to cover the same loss.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Insurance companies continue to include these provisions as standard clauses in liability policies even though potential fraud through over-insurance in this context is remote.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b759-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>Justice Riley, writing for a unanimous Court, recognized that \"other insurance\u201d clauses fall into three general categories. The effect of each in the event of concurrent coverage is to reduce the insurer\u2019s loss. They are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-3\">1. A pro-rata clause, which purports to limit the insurer\u2019s liability to a proportionate percentage of all insurance covering the event;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-4\">2.

In other words, they are generally intended to become effective only when other valid and collectible primary insurance is available. <em>Jones v Medox, Inc, </em>430 A2d 488, 491 (DC App, 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">American Home\u2019s \"other insurance\u201d clause reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-5\">If the insured has other insurance against a loss covered by this policy the Company shall not be liable under this policy for a greater proportion of such loss than the applicable limit of liability stated in the Declarations bears to the total applicable limit of liability of all valid and collectible insurance against such loss; <em>provided, however, with respect to acts or omissions which occur prior to the inception date of the policy, the insurance hereunder shall apply only as excess insurance over any other valid and collectible insurance and shall then apply only in the amount by which the applicable limits of liability of this policy exceeds the sum of the applicable limits of liability of all such other insurance. </em>[Emphasis added.][<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">The language emphasized above is known as an excess \"other-insurance clause.\u201d It provides that if other, collectible insurance covers the occurrence, the \"policy will provide coverage only for liability above the maximum coverage of the primary pol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>icy or policies.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In other words, it is generally the insurer\u2019s intent that the policy only afford secondary coverage when the same loss is covered by \"other insurance.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">Most professional liability policies contain an \"other insurance\u201d clause because of the frequency of overlapping periods of insurance coverage.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As in this case, the clause was inserted in \"error and omission\u201d insurance policies to address the issue of how liability under more than one applicable policy is to be apportioned, or if it is to be apportioned at all. <em>Stine v Continental Casualty Co, </em>419 Mich 89, 96-97; 349 NW2d 127 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">The case before us involves two types of errors and omissions insurance policies afforded the professional. They are \"discovery\u201d or \"claims made\u201d policies and the so-called \"occurrence\u201d policy. In <em>Stine, supra </em>at 97, we outlined the differences between \"occurrence\u201d and \"claims made\u201d insurance policies available for professionals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-8\">As a general proposition, although not in every case ... a \"discovery\u201d or \"claims made\u201d policy is one in which indemnity is provided no matter when the alleged error or omission or act of negligence occurred, provided the misdeed complained of is discovered and the claim for indemnity is made against the insurer during the policy period. Some \"claims made\u201d policies . . . are written to provide coverage only for negligent acts or omis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>sions which occur during the policy period and for which the claim is made against the insured during that period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-4\">An \"occurrence\u201d insurance policy, on the other hand, generally is one in which indemnity is provided no matter when the claim is brought for the misdeed complained of, providing it occurred during the policy period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">In the instant case, each insurer had a contractual relationship with attorney Grimm. Plaintiffs and Grimm agreed to contract for an occurrence policy,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> while American Home and Grimm opted for a claims-made policy.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Consequently, plaintiffs\u2019 occurrence policies were \"on\u201d the risk for Grimm\u2019s alleged legal malpractice because the acts or omissions occurred during those policy periods.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">On the other hand, American Home\u2019s \"other insurance\u201d provision of its \"claims made\u201d policy functions as an excess clause only, whenever the acts or omissions complained of \"occur prior to the inception date of the policy . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The excess portion of American Home\u2019s hybrid \"other insurance\u201d clause is activated in this case because it is undenied that all the acts or omissions occurred before the inception date of the American Home policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">Finally, we recognize the vital role \"other insur-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>anee\u201d clauses play in insurance policies. Moreover, these clauses are inserted deliberately and are thus the negotiated intent of the contracting parties. They afford interested parties, insurers, insureds, and claimants a way to sort out their respective rights and responsibilities under the applicable insuring agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Accordingly, we shall refrain from rewriting the contracts and instead give effect to the meaning and intent of the policy language. <em>Upjohn Co v New Hampshire Ins Co, </em>438 Mich 197; 476 NW2d 392 (1991); <em>Eghotz v Creech, </em>365 Mich 527, 530; 113 NW2d 815 (1962).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">The question presented requires this Court to determine whether a pro-rata \"other insurance\u201d clause in two malpractice policies and an excess \"other insurance\u201d clause in another can be reconciled to give effect to the intent of the contracting parties, or whether the clauses are irreconcilable and require that this Court disregard the contractual language and impose a pro-rata share of the loss upon each insurance company. Our options are: (1) the minority view that prorates the loss among all the insurers, or (2) the majority view that requires the insurer with the pro-rata clause to cover all losses up to its policy limit.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">The first option is the rule adopted by the Ore<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>gon Supreme Court in <em>Lamb-Weston v Oregon Automobile Ins Co, </em>219 Or 110, 129; 341 P2d 110 (1959).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-3\">In our opinion, whether one policy uses one clause or another, when any come in conflict with the \"other insurance\u201d clause of another insurer, regardless of the nature of the clause, they are in fact repugnant and each should be rejected in toto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">Later, in <em>Sparling v Allstate Ins Co, </em>249 Or 471; 439 P2d 616 (1968), the Oregon Supreme Court expanded upon its previous holding in <em>Lamb-Weston. </em>In <em>Sparling, </em>the court held that \"other insurance\u201d clauses conflict with one another for purposes of the rule, making them repugnant, whenever the policies containing those clauses cover the same loss and the clauses attempt to limit coverage in light of other insurance. <em>Id. </em>at 476.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Only a few jurisdictions have followed the <em>Lamb-Weston </em>rule. Nonetheless, plaintiffs contend that Michigan adheres to the minority rule, citing as support <em>Farm Bureau Mutual Ins Co v Horace Mann Ins Co, </em>131 Mich App 98; 345 NW2d 655 (1983), and <em>Mary Free Bed Hosp &amp; Rehabilitation Center v Ins Co of North America, </em>131 Mich App 105; 345 NW2d 658 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">In <em>Farm Bureau, </em>the Court of Appeals encountered a dispute between a pro-rata clause and an escape \"other insurance\u201d clause. The <em>Farm Bureau </em>panel expressly rejected the majority view. In holding that the escape clause and pro-rata clause conflicted, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-7\">The majority view attempts to resolve an intractable conflict. This is not possible. We recognize \"the absurdity of attempting to assume that where conflicting 'other insurance\u2019 provisions exist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>by reason of overlapping coverages of the same occurrence the provisions of one policy must yield to the provisions of the other.\u201d Courts which have arrived at that conclusion represent the minority view. Under that approach, the conflicting \"other insurance\u201d clauses are declared \"repugnant\u201d and are \"rejected in toto.\u201d Once the conflicting clauses are disregarded, both policies clearly provide coverage. Each insurer\u2019s liability is then prorated based on the proportion of the combined policy limits represented by the limits of each insurer\u2019s policy. We adopt the minority view. <em>[Id. </em>at 103-104. Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">The <em>Farm Bureau </em>panel also decided the case of <em>Mary Free Bed, supra. </em>In <em>Mary Free Bed, </em>the Court was confronted with two identical excess \"other insurance\u201d clauses that were activated on the same risk. The panel held that the clauses conflicted because both could not be excess to the other. The panel merely cited its holding in <em>Farm Bureau, </em>which followed <em>Lamb-Weston.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Consequently, the plaintiffs argue that their pro-rata \"other insurance\u201d clause and the excess \"other insurance\u201d clause in American Home\u2019s policy are mutually repugnant, and thus the liability must be shared jointly by the three insurers. Taking issue with the Court of Appeals conclusion that the pro-rata and excess \"other insurance\u201d clauses are not necessarily mutually repugnant or automatically in conflict, they urge this. Court to reject the majority rule and to adopt the <em>Lamb-Weston </em>rule.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Moreover, they contend that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>majority rule requires circularity of reasoning, and that the decision regarding which policy constitutes other valid and collectible insurance triggering the \"other insurance\u201d clause of the second policy will depend upon which contract is read first.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-3\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">The second option is the interpretation embraced by the majority of jurisdictions that have considered competing pro-rata and excess \"other insurance\u201d clauses.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Courts adopting the majority view have reconciled the pro-rata clause and the excess clause by interpreting the policy containing the excess clause as secondary coverage where there is another insurance policy covering the same risk. See <em>St Paul Mercury Ins Co v Pennsylvania Casualty Co, </em>642 F Supp 180 (D Wy, 1986). The result, under this view, is that the excess insurer is generally liable for the loss only to the extent that the insured\u2019s claim exceeds the policy limits of the insurance policy containing the pro-rata \"other insurance\u201d clause.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">American Home maintains that Michigan courts have adopted the majority rule. See <em>Vandermore v Michigan Millers Mutual Ins Co, </em>34 Mich App 429; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>191 NW2d 501 (1971), and <em>Werner v Travelers Indemnity Co, </em>55 Mich App 390; 222 NW2d 254 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">In <em>Vandermore, </em>the Court of Appeals affirmed a judgment against the carrier whose policy contained a no-liability provision, which judgment required that the carrier bear a loss without contribution from another carrier that had a policy in effect at the pertinent time because that policy contained an excess provision. However, the Court explicitly noted that, because of \"the equities of the two insurers,\u201d there was no need for it to attempt to generally reconcile no-liability and excess-liability clauses. <em>Id. </em>at 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">In <em>Werner, </em>the Court of Appeals spoke approvingly of the majority rule and expressly rejected the minority rule. <em>Id. </em>at 394-401. However, the Court\u2019s discussion of it was merely dictum. Consequently, the question of allocating loss among insurers while one policy has an insurance clause calling for the pro-rata sharing of the loss and the other specifies that it is only for coverage in excess of other policies despite the arguments of the parties, has not been decided by our state courts. However, the issue regarding competing pro-rata and excess \"other insurance\u201d clauses has been considered in numerous jurisdictions.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">A carefully considered opinion that addresses the comparable worthiness of the majority rule and the <em>Lamb-Weston </em>rule is <em>Jones v Medox, Inc, </em>430 A2d 488 (DC App, 1981). In order to reconcile a pro-rata and an excess \"other insurance\u201d clause, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>the <em>Jones </em>court reasoned that the policies containing a pro-rata clause are effective only when \"other valid and collectible\u201d primary insurance is available. <em>Id. </em>at 491. On the other hand, a policy containing an excess \"other insurance\u201d clause is not considered to be other valid and collectible primary insurance for the purpose of triggering the operation of the pro-rata clause. Consequently, the policy containing the excess clause becomes secondary coverage because the carrier is liable only for the loss after the primary insurer has paid up to its policy limits. <em>Id. </em>The court specifically stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-4\">\"[W]here an excess clause is inserted in a typical . . . liability insurance policy the usual intent of the insurer is that the policy will afford only secondary coverage when the loss is covered by 'other insurance.\u2019 On the other hand, a provision that limits a policy to only pro rata liability in the event of concurrent coverage usually is intended to become effective only when other valid and collectible primary insurance is available. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-5\">Stated another way, these courts assume that the standard phrase \"other valid and collectible insurance\u201d means other valid and collectible primary insurance. It follows, then, that the policy containing the pro rata clause is other valid and collectible primary insurance that triggers application of the excess clause in the second policy. The excess clause in the second policy therefore is given full effect and that carrier is liable only for the loss after the primary insurer had paid up to its policy limits. The policy containing the excess clause, however, is not considered to be other valid and collectible primary insurance for the purpose of triggering the operation of the pro rata clause, because when a stated contingency occurs, that is, when there is other valid and collectible primary insurance available to the insured, the policy con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>taining the excess clause becomes secondary coverage only.[<footnotemark>28</footnotemark>] [ <em>Id.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">The <em>Jones </em>court in addressing the <em>Lamb-Weston </em>rule stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-6\">The <em>Lamb-Weston </em>rule presents an appealingly, simple and no-nonsense way to deal with the vagaries of insurance policies. <em>A principal concern of courts adopting this rule apparently is that one insurance company is getting \"stuck\u201d and that regardless of the intent of the contracting parties as expressed in their \"other insurance\u201d clauses, two companies covering the same risk should pay equally. </em>Courts swayed by this concern, however, have failed to recognize that the insurance companies have no contractual relationship with each other, and one company hardly needs to be protected from the other. Neither insurance company is getting \"stuck\u201d for anything more than it contracted to provide for its insured. Moreover, courts applying the <em>Lamb-Weston </em>rule ignore a basic rule of contracts requiring consideration of all the language in a policy to determine its meaning and intent. By sweeping away the contractual language and, perhaps the negotiated intent of the parties, these courts effectually are legislating mandatory pro rata clauses for insurance policies having \"other insurance\u201d provisions. Courts generally should take such drastic action only when presented with clearly irreconcilable provisions. [430 A2d 492-493. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">ill</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">We are persuaded by the reasoning in <em>Jones, supra, </em>and therefore adopt the majority view for resolving disputes between pro-rata and excess <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>\"other insurance\u201d clauses.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Although the simplicity and ease of application of the <em>Lamb-Weston </em>rule is tempting, we find the cost of nullifying the negotiated intent of the parties alarming.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Accordingly, we refrain from rewriting the instant contracts and instead give effect to the meaning and intent of the policy language. <em>Upjohn Co v New Hampshire Ins Co, </em>438 Mich 197; 476 NW2d 392 (1991); <em>Eghotz, supra </em>at 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-3\">We also acknowledge that it may be necessary to declare \"other insurance\u201d clauses irreconcilable when the applicable portions of the two other insurance clauses are identical excess clauses.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> In the example presented, there is an actual problem with circularity. Moreover, the literal interpretation of policies containing competing excess clauses would leave the insured without any coverage where it first appeared he had multiple cover<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>age. In these cases, there is no rational reason to give the language of one policy preference over identical language in the other policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">However, that is not the case before us. Instead, we are confronted with a dispute involving pro-rata and excess \"other insurance\u201d clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">We do not view \"other insurance\u201d clauses as being automatically irreconcilable and choose not to adopt a rule that requires this Court to automatically override the contractual language and, perhaps, the negotiated intent of the parties.

This typically appears as an \"other insurance\u201d clause in the conditions section of the policy. As a provision in the insuring agreement, such a clause becomes a predicate to coverage. A common provision is the \"pro rata\u201d clause which specifies proration of the loss. The typical approach is based upon the ratio of the limits of liability of the company\u2019s policy to the total limits of all other valid and collectible insurance against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>such a loss. . . . There are two other common \"other insurance\u201d provisions. The \"excess\u201d clause typically limits the insurer\u2019s liability to the amount by which the insurance exceeds that provided by other valid and collectible insurance. The \"escape\u201d or \"no liability\u201d clause seeks to avoid any coverage for the loss if there is other valid and collectible insurance.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b760-10\"> Cna\u2019s \"other insurance\u201d also contained the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-11\">[W]ith respect to acts or omissions which occur prior to the policy period, the insurance hereunder shall apply only as excess insurance over any other valid and collectible insurance ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-12\">The trial court found, and cna did not dispute, that \"the circumstances which invoke it [the cna excess 'other insurance\u2019 clause] do not exist in this case.

It was also undisputed that the claim against attorney Grimm was made while American Home\u2019s claims-made policy was in effect, i.e., August 19, 1977 to August 19, 1978.

They point out that an attorney may have several professional liability insurance policies available that apply to the same act or omission claim. Consequently, overlapping coverages are likely to exist where the present policy is on a claims-made basis and there was an occurrence policy when the act or omission occurred.

Nonetheless, with the exception of <em>Farm Bureau, </em>cases from the Court of Appeals indicate that application of the minority rule in Michigan has been limited to instances where the competing policy language was truly in conflict, i.e., identical clauses that would in effect leave the insured without protection.
