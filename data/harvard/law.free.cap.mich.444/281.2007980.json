Citizens paid work loss benefits less social security disability benefits. Gail Profit, Yan-cey\u2019s guardian, commenced this action against Citizens claiming that, because Yancey did not elect to coordinate work loss benefits with other accident coverage, Citizens should not have reduced the work loss benefits by social security disability benefits paid by the federal government.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The question presented is whether social security disability benefits are to be subtracted by an automobile no-fault insurer from the amount otherwise payable for work loss where the policy of insurance specifically provides that the work loss benefit and other accident coverage are not coordinated, and thus the insured paid a higher premium than would have been payable had he been offered an opportunity and had elected to coordinate. We hold that social security disability benefits should be subtracted.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">Profit contends, and the circuit judge and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Court of Appeals agreed, that work loss benefits should not be reduced by social security disability benefits. The Court of Appeals said that while it found Citizens\u2019 \"arguments to be strong and persuasive,\u201d Citizens\u2019 position was rejected in <em>LeBlanc v State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins Co, </em>410 Mich 173; 301 NW2d 775 (1981), and <em>Tatum v Government Employees Ins Co, </em>431 Mich 663; 431 NW2d 391 (1988).

With few exceptions, no employer, no employee, can lawfully avoid paying social security taxes and participating in this social welfare program.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">The term \"other accident coverage,\u201d like the term \"other health coverage,\u201d does not\u2014now that <em>LeBlanc </em>has, to that extent, been disapproved\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>include benefits payable under such a program.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Accordingly, although Yancey purchased a policy of no-fault insurance that was not coordinated for work loss benefits, and paid a somewhat higher premium than if the policy had been so coordinated, social security disability benefits, because they are \"[bjenefits provided or required to be provided under the laws\u201d of the federal government, \"shall be subtracted\u201d from work loss benefits otherwise payable for an automobile injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">In so holding, we follow <em>O\u2019Donnell v State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins Co, </em>404 Mich 524; 273 NW2d 829 (1979), in which this Court held that social security survivors\u2019 benefits are required to be subtracted,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Thompson v Detroit Automobile Inter-Insurance Exchange, </em>418 Mich 610; 344 NW2d 764 (1984), in which this Court held that social security disability benefits paid to dependents of an injured wage earner are required to be subtracted, and <em>Mathis v Interstate Motor Freight System, </em>408 Mich 164; 289 NW2d 708 (1980), in which this Court held that workers\u2019 compensation benefits are required to be subtracted from no-fault work loss benefits otherwise payable for an automobile injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b482-7\">Cavanagh, C.J., and Griffin and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b477-12\"> MCL 500.3109(1); MSA 24.13109(1) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-13\">Benefits provided or required to be provided under the laws of any state or the federal government shall be subtracted from the personal protection insurance benefits otherwise payable for the injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-17\">Personal protection insurance benefits include benefits for medical expense and work loss (MCL 500.3107; MSA 24.13107).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b478-9\"> MCL 500.3109a; MSA 24.13109(1) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-10\">An insurer providing personal protection insurance benefits shall offer, at appropriately reduced premium rates, deductibles and exclusions reasonably related to other health and accident coverage on the insured.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b479-10\"> 187 Mich App 55, 61-62; 466 NW2d 354 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b479-11\"> See Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1980, 42 USC 1395b.

We believe that continued ad hoc resolution of these issues can only lead to further social and judicial costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The majority does not adequately define the difference between benefits required by law, therefore subject to automatic setoff under \u00a7 3109(1), and \"other health and accident coverage\u201d to be coordinated pursuant to \u00a7 3109a. Section 3109(1) provides an offset to no-fault insurers for \"[b]en-efits provided or required to be provided <em>under the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number><em>laws of any state or the federal </em>government. . . (Emphasis added.) This provision focuses on whether benefits are provided pursuant to state or federal law rather than on who pays the benefits. When no such law directs payment of benefits, benefits owed to the insured, even if paid by a governmental entity, are not to be automatically subtracted, but must be coordinated under \u00a7 3109a.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Although holding that social security disability benefit payments are to be subtracted from no-fault work loss benefits, the majority, in dicta, differentiates between benefits provided under a mandatory federal entitlement providing benefits to \"ail persons . . . paid for by taxes levied on <em>all </em>wage earners,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 287, and health and accident coverage provided as a fringe benefit of employment, whether private or governmental.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The majority converts \u00a7 3109(1) \"benefits\u201d into the \u00a7 3109a question of \"coverage\u201d by concluding that because the insured had a coordinated policy, health care coverage \"in consequence of his employment\u201d in the military forces is primary. <em>Owens v ACIA, </em>444 Mich 314, 319; 506 NW2d 850 (1993). The majority opinion does not address the question what benefits are provided or required to be provided under state or federal law, \u00a7 3109(1). Rather, in <em>Owens, </em>the opinion simply concludes that to the extent that appropriate medical services are provided by the military or Veterans Administration they are \"other health coverage\u201d under \u00a7 3109a.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Moreover, despite our previous holding that \"benefits\u201d are to be determined as a matter of law under the no-fault statute, not the insurance policy, <em>Rohlman v Hawkeye-Security Ins Co, </em>442 Mich 520; 502 NW2d 310 (1993), the majority suggests further, in <em>Owens </em>at 321, n 7, that the term \"benefits payable\u201d is the \"functional[ ] equiv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>alent\u201d of \"required to be provided\u201d in \u00a73109(1), thus borrowing its analysis in <em>Tousignant v Allstate Ins Co, </em>444 Mich 301, 312; 506 NW2d 844 (1993), that the appropriate examination determines whether the policy covered benefits \"paid, payable or required to be provided.\u201d Thus, the majority looks first to the policies in <em>Profit </em>and <em>Owens </em>to determine whether they were coordinated, instead of examining the benefits under \u00a7 3109(1) to determine whether they were provided pursuant to the law of a state or the federal government.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">The methodology is proof of the adage that in judicial opinions, the rationale, not the result, is everything. Thus, without adequate reasoning, in <em>Owens </em>the majority essentially finds that medical services provided by the United States military or the Veterans Administration is \"other health and accident coverage\u201d under \u00a7 3109a and duplicative payments are available where coverage is uncoordinated; and it suggests in <em>Profit </em>that \u00a7 3109(1) benefits are only those provided under a \"mandatory federal entitlement program . . . largely paid for by taxes levied on <em>all </em>wage earners.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Further illustrating that the rationale is more important than the result, the majority in part iii of the <em>Owens </em>opinion also repudiates the <em>Jarosa</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>test by turning the distinction between benefits and other health or accident coverage into issues of functional equivalence. See <em>Owens </em>at 321-323. Thus, where the issues are essentially the same, and a choice is made to coordinate, \u00a7 3109(1) need not be considered. The corollary is that when the issues are the same, and the insured has purchased uncoordinated protection pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>\u00a7 3109a, the no-fault insurer must replicate benefits despite the Legislature\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Finally, the majority also invites future distinction under \u00a7 3109a between those who are insurers of health care and those who are insurers <em>and </em>providers, suggesting that insurers who are providers may not fall within the phrase \"health care coverage.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Interpreting \u00a7 3109a and the policy to cover benefits \"paid, payable or required to be provided,\u201d the majority concludes that services provided are \"benefits\u201d required to be provided to the insured. Thus, the majority transfers \"benefits\u201d and \"required to be provided\u201d from \u00a7 3109(1) to \u00a7 3109a, suggesting that service in kind is not a \"benefit\u201d under \u00a7 3109. Services are not \"benefits\u201d under \u00a7 3109(1) even if required by law to be provided, and services may not be \"coverage\u201d under \u00a7 3109a if privately provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">We agree with the result in both <em>Tousignant </em>and <em>Pro\u00f1t, </em>and disagree with the result in <em>Owens. </em>However, our concern is that the rationale of the opinions will perpetuate litigation regarding the scope of no-fault coverage, the conditions under which coordination might be appropriate, and the extent to which \u00a7 3109(1) has any continued viability. This could be avoided by properly distinguishing between \u00a7 3109(1) and \u00a7 3109a.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">II. <em>PROFIT v CITIZENS INSURANCE</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">The goal of the no-fault insurance system was to provide victims of motor vehicle accidents assured, adequate, and prompt reparation for certain economic losses. By making no-fault insurance cover<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>age mandatory, MCL 500.3101; MSA 24.13101, the Legislature ensured that victims of automobile accidents would be recompensed for injuries sustained in motor vehicle accidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">However, because the system was mandatory, it was imperative to contain costs so that vehicle owners or registrants could afford to purchase insurance policies.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore, the Legislature mandated subtraction of \"[bjenefits provided or required to be provided under the laws of any state or the federal government . . . from the personal protection insurance benefits otherwise payable for the injury.\u201d MCL 500.3109(1); MSA 24.13109(1). The insurer remains primarily liable for the personal protection benefits, but it may reduce the extent of its liability where the laws of any state or the federal government mandate that a benefit be provided as a result of the injury.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">As originally enacted, the act did not contain a mechanism by which those who were already covered under a health and accident insurance policy could coordinate coverage with no-fault personal protection insurance. State or federal law does not currently mandate that \"other health and accident coverage\u201d be purchased by or for anyone.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Legislature did, however, recognize that in many instances owners and registrants of motor vehicles in Michigan were also covered by other health and accident insurance._</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>[A]uto insurance premiums have not been reduced as some persons had anticipated. Many believe the average driver is overbuying in regards to accident and medical insurance since no-fault coverage overlaps with portions of the medical coverage offered by the private accident and health insurers and the group plans of Blue Cross and Blue Shield. Some persons claim Michigan residents should not be required to pay for this duplicate coverage and that automobile insurers should offer deductions and exclusions at reduced premiums to those who pay for similar coverage under other health and accident plans. Further, many contend this elimination of duplicate coverage by the no-fault insurers would result in a substantial savings to Michigan drivers. [House Legislative Analysis, HB 5724, February 27, 1974.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Two years after the advent of mandatory no-fault, the Legislature amended the no-fault act to provide that \"[a]n insurer providing personal protection insurance benefits shall offer, at appropriately reduced premium rates, deductibles and exclusions reasonably related to other health and accident coverage on the insured.\u201d MCL 500.3109a; MSA 24.13109(1). Under \u00a7 3109a, an insured may opt to coordinate insurance coverage, making the health and accident insurer primarily liable for medical coverage in the event of an automobile accident. This is in direct contrast to mandatory subtraction of benefits received or to be received from another source pursuant to state or federal law from the insurer\u2019s liability for those benefits. Because coverage is coordinated, the no-fault insurer is simply not liable for any medical expense benefit payments until the benefits under the \"other health or accident coverage\u201d have been exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">It is undisputed that savings on basic no-fault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>insurance premiums was a goal of the original no-fault act and was to be accomplished through the mandatory setoff of duplicative benefits provided by government pursuant to state or federal law under \u00a7 3109(1). In enacting \u00a7 3109a, the Legislature anticipated that further savings would be effected on an individual basis. Duplicative insurance coverage would be avoided at the option of the insured, and insurance premiums would be reduced to reflect this choice. Moreover, \u00a7 3109a allows consumers who require more insurance the flexibility to arrange for it by opting not to coordinate coverage and paying the higher premium.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Therefore, contrary to the rationale advanced by the majority, separate purposes are served by \u00a7\u00a7 3109(1) and 3109a. We erred when we held that the Legislature intended to include benefits required to be provided by law under the umbrella of other health and accident coverage, and that error, compounded by today\u2019s majority, further undermines the purpose of \u00a7 3109(1), cost containment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Under \u00a7 3109(1) the court must first determine whether other benefits available to the insured were provided or required to be provided pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>to state or federal law. If state or federal law mandates provision, the benefits</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-4\">must be deducted from no-fault benefits under \u00a7 3109(1) if they:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">1) Serve the same purpose as the no-fault benefits, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">2) Are provided or are required to be provided as a result of the same accident. <em>[Jarosz v DAIIE, </em>418 Mich 565, 577; 345 NW2d 563 (1984).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">It is undisputed that federal law mandates that social security disability benefits be \"provided.\u201d See 42 USC 423. It is also undisputed that plaintiff has been receiving social security disability benefits. Furthermore, the benefits serve the same purpose as no-fault work loss benefits and are provided as a result of the same accident. See <em>Thompson v DAIIE, </em>418 Mich 610, 625; 344 NW2d 764 (1984) (Ryan, J., concurring) (\"[T]he no-fault work loss benefits and the social security disability payments are both intended to relieve [the disabled person] and his family of the economic hardship which would result from his inability because of his injuries to earn wages to support himself and his family\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">Thus, we agree that pursuant to \u00a7 3109(1) the insurer must subtract social security disability benefits received by plaintiff from the work loss benefits otherwise payable, <em>not </em>because social security is a mandatory entitlement program paid for by \"taxes levied on all wage earners,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 287, but because the benefit is provided pursuant to federal law and meets the <em>Jarosz </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">III. <em>OWENS v ACIA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">Under \u00a7 3109(1), the acia is liable for plaintiff\u2019s medical benefits but may reduce its liability to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>extent that, in this instance, federal law requires that the medical benefit be provided by another source. It is undisputed that federal law requires that veterans are entitled to treatment at a Veterans Administration facility. 38 USC 1710.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The medical care provided by the Veterans Administration serves the same purpose as the no-fault medical benefit \u2014 treatment of injury received in an automobile accident. In addition, va medical care was received as a result of the same accident for which no-fault medical benefits are sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Therefore, if treatment was directly available at a va facility, the acia may subtract the value of that treatment from the medical benefits it would otherwise be liable to pay to Owens, <em>not </em>because the medical care was \"health care coverage,\u201d <em>Owens </em>at 321-322, but because it is a benefit provided pursuant to federal law and meets the <em>Jarosz </em>test.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">If medical care is not available at a va facility, federal law allows the va to contract for medical care in a private facility. 38 USC 1703.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, because contract care is at the discretion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Secretary of Veteran Affairs, we would hold that it is not \"required to be provided\u201d within the meaning of \u00a73109(1). Contract care need not be subtracted from medical expense benefits otherwise payable unless the secretary has exercised discretion and authorized the care, and the insured has opted not to be treated at the authorized contract facility. Under these circumstances, the no-fault insured\u2019s efforts to obtain the benefit become relevant. At a minimum, the insured must ask the government to exercise its discretion and award the benefit. If the secretary then decides not to contract for private medical care, the benefit is not \"required to be provided\u201d within the meaning of \u00a73109(1), and the no-fault insurer\u2019s liability for the medical expense benefit may not be reduced.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Finally, because we agree that social security disability benefits are benefits that must be subtracted from the insurer\u2019s no-fault work loss benefits otherwise payable in <em>Pro\u00f1t, </em>we agree that they must also be subtracted from the acia\u2019s liability here.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">We would also hold that the Veterans Administration disability benefits must be subtracted from work loss benefits the acia would otherwise pay. Veterans Administration disability benefits are provided pursuant to federal law. See 38 USC 1131. They are payable to a veteran who was disabled and discharged from service \"[fjor disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in [the] line of duty, or for aggravation of a preexisting injury suffered or disease contracted in [the] line of duty, in the active military . . . .\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Furthermore, the va disabil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>ity benefits in this case were payable as a result of the same accident for which the no-fault work loss benefits are payable.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">IV. <em>TOUSIGNANT v ALLSTATE</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The majority also introduces the notion that the insured must make \"reasonable efforts to obtain\u201d payment or treatment from the health care provider before turning to the no-fault insurer for payment of medical expenses. <em>Post </em>at 311-312, citing <em>Perez v State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins Co, </em>418 Mich 634; 344 NW2d 773 (1984). We would hold that where an insured has opted to coordinate coverage pursuant to \u00a7 3109a, the insured has contractually agreed first to seek benefits under the insured\u2019s preexisting health and accident coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">References to the \"reasonable efforts\u201d of the insured to obtain payment are, in this context, irrelevant, and will only increase uncertainty and add to litigation. Tousignant agreed to coordinate coverage pursuant to \u00a7 3109a. The no-fault policy expressly provides that if the insured coordinated coverage, then Allstate would</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-8\">\u201cnot be liable to the extent that any elements of loss covered under Personal Protection Insurance allowable expenses benefits are paid, payable or required to be provided to . . . the named insured . . . under the provisions of any valid and collectible</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-9\">\"(a) individual, blanket or group accident disability or hospitalization insurance,_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aqg-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>\"(b) medical or surgical reimbursement plan . . . <em>[Id. </em>at 304, n 5.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Thus, under the clear language of the policy, Allstate is simply not liable for medical expense benefits that should have been paid for or provided by another source. The policy does not require that the insured make reasonable efforts to obtain the benefit from the other source. Allstate\u2019s liability for medical expense benefits is premised on their unavailability from other sources. If medical expense benefits were available to the insured under any other health care plan, Allstate need not pay for them; if they were not, Allstate must pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">In sum, the majority opinions constitute another step in a process that undermines the legislative purpose of \u00a7 3109(1). By examining the insurance policy rather than the benefit at issue, restrictively defining benefit under \u00a7 3109(1), and treating the phrases as functional equivalents of each other, the majority opinions convert \"benefits\u201d that state or federal law mandates be provided, into \"other health and accident coverage.\u201d Section 3109(1) allows no-fault insurers to subtract from benefits otherwise owed, those benefits provided or required to be provided pursuant to state or federal law. The focus of this provision is not on who pays the benefits. Rather, the focus is on whether the benefits are provided pursuant to law. Only benefits not provided pursuant to \"the laws of any state or the federal government\u201d are subject to coordination under \u00a7 3109a.</p>\n<judges id=\"b494-8\">Brickley and Riley, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b483-8\"> We would disavow the rationale of <em>LeBlanc, </em>and would prospectively overrule <em>Tatum.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b483-9\"> The shift occurs despite our holding in <em>Federal Kemper Ins Co, Inc v Health Ins Administration, Inc, </em>424 Mich 537; 383 NW2d 590 (1986), that when an insured opts to coordinate health care coverage with no-fault coverage, pursuant to MCL 500.3109a; MSA 24.13109(1), the health care insurer or provider is primarily liable for the payment of medical care benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b485-6\"> <em>Jarosz v DAIIE, </em>418 Mich 565; 345 NW2d 563 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b486-8\"> It should also be noted that as in <em>Owens, </em>Justice Levin suggests in <em>Tousignant </em>at 308-309, that there is a distinction between an insurer and a health care provider, suggesting there is a distinction for purposes of \u00a7 3109a between the provision of services and the payment of bills.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b487-7\"> <em>O\u2019Donnell v State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins Co, </em>404 Mich 524, 547-548; 273 NW2d 829 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b487-8\"> The mandatory subtraction of benefits \"provided or required to be provided\u201d pursuant to state or federal law allows insurers to anticipate the risk being secured.
