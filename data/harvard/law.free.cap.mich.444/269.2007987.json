He had a prior conviction record, which included larceny in a building, attempted larceny in a building, and malicious destruction of property over one hundred dollars. He did not, however, have a prior drug-related conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>Primer was charged with delivery of less than fifty grams of cocaine, and with being an habitual fourth offender.

The Court of Appeals affirmed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Hegwood was charged with delivery of less than fifty grams of cocaine and as an habitual fourth offender. He tendered pleas of guilty of delivery of less than fifty grams of cocaine and to being an habitual second offender. The prosecutor agreed to recommend a sentence of no more than ten to thirty years on conviction as an habitual offender. Hegwood was sentenced to serve nine to thirty years. The Court of Appeals affirmed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">Primer and Hegwood contend that they cannot be sentenced under the habitual offender provisions because of the specific statement added in 1978 that a person convicted of a major controlled substance offense <em>\"shall </em>be punished\u201d as provided in the Public Health Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">Section 13 of chapter 10 of the Code of Criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>Procedure provides that if a person is convicted as an habitual offender under \u00a7 10, 11, or 12, the court may sentence the offender to the punishment prescribed in \u00a7 10,11, or 12, and shall vacate the previous sentence, deducting from the new sentence all time actually served on the vacated sentence if required.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In providing that a person convicted of a major controlled substance offense shall be punished as provided in the Public Health Code, the Legislature may have been concerned that a judge reluctant to impose a mandatory sentence provided in the Public Health Code might utilize the habitual offender provisions to eliminate the mandatory sentence on the basis that \u00a7 13 provides that the sentence imposed for the underlying offense \u2014 the mandatory sentence\u2014 shall be vacated and a new sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">There is no mandatory minimum sentence, even for a fourth offender, under the habitual offender sentencing provisions. Accordingly, after sentencing a person under the habitual offender provisions to a term less than the mandatory sentence provided for in the Public Health Code, a judge\u2014 but for the proviso stating that where the conviction is for a major controlled substance, the person \"shall be punished\u201d as provided in the Public Health Code \u2014 could vacate the sentence imposed under the Public Health Code and substitute a term of years less than the mandatory sentence provided in the Public Health Code. The legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>purpose may thus have been to obviate such manipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">We do not read \"shall be punished as provided\u201d in the Public Health Code in this context as meaning that a greater sentence could not be imposed under the habitual offender provisions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The minimum sentences were well within the one- to twenty-year range provided for in the Public Health Code.

This case presents a question concerning the scope of the habitual offender sections of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The circuit court and the Court of Appeals permitted the prosecution of the defendants as habitual offenders, but the clear language of the statute compels a contrary result. Accordingly, I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>would vacate the defendants\u2019 convictions and enhanced sentences as habitual offenders, and remand to the circuit court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Within the Code of Criminal Procedure<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> are the habitual offender sections.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Their purpose is to provide augmented punishment for habitual criminals.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">In addition to the general provisions regarding habitual offenders, several sections of the Penal Code<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provide either that a repeat offender receive enhanced punishment or that such a person be guilty of a higher offense.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In addition, the Public Health Code<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> states that persons previously convicted of controlled substance offenses, who later are convicted of a second or subsequent controlled substance violation, are to be given enhanced punishment.

In general, such combination is not an improper form of double enhancement. For example, in <em>People v Bewersdorf, </em>438 Mich 55; 475 NW2d 231 (1991), this Court held that the general habitual offender provisions could be applied to persons who were convicted of operating a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor, third offense.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This outcome was reached even though ouiL-3d is a felony only because the ouil statute elevates a third offense from a misdemeanor to a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">With regard to the issue before us today, the key <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>language is in paragraph (l)(c) of the habitual offender provisions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That paragraph states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-4\">If the subsequent felony is a major controlled substance offense,[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] the person shall be punished as provided by part 74 of the public health code, Act No. 368 of the Public Acts of 1978, being sections 333.7401 to 333.7415 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">This passage was noted in <em>Bewersdorf, </em>where we contrasted it with the Legislature\u2019s treatment of ouiL-3d offenders:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-6\">Our conclusion that the Legislature intended that the habitual offender act applied to ouil felonies, even though the underlying felony is itself an ouil offense, is supported by 1978 PA 77, which amended the habitual offender statute to exempt from its application certain major controlled substance offenses controlled by other provisions of law. See <em>People v Elmore, </em>94 Mich App 304, 306, n 1; 288 NW2d 416 (1979), and <em>People v Staples, </em>100 Mich App 19, 23; 299 NW2d 1 (1980).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-7\">Obviously, the Legislature has demonstrated that when it intends to do so, it is capable of excluding a particular category of felonies from the sentence enhancement provisions of the habitual offender act. That the Legislature has not seen fit to write in a similar exception for ouil convictions, although it has had numerous opportunities to do so, provides reinforcement, we believe, for our finding that the Legislature intended the habitual offender statute to apply to ouil felonies. <em>[.Bewersdorf, </em>438 Mich 71-72][<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>In the past, the Court of Appeals has reached divided outcomes with regard to this issue.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> However, as we explained in <em>Bewersdorf, </em>the language of paragraph (l)(c) of the habitual offender sections is clear. In such an instance, our obligation is simply to apply the law as enacted by the Legislature. As we have stated on many occasions, a court may not substitute a judicial construction or interpretation for a clear and unambiguous statute. <em>Lorencz v Ford Motor Co, </em>439 Mich 370, 376; 483 NW2d 844 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Though defendant Primer has three prior offenses, he is not subject to enhanced punishment. The habitual offender section is inapplicable because he has been convicted of a major controlled substance offense. And there is no enhanced punishment in part 74 of the Public Health Code, because this is only the defendant\u2019s first conviction for a controlled substance offense. Similarly, defendant Hegwood is not subject to an enhanced pun-ishm\u00e9nt under either the habitual offender statute or the Public Health Code. While the outcomes may seem incongruous, it is required by the clear and unambiguous statutory language chosen by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">For the foregoing reasons, I would vacate the defendants\u2019 convictions as habitual offenders and remand to the circuit court for resentencing.</p>\n<judges id=\"b474-6\">Brickley and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Cavanagh, C.J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b470-8\"> MCL 760.1 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 28.841 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b470-9\"> MCL 769.10 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 28.1082 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b470-10\"> <em>People v Bewersdorf, </em>438 Mich 55, 67; 475 NW2d 231 (1991); <em>Wayne Co Prosecutor v Recorder\u2019s Court Judge, 406 </em>Mich 374, 389-390; 280 NW2d 793 (1979), reh den 406 Mich 1127 (1979), app dis sub nom <em>Brintley v Michigan, </em>444 US 948 (1979); <em>People v Hendrick, </em>398 Mich 410, 416-417; 247 NW2d 840 (1976); <em>People v Shotwell, </em>352 Mich 42, 46; 88 NW2d 313 (1958), cert den 356 US 976 (1958).
