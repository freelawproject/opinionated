Therefore, we affirm in part and reverse in part the Court of Appeals decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">On April 28, 1987, Harold Shapiro announced his resignation as President of the University of Michigan, effective January 3, 1988. In May of 1987, the Board of Regents, consisting of eight members, appointed itself as the Presidential Selection Committee and began the process of choosing a new university president. The committee appointed Regent Paul W. Brown as chairman and formed three advisory committees to assist it: a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>student committee, a faculty committee, and an alumni committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">By the fall of 1987, the Presidential Selection Committee had compiled an informal list of 250 potential candidates to replace President Shapiro. No formal applications were submitted by the candidates themselves. Rather, most of the candidates were recommended by third parties, who advised the committee of the candidates\u2019 qualifications. The committee\u2019s administrative secretary compiled a notebook of information relating to each candidate, and the board members reviewed these materials to evaluate the various individuals. To reduce the field of candidates, the committee made a series of \"cuts,\u201d narrowing the list from 250 to one.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The first cut reduced the number of candidates from 250 to 70. The Presidential Selection Committee entrusted Regent Brown with sole authority to make the first cut, and he did so after numerous telephone calls and meetings with the advisory committees and informal subquorum groups of regents.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The acknowledged purpose of the telephone calls and the subquorum meetings was to achieve the same intercommunication that could have been achieved in a full board meeting.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> During this process, the board avoided quorum meetings because it would have been required to conduct a public meeting under the oma. In fact, Regent Roach told an Ann Arbor News reporter on November 15, 1987, that if it had not been for the oma and the desire not to discuss these matters in public,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-6\">we would [have been] able to sit down with all the regents present, discuss the problems and talk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>about all the candidates at a much earlier point. [Instead], it [took] three or four hours to go around the horn on the telephones and find out what everybody is thinking.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">After gaining thorough input from all the regents, Brown\u2019s first decision was largely an arithmetic function rather than a matter of judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> How-ever, any regent could review Brown\u2019s list of seventy candidates and request the retention of a particular candidate, despite his decision to eliminate the candidate from consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The second phase of cuts employed essentially the same procedure as the first. During this phase, the Presidential Selection Committee narrowed the candidate list from seventy to thirty. Again, Regent Brown telephoned individual regents, and all regents participated in the reduction process. Subquorum-sized groups of regents met to discuss the candidates and to reach a consensus regarding the desired individuals. One regent testified that candidates were rated, the ratings were tallied and circulated, and Brown discussed the results priovately with each regent to insure that the list of thirty would be acceptable to the entire committee.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">The candidates themselves made the third cut. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>Brown called the thirty remaining candidates and asked if they would be interested in the position. At this point, more than half the candidates removed themselves from consideration, but twelve candidates expressed their desire to remain on the list.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">In March and April of 1988, groups of two, three, or four regents conducted private interviews in the candidates\u2019 home cities. Although the Presidential Selection Committee referred to these meetings as \"visits,\u201d at least one regent conceded that, like any interview, these meetings were to assess and possibly recruit candidates.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Before these interviews, candidates informed the regents that they desired their candidacy to remain confidential by signing a form letter that the board had prepared in advance. Subsequently, the candidates and the groups of visiting regents met to discuss the position and the candidates\u2019 interests and qualifications. After these meetings, some regents submitted written reports of their impressions of the candidates to the other regents, while others telephoned Brown with their impressions.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">The fourth cut followed a number of closed meetings held by the board to discuss the remaining twelve candidates, those \"most seriously considered\u201d by the Presidential Selection Committee.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The board believed that it could now justifiably convene in closed sessions because of the candidates\u2019 request for confidentiality. Following these closed sessions, Brown reduced the list of candidates from twelve to five. Although the regents contended that no voting occurred at these closed meetings, they agreed that they reached a general consensus and that Brown\u2019s list of five candidates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>reflected the views of the entire Presidential Selection Committee.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">On May 20, 1988, the board resolved to form a \"nominating committee\u201d to decide which candidates would be placed in nomination for action by the board. On May 24, 1988, before the nominating committee met, seven of the regents held a closed meeting to discuss the results of the interviews and to reveal their opinions regarding each of the remaining candidates. The board insisted that no voting took place at this time. It conceded, however, that, on the basis of a consensus, two of the candidates were preferred over the other three.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Immediately following this closed meeting, the nominating committee met, considered the entire candidate list, and decided that only two preferred candidates would remain. This was the fifth cut. After this decision and various informal discussions between committee members and the two remaining candidates, the nominating committee unanimously decided to recommend one candidate, Dr. James Duderstadt, to the board.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Dr. Duder-stadt was interviewed in an open session by the regents and by selected student, faculty, and alumni representatives. Following this open inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>view, the nominating committee met in a closed session, and recommended the nomination of Dr. Duderstadt. The board subsequently reconvened in a public session and voted to elect Dr. Duderstadt president of the University of Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Booth Newspapers, Inc., doing business as the Ann Arbor News, and the Detroit Free Press, Inc., brought an action in Washtenaw Circuit Court, alleging that the Board of Regents had violated the Open Meetings Act and the Freedom of Information Act. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and in-junctive relief against the procedures employed by the Presidential Selection Committee. Plaintiff sought to have the court compel the board to make available the information regarding persons considered for the presidency, the discussions among the regents of the respective qualifications of each individual, and the decisions of certain nonquorum committees as they narrowed the candidates. It also sought disclosure under the foia of the destinations to which individual regents traveled for the purpose of interviewing candidates.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">The trial court denied all requested relief and granted defendant summary disposition. The Court of Appeals reversed in part and affirmed in part, finding that defendant had violated the oma, but not the foia. 192 Mich App 574; 481 NW2d 778 (1992). Further, the panel enjoined defendant from further use of the procedure that had been utilized in selecting the university president and awarded plaintiff attorney fees and costs to be determined by the trial court on remand. Defendant filed an application for leave to appeal and plaintiffs filed an application for leave to appeal as cross-appellant. This Court granted both applications. 441 Mich 881 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"At7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">A. OPEN MEETINGS ACT</p>\n<p id=\"A_L\">1. THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Courts are bound to discover and to apply the Legislature\u2019s intent, when interpreting statutory mandates. <em>In re Certified Question, </em>433 Mich 710, 722; 449 NW2d 660 (1989). The legislative intent questioned in the instant case concerns the degree of accessibility the Legislature intended to afford the general public in observing the decision-making processes of public bodies.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">During the late 1960s, Michigan\u2019s Constitution and a patchwork of statutes required accountability and openness in government.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In 1968, the Legislature directly addressed this issue by enacting an open meetings statute applicable to most public bodies. 1968 PA 261. The statute required only that public entities conduct final votes on certain subjects at meetings open to the public. Consequently, all other decisions and deliberations by public bodies could lawfully be held in closed sessions. Most importantly, because the 1968 statute failed to impose an enforcement mechanism and penalties to deter noncompliance, nothing prevented the wholesale evasion of the act\u2019s provisions. See 1970 CL 15.251-15.253. In 1973, the Michigan Senate established the Special Senate Study Committee on Political Ethics to study a variety of topics, including the 1968 statute. See Senate Resolution No. 7, 1973 Journal of the Senate 36-37. The committee concluded that revisions to the open meetings law were necessary. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>\"The fact that only the meetings, or parts of meetings, at which votes are actually taken are considered public effectively insulates members of these bodies from public pressure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-6\">\"Since final decisions of a public body are the only items that must be made public, nothing in Michigan law prevents members of any public body, even including school boards, from discussing a proposal, adjourning to an executive session where members can agree privately on the action to be taken and then reconvene the 'public\u2019 meeting for the one or two minutes required to formally vote on their privately-arranged agreement. Actually, under existing law it is really not necessary for a public body in Michigan to go through even this semblance of openness if it doesn\u2019t want to.\u201d [Osmon, <em>Sunshine or shadows: One state\u2019s decision, </em>1977 Det Col L R 613, 620, n 54, quoting Preliminary Final Report 10-11 (August, 1973).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">To rectify the ineffectiveness of the 1968 statute, legislators introduced bills to comprehensively revise and substantially improve the law. The current Open Meetings Act resulted from these legislative efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">2. THE OMA\u2019S PURPOSE</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">Yet another fundamental rule of statutory construction is to examine a statute\u2019s purpose as evidenced by the Legislature. <em>In re Certified Question, supra </em>at 722. In the instant case, the oma\u2019s legislative purposes were to remedy the ineffectiveness of the 1968 statute and to promote a new era in governmental accountability. Legislators hailed the act as \"a major step forward in opening the political process to public scrutiny.\u201d 1976 Journal of the House 2242 (June 24, 1976, remarks of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Representative Wolpe).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> During this period, lawmakers perceived openness in government as a means of promoting responsible decision making. Moreover, it also provided a way to educate the general public about policy decisions and issues. It fostered belief in the efficacy of the system. Legal commentators noted that \"[o]pen government is believed to serve as both a light and disinfectant in exposing potential abuse and misuse of power. The deliberation of public policy in the public forum is an important check and balance on self-government.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The prodisclosure nature of the oma prompted one of its sponsors to describe the law, prior to enactment, as \"a strong bill now which provides very limited closed meetings\u201d and \"very tight, limited exceptions . . . .\u201d See 1976 Journal of the House 2242 (June 24, 1976, remarks of Representative Hollister). To further the oma\u2019s legislative purposes, the Court of Appeals has historically interpreted the statute broadly, while strictly construing its exemptions and imposing on public bodies the burden of proving that an exemption exists.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"AtJ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>3. THE OMA\u2019S PLAIN MEANING</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">A thorough examination of the legislative intent and purpose places a statute in its historical context and aids a court in interpreting the statute\u2019s text. When courts interpret this or any other statute, they must look to the plain meaning of the particular law in question. <em>Owendale-Gagetown School Dist v State Bd of Ed, </em>413 Mich 1; 317 NW2d 529 (1982). In the instant case, the legislative reforms during the 1970s resulted in an oma with broad inclusive language that required a public meeting for \"all decisions of a public body\u201d and \"[a]ll deliberations of a public body constituting a quorum of its members . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AnL\">The gist of our analysis is whether, on the basis of the oma\u2019s plain meaning, the Presidential Selection Committee (a) constituted a public body that (b) made closed-session decisions and deliberations, and (c) conducted closed-session interviews in violation of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">(A) PUBLIC BODIES</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">The oma defines a \"public body\u201d to include a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>\"committee, subcommittee, authority, or council, which is empowered by state constitution, statute, charter, ordinance, resolution, or rule to exercise governmental or proprietary authority . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Consequently, a key determination of the oma\u2019s applicability is whether the body in question exercises governmental or proprietary authority. <em>Goode v Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>143 Mich App 756, 759; 373 NW2d 210 (1985). In this case, it is beyond question that the University of Michigan Board of Regents is a public body charged by law and financed by Michigan taxpayers to govern an institute of higher education.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The selection of a university president is one of the board\u2019s most important exercises of governmental authority. If it establishes any form of subcommittee and empowers that subcommittee by \"resolution or rule\u201d to exercise this particular governmental authority, then that subcommittee is also a \"public body\u201d within the meaning of the act.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The board, however, argues that Regent Brown\u2019s actions do not constitute that of a subcommittee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>and, therefore, his activities as chair of the Presidential Selection Committee fall outside the oma\u2019s reach. We do not find this argument persuasive. Essentially, the board argues form over substance. The Legislature did not grant any exception to specific types or forms of committees. Therefore, delegating the task of choosing a public university president to a one-man committee, such as Regent Brown, would warrant the finding that this one-man task force was in fact a public body. As the <em>Goode </em>Court observed, \"[w]e do not find the question of whether a multi-member panel or a single person presides to be dispositive. Such a distinction carries with it the potential for undermining the Open Meetings Act . . ; <em>Id., </em>143 Mich App 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Therefore, we hold that the selection of a public university president constitutes the exercise of governmental authority, regardless of whether such authority was exercised by Regent Brown, the nominating committee, the full board, or even subcommittees. Accordingly, this individual or these entities must be deemed \"public bodies\u201d within the scope of the oma. Having established the \"public\u201d nature of these bodies, we must now examine the precise actions taken by them and their disposition under the oma.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">(b) DECISIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">Section 2(d) of the oma provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-9\">\"Decision\u201d means a determination, action, vote, or disposition upon a motion, proposal, recommendation, resolution, order, ordinance, bill, or measure on which a vote by members of a public body is required and by which a public body effectuates or formulates public policy. [MCL 15.262(d); MSA 4.1800(12)(d).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>The board insists that the process of reducing the candidate list resulted from recommendations by subquorum groups of regents, the nominating committee of board members, or by Regent Brown acting alone after consultation with individual regents. It maintains that none of these actions constituted formal \"decisions\u201d that bound the board because the possibility existed that the board might reconsider their candidate evaluations and reexamine a previously rejected candidate. On each occasion, the board claims that they merely reached a consensus regarding the action that they would take or the candidates that they preferred. In short, the board insists that their actions, in reducing the list of viable candidates, were not subject to the oma because it did not take action by a \"vote\u201d as required under the act\u2019s definition of \"decision.\u201d It maintains that the only decision that required a public meeting was held on June 10, 1988, when the board actually voted to elect Dr. Duderstadt.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The board bases its argument on the misconception that every term within the definition of \"decision\u201d is modified by the last two phrases (\"on which a vote ... is required <em>and </em>by which a public body effectuates . . . policy\u201d) (emphasis added). In other words, the board erroneously concludes that a determination or an action, for example, will only constitute a \"decision\u201d under the oma if that activity is one \"on which a vote ... is required and by which a public body effectuates . . . policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">This interpretation is substantially flawed, however, when one considers the third activity included within the definition \u2014 a vote. Under the board\u2019s construction, the definition of \"decision\u201d would include a matter \"on which a vote ... is required and by which a public body effectuates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>. . . policy.\u201d Defendant\u2019s disjointed and strained reading of the statute is nonsensical. It is a general rule of statutory construction that courts must construe statutes to avoid rendering words in the statute mere surplusage or nonsense. <em>Stowers v Wolodzko, </em>386 Mich 119, 133; 191 NW2d 355 (1971). A reasonable construction of the definition interprets the last phrase (\"by which a public body effectuates ... policy\u201d) as modifying the whole definition. The preceding phrase (\"on which a vote ... is required\u201d) modifies only those clauses that follow the term \"disposition.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AOrU\">The board also contends that open meetings are only required when \"formal\u201d voting occurs. The defendant has once again misconstrued the statute. As currently worded, the oma\u2019s plain meaning clearly applies to \"all decisions\u201d by public bodies. The act does not modify the word \"vote\u201d by the term \"formal.\u201d If this provision were now read into the current oma, it would resurrect the amended 1968 statute, which has been discredited by the Legislature. The board cannot read into the statute what the Legislature has seen fit to exclude.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Regardless of how the Presidential Selection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>Committee wishes to categorize its actions, the fact remains that the board adopted a procedure that violated the oma. The oma does not contain a \"voting requirement\u201d or any form of \"formal voting requirement.\u201d Consequently, arguments that the Presidential Selection Committee\u2019s actions were a consensus building process, rather than a mere vote or \"formal\u201d vote, are irrelevant. Furthermore, any alleged distinction between the committee\u2019s consensus building and a determination or action, as advanced in the oma\u2019s definition of \"decision,\u201d is a distinction without a difference. Even members of the committee acknowledged that its \"round-the-horn\u201d decisions and conferences achieved the same effect as if the entire board had met publicly, received candidate ballots, and \"formally\u201d cast their votes.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Moreover, testimony of various regents even raises the question whether the board did in fact vote through the use of tallies and a rating system.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The only part of the decision-making process that occurred in public was the final step: Dr. Duderstadt\u2019s selection from a list of one. The Presidential Selection Committee did not make the decision to appoint Dr. Duderstadt publicly, it merely announced the decision publicly. Dr. Du-derstadt\u2019s elevation to the position of university president was a fait accompli by the commencement of the public meeting held on June 10, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">In sum, the board\u2019s actions must be considered closed session decisions under the oma. Any other interpretation of its actions would contradict the act\u2019s letter and spirit. This Court\u2019s failure to recognize this fact would undermine the legislative intent to promote responsible and open government.</p>\n<p id=\"Ab3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>(C) DELIBERATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Although \u00a7 3(3) of the oma requires a public body to hold all deliberations at an open meeting, \u00a7 8(f) does permit closed session deliberations \"[t]o review the specific contents of an application for employment or appointment to a public office if the candidate requests that the application remain confidential.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The oma further provides, however, that \"all interviews by a public body for employment or appointment to a public office shall be held in an open meeting pursuant to this act.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">The board maintains that this \"application exception\u201d permitted it to withhold the candidates\u2019 identities and to justify closure of discussions comparing the candidates\u2019 qualifications for the purpose of reducing the list of viable individuals. The board\u2019s deliberation, however, far exceeded the exemption\u2019s scope. The oma exception permitting closed sessions to review the \"specific contents\u201d of an application would entail discussions about the applicant\u2019s qualifications on the basis of information contained in the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">In the instant case, the Court of Appeals construed the \"specific contents\u201d exemption narrowly and held that the oma permitted closed sessions only to review personal matters contained in a candidate\u2019s application. We agree. Considering the oma\u2019s prodisclosure nature, the requirement to strictly construe exemptions and the mandate for open candidate interviews, it is reasonable to assume that the Legislature intended this exemption to be a limited compromise, allowing privacy rights to dictate in instances where boards were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>not engaged in decision-making activities.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Here we agree with the panel that the board went beyond this limitation and made reduction decisions under the guise of this exemption. Clearly, however, the oma requires that \"all decisions of a public body\u201d be made in public. Consequently, the act mandates that the Presidential Selection Committee make any reduction decisions in public.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">With regard to the interviews, or \"visits\u201d as termed by the board, there is no statutory exception permitting a subcommittee to conduct closed interviews. On the contrary, the Legislature expressly mandated open interviews. In doing so, the Legislature must have recognized that candidates\u2019 identities would become public, and that it was in the greater public interest to know the qualifications of candidates for public positions and the hiring procedures of public officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Therefore, we hold that the Board of Regents is a public body that made closed session deliberations and decisions and held private interviews in violation of the oma.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">B. FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">The Freedom of Information Act, MCL 15.231 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 4.1801(1) <em>et seq., </em>protects a citizen\u2019s right to examine and to participate in the political process. It requires public disclosure of information regarding the formal acts of public officials and employees. This Court has stated that the act mandates \"[a] policy of full disclosure . . . .\u201d <em>Swickard v Wayne Co Medical Examiner, </em>438 Mich 536, 543; 475 NW2d 304 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">However, the foia provisions requiring disclosure are not absolute. The act outlines several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>instances in which public records may be exempt from disclosure. MCL 15.243; MSA 4.1801(13). These exemptions must be narrowly construed. See <em>Swickard, supra </em>at 544; <em>Evening News Ass\u2019n v Troy, </em>417 Mich 481, 503; 339 NW2d 421 (1983). In addition, the burden of proving the need for an exemption rests on the public body asserting its application. <em>Swickard </em>at 544; see <em>Nowack v Auditor General, </em>243 Mich 200, 203-204, 208-209; 219 NW 749 (1928); <em>Booth Newspapers, Inc v Mus-kegon Probate Judge, </em>15 Mich App 203, 205; 166 NW2d 546 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">When interpreting the various foia provisions, we must again follow the statute\u2019s plain meaning. <em>Owendale-Gagetown School Dist, supra. </em>In the instant case, the Presidential Selection Committee asserts that the travel expense records of regents who met with various presidential candidates should be privileged under \u00a7 13(l)(a) of the foia. This exemption allows a public body to conceal public records containing \"[information of a personal nature where the public disclosure of the information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of an individual\u2019s privacy.\u201d MCL 15.243(l)(a); MSA 4.1801(13)(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">As evident from the statute, under a plain-meaning analysis of \u00a7 (13)(l)(a), two factors must exist to exempt information from public exposure. First, the information sought must be of a \"personal nature,\u201d and, second, the disclosure of such information must constitute a \"clearly unwarranted\u201d invasion of privacy. <em>Swickard, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\"><em>1. </em>PERSONAL NATURE</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">In determining whether the information withheld is of a \"personal nature,\u201d \"the customs, mores, or ordinary views of the community\u201d must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>taken into account. <em>Swickard, supra </em>at 547. The Court of Appeals failed to consider this \"personal nature\u201d test as a separate inquiry as mandated by <em>Swickard. </em>Had it done so, it would have been compelled to determine that the information being sought by plaintiff was not \"personal\u201d in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">There exists no custom, mores, or ordinary view of the community that would warrant a finding that the travel expense records of a public body constitute records of a personal nature. The board, however, asserts that the travel expense reports of the regents might lead to information concerning the candidates that is in fact personal (i.e., the actual names of those individuals considered in the presidential search). We find that the foia \"personal nature\u201d exemption does not prohibit the disclosure of information that could <em>conceivably </em>lead to the revelation of personal information. As the United States Supreme Court stated, when examining a disclosure exemption in the federal Freedom of Information Act similar to \u00a7 13(l)(a), the exception is \"directed at threats to privacy interests more palpable them mere possibilities.\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of Air Force v Rose, </em>425 US 352, 380, n 19; 96 S Ct 1592; 48 L Ed 2d 11 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">If the board\u2019s arguments are upheld, they could lead to undesired consequences and precedents. Its arguments welcome abuse of this prodisclosure legislation by misconstruing the statutory exemptions. In short, the standard advanced by the board permits a party to assert a myriad of scenarios under which the disclosure of one particular type of information might lead someone to discover other material deemed \"personal.\u201d By expanding the exemption to protect information that may or may not lead to the exposure of personal material, the board ignored the requirement that courts must construe foia exceptions narrowly.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Therefore, under our analysis, we hold that the foia\u2019s \u00a7 (13)(l)(a) exemption does not apply in the instant case because the travel expense records fail to survive scrutiny under the first prong of the two-part test required by this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">C. CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">The board contends that application of the oma to governing boards of public universities in the manner prescribed by the Court of Appeals violates the autonomy vested in such bodies by the Michigan Constitution. Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 5. For the reasons discussed below, we reject that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">1. FAILURE TO PRESERVE CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">The board first raised its constitutional claim in its appeal to this Court; the issue was neither presented to nor evaluated either by the trial court or the Court of Appeals. Issues raised for the first time on appeal are not ordinarily subject to review.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In addition, there exists a general presumption by this Court that we will not reach constitutional issues that are not necessary to resolve a case. <em>Taylor v Michigan, </em>360 Mich 146, 154; 103 NW2d 769 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>On the basis of the arguments articulated above, we refuse to consider the board\u2019s constitutional argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">On the basis of an examination of the Open Meetings Act and the Freedom of Information Act, we rule that both acts were violated. Presidential searches at the state\u2019s public universities must be conducted with due regard to the oma\u2019s requirement of open meetings for all public body deliberations, decisions, and interviews. Travel expense records connected with these searches are not exempt from an foia request.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Therefore, we remand this case to the circuit court for entry of a judgment providing injunctive relief and compelling disclosure in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b429-8\">Cavanagh, C.J., and Levin and Brickley, JJ., concurred with Mallett, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AW2\"> Five regents constituted a quorum of the Board of Regents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b410-9\"> Deposition of Regent Power, pp 52-53.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b411-8\"> See Ann Arbor News, November 15, 1987, \"Privacy complicates U-M search\u201d (quoting Regent Roach).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b411-9\"> Deposition of Regent Power, p 13.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b411-10\"> In testimony regarding this first and second cut, there were conflicting statements taken from various regents concerning whether formal \"rating sheets\u201d were circulated and used by the Presidential Selection Committee to vote on a particular candidacy.

As noted by the majority, the ultimate goal of the Legislature in enacting the oma was to educate the general public regarding government decision making, while at the same time creating a responsible and competent public body. The success of the act is reflected in its high rate of support and compliance among a majority of public bodies at both the state and local level.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Before concluding, however, that every endeavor of a public body in the context of hiring must be conducted in full view of the public under the auspices of the oma and the foia, it is essential to examine the purpose and boundaries of those acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">The Open Meetings Act requires that all meetings, decisions, and quorum deliberations of a public body take place at a forum open to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>public.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> I agree with the Court that, in this case, the President Selection Committee was a \"public body\u201d as defined by the act because it was empowered to select the university\u2019s new president.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Board of Regents appointed \"itself \u201d the President Selection Committee. The committee was, in reality, the Board of Regents and thus could not deliberate and recommend to itself, the board, a list of final candidates for public interview without violating the oma provision requiring that all \"decisions\u201d of a quorum of a public body be conducted at a public meeting. In my judgment, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>ever, despite the intent to read the oma broadly, and with limited exceptions, 1976 Journal of the House 2242; <em>Wexford Co Prosecutor v Pranger, </em>83 Mich App 197, 201; 268 NW2d 344 (1978), the Legislature did not intend that the act apply to every venture undertaken by a public body in the context of hiring.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The compiling of a list of names, reviewing qualifications, and identifying a limited number of persons for interviews to further assess their capability and interest in the position, are tasks that are ministerial in nature and not \"public business\u201d within the purview of the oma. Screening from the original inventory of 250 names, a list of thirty potential candidates who were more qualified than the others was not a public body meeting, deliberation, or decision effectuating public policy. Whether performed by administrative staff, a third party, or the Board of Regents itself, does not change the technical and qualitative nature of the task. At no time during this initial screening process was there any \"decision\u201d by any person or public body to eliminate or remove any person from the list of 250 potential candidates. Rather, the assignment involved the gathering and sorting of submitted names to locate those persons who might be best qualified for the position of president of the university.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Tapering the list from the thirty most qualified \"potential\u201d candidates to twelve \"actual\u201d candidates was executed by the candidates themselves and not through any action of a public body or official. These twelve candidates expressed an interest in the position and, when asked, requested that their preliminary candidacy remain confidential. Although no \"applications\u201d per se were submitted, a logical inference follows that when the potential candidates affirmed an interest in pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>ing the position, they became \"applicants\u201d within the meaning of the oma. Pursuant to MCL 15.268(f); MSA 4.1800(18)(f), authorizing closed meetings by the full public body to deliberate and review applications for appointment when the applicant requests confidentiality, the board met in a private session to evaluate the twelve candidates\u2019 curricula vitae. Hence, no violation of the oma by the President Selection Committee or the board occurred at this stage of the selection process.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Although \u00a7 8(f) enables a public body to meet in closed session to review the specific contents of an employment application, the second sentence of the same provision provides that all interviews by a public body for employment shall be held in an open meeting.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The tension between the sentences is apparent when a public body, authorized to review and discuss a candidate\u2019s application at a closed meeting, is unable to render any \"decision\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> concerning the candidate without violating the open meeting requirement that all \"decisions\u201d of the public body be made in an open forum. In an attempt to reconcile this conflict, it has been sug<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>gested that the public body create a committee composed of outside members or a subquorum of public officials, and charge the group with recommending a final list of candidates who are most qualified and suited for the position. As a nonpublic body without authority to exercise a government function, it has been contended that the committee would be free to meet in private and to conduct confidential interviews with some or all of the candidates to facilitate the development of its recommendation of final candidates to the full public body. See Wernet, <em>A guide to the hiring process for public bodies under Michigan\u2019s Open Meetings Act, </em>63 Mich B J 1040 (1984); OAG, 1977-1978, No 5183, pp 21, 40 (March 8, 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">The President Selection Committee was not a committee empowered solely with authority to advise or make a recommendation to the full board because, as indicated above, the committee was \"itself\u201d the board. The committee therefore could not accomplish in subquorum groups what it was prohibited by the oma from performing as a quorum public body. At the juncture in the process when the board conducted subquorum private interviews, deliberations, and decisions concerning the twelve applicants for employment, it violated the mandates of the oma.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The board does not deny, and it is unclear from the record, whether a quorum of the regents as President Selection Committee members may have interviewed any single applicant, albeit at different times. Nevertheless, even absent a quorum of regents interviewing any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>one candidate, the board violated the oma\u2019s public interview requirement. The Attorney General has determined that the Open Meetings Act</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-5\">is violated when a committee comprised of [a] quorum of the public body, or subcommittees of a public body, which constructively constitute a quorum of the public body, collectively deliberate on or render decisions on public policy in a closed session on matters which do not fall within the provisions of the Open Meetings Act, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 8, allowing a closed meeting. The fact that these committees are physically separated while they deliberate on public business does not insulate them from the requirements of the Open Meetings Act, <em>supra. </em>[OAG, 1979-1980, No 5788, pp 1015, 1017 (September 23, 1980).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Thus,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-7\">[w]hile a committee or subcommittee of a public body which constitutes less than [a] quorum of the public body, and is purely advisory in nature, is not subject to the Open Meetings Act, <em>supra, </em>a public body which divides itself into subcommittees of less than quorum to collectively deliberate towards the resolution of public business, is in fact, acting as a \"public body.\u201d A public body may not avoid violating the Act by clothing itself as a sham advisory committee or subcommittee of less than a quorum. <em>[Id. </em>at 1016.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">Similar to the Attorney General opinions concerning the division of a public body into subquorum committees, the Court of Appeals in <em>Booth Newspapers, Inc v Wyoming City Council, </em>168 Mich App 459, 472; 425 NW2d 695 (1988), upheld the trial court\u2019s finding that the city council violated the oma when it divided into subquorum groups to deliberate matters of public policy it normally would have been required to discuss at an open <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>meeting. The Court found that a \"constructive quorum\u201d actually existed, and, thus, its deliberations and actual decisions were subject to the act. The act would also be violated if a public body simply labeled a meeting a \"conference\u201d and refrained from engaging in any actual deliberations or discussion in an attempt to utilize the conference exemption contained in \u00a73(10).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> OAG, 1981-1982, No 6074, pp 662, 664 (June 11, 1982); OAG, 1979-1980, No 5433, p 29 (January 31,1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">In this case, there was no express finding of fact by the trial court that the regents\u2019 subquorum interviews and discussions were designed to circumvent the oma\u2019s requirements. Conversely, several regents, including Regent Brown, testified that the interviews and subsequent feedback discussions were conducted in this format to comply with the act\u2019s subquorum mandates.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Whether viewed as \"avoiding\u201d the act or \"complying\u201d with the act, is, in this factual presentation, a distinction without a difference. The overall purpose of the interviews and follow-up discussions were to narrow the list of candidates for final consideration.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Unable to make an advisory recommendation to itself because its membership included the entire public body, the President Selection Committee, as a public body, was required by the oma to conduct open interviews and decisions. The recommendation by Regent Brown, as chair of the committee, to further interview five candidates in private with participation from the three advisory groups and, finally, to interview two candidates in public was, in reality, the general consensus and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>view of the entire board after discussing the candidates in several closed meetings and phone conversations with all the regents.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Such decision making violated the act by not taking place in a public forum.

However, while I agree with the conclusion that the process selected by the Board of Regents in this case ultimately violated the mandates of the oma, the identity of candidates recommended by a true advisory committee need not be disclosed until a final list of candidates is recommended to the full public body.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The majority opinion rests on the explicit premise that the prodisclosure purpose of the act requires broad application of the oma to all phases of the public hiring process.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This approach overlooks the fact that, as enacted, the oma is actually less comprehensive than the act originally proposed. The initial draft of the act would have included within the definition of a public body \"any . . . state or local government entity to make recommendations concerning the exercise of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>governmental authority.\u201d SB 920, \u00a7 2(a). The applicability of the act to such recommending entities was stricken by the first amendment of the bill. See 1975 Journal of the Senate 2400. The Attorney General subsequently concluded that the oma</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-4\">does not apply to committees and subcommittees of public bodies which are merely advisory or only capable of making \"recommendations concerning the exercise of governmental authority.\u201d These bodies are not legally capable of rendering a \"final decision.\u201d In other words, a subcommittee which can only make recommendations to the public body for final decision is not required to hold its committee meetings in public hearings. . . . [W]here such [a] subcommittee contains the entire body of the \"public body\u201d which it serves, it would be a violation of the Act to allow such subcommittees to meet in closed session. [OAG, 1977-1978, No 5183, <em>supra, </em>p 40. See also OAG, 1979-1980, No 5505, pp 221-222 (July 3, 1979).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Having specifically considered and rejected the idea that \"recommendations\u201d by a committee or subcommittee of a public body concerning the exercise of government authority be included in the act\u2019s definition of a \"public body,\u201d it can safely be concluded that the Legislature intended to exempt such entities from the oma\u2019s public forum requirements. The public body could create such an advisory committee to maintain the confidentiality of preliminary candidates and to recommend a pool of finalists for its consideration. Although the oma imposes no literal restrictions or reporting requirements on advisory committees, to effectuate the purpose of the oma, the committee should provide with its recommendation reasons for its recommendation and the procedures and methods used in reaching it. OAG, 1979-1980, No 5788, <em>supra, </em>pp 1017-1018. As always, the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>body would be free to reject, accept, or modify the committee\u2019s nonbinding recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">I also disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the oma requires that a public body disclose the identity of a candidate yet allows it to meet in a closed session to review \"personal matters contained in a candidate\u2019s application.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 230.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> To read the oma in this manner is nonsensical. First, it is a violation of an applicant\u2019s civil rights under the Civil Rights Act for an employer to consider a prospective employee\u2019s \"religion, race, color, national origin, age, sex, height, weight, or marital status\u201d with respect to employment. MCL 37.2202(l)(a); MSA 3.548(202)(l)(a). Additionally, an employer is prohibited from soliciting such information on the employment application. MCL 37.2206; MSA 3.548(206). Thus, it is incomprehensible to read the oma as permitting the regents to conduct a closed meeting to consider personal information that it can neither obtain on an employment application nor consider in making its decision, absent a violation of the candidate\u2019s civil rights. Second, the position of president of a major public university customarily attracts well-qualified, prominent, and distinguished persons. The information submitted and reviewed generally includes the candidate\u2019s curriculum vitae, rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>than an employment \"application\u201d per se filled out by a hopeful applicant. It is only logical to assume that the Legislature understood that in hiring situations for high level positions, the most sensitive information, and that most in need of being defined as confidential, is the candidate\u2019s identity. The Legislature\u2019s highly sophisticated experience in such matters must be deemed to have contemplated that once the identity of a candidate who is generally well-known and respected within a given community is made public, the candidate\u2019s biographical resume is often an open book and easily obtainable. Given that the result of such disclosure is to serve notice upon the candidate\u2019s current employer that the person is contemplating other employment and to discourage the best candidates from pursuing an interest in the position, it strains credulity to believe that the Legislature intended a result so inconsistent with public interest and the hiring needs of public bodies.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">For the above reasons, the oma should be construed to grant a public body the power to refuse to disclose the identity of a preliminary candidate when confidentiality is requested and to permit the review and deliberation of the candidate\u2019s qualifications to occur in a closed meeting. If recommended as a finalist for the position, the candidate should be afforded the opportunity to withdraw before a formal public recommendation to the hiring body. Any candidate who consents to further consideration by the full public body must be deemed to have waived the right to privacy, yielding to the public\u2019s right to know the qualifications of the candidate and satisfying the act\u2019s requirement that where the public body reserves to itself the final decision for appointment to certain levels of employment, without exception, those interviews must be conducted in public. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>OAG, 1977-1978, <em>supra, </em>pp 38-39; Wernet, <em>supra, </em>p 1042.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The balancing of the public\u2019s interest in the qualities of candidates and in the process by which they are chosen, against the interest of the university in attracting the finest candidate for the position is best achieved by reading the act in the manner suggested.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">The Freedom of Information Act, MCL 15.231 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 4.1801(1) <em>et seq., </em>provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-8\">It is the public policy of this state that all persons are entitled to full and complete information regarding the affairs of government and the official acts of those who represent them as public officials and public employees, consistent with this act. The people shall be informed so that they may fully participate in the democratic process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">The act promotes a policy of full disclosure, <em>Swick-ard v Wayne Co Medical Examiner, </em>438 Mich 536, 543; 475 NW2d 304 (1991). However, the foia is not absolute and affords an exception from disclosure of \"Conformation of a personal nature where the public disclosure of the information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of an individual\u2019s privacy.\u201d MCL 15.243(l)(a); MSA 4.1801(13)(l)(a). I agree with the majority that the exemptions must be narrowly construed and that the public body bears the burden of proving the need for the exemption. <em>Ante </em>at 232. However, I cannot agree with the determination that the information sought by the plaintiff newspaper was not of a personal nature and thus not exempt from disclosure in this situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">The plaintiffs requested copies of all travel ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>pense vouchers submitted for reimbursement for travel expenses by the regents or other personnel for presidential interview expenses. The university complied and forwarded copies of its records concerning the dates of travel, the name of the regent traveling, the hub-city destination,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and the total amount and breakdown of expenses for each trip. Citing \u00a7 13(l)(a), the final destinations were redacted from the travel expense forms in an effort to protect the confidentiality of the candidates\u2019 identities.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">As noted by Justice Cavanagh in the lead opinion in <em>State Employees Ass\u2019n v Dep\u2019t of Management &amp; Budget, </em>428 Mich 104, 123; 404 NW2d 606 (1987), and quoted with approval by Justice Riley in <em>Swickard, supra </em>at 546:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">The Legislature made no attempt to define the right of privacy [in \u00a7 13(l)(a)]. We are left to apply the principles of privacy developed under the common law and our constitution. The contours and limits are thus to be determined by the court, as the trier of fact, on a case-by-case basis in the tradition of the common law. Such an approach permits, and indeed requires, scrutiny of the particular facts of each case, to identify those in which ordinarily impersonal information takes on \"an intensely personal character\u201d justifying nondisclosure under the privacy exemption.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Although the release of a person\u2019s name, without more, is generally not considered an invasion of privacy, Justice Ryan in <em>Kestenbaum v Michigan State Univ, </em>414 Mich 510, 547; 327 NW2d 783 (1982), observed that such a predicament may exist and left \"for another day the question whether, in certain unusual circumstances, ordinarily impersonal information might take on an intensely per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>sonal character.\u201d This case presents such a situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The Court of Appeals upheld the trial court\u2019s finding that \"disclosure of the regents\u2019 travel destinations would, with little further investigation, reveal the candidates\u2019 identities, thereby constituting a clearly unwarranted invasion of their privacy.\u201d 192 Mich App 574, 586; 481 NW2d 778 (1992). I agree. As previously recognized by this Court in <em>Kestenbaum, State Employees Ass\u2019n, </em>and <em>Swickard, </em>the foia does not require blanket application without regard to the factual context.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Each of the twelve candidates, comprised of presidents of other universities and persons holding equally responsible positions, requested that their preliminary consideration as president of the University of Michigan remain confidential. The trial court found that disclosure of the regents\u2019 final travel destination was tantamount to revealing the identity of the specific candidate under consideration. Divulging information that easily led to the identity of the prospective employee was equivalent to releasing information that was \"personal, intimate, or embarrassing\u201d to the applicant, <em>Swickard </em>at 547. The fear of reprisal from a current employer or trepidation that \"public knowledge of nonselection would stigmatize them as having been weighed and found wanting and thereby blight their future careers as educational administrators,\u201d 192 Mich App 587, was exactly the type of unwarranted invasion of privacy causing injury that the candidates sought to avoid. Thus, revealing information that would easily lead to the candidate\u2019s identity as an applicant for the position constituted a clearly unwarranted invasion of promised privacy. See <em>Core v United States Postal Service, </em>730 F2d 946 (CA 4, 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">The majority\u2019s fear that to rule otherwise in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>case could lead to \"undesired consequences and precedents\u201d fostering a \"myriad of scenarios under which the disclosure of one particular type of information might lead someone to discover other material deemed 'personal\u2019 \u201d to an individual, is both unwarranted and unfounded. <em>Ante </em>at 233. The potential risk or opportunity for abuse has never alone been a sufficient and valid reason for interpreting a statute in a particular manner. The intent of the Legislature in exempting from the foia information of a personal nature that would clearly invade an individual\u2019s privacy was to protect individuals from suffering injury or embarrassment from such disclosure. In this case, the information that was personal and intimate to the individuals was their identities as employment applicants. I see no clear error in the Court of Appeals affirmance of the trial court\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs\u2019 foia request and would hold that the redacting of the final destination on the university\u2019s travel expense forms was not a violation of the act. Moreover, there has been no suggestion that the expenses were not justified, a matter which, if claimed, would permit in camera inspection by the trial court to balance the taxpayers\u2019 interest in the validity of tax dollars expended against privacy exemptions under the foia. <em>Nicita v Detroit, </em>194 Mich App 657; 487 NW2d 814 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">In sum, I would hold that the Open Meetings Act does not compel that information gathered in the initial presidential screening process be disclosed to the public, nor does it dictate the revelation of a candidate\u2019s identity without consent or before the scheduling of a public interview. Additionally, I would uphold the lower courts\u2019 finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>that the Freedom of Information Act was not violated by redacting the final destinations on the regents\u2019 travel expense forms.</p>\n<judges id=\"b445-5\">Levin, J., concurred with Boyle, J., except with respect to part i(c).</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b429-10\"> I also concur with the majority that the Board of Regents\u2019 constitutional argument, which was raised for the first time in this Court, has not been properly preserved for appellate review. <em>Ante </em>at 234.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b429-11\"> Similarly, I cannot agree with Justice Riley\u2019s finding that the Board of Regents is entirely exempt from the Open Meetings Act and that, pursuant to the Michigan Constitution, only its \"formal\u201d sessions need be open to the public.

This Court, therefore, has long recognized that the Legislature and boards of education are distinct and coequal governmental bodies vested with separate powers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-6\">The board of regents and the legislature derive their power from the same supreme authority, namely, the Constitution. In so far as the powers of each are defined by that instrument, limitations are imposed, and a direct power conferred upon one necessarily excludes its existence in the other, in the absence of language showing the contrary intent. . . . They are separate and distinct constitutional bodies, with the powers of the regents defined. By no rule of construction can it be held that either can encroach upon or exercise the powers conferred upon the other. <em>[Id. </em>at 382.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">In other words, \"the board of regents is made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>the highest form of juristic person known to the law, a constitutional corporation of independent authority, which, within the scope of its functions, is co-ordinate with and equal to that of the legislature.\u201d <em>Bd of Regents of Univ of Michigan v Auditor General, </em>167 Mich 444, 450; 132 NW 1037 (1911).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Hence, \"the Legislature may not interfere with the management and control of \u201d universities, <em>Regents of Univ of Michigan v Michigan, </em>395 Mich 52, 65; 235 NW2d 1 (1975), nor may it \"control the action of the Regents.\u201d <em>Weinberg v Regents of Univ of Michigan, </em>97 Mich 246, 254; 56 NW 605 (1893). Justice Williams distilled from our constitution and precedent that \"[t]he Legislature cannot interfere in the management of the university.

In fact, \"[t]he powers and prerogatives of Michigan universities have been jealously guarded not only by the boards of those universities but by this Court in a series of opinions running as far back as 1856.\u201d <em>Eastern Michigan Univ Bd of Control v Labor Mediation Bd, </em>384 Mich 561, 565; 184 NW2d 921 (1971).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Nevertheless, this Court has noted that its historically strong protection of regental autonomy is not without exceptions. The Court has acknowledged that legislative regulation of the universities is not improper if legislation focuses upon the general welfare and does not interfere with the university\u2019s operations, finances, or mission:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-5\">\"It is the opinion of this Court that the legislature can validly exercise its police power for the welfare of the people of this State, and a constitutional corporation such as the board of regents of the University of Michigan can lawfully be affected thereby. The University of Michigan is an independent branch of the government of the State of Michigan, but it is not an island. Within the confines of the operation and the allocation of funds of the University, it is supreme. Without these confines, however, there is no reason to allow the regents to use their independence to thwart the clearly established public policy of the people of Michigan.\u201d <em>[Univ of Michigan Regents v Employment Relations Comm, </em>389 Mich 96, 108; 204 NW2d 218 (1973), quoting <em>Branum v Bd of Regents of Univ of Michigan, </em>5 Mich App 134, 138-139; 145 NW2d 860 (1966).][<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>This reading of the constitution is in accord with its language as well as the original intentions of the ratifiers and framers of the constitution when granting autonomous regental power. The thrust of the adoption of the constitutional provisions was to ensure university autonomy with regard to management and supervision of the educational process and related matters, but not with the general welfare of the community. The provision, for instance, clearly was not intended to permit a board of regents to decriminalize drugs for recreational use or violate child labor laws, nor was it intended to permit the regents to refuse compliance with other general welfare laws unless they interfered with their constitutionally conferred duties.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">On the other hand, the constitution clearly prohibits infringement of constitutionally enumerated regental power by the Legislature. Hence, this Court has held that although defendant was subject to the public employees relations act,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> such regulation could not extend into the regents\u2019 constitutionally granted powers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">Because of the unique nature of the University of Michigan . . . the scope of bargaining by [an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>association of medical interns, residents, and postdoctoral fellows] may be limited if the subject matter falls clearly within the educational sphere. Some conditions of employment may not be subject to collective bargaining because those particular facets of employment would interfere with the autonomy of the Regents. [389 Mich 109.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Similarly, in <em>Bd of Agriculture v Auditor Gen</em>eral, 226 Mich 417, 425; 197 NW 160 (1924), the Court ruled that although the Legislature may attach conditions to funding, not only may the regents reject such appropriations, but those conditions that infringed upon the regents\u2019 management and control of the institution were unconstitutional:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-6\">Clearly, in saying that the legislature can attach to an appropriation any condition which it may deem expedient and wise, the court had in mind only such a condition as the legislature had power to make. It did not mean that a condition could be imposed that would be an invasion of the constitutional rights and powers of the governing board of the college. It did not mean to say that, in order to avail itself of the money appropriated, the State board of agriculture must turn over to the legislature management and control of the college, or of any of its activities.[<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Moreover, those cases permitting legislative interference with the regental power pitted one constitutional provision against another, and resolved the disputes by holding that the more specific power granted to the other branches of gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>ernment overrode the general power of university autonomy.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">The Legislature, therefore, may not impose conditions on a board of regents that interfere with the supervision, management, or control of a university or that are related to its finances, property, or educational mission, and may only regulate university-related activities that have bearing on the general welfare and that arise from a constitutionally granted power.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">In the instant case, the plain meaning of the constitution, combined with the historical circumstances surrounding its adoption, reveal that the intentions of its ratifiers and framers were to grant autonomous regental power over the selection of the university president. The constitution endows the regents with the exclusive power to \"elect a president of the institution under its supervision,\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and confers upon the regents \"general supervision of its institution and the control and direction of all expenditures . . . .\u201d Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 5. That the ratifiers and framers of the constitution intended to prohibit legislative intervention in the fundamental operations of public universities may not be doubted. The historical circumstances that bore the constitutional provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>sion evidence that regental autonomy in core educational functions, such as selecting a president, was the paramount concern of the ratifiers and framers of the section. Indeed, acknowledging that the selection of the president of a university is perhaps the most important function of the board of regents, the constitution explicitly granted the power to the regents,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> who historically were unencumbered in their presidential selection process by the Legislature.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In short, legislative oversight of the presidential selection process strikes at the core of regental autonomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">This is so because the procedures followed by defendant to select a president are a vital aspect of the \"management and control of\u201d the university. 395 Mich 65. As this Court is well aware, procedure often determines result. The oma and the foia certainly attempt to \"control the action of the Regents\u201d by dramatically altering the method by which the board must fulfill its constitutionally vested duty. <em>Weinberg, supra </em>at 254.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Indeed, our well-established precedent manifests that most legislative efforts to control the university unconstitutionally have occurred when the \"legislature attempted to impose its will upon the internal operations of a university.\u201d 384 Mich 565. The acts at issue are such attempts._</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>In <em>In re 1976 PA 267, </em>400 Mich 660, 663; 255 NW2d 635 (1977), the Court recognized that the separation of powers doctrine prohibits the application of the oma to the internal operations of the judiciary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-5\">The judicial powers derived from the Constitution . . . have been exclusively entrusted to the judiciary by the Constitution and may not be diminished, exercised by, nor interfered with by the other branches of government without constitutional authorization. . . . 1976 PA 267 is an impermissible intrusion into the most basic day-today exercise of the constitutionally derived judicial powers.[<footnotemark>25</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Similarly, the oma and the foia strongly infringe upon the internal workings of a university by demanding the regents entirely rework their presidential selection procedures to meet their requirements. The regents vigorously argue that an open selection process will reduce both the quantity and the quality of available candidates. The record reveals that other regents from major Michigan universities concur. Not unlike this Court, the application of the oma and the foia to the regents is simply beyond the realm of legislative authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Moreover, the constitution rejects legislative attempts to open the presidential selection process because it fails to include the informal presidential search process in its mandatory disclosure provision. Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 4. Ratified concurrently with art 8, \u00a7 5, art 8, \u00a7 4 mandates limited public oversight over the universities: \"Formal sessions of governing boards of such institutions shall be open to the public.\u201d_</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>At the Constitutional Convention, the author of the provision explained its history and purpose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">Meetings of governing boards of the 3 major universities have been open to the public and news media for the past <em>Vi </em>dozen years and that has been accomplished only after a long period of negotiations. As it stands, the public and news media are present only as a matter of sufferance. They are invited guests of the governing board, an invitation which could be, conceivably, withdrawn at any time. . . . [N]ow that we are creating by constitutional enactment 7 more such governing boards, it would be appropriate that their formal meetings should be conducted in public sessions. [Delegate White, 1 Official Record, Constitutional Convention 1961, p 1187.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Similarly, the Address to the People stated that this provision was enacted to \"insure[ ] that formal sessions of the governing boards of such institutions will be open to the public.\u201d 2 Official Record, Constitutional Convention 1961, p 3396.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Unmistakenly, the purpose of the provision was to bring within the constitution the then-recent practice of permitting public access to formal meetings. No evidence, however, suggests that the provision was intended or understood to mandate the exposure of the entire presidential selection process to public view, or to empower the Legislature to do so.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Indeed, the exclusionary language of \"formal\u201d reveals the decision whether informal meetings shall be held publicly is vested in the regents. As noted at the Constitutional Convention of 1961, before the adoption of art 8, \u00a7 4, regental power permitted the exclusion of the public from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>all of its meetings; after the ratification of that provision, the same power rested with the regents except with relation to formal meetings. Indeed, that the convention considered a constitutional amendment necessary to ensure that the recent practice of open formal meetings continued strongly suggests that the framers understood that the regents possessed plenary power with regard to the issue. The presidential selection process, therefore, need not be disclosed except when conducted in a formal meeting, such as the election of the officer,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>The plain understanding of the constitution, enlightened by the circumstances from which it arose, protects regental power from the Legislature\u2019s oversight in the instant case.

Cf. <em>Bd of Regents of Univ of Michigan v Auditor General, supra </em>at 449 (holding that regents could determine if their expenditures were \"for lawful purposes\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">In any event, the plain meaning of the constitutional provision prohibits the application of the oma and the foia in the instant case. Unlike the oma, the constitution only mandates that \"[formal sessions\u201d be open to the public. Sources contemporary with the adoption of the amendment reveal that \"formal\u201d is defined as \"belonging to or being the essential constitution or structure . . . following or according with established form, custom, or rule . . . based on conventional forms and rules,\u201d while \"session\u201d is defined as \"a meeting or series of meetings of a body (as a court or legislature) for the transaction of business . . . .\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary </em>(1969), p 328; <em>id. </em>at 793. See also 37 CJS, formal, p 115 (\"[o]f or pertaining to form, characterized by due form or order\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">This definition comports with one drafted by the Attorney General:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-7\">\"[F]ormal sessions\u201d [is defined] as meetings or sittings of the respective governing bodies held in accordance with established rules of such bodies for the transaction of business. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-8\">[W]henever the governing board of an educational institution of higher learning is convened in accordance with established rules of such body for the transaction of business, it must convene in public session .... [OAG, 1969-1970, No 4676, pp 73, 75 (August 13, 1969).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">Cf. <em>Severson v Sueppel, </em>260 Iowa 1169, 1173-1174; 152 NW2d 281 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">Meetings at which the regents follow established rules in order to formally transact business, therefore, must be open to the public. OAG, No 4676, <em>supra. </em>On the other hand, informal meetings need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>be. The meetings at issue, therefore, were informal and need not have been open to the public.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b461-6\"> The Michigan Constitution also mandates that the financial records of public entities be open to public scrutiny:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-7\">All financial records, accountings, audit reports and other reports of public moneys shall be public records and open to inspection. [Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 23.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">\"The manifest purpose of article 9, \u00a723 is to allow the public to keep their finger on the pulse of government spending.\u201d <em>Grayson v Bd of Accountancy, </em>27 Mich App 26, 34; 183 NW2d 424 (1970). In the instant case, there is no doubt that the records of the expenditures by defendant must be open to public scrutiny in some manner. Hence, defendant must disclose that it purchased airline tickets, the price of the tickets, and other pertinent financial information. Defendant must release at least \"summaries, balance sheets, and other such compilations which map out and correlate a myriad of financial transactions into a meaningful account.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On the other hand, whether a constitutional mandate exists which compels defendant to disclose the location of its travels is open to question. Cf. <em>id. </em>at 34-35 (\"[i]t strains one\u2019s credulity to think that the framers of the Constitution meant to allow the public to inspect every receipt . . . and every writing evidencing a receipt or expenditure\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">In any event, where the board, while exercising its exclusive authority to select a president, reasonably determines that such disclosure significantly hinders its ability to fulfill its constitutional duty, then the longstanding constitutional protection of regental autonomy should outweigh the minimal interest of financial record disclosure of the destination of such trips. Hence, in the conflict between these two constitutional provisions regental autonomy triumphs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b461-10\"> Both sides vigorously contest the efficacy of a closed versus an open presidential selection process. These arguments, however, are irrelevant to the resolution of the instant case because the constitution has settled the issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-11\">[T]he Court is not called upon to give its opinion as to whether the legislation in question is good public policy and the best part of wisdom for the Legislature and the universities to follow. We are asked only whether the legislative conditions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>invade the constitutional jurisdiction of the universities. Therefore, our conclusions based on the Constitution and the foregoing precedents and our analysis of the lessons they teach can be seen only in that perspective.
