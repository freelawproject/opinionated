The object of the conspiracy was the murder of Rodney Fancher, the live-in fianc\u00e9 of the defendant\u2019s daughter, Cora. In a per curiam opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed Bushard\u2019s convictions. Unpublished opinion, decided January 11, 1991 (Docket No. 112817). We granted leave to appeal, 440 Mich 889 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">The defendant raises four issues: (1) whether the admission of testimony that defendant \"shook her head\u201d when asked by a cellmate if she realized she was admitting her guilt, was a violation of the defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right to remain silent; (2) whether cross-examination of the prosecutor\u2019s chief witness was improperly limited, contravening the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation; (3) whether a coconspirator\u2019s statement was admissible against the defendant; and, (4) whether the retrial of defendant violated the constitutional ban against double jeopardy. Because the defendant\u2019s conviction does not constitute a miscarriage of justice, MCL 769.26; MSA 28.1096, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals upholding the defendant\u2019s conviction of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder and first-degree murder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">The defendant, Anna Bushard, was tried jointly with Tony Hill for first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Both were convicted. However, because of a trial court error, Bushard was granted a new trial. On retrial, the defendant was again convicted of first-degree murder and of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Peggy Stevens\u2019 testimony was the primary evidence at trial. However, the trial was not simply a one-to-one credibility contest. Stevens testified that Anna Bushard had originated the idea that would lure the deceased from his home to the appointment with his murderer. Anna suggested that Rod Fancher should be told that they had posted a note at Don\u2019s Truck Stop saying that Rod was looking for work. Tony Hill was to call Rod and arrange to meet him on the pretext that he had seen such a note and wanted to hire him to unload a truck. She also testified that Anna had said that simply breaking Fancher\u2019s arms and legs would do no good, that he had to be shot, and that she would pay the $1000 fee for the killing in installments. Peggy testified that after the murder Anna gave her $100, and she, in turn, gave it to Hill.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Bushard\u2019s cellmate, Rhonda Howlett, reiterated her testimony that Anna Bushard told her that she had given money to Peggy to give to Tony and, corroborating Peggy\u2019s testimony, that the defendant said that \"the way they planned it\u201d the murder of Rod Fancher was supposed to occur on Wednesday, October 2, 1985, not on Thursday when it actually occurred. Cora Bushard\u2019s testimony established that Rod had received phone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>calls from a man who initially asked him to unload a truck on October 2, and then rescheduled the meeting for October 3. The jury was given an accomplice instruction, but it was entitled to conclude from Howlett\u2019s testimony that Anna Bu-shard could only have known about the failed October 2 attempt if she had been part of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Evidence was also introduced through the interrogating detective that coconspirators Harold Stevens and Peggy Stevens, separately questioned, gave identical statements regarding Bushard\u2019s involvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Testimony of the deceased\u2019s mother, Mary Fancher, also corroborated Stevens\u2019 account of Anna\u2019s involvement and may have been critical in jury deliberations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mary Fancher testified that she asked Rod on Wednesday night (October 2) how the man who had called him knew he was looking for work and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-7\">then Anna spoke up and said that she had written Rodney\u2019s name and phone number on a slip of paper and gave it to Peggy and Harold to take and put on Don\u2019s \u2014 at Don\u2019s Truck Stop on the bulletin board.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">Police investigation corroborated Peggy\u2019s testimony that no note was ever posted at Don\u2019s Truck Stop. The jury was thus entitled to conclude that the fictional note was a ruse and that Anna\u2019s statement that the call had come in response to a note she had personally written and allegedly given to Peggy and Harold to post, confirmed her participation in the plot to kill Rod Fancher.</p>\n<p id=\"AnW\">Defendant also acknowledged that she had given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Harold $100, but said it was to repair her car. She denied having said she wrote a note to be posted at Don\u2019s Truck Stop. Defendant testified that her daughter Cora, Rod\u2019s girl friend, had asked her in September if she would post a note. However, the jury was also entitled to credit Cora Bushard\u2019s contrary testimony concerning the note. Cora testified that the defendant told her that Peggy posted a note at Don\u2019s Truck Stop. While Cora also stated that she did not recall when any discussion about a note occurred, she admitted that she probably did not know about it before <em>she </em>asked her mother on October 2, 1985, how the man who called Rod knew he was looking for work.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Two juries have now considered the credibility of evidence implicating Anna Bushard and resolved the credibility question adversely to the defendant. We find no basis to conclude that the conviction of Anna Bushard constitutes a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">The defendant first complains that the testimony of Rhonda Howlett, a cellmate, was a violation of her right to silence under the Fifth Amendment. Howlett testified that while in jail, Bushard discussed her role in the plan to murder Fancher and when another cellmate asked Bushard whether she realized she was admitting her guilt, Anna \"just shook her head, didn\u2019t say anything else.\u201d We agree with Justice Levin<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that Howlett\u2019s testimony was evidence of Bushard\u2019s nonverbal response to a question presented during a conversation with her cellmates that the defendant ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>tively took part in. Thus, the testimony was not admitted as a violation of the defendant\u2019s right to silence under the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Although not raised at trial, the defendant complains that her constitutional right of confrontation was violated on retrial when the court refused to allow the defendant to cross-examine Peggy Stevens, the prosecutor\u2019s chief witness, regarding prior unprosecuted criminal activity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defense contends that cross-examination concerning the welfare application fraudulently filed in defendant\u2019s name would show Peggy Stevens\u2019 tendency to accuse her mother of criminal activity. It is also claimed that cross-examination of Peggy regarding prior statements made by codefendant Tony Hill, that he was paid $100 for his participation in the theft of a trailer and that the money had nothing to do with the murder of Rod Fancher, would assist the jury in assessing Stevens\u2019 credibility.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Dealing with the assertions in inverse order, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>is clear that the trial judge properly prevented cross-examination with respect to Tony Hill\u2019s statement regarding the reason for payment to him of $100. The question contained a hearsay assertion, and no showing of the witnesses\u2019 unavailability was made so as to bring it within the hearsay exception, MRE 804(b)(1).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Second, although evidence of a false charge of welfare fraud generally may have been helpful to suggest Peggy Stevens\u2019 hostility toward her mother, limitation of impeachment in these circumstances did not violate defendant\u2019s right of confrontation. A trial court has wide latitude in deciding whether particular evidence indicates partiality. 1 McCormick, Evidence (4th ed), \u00a7 39, pp 134-135. Stated otherwise, \"the Confrontation Clause guarantees an <em>opportunity </em>for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.\u201d <em>Delaware v Fensterer, </em>474 US 15, 20; 106 S Ct 292; 88 L Ed 2d 15 (1985) (emphasis in original); <em>Delaware v Van Arsdall, </em>475 US 673, 679; 106 S Ct 1431; 89 L Ed 2d 674 (1986).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>In <em>Davis v Alaska, </em>415 US 308, 316; 94 S Ct 1105; 39 L Ed 2d 347 (1974), the Court found a denial of confrontation where the trial court prevented any exploration of a witness\u2019 \"bias,\u201d resulting from the witness\u2019 status as a juvenile on probation, for its bearing on the motivation for his testimony incriminating the defendant. By contrast, in the instant case, the welfare incident had been resolved without prosecution, and the defendant fully explored the bias inherent in Peggy Stevens\u2019 status as a fully immunized witness. Stevens was extensively examined regarding the fact that she had received complete immunity from prosecution for her admitted involvement in the conspiracy to murder in exchange for her testimony implicating her mother. Although inquiry into Stevens\u2019 prior conduct may have been helpful in discrediting Peggy Stevens, the limitation complained of did not deny the defendant a fair trial or violate her right of confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">The defense also claims the trial court committed error requiring reversal by admitting the hearsay statement made by coconspirator, Tony Hill, to Peggy Stevens that he told the victim that \"this was the way she [Anna] wanted it done.\u201d In a pretrial motion, the defense challenged the admission of Hill\u2019s statement to Stevens because it occurred after the murder and was thus not a statement made \"in furtherance\u201d of the conspiracy, because any conspiracy had been completed at that point._</p>\n<p id=\"b587-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>The trial court deferred ruling on the issue until the evidence was presented at trial. However, the record does not contain any renewal of that motion or of any objection by the defendant to the admission of the statement at trial. On appeal, the defendant contends that, despite counsel\u2019s failure to renew the objection during trial, the court committed error requiring reversal by admitting the statement because it was not made \"in furtherance\u201d of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">The conspiracy in this case consisted of an agreement between the Stevenses, the defendant, and Tony Hill that Hill would murder Rodney Fancher in exchange for $1000. The conspirators agreed that the money was to be paid in installments. Hill\u2019s possession of the motorcycle was a \"down payment\u201d for his participation in the murder. The statement at issue was spoken a few days after the October 2, 1985, murder at the first meeting between Peggy and Harold Stevens and Hill following the killing. According to Stevens, Hill told them that he suggested to Rod that they get out of the car and smoke some weed, that as he shot him he told Rod why, and that Hill left him in the ditch where he fell. Several weeks later, in late October or early November, responding to Hill\u2019s pressure for payment, Anna Bushard gave Stevens $100 to give to Hill as an installment payment. The conspirators were arrested in late December before any additional or final payment was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Assuming arguendo that this issue was preserved for review by this Court, MRE 801(d)(2)(E) provides in pertinent part that a statement is <em>not </em>hearsay if</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-6\">[t]he statement is offered against a party and is ... a statement by a coconspirator of a party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy on independent proof of the conspiracy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Thus, to qualify under the rule, the statement must be made \"during the course\u201d <em>and </em>\"in furtherance\u201d of the conspiracy. If either requirement is unmet, the statement must be excluded. See 2 McCormick, Evidence (4th ed), \u00a7 259, p 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">To satisfy the \"during the course\u201d aspect of the exception, the conspiracy must be extant at the time the statement is made. The phrase relates to the temporal dimension of the conspiracy, which continues until the common enterprise has been fully completed, abandoned, or terminated. An arrest generally terminates the conspiracy, as does the success or failure of its objectives. <em>Krulewitch v United States; </em>336 US 440; 69 S Ct 716; 93 L Ed 790 (1949); <em>People v Beller, </em>294 Mich 464, 468; 293 NW 720 (1940). See also LaFave &amp; Scott, Criminal Law (2d ed), \u00a7 6.5(e), pp 554-555.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">However, as noted by Professor Perkins, a conspiracy to commit a crime is not necessarily ended by the fact that enough has been done to incur guilt of that offense, Perkins &amp; Boyce, Criminal Law (3d ed), p 710. Thus, even after the primary object of the substantive crime is complete, the conspiracy may continue if its objectives contemplated the completion of financial or other arrangements. <em>People v Losey, </em>98 Mich App 189, 199-200; 296 NW2d 601 (1980), rev\u2019d on other grounds 413 Mich 346; 320 NW2d 49 (1982); <em>People v Scotts, </em>80 Mich App 1, 5-6; 263 NW2d 272 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Where conspiracies involve murders for hire, courts have held that because an act connected with the main objective of the conspiracy is not completed, the conspiracy is still alive, <em>Losey, supra; Scotts, supra; State v White, </em>168 Ariz 500; 815 P2d 869 (1991), cert den 502 US 1105; 112 S Ct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>1199; 117 L Ed 2d 439 (1992); <em>State v Howard, </em>324 NW2d 216 (Minn, 1982); <em>People v Saling, </em>7 Cal 3d 844; 500 P2d 610 (1972); <em>United States v Kahan, </em>572 F2d 923, 935 (CA 2, 1978), cert den 439 US 833 (1978). \"So long as the defendant continued to pay, the agreement[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] remained in force.\u201d <em>Losey, supra </em>at 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">It is clear that the agreement contemplated payment. Moreover, the fact that a payment was actually made indicates that as of that point, subsequent to the making of the statement, the conspirators regarded payment as part of their agreement. The objects of the conspiracy had not been completed or abandoned, and no arrests had been made when Hill made his remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The second requirement, \"in furtherance,\u201d has been construed broadly. \"[Statements made by one conspirator to keep other conspirators informed about the progress of the scheme do satisfy the 'in furtherance\u2019 requirement.\u201d <em>United States v Gibbs, </em>739 F2d 838, 845 (CA 3, 1984), cert den 469 US 1106 (1985). In <em>United States v Maldonado-Rivera, </em>922 F2d 934, 958-959 (CA 2, 1990), the court defined statements in furtherance of a conspiracy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-6\">[M]ere \"idle chatter\u201d does not satisfy Rule 801(d)(2)(E). Rather, the statements must be such as to prompt the listener \u2014 who need not be a coconspi-rator \u2014 to respond in a way that promotes or facilitates the carrying out of a criminal activity. . . . [Statements between coconspirators that may be found to be in furtherance of the conspiracy include statements that provide reassurance, or seek <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>to induce a coconspirator\u2019s assistance or serve to foster trust and cohesiveness, or inform each other as to the progress or status of the conspiracy. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-5\"><em>People v Trilck, </em>374 Mich 118; 132 NW2d 134 (1965), is not to the contrary. In <em>Trilck, </em>the Court held that statements made by one coconspirator after his arrest were not in furtherance of the conspiracy because they \"were not made to advance the common objective and criminal purpose,\u201d or \"these statements, rather than being in furtherance of the conspiracy, were in derogation of same.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Hill\u2019s statement was made \"in furtherance\u201d of the conspiracy to murder. Reporting the details of the crime to Peggy and Harold Stevens, presumably insured that he would collect his remaining payments, one of the main objectives of the killing as far as Hill was concerned, and a part of the conspiratorial understanding of all four conspirators. Moreover, the trial court\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-7\">finding that a given statement was uttered by a coconspirator \"in furtherance\u201d of a conspiracy will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is clearly erroneous. Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the court\u2019s choice between them cannot be deemed clearly erroneous. <em>[Maldonado-Rivera, supra </em>at 959. Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">In short, it may be generally said that statements made after the commission of the substantive crime that is the object of the conspiracy are neither \"in the course\u201d nor \"in furtherance\u201d of the conspiracy because the object of the conspiracy has been accomplished. Where, as here, however, the conspiracy is a murder for hire, the object is more than the commission of the substantive offense. Because the conspiracy embraces payment as \"its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>last term,\u201d <em>State v Cruz, </em>137 Ariz 541, 547; 672 P2d 470 (1983), the conspiracy in this case was ongoing at the time the statement was made. Hill\u2019s statement, made after the murder but before payment had been made, was thus \"made in the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\u201d <em>Nixon v State, </em>533 So 2d 1078, 1091 (Miss, 1987), cert den 490 US 1102 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Finally, the defendant complains that she has been put twice in jeopardy because in the first trial she was convicted of \"conspiracy to commit murder\u201d and, on retrial, was convicted of \"conspiracy to commit first-degree murder.\u201d We agree with Justice Levin that although the jury\u2019s verdict form may have been ambiguous, there is absolutely no doubt that at the first trial the jury convicted Bushard of first-degree murder at the same time it convicted her of conspiracy to murder. Thus, the first conviction of conspiracy to commit murder logically pertained to the finding of first-degree murder, not of second-degree murder as defendant alleges. Therefore, no double jeopardy violation occurred when, on retrial, the defendant was charged with and convicted of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">There is no basis from which it affirmatively appears that the conviction of Anna Bushard constitutes a miscarriage of justice. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b591-8\">Griffin, J., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b591-9\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AcN\">Anna Marie Bushard was convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>degree murder on the testimony of her daughter, Peggy Stevens.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">I agree with the majority that Bushard\u2019s constitutional rights to be protected from self-incrimination<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and double jeopardy<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>There is, however, substantial evidence that the use made of evidence claimed by the prosecutor to be corroborative of Stevens\u2019 testimony, omissions of her trial counsel,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and rulings of the trial judge,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> might have deprived Bushard of her due process right to a fair trial and might have resulted in a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">I would remand to the trial court for a <em>Ginther-</em>type<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> hearing to explore what I consider to be disturbing aspects of this case, and would retain jurisdiction to consider, in light of such findings as the trial judge might deem appropriate, whether to order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">There is no need to cite authority in support of the following statements. Appellate courts review the record made at the trial to determine whether there has been error. Error is an incorrect ruling by a trial judge. Accordingly, there cannot be error unless the judge was asked to rule. No objection, no ruling, no error. And even if the judge rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>incorrectly, the error might not constitute error requiring reversal if, on a review of the record, it appears that the error was harmless. But, even in the absence of objection, an appellate court may recognize \"plain error\u201d where what occurred is deemed contrary to the sound administration of justice or there may have been a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">It would be premature to order a new trial respecting some of the matters adverted to in this opinion without first providing the prosecutor, Bushard\u2019s trial and appellate counsel, and the judge an opportunity to consider those matters, many of which have not been discussed in the briefs. After such an inquiry, and such findings as the trial judge might find to be appropriate, this Court should then consider whether a new trial should be ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Frequently, a review of the record leaves the appellate court with the conviction that, while the defendant\u2019s trial was not a perfect trial, it was a fair trial, and any \"error\u201d was harmless. My review of this record leaves me with the impression that there might have been a miscarriage of justice. While Bushard might truly be guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, she might, as she claims, be innocent.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">I recognize that two juries have convicted Bu-shard, and that a third jury might convict her again. I also recognize that the trier of fact, generally a jury, decides whether Stevens or Bushard is telling the truth. For that reason, it is unusual for an appellate court to assess the weight of the evidence. In this case it is necessary to scrutinize the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">Peggy Stevens was the principal prosecution witness.

He would twist Brian\u2019s arm behind his back and, when Brian said it hurt, would tell him to shut up._</p>\n<p id=\"b597-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Peggy <em>Stevens </em>testified that her husband Harold began to discuss Fancher\u2019s treatment of Brian with Hill, the person who killed Fancher.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Harold had most of the conversations with Hill. Peggy was asked on cross-examination whether Harold had ever talked with Hill \"about just thumping\u201d (beating up) Fancher. She responded: \"I think at one time it had been discussed with Tony about just having him beat up.\u201d She could not \"remember\u201d if Hill said, \"[w]hy not shoot him,\u201d but <em>he could have made that statement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">In her first confessional statements on Saturday, Peggy said that Hill had suggested that Fancher be killed. After there had been discussions on Sunday about the possibility of granting immunity to Peggy in exchange for her testimony, she revised her Saturday confessional statement to include her mother in the conspiracy. She acknowledged that if Hill suggested killing Fancher, that would be \"different than your statement on Sunday when you said it was Anna [Bushard] that talked about having him shot . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Peggy Stevens testified that she and her mother, defendant Anna Bushard, had discussed Fancher\u2019s excessive discipline of Brian, and agreed that \"something had to be done.\u201d Peggy said that she suggested that Fancher be beaten up, or have his arms and legs broken. According to Peggy, her mother said that would \"just make him worse,\u201d and that Fancher should be killed. Peggy testified that at first she did not take her mother\u2019s statement seriously, but, when her mother repeated this in subsequent conversations, Peggy said she would see what she could do.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Peggy Stevens also testified that after the discus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>sions between Harold Stevens and Hill moved from beating to killing Fancher, Hill reported to Harold that he had talked to one of his friends and that Fancher could be shot, but that it would \"take one thousand dollars.\u201d According to Peggy, she then talked to her mother, informed her of the price, and her mother replied that \"she didn\u2019t have that much money, that it would have to be made in payments\u201d \u2014 that she would have to pay \"when she could and what she could.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AfJ\">Hill agreed to do the deed. No money was paid to Hill before Fancher was killed.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Peggy testified, however, that her husband, Harold, transferred to Hill, as a \"down payment\u201d or \"collateral,\u201d possession of a motorcycle Harold had obtained from his brother, David.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> There is no evidence, other than Peggy\u2019s testimony, that Hill extended credit or that he truly expected to receive any money from the Stevenses after the killing._</p>\n<p id=\"al-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Anna Bushard acknowledged that her daughter, Peggy\u00bb had suggested that Fancher should be beaten up, or have his arms and legs broken. She said that she responded that \"that wouldn\u2019t do any good . . . .\u201d Bushard testified that she added: \"violence never helped any situation.\u201d She denied that she suggested or agreed that Fancher should be killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">Peggy Stevens thus acknowledged that she and her husband Harold were thinking of resorting to violence against Fancher. Their motive was their desire to punish him for mistreatment of Brian and what they perceived to be his role in withdrawing Brian from their society. She also testified that they were considering moving to Arizona and hoped that Cora Bushard would let them take Brian with them because Cora \"didn\u2019t really care if she had him around.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">Since Peggy Stevens acknowledged that she and her husband hired Hill to kill Fancher, the narrow factual dispute between Peggy and her mother was whether it was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-9\">\u2022 the Stevenses \u2014 who acknowledged that they had discussed with Hill having Fancher beaten up, or having his arms and legs broken; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-10\">\u2022 Hill \u2014 who, according to Peggy, might have suggested \"[w]hy not shoot him\u201d and who had talked to one of his friends who would kill him for $1,000; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-11\">\u2022 Anna Bushard \u2014 who Peggy acknowledged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>said that violence would \"just make him worse,\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">who suggested that Fancher should be killed, and whether Bushard joined in the conspiracy to do so.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">The trial essentially concerned the veracity and credibility of Peggy Stevens and her mother, Anna Bushard.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Peggy had been granted complete immunity from prosecution although she was admittedly deeply involved and a moving force in bringing about the killing. Because Peggy had been granted immunity in exchange for her testimony against her mother and Hill, her testimony was suspect, and probably would not be believed without more. It was therefore important for the prosecution to attempt to provide corroboration.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">The lead opinion states that the trial was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>simply a \"one-to-one credibility contest.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The prosecutor, in his closing argument, stated that it is not \"Peggy versus Anna\u201d: \"the evidence you\u2019ve heard has supported Peggy Stevens\u2019 testimony in every way until we get to the denial by the Defendant,\u201d Anna Bushard.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The argument that the evidence supported Peggy\u2019s testimony \"in every way\u201d is extravagant. There was no testimony or other evidence supporting what she said occurred during her conversations and her husband\u2019s conversations with Hill, or what occurred during her conversations with her husband, or what occurred during her conversations with her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">The prosecutor, in closing argument, stated and reiterated that there was no reason for Peggy Stevens to lie at the time she changed her confessional statement to include her mother because she did not <em>then </em>have a promise of immunity.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>That is not the whole truth. Before Peggy revised her confessional statement to include her mother, there were discussions with Detective Robert Ko-walski about the possibility of her obtaining immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">The prosecutor\u2019s argument that Peggy Stevens had no \"motive to lie on Sunday\u201d \u2014 the revised confession implicating her mother was made on Sunday \u2014 because she had not <em>yet been promised </em>immunity is misleading. While she had not yet been promised immunity, the possibility of immunity had been discussed with Detective Kowalski, and she had a motive to lie on Sunday in the hope that the prosecutor would, on Monday or sometime thereafter, as he did, grant her immunity in exchange for testimony implicating her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">The prosecutor would not have been able to use Peggy Stevens\u2019 revised confessional statement against Hill or Bushard unless she was willing, in exchange for concessions agreed to by the pros<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>ecutor, to repeat the substance of her revised confession at a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">The prosecutor\u2019s argument that Peggy Stevens had no \"motive to lie on Sunday\u201d makes especially important the judge\u2019s rulings precluding Bushard\u2019s lawyer from examining Peggy concerning a fraudulent filing by the Stevenses of a welfare application on which they had forged Bushard\u2019s name, and from examining Peggy concerning the theft of a trailer by Hill and one or both of the Stevenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">Close family members do not generally falsely accuse one another of serious crimes. A jury thus might assume that Peggy Stevens was telling the truth. The prosecutor repeatedly asserted that Peggy had no reason or motive to lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">Because family members do not generally falsely accuse each other of crime, such an accusation heightens the credibility of the accuser and enhances the believability of the accusation. For this reason, evidence indicating that Peggy Stevens had falsely implicated Bushard in criminal activity in the past is especially important and not merely cumulative of other evidence denigrating Peggy\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">Although Peggy\u2019s credibility had been put in doubt by the evidence that she had been granted immunity from prosecution, and had revised her Saturday confession on Sunday to include her mother in the conspiracy after there had been discussion about the possibility of her obtaining immunity from prosecution, evidence that she had forged her mother\u2019s name to a fraudulent welfare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>application, thus falsely involving her in a crime that the Stevenses themselves committed, might have led to a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">The evidence that was excluded might have overcome any assumption that Peggy\u2019s testimony implicating her mother is inherently more credible than testimony implicating a stranger or mere acquaintance. Cross-examination about the fraudulent filing might have led the jury to conclude that there was not such a familial relationship as to justify an assumption that Peggy would not involve Bushard in criminal activity or falsely accuse her of a crime. Had the jury heard this testimony, it might have found it to be more likely that Peggy would falsely implicate her mother in a crime that she had not committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">At the first trial,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Peggy Stevens was cross-examined about the theft of the trailer by Hill\u2019s lawyer. She acknowledged that Hill and her husband Harold stole a trailer from B &amp; L Campers during \"that time period.\u201d She said she was home at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">The trailer was brought to the Stevens\u2019 home by Hill and Harold. Peggy denied any knowledge of conversations concerning payment of money to Hill for his assistance in stealing the trailer. Hill testified that he received $100 from the Stevenses one month after the killing, but said that it was for his assistance in stealing the trailer \u2014 not, as Peggy testified at the first and second trial, for killing Fancher.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">The record does not disclose that Bushard\u2019s lawyer made an attempt to obtain Hill\u2019s appearance to testify at the second trial. Nor does it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>appear why, except for the failure to show that Hill was unavailable, his earlier testimony was not admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">In sum, Bushard was accused by Peggy Stevens, who could have been shown through cross-examination to have sought to involve Bushard in criminal activity committed by the Stevenses, and who might have been shown through cross-examination to have lied about the reason $100 was paid to Hill.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">This was a \"one-to-one credibility contest.\u201d The limitation of the cross-examination of Peggy appears to justify a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">There is no claim or evidence that either Hill or Harold Stevens spoke to Anna Bushard. There was thus no testimony, other than Peggy\u2019s testimony, that Bushard joined in the conspiracy, or that the price was $1,000, or that Hill extended credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">Since neither Hill nor Harold Stevens spoke to Bushard, and Peggy Stevens was the sole source of their information about Bushard\u2019s alleged participation in the conspiracy, no statement by Hill or by Harold \u2014 reported at the trial by Peggy, David Stevens, or Detective Kowalski \u2014 can corroborate Peggy\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-11\">Nor was Peggy\u2019s testimony corroborated by Bushard\u2019s acknowledgment that, a few weeks before the killing, she had provided Peggy with Fancher\u2019s name and phone number to be posted at Don\u2019s Truck Stop, and that she had paid $100 to Peggy about a month after the killing. <em>The issue </em>about both the posting of the note and the pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>ment of $100 <em>is the reason Bushard did what she concedes she did.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">Did Bushard participate in the plan to post the note at Don\u2019s Truck Stop in a family effort to find Fancher work, as she claimed? Did she pay the $100, as she claimed, to purchase parts to repair her automobile? Or did she do what she did as part of the conspiracy? As to that issue \u2014 why she did what she did \u2014 it is Anna versus Peggy. There is nothing else.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Bushard\u2019s testimony that there was family discussion about posting a note \u2014 to find work for Fancher \u2014 and concerning the reason why the $100 was paid \u2014 to pay for parts for her automobile\u2014 was corroborated by the testimony of other witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">There is nothing to corroborate Peggy\u2019s testimony that Bushard\u2019s role in the plan to post the note and her payment of the $100 was part of the conspiracy. As to that \u2014 the reason that Bushard did what she concedes she did \u2014 Peggy\u2019s testimony stands alone without corroboration.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">With the exception of the testimony of Rhonda Howlett, a cellmate of Bushard\u2019s, the bulk of the asserted corroboration of Peggy\u2019s testimony was essentially repetition of, or dependent on, the assertions of Peggy, of the nature of hearsay,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and was essentially bootstrap corroboration.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">Before discussing in greater detail the evidence concerning the posting of the note at Don\u2019s Truck <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>Stop (part v) Peggy Stevens\u2019 receipt of $100 from Anna Bushard a month after the killing (part iv) and the testimony of cellmate Rhonda Howlett (part vi), I turn to a discussion of the \"bootstrap corroboration,\u201d relied on by the prosecutor as corroboration of Peggy\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">The bootstrap corroboration was in the nature of hearsay, or was hearsay, or possibly within an exclusion or exception to the hearsay rule. Defense counsel did not seek to bar the bootstrap corroboration on the basis that it was hearsay,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> or not within a hearsay exception,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> or was not of probative value, or that any probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">At the remand hearing that I would order, the legal issues could be explored and the question whether Bushard is entitled to a new trial, at which the bootstrap corroboration would be excluded, could be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">The first statement, chronologically, was Detective Kowalski\u2019s report that David Stevens, Harold\u2019s brother, telephoned him Saturday night, after Peggy and Harold Stevens had been arrested, to report, on the basis of a telephone conversation with Harold, that Bushard was the \"push\u201d behind the killing of Fancher. Detective Kowalski testified that Anna Bushard became a focus of the police investigation for the first time after David Stevens\u2019 telephone call to Kowalski.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">The only source of David Stevens\u2019 accusation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>was a telephone conversation with Harold. And Harold\u2019s assertion is dependent on the veracity of Peggy, who alone claims that she had conversations with her mother concerning her mother\u2019s involvement in the conspiracy.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">Harold\u2019s repetition to his brother David of what Peggy was claimed to have told him, and David\u2019s repetition to Kowalski of what Harold told him, does not corroborate Peggy\u2019s testimony. This is bootstrap corroboration.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Detective Kowalski testified that, after Peggy revised on Sunday the confession she gave shortly after she was arrested on Saturday to include her mother in the conspiracy, he again spoke to Harold, who then also involved Bushard in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Putting aside until the next paragraphs of this opinion whether it was probative that Harold\u2019s statements involving Bushard allegedly coincided with Peggy\u2019s revised confession, and focusing on whether what Harold said to Kowalski was corroborative of what Peggy said, once again, since Harold did not speak to Bushard, whatever Harold told Kowalski was dependent on what he claims Peggy told him about her conversations with her mother. Thus, again, whatever was said by Harold to Kowalski is not corroborative of the veracity of Peggy because all there is is repetition of what Peggy is alleged to have told Harold. More bootstrap corroboration._</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>The lead opinion states that Kowalski testified that the Stevenses, \"separately questioned, gave identical statements regarding Bushard\u2019s involvement.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Having in mind that the idea of involving Bushard in the police investigation <em>originated with Harold, </em>it is neither remarkable nor probative that Harold\u2019s statement concerning Bushard\u2019s involvement matched Peggy\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">On Saturday night, after the Stevenses both had confessed their involvement in the killing, Harold was looking at life imprisonment without possibility of parole, and, quite understandably, for a way out.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> It apparently occurred to him, possibly to Peggy also, that they might obtain some mitigation or immunity by involving Bushard. We know this because it was Harold who \u2014 although he had never spoken to Bushard \u2014 telephoned his brother David on Saturday night, and, following that conversation, it was David who telephoned Kowalski to suggest that Bushard was the \"push\u201d behind the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Peggy and Harold would have had no difficulty in coming up with parallel versions of Bushard\u2019s involvement. All they had to do was repeat to Kowalski what, according to Peggy, they told Hill. Peggy said that they told Hill that Bushard would come up with money. It would not have taken more than a few minutes, or even less<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> for them to agree to tell Kowalski the same story about the abuse and mistreatment of Brian, and Bushard\u2019s involvement in the conspiracy to kill Fancher, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>they had, over six meetings with Hill, related to him, in a successful effort to persuade him to kill Fancher. They simply had to be as persuasive with Detective Kowalski as they had been with Hill.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">It is noteworthy that there is no verbatim record of the interrogation or of the original or revised confessional statements made by Peggy or Harold Stevens. There is neither a stenographic nor an audio record. Notes were taken, and Kowalski testified on the basis of his recollection and notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">Returning to the bootstrap corroboration, there is the statement attributed by Peggy to Hill that, shortly before he shot Fancher, he said in effect \"this is for the way you\u2019ve treated Brian, . . . that was the way [Grandma] had wanted it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">Since Hill never spoke to Bushard and was dependent on what Peggy and Harold told him, and Harold was dependent on what Peggy told him about Bushard\u2019s involvement, Hill\u2019s reported statement is, again, bootstrap corroboration without probative value, independent of whether Peggy was telling the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">Peggy\u2019s recital of Hill\u2019s alleged statements shows, at most, that Peggy and Harold had succeeded in persuading Hill that Fancher was a drug and child abuser, and that Bushard wanted him killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">While it is clear, as a matter of ordinary logic, that Hill\u2019s statement was without probative value, the illogic in according any weight to Peggy\u2019s repetition of Hill\u2019s alleged statement is not readily apparent because the key factual point \u2014 neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Hill nor Harold ever had direct communication with Bushard \u2014 was <em>not highlighted.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The prosecutor accorded great probative value to Hill\u2019s nonprobative statement. He used this non-probative evidence to close his rebuttal argument to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-6\">It comes down to that statement Tony Hill made on October 2nd \u2014 excuse me \u2014 October 3rd at 9 p.m. as he had the gun to Rodney\u2019s chest and put him in the ditch. He\u2019s down in the ditch. You can look at the picture. He comes out with that statement. This is for Brian. This is the way his grandmother wants it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">The prosecutor thus argued, dramatically, rhetorically, and effectively that Hill, the killer, confirmed, as he was about to blow Fancher apart with a shotgun, that Bushard had hired Hill to kill Fancher because of his mistreatment of Brian.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">In thus using Peggy\u2019s testimony \u2014 repeating what she said Hill said, which, at best, was what she and Harold had persuaded him of \u2014 to bolster her credibility, in omitting that Hill had no independent knowledge of whether Bushard wanted Fancher killed, the prosecutor again misled the jury. This was not a minor point. The prosecutor closed his rebuttal argument with this misleading testimony and argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">Peggy Stevens\u2019 recital of what she says Hill said he said, which at best was based on what Peggy said she and Harold had said to Hill, should thus have been excluded because it had no probative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>value, and any probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury. This recital should also have been excluded because it was not within the exclusion for statements by a coconspirator.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Bushard\u2019s lawyer made an effort, by motion in limine, to bar this recital as not within the exclusion for statements by a coconspirator. The prosecutor argued that the conspiracy was not complete at the time Hill reported to the Stevenses what had occurred at the time Fancher was killed because Hill had not been paid in full the $1,000 that Peggy said had been promised him. The judge deferred ruling on this issue, and the record does not disclose a renewed objection by Bushard\u2019s lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">It is possible that both lawyers and the judge ultimately may have concluded that the first opinion of the Court of Appeals precluded challenge except on further appeal to this Court. The first opinion said that \"[although we are persuaded of no error arising from codefendant Bushard\u2019s remaining issues, our decision to reverse and remand renders further analysis unnecessary.\u201d The record does not disclose that the lawyers and judge so concluded, and therefore we would not be justified in so concluding without exploring this on the remand I would order.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Hill\u2019s statement to Peggy Stevens concerning what he allegedly told Fancher would not have been admissible under the exclusion for a coconspi-rator\u2019s statement unless, when Hill made the statement to Peggy, the conspiracy to murder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Fancher was, although he was dead, continuing and, although he was dead, was made in furtherance of the conspiracy.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The lead opinion would hold that the conspiracy was continuing at the time that Hill made the statement to Peggy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-6\">Hill\u2019s statement was made \"in furtherance\u201d of the conspiracy to murder. Keporting the details of the crime to Peggy and Harold Stevens, presumably insured that he would collect his remaining payments, one of the main objectives of the killing as far as Hill was concerned, and a part of the conspiratorial understanding of all four conspirators.[<footnotemark>32</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">The lead opinion thus concludes that because Peggy testified that, a few days after the killing, Hill related what occurred at the time of the murder, and also testified that she paid Hill a month later $100 in respect to the $1,000 she testified Hill was promised, the conspiracy was ongoing. Adoption of the prosecutor\u2019s approach would mean that the conspiracy to murder Fancher is still continuing, because Hill never received the $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">The reliance on <em>People v Centers, </em>141 Mich App 364; 367 NW2d 397 (1985), is misplaced. There, the \"financial arrangements\u201d concerned the division of the spoils of the crime of armed robbery. The Court of Appeals, in finding the testimony concerning the out-of-court statements of a coconspirator were <em>not </em>admissible said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-9\">No evidence suggests that any proceeds of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>crimes remained to be divided or that any other arrangements between the conspirators remained to be completed.[<footnotemark>33</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The Stevenses, in an effort to create an alibi, had left town shortly before Fancher was killed, and had left their dog with Hill. A few days after they returned, they saw Hill, possibly for no other reason than to pick up their dog. In all events, that was when Hill allegedly made the statement to the Stevenses reported by Peggy at the trial. By then, Bushard had learned that Fancher had been killed, and it appears, although the record is not specific, that the Stevenses had also learned of Fancher\u2019s death. There thus was no need to \"report back\u201d that Fancher had been killed. Nor is there any evidence that Hill agreed to report back, or that reporting back was a precondition of his entitlement to further payment.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">It is conjecture, unsupported by the record, that Hill\u2019s asserted statement to Peggy had the \"presumable\u201d goal of assuring \"that he would collect his remaining payments.\u201d Since Bushard is claimed to have been financing this conspiracy, one would expect that if the \"presumable\u201d goal of Hill making the statement was to assure that he would collect his remaining payments, there would be Some evidence that Peggy reported to Bushard what Hill is claimed to have said. The prosecutor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>made no effort to adduce from Peggy that she had reported to Bushard what she claims Hill said.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">Since there is no evidence that it was part of the conspiratorial agreement that Hill, before killing Fancher, would say to him, in effect, this is for your mistreatment of Brian and this is the way Grandma wants it, or that Hill\u2019s statement to Fancher or report back to the Stevens was to increase the likelihood that he would be paid, there is no basis in the record for a finding that what was said to have been said shortly before Fancher was killed, or the report back, was in furtherance of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">4</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">It appears that Bushard is entitled to a new trial because the statement concerning what Hill allegedly said to Fancher shortly before killing him, was not probative, was likely to confuse, mislead and prejudice the jurors, and was not within exclusion for statements of a coconspirator.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">It is not claimed that Bushard paid any amount toward the alleged price of $1,000 until November, 1985, over a month after the killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">According to Peggy Stevens, in November, 1985, Hill demanded payment of some amount in respect to the alleged $1,000 price. She said that she discouraged him from calling her mother, with whom Hill until then had no communication.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">Anna Bushard acknowledged paying $100 to Peggy Stevens in November, 1985. Peggy testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>she gave the sum received from her mother to Hill.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Bushard said that she gave the $100 to Peggy so that she could give the sum to Harold to fix Bushard\u2019s automobile. There was substantial corroboration of Bushard\u2019s testimony that her automobile had been in disrepair for over a month before Fancher was killed, that Harold was a backyard mechanic who kept the family automobiles in repair without charge for his labor, but that Bushard would have to pay for the parts.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Larry Bushard testified that his mother had borrowed $396 from him, when some money orders were lost, so that the house payment could be made, and that when the money for the lost money orders was recovered, he kept $300 and allowed his mother to have $96 so that she could have her automobile repaired. Bushard said that she added $5, put one dollar back in her purse, and then gave the $100 to Peggy Stevens.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The payment of $100 by Bushard to Peggy does not corroborate the veracity of Peggy\u2019s testimony <em>concerning the reason it was paid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">No evidence contradicts Bushard\u2019s testimony that it was paid to buy parts to repair her auto<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>mobile other than Peggy\u2019s testimony that it was paid to provide money to make the first payment to Hill. No evidence corroborates Peggy\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">With that in mind, it cannot be said that the jury would have reached the same verdict if the judge had not precluded Bushard\u2019s lawyer from examining Peggy concerning a fraudulent filing by the Stevenses of a welfare application on which they had forged Bushard\u2019s name, and from examining Peggy concerning the theft of a trailer by Hill and one or both of the Stevenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Peggy and Harold Stevens plotted with Hill to lure Fancher away from Cora Bushard and her children by having Hill pose as a trucker who would pay $80 to unload a semitrailer. If Fancher asked how Hill obtained his name, Hill was to respond that he saw his name posted at Don\u2019s Truck Stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">Hill telephoned Wednesday morning, October 2, 1985, and offered Fancher the job, which he accepted. He telephoned that night to say that the truck had broken down. It was agreed that Hill would meet Fancher Thursday night. Fancher met Hill, they drove to a secluded spot, and Fancher was killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">It appears that the idea of posting a note at Don\u2019s Truck Stop grew out of another source of conflict in the Bushard household, a shortage of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>money,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> which was exacerbated by Fancher\u2019s inability to find steady work. Fancher had an eighth-grade education and could only find part-time jobs.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Peggy Stevens and her mother <em>both </em>testified that there had been family discussions about posting a note at Don\u2019s Truck Stop stating that Fancher was looking for work unloading trucks. Such discussions, in July-August, 1985, preceded the conspiracy to murder Fancher, who was killed in early October.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Peggy testified that she, her husband Harold, and Hill decided that Hill would pose as a trucker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>responding to a note posted at Don\u2019s Truck Stop to lure Fancher from Cora and the children to a place where he could be killed. At first she could not recall whether she had informed her mother of the ruse, but, ultimately, under persistent questioning by the prosecutor, said that she had.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">The prosecutor claimed that Bushard wrote Fancher\u2019s name and phone number and gave it to Peggy as part of Bushard\u2019s role in the conspiracy. Bushard claimed that she did so in an effort to obtain work for Fancher.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The ruse, that such a note had been posted at Don\u2019s Truck Stop, depended for its success on Fancher believing that such a note had been posted. If Fancher were to inquire where Hill obtained his name, he would be told it was at the truck stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">The conspirators apparently thought that Fancher would believe that a note had been posted because of family discussion about posting such a note in an effort to find work for Fancher. Because the conspirators thought that Fancher would believe that a note had been posted, it is not surprising, and does not implicate Bushard in the conspiracy, that she knew about plans to post such a note.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">The prosecutor portrayed the plans to post a note as a conspiratorial secret. It is clear from all the evidence \u2014 including Peggy\u2019s testimony \u2014 that there were plans to post a note separate and apart <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>from the misuse of these plans to lure Fancher to his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Mary Fancher,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Rodney Fancher\u2019s mother, testified that she was at the Bushard home on Wednesday night, the night before her son was murdered. She asked how whoever called Fancher had obtained his name. Bushard responded that she had given the name and phone number to Peggy to post at Don\u2019s Truck Stop. This, the prosecutor argued to the jury, shows that Bushard was a part of the conspiracy. Otherwise, she would not have known that a note was supposed to have been posted at the truck stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">It is clear, however, from the testimony of the prosecutor\u2019s principal witness, Peggy, that there was an innocent explanation for Bushard\u2019s knowledge of the plan to post a note. Fancher had experienced difficulty in obtaining even part-time work, and there had been family discussions about posting a note at Don\u2019s Truck Stop seeking work for Fancher unloading trucks.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Peggy confirmed Bushard\u2019s assertion that there had been such discussions. Peggy testified: \"Back early that summer I think I had mentioned it [about this note about getting a job] to him [Fancher] once when he asked if I knew of a place he could pick up some work.\u201d She also confirmed that Bushard had provided her with Fancher\u2019s name and phone number before the time that it was claimed the conspiracy to kill Fancher was entered into. Other family members also confirmed that there were discussions about posting such a note at Don\u2019s Truck Stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Surmise by Bushard that a call to unload a truck was the result of Peggy Stevens\u2019 actually having posted a note at Don\u2019s Truck Stop would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>come to the mind of a person who had participated in family discussion about Peggy posting a note.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">To be sure, Cora Bushard denied that there were family discussions about the note, and the lead opinion adverts to her testimony.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Her testimony at the preliminary examination, two years before the retrial, when her memory probably was clearer, corroborated the testimony of <em>Peggy </em>and Bushard, and of her sister that there had been family discussions about posting a note at the truck stop to find work for Fancher.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>No effort was made at the trial to refresh Cora Bushard\u2019s recollection, or possibly to impeach her testimony by her testimony at the preliminary examination.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">In arguing the case to the jury, the prosecutor claimed that there was a conflict between Mary Fancher\u2019s testimony and Bushard\u2019s testimony concerning the posting of a note at Don\u2019s Truck Stop, and that this showed that Bushard was lying. \"Rhonda Howlett\u2019s<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> lying, Peggy\u2019s lying, <em>Mary Fancher\u2019s lying. Who\u2019s lying? </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">In cross-examining Bushard, the prosecutor misrepresented Mary Fancher\u2019s testimony in an apparent effort to create a conflict between Mary Fancher\u2019s testimony and Bushard\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Bushard, in her testimony on direct examination, said that she had written Fancher\u2019s name and phone number on a piece of paper and had given it to Peggy who was to post a note at Don\u2019s Truck Stop in an effort to obtain work for Fancher. Bushard thus distinguished between writing the name and phone number on a piece of paper and writing the actual note to be posted.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Mary Fancher, who testified during the prosecutor\u2019s case in chief and thus before Bushard testified, did not testify that Bushard said that she wrote the note to be posted at Don\u2019s Truck Stop. She said, rather, \"Anna spoke up and said that she had written Rodney\u2019s name and phone number on a <em>slip of paper </em>and gave it to Peggy and Harold to take and put on\u201d the bulletin board at Don\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Truck Stop. On cross-examination, she testified that Anna said that she <em>\"gave the phone number and name to Peggy.\u201d </em>She also said, \"All I know is she [Anna Bushard] put <em>Rodney\u2019s name and phone number </em>on the paper for them\u201d \"[a]nd gave it for them to put on Don\u2019s Truck Stop on the bulletin board there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Mary Fancher concluded that, as far as she knew, all that Bushard gave them was <em>\"the name and phone number and not a written note.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">It is clear that there was no real conflict. Yet the prosecutor sought to mislead Bushard in a purposeful effort to create a conflict that he could exploit before the jury \u2014 Bushard claimed that Mary Fancher, the mother of the murdered Rodney Fancher, is lying: \"Mary Fancher is lying.\u201d He could then ask the jury to conclude that Bushard was lying because Mary Fancher was telling the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">The prosecutor also misled the jury when he argued that Bushard said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-9\">I wrote the note out, and I gave it to Peggy to put up. <em>The note </em>was \u2014 this note, that was the idea <em>to get Rodney away from Cora. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">Bushard did not testify: \"I wrote the note\u201d \"to get Rodney away from Cora.\u201d The prosecutor thus, again, misled the jury concerning the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-11\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b624-12\">The lead opinion states that the jury was \"entitled to conclude that the fictional note was a ruse and that Anna\u2019s statement that the call had come in response to a note she had personally written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>and allegedly given to Peggy and Harold to post, confirmed her participation in the plot to kill Rod Fancher.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">The idea that the prosecutor apparently succeeded in implanting in the jury\u2019s mind \u2014 and which the signers of the lead opinion believe the jury might have found to be persuasive \u2014 was that when Bushard responded as she did to Mary Fancher it was a slip of the tongue, and she thereby incriminated herself by revealing something that was or should have been kept secret. Posting a note at Don\u2019s Truck Stop was not, however, a secret.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The conspirators thought Fancher would believe that a note had been posted at Don\u2019s Truck Stop. The reason they thought he would believe the ruse was because posting a note had indeed been discussed in the Bushard household and with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The plan to post a note at Don\u2019s Truck Stop does not corroborate Peggy\u2019s testimony, despite the purposeful effort to create conflict between Mary Fancher and Bushard\u2019s testimony, the minute differences in testimony, and Cora Bushard\u2019s memory lapse. There was no essential conflict in the testimony of the witnesses <em>except the con\u00f1ict concerning the reason the note was to be posted. </em>Did Bushard provide the name and telephone number <em>to \u00f1nd work for Fancher? </em>Or did she provide that information as a means of <em>luring Fancher from the house? </em>It is, again, Anna versus Peggy, a one-to-one conflict between the testimony of Bushard and Peggy.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">It cannot be said that the jury would have reached the same verdict if the judge had not precluded Bushard\u2019s lawyer from examining Peggy concerning a fraudulent filing by the Stevenses of a welfare application on which they had forged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>Bushard\u2019s name, and from examining Peggy concerning the theft of a trailer by Hill and one or both of the Stevenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">vi</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Turning to the testimony of Rhonda Howlett, she and Katherine Wright were cellmates of Anna Bushard while she was being held for trial. They were repeat offenders charged with crimes of theft of one form or another.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">I am troubled about the practice of putting a person like Anna Bushard, who had no prior involvement with the law, in a cell with such persons. Not infrequently, by the time of trial, a cellmate comes forward with testimony favorable to the prosecution.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">Until Rhonda Howlett and Katherine Wright provided testimony, the prosecutor, who had granted complete immunity to Peggy Stevens in exchange for her testimony, had nothing to corroborate Peggy Stevens\u2019 testimony other than bootstrap corroboration.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">Rhonda Howlett\u2019s testimony consists of two parts. One part consists of statements claimed to have been made by Bushard. The second part is the accusation attributed to Katherine Wright: \"Anna, you\u2019re saying that you\u2019re guilty.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">Howlett testified that Bushard made the follow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>ing statements: that \"she did not want Cora to leave\u201d her home, that she had \"given Peggy some money and that she wasn\u2019t supposed to come in contact with anyone. She was more or less in contact with Peggy,\u201d that Peggy \"was supposed to have given it [the money] to Tony,\u201d and that \"the way they planned it, it was supposed to have happened on a Wednesday, but it happened on a Thursday.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">On cross-examination, Bushard\u2019s lawyer observed that Bushard\u2019s alleged reference to \"the way <em>they </em>planned it\u201d was vague and did not necessarily mean that Bushard took part in the \"plan.\u201d Howlett\u2019s response carefully distinguished between \"we\u201d and \"they\u201d \u2014 she said that the term used was \"they.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Bushard\u2019s lawyer also inquired whether Bushard was involved in court proceedings on the day that the conversation occurred, and Howlett responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">I don\u2019t know what type of proceedings she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>involved with at all, really. All I know is she left the cell, and she went and talked to somebody and came back. I don\u2019t know what it was for or whom she talked to.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Bushard testified that at the time she was involved in pretrial proceedings while being held in jail, and that during those proceedings she learned that the murder was originally planned for Wednesday and occurred on Thursday. She said that her cellmates had newspaper accounts of Fancher\u2019s murder and talked about what they had read. She also said that she told them what she knew about the case, and that she was taken to a hearing the day the conversation took place, possibly the preliminary hearing. Bushard\u2019s lawyer argued that the statements attributed by Howlett to Bushard referred to statements by Bushard concerning what she had learned about the case while she was out of her cell that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Howlett\u2019s phrasing of Bushard\u2019s statements can be read consistently with Bushard\u2019s testimony. According to Howlett, Bushard said \"that she had given Peggy some money and that she wasn\u2019t <em>supposed </em>to come in contact with anyone. She was more or less in contact with Peggy,\u201d that Peggy \"was <em>supposed </em>to have given it [the money] to Tony.\u201d (Emphasis added.) That phrasing is consistent with the claim of Bushard\u2019s lawyer that she was relaying information she was told \u2014 but didn\u2019t know \u2014 happened. Some laypersons may use \"suppose\u201d in the same sense that others might use \"allege,\u201d to indicate that something did not occur, such as, \"I was supposed to have cleaned my room,\u201d \"Fred was supposed to have hit him,\u201d \"Supposedly, she shot him.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">Howlett denied that she had received any consideration for her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Katherine Wright testified at the first trial. She acknowledged that, in exchange for her testimony, the prosecutor had agreed not to file a supplemental information charging her as a repeat offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Katherine Wright did not testify at this trial, and the consideration that she received for her testimony was not made known to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">The prosecutor argued to the jury that <em>Howlett </em>received no consideration in exchange for her testimony. That statement was a half-truth. The portion of Howlett\u2019s testimony that he most emphasized was Wright\u2019s statement that, \"Anna, you\u2019re saying that you\u2019re guilty.\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">Wright\u2019s accusation, repeated by Howlett, is again an unsworn statement of the nature of hearsay. Wright\u2019s accusation was not offered simply to show how Bushard reacted. The accusation was offered for its probative value and was re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>peated three times during closing arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-5\">Do you know you\u2019re saying you\u2019re guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-6\">You\u2019re saying you\u2019re guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-7\">You\u2019re saying you\u2019re guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">Clearly, the prosecutor regarded the accusation as having probative value in and of itself, but nevertheless he did not inform the jury that he had granted Wright a concession regarding the length of her punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">Since Bushard\u2019s lawyer did not object to the recital of Wright\u2019s assertion regarding Bushard\u2019s complicity, the legal issue whether Wright\u2019s assertion was admissible has not been explored. On the remand that I would order, this issue could be explored and briefed.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b630-11\">The prosecutor referred to Howlett\u2019s testimony that \"the way they planned it, it was supposed to have happened on a Wednesday, but it happened on a Thursday.\u201d The prosecutor argued that Bu-shard knew about the call on Wednesday \"because she was told to expect that call. She was told it was going down Wednesday or Thursday.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-12\">There is no evidence, however, that Anna Bu-shard was told it was \"going down\u201d Wednesday or Thursday. Peggy Stevens denied that she so informed her mother. The prosecutor, who had introduced a record of phone calls, surmised that during one of several telephone conversations on Tuesday night, Peggy said, \"Mom, it\u2019s going down Wednesday or Thursday.\u201d This was surmise and speculation and contrary to Peggy Stevens\u2019 denial that she had so informed her mother. It is again noteworthy that disbelief of a witness\u2019 testimony does not constitute affirmative evidence to the contrary. The prosecutor thus made a statement, \"Mom, it\u2019s going down Wednesday or Thursday,\u201d that is contrary to the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>The prosecutor continued \"that that\u2019s supported by Rhonda Howlett?\u201d In other words, Howlett confirmed that Peggy Stevens told Bushard on Tuesday that it was \"going down\u201d Wednesday or Thursday night. That is stringing together two unconnected statements, and misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">In all events, by January or February, 1986, when Bushard is claimed to have made the statement to Howlett indicating that the murder was originally planned for Wednesday and did not \"go down\u201d until Thursday, it should have been obvious to almost everyone that the original plan was to lure Fancher away and kill him on Wednesday, and that for whatever reason, either because the truck broke down or some other reason, Hill called Fancher and canceled the plans for Wednesday night and lured him away and killed him on Thursday.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">One does not have to be the proverbial rocket scientist to conclude \u2014 from the evidence that the first phone call to Fancher was made Wednesday morning, on Wednesday night the plans were canceled and the plans were rescheduled for Thursday night, when Fancher was lured away and soon thereafter killed \u2014 that the original plan was to kill Fancher on Wednesday night, that it did not \"go down\u201d on Wednesday night, and that it \"went down\u201d on Thursday night.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Once again, the prosecutor sought to mislead, and may have misled, the jury by mischaracteriz-ing the significance of evidence about which there could have been no dispute. By January, 1986, countless persons knew that the murder had been planned originally for Wednesday night and did not occur until Thursday night. The countless persons who knew this were not coconspirators. Neither was Bushard, unless she had become part of the conspiracy to kill Fancher, and had learned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>this before Wednesday, or at some time thereafter, as a result of a conversation with Peggy. There is no evidence of any such conversation, and Peggy denied that there was such a conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">I would remand to the trial court for a <em>Ginther-</em>type hearing and would retain jurisdiction to consider, in light of such findings as the trial judge might deem appropriate, whether to order a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b632-5\">Cavanagh, C.J., and Mallett, J., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b580-8\"> No request has been made for the <em>Ginther </em>hearing suggested by the dissent, nor does defense counsel\u2019s well-presented brief at any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>point seek to reargue the facts or claim that defendant\u2019s conviction constituted a miscarriage of justice. <em>People v Ginther, </em>390 Mich 436; 212 NW2d 922 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b582-9\"> The jury asked for the rereading of Mary Fancher\u2019s and Peggy Stevens\u2019 testimony.

As correctly noted by the trial court and the Court of Appeals, the statute is not applicable because it applies to defendants and does not provide for the admission of the proposed cross-examination of a nondefendant witness. On appeal, the defendant raises the constitutional right of confrontation and the witness credibility issues. Although an objection raised at trial is insufficient to preserve an appellate attack based on a different ground, if a significant constitutional question is raised and is decisive to the outcome of the case, appellate review is appropriate. <em>People v Catey, </em>135 Mich App 714; 356 NW2d 241 (1984); <em>People v Banning, </em>329 Mich 1; 44 NW2d 841 (1950).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b584-9\"> The trial court rejected the defendant\u2019s MCL 768.27; MSA 28.1050 argument as inapplicable because Peggy Stevens was a witness and not a defendant in the case.

Because the trial court pointed out that the defense could call Tony Hill to testify, we assume the decision not to raise the MRE 804(b)(1) issue was a strategic choice based on counsel\u2019s desire to avoid the possibility of admission of other portions of Hill\u2019s testimony at the former trial, which corroborated Hill\u2019s phone calls to defendant\u2019s home on October 2, 1985, and his conversation with a woman Hill acknowledged he assumed was Anna Bushard, MRE 106.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b585-10\"> Contrary to the dissent\u2019s suggestion, the test of evidentiary error is not whether the jury \"might have found it more likely that Stevens would falsely implicate her mother . . . .\u201d Where the error is not of constitutional dimension, the inquiry is whether the defendant\u2019s conviction constituted a miscarriage of justice.

They were both convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. The Court of Appeals affirmed Hill\u2019s conviction. Bushard\u2019s conviction was reversed because the circuit judge refused to read back trial testimony to the jury. Unpublished per curiam opinion, decided May 3, 1988 (Docket Nos. 94496, 94498). Bushard was retried alone in August, 1988, and again was convicted of both charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b592-6\"> Rhonda Howlett, who, together with Katherine Wright, occupied the same cell as did Anna Bushard before the first trial, testified at the retrial concerning a conversation she, Wright, and Bushard had in January or February, 1986. Howlett said that, at the conclusion of the conversation, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-7\">And Kathy said, well, Anna, you\u2019re saying that you\u2019re guilty. And Anna says \u2014 she just shook her head, didn\u2019t say anything else.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">Bushard contends that her constitutional right to be protected against self-incrimination was violated when Howlett testified concerning Bushard\u2019s \"silence\u201d in the face of Kathy Wright\u2019s \"accusation.\u201d Bushard claims that tacit or adoptive admissions through silence are not admissible in a criminal prosecution. Bushard\u2019s lawyer did not object to Howlett\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">Howlett\u2019s testimony was not a comment on silence. Howlett, rather, related a conversation during which Bushard made a number of statements. Bushard\u2019s communicative gesture \u2014 \u201cshe just shook her head, didn\u2019t say anything else\u201d \u2014 was part of and concluded a conversation in which it is claimed Bushard participated and had responded to other questions. Bushard thus had not remained silent.

She contends that the verdict, conspiracy to commit murder, found her guilty of conspiracy to commit the common-law offense of murder, which is second-degree murder, and thus she was acquitted of first-degree murder. Therefore, she contends, she could not be retried for offenses greater than conspiracy to commit second-degree murder and second-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-12\">While there is ambiguity in the 1986 verdict form, the jury expressed its intention not to acquit her of first-degree murder when it convicted her of first-degree murder.

The Stevenses nevertheless may have told Hill that her mother would supply $1,000 or some other sum of money.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b598-7\"> Hill obtained $60 from Harold to purchase a gun, which Hill said would cost $160.

Hill told the person who lent him the gun that he needed the gun to protect his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">Peggy also testified that about a month after Fancher was killed, Hill demanded some payment with respect to the alleged price of $1,000, and that Bushard paid $100, which was transmitted to Hill. Bushard acknowledged that she gave Peggy $100, but said that this was to be transmitted to Harold Stevens, who was a backyard mechanic, and that he was to use the $100 to purchase parts to fix Bushard\u2019s automobile, which had been in disrepair for some time. This is discussed further in part iv.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b598-9\"> After Fancher was killed, Hill was involved in an accident that was investigated by the police. It appears that he was apprehensive that the police investigation would lead to his apprehension for the murder of Fancher. On the day of the accident and police inquiry, he hurriedly sold the motorcycle for $200 cash. Because the sale was arranged so urgently, it appears that the motorcycle may have been worth more than $200.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b600-9\"> Bushard testified that she responded that \"that wouldn\u2019t do any good . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b600-10\"> In order to convict Anna Bushard, one has to conclude that the concept of resort to violence, which Peggy Stevens acknowledged she and her husband were considering, was something that Anna Bu-shard was ready to accept when suggested by Peggy, and even to go one major step beyond what Peggy said she and her husband were at first prepared to do. Stated differently, Peggy and Harold are two ne\u2019er-do-wells who were prepared to beat up their sister\u2019s boyfriend because of jealousy or competition regarding her son Brian, to ruin her opportunity for happiness, who, in fact, hired the killer. Peggy then testified, in exchange for immunity, that her mother, not Tony Hill, came up with the idea of escalating a \"thumping\u201d or \u201cbeating up\u201d to murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-11\">In this connection, it is noteworthy that there were a number of reputation witnesses who spoke well of Anna Bushard\u2019s reputation for truthfulness. She had six children and eight grandchildren. After her husband died, she raised the children on her own, and had never been involved in any conflict with the law, and had no prior record.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-12\">Peggy and Harold Stevens, in contrast, had lived on the edge, and, it appears, were thieves.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b601-8\"><em> Ante, </em>p 387.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b601-9\"> Why would Peggy Stevens lie about her mother\u2019s involvement in a murder and a conspiracy to commit murder? That\u2019s one of the questions you need to answer, I think. Why would she lie, if she is? I submit when she started talking about it and you think it through, there\u2019s no reason for her to lie at that time, none that makes sense, none that makes sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">And Peggy Stevens? Well, let\u2019s see if her motive is to get immunity, there\u2019s a problem, though, ladies and gentlemen. It\u2019s not as easy. There\u2019s no easy answer there. She included her mom before any immunity? She said nothing. She had a couple talks. And as stated by Kowalski, I\u2019ll take it to the Prosecutor, but I can\u2019t promise anything. And that\u2019s on Saturday the day before. And, yet, she still talks about her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-11\">You know, you can probably figure out through the testimony you\u2019ve heard, since they talked about immunity the day before on Saturday. Sergeant Kowalski knew the hitman, Tony Hill, because all the time they had the phone records showing the phone calls to Tony Hill and Tony Hill\u2019s phone calls to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Bushard \u2014 Anna Bushard\u2019s house. That\u2019s what they really had at the time was Tony Hill. They didn\u2019t have this.</p>\n<p id=\"ale-dedup-0\">You heard the testimony. Kowalski didn\u2019t get the murder weapon until June of \u201986. They didn\u2019t have a way to definitely tie Tony Hill into that murder. So you can probably determine that Sergeant Kowalski was looking at immunity for Peggy based on the statements you\u2019ve heard from Tony H\u00dc1.</p>\n<p id=\"A7J\">Well, what happens? She throws in her mother? And, again, we\u2019re still at the point she has no immunity. She has nothing, yet. You can say, well, she had to testify, because otherwise she could be prosecuted. That\u2019s true. That\u2019s why she testified. But why include her mom before? They didn\u2019t have any evidence against Anna Bushard at that time. They didn\u2019t say, you give us your mom and we\u2019ll give you immunity. It was not that.</p>\n<p id=\"A2h\">We come right back again to why would she lie?

There was, however, little if any evidence, other than the shortage of money, that would support such a theory. The prosecutor did not argue this theory to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">Bushard denied that she was aware of Fancher\u2019s and Cora Bu-shard\u2019s plans to marry. It is a well-established principle that disbelief of a witness is not affirmative evidence of the contrary. Thus, disbelief of Cora Bushard\u2019s assertion that Anna Bushard had not been informed of her plan to marry Fancher and move away, does not constitute affirmative evidence that Anna Bushard had been informed of their plans to marry and move away, or that, when she was so informed, she became upset.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">Cora testified that she confided their plans only to her brother, Larry.

However, I do not believe that it warrants reversal of the defendant\u2019s conviction. Nor do I believe that this Court, sua sponte, should remand this case to the trial court for a <em>Ginther </em>hearing. <em>People v Gin-ther, </em>390 Mich 436; 212 NW2d 922 (1973). Thus, I concur with Justice Boyle that the defendant\u2019s conviction should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">The defendant had the constitutional right to cross-examine Peggy Stevens and to inquire into her truthfulness and credibility. As the United States Supreme Court stated in <em>Davis v Alaska, </em>415 US 308, 316; 94 S Ct 1105; 39 L Ed 2d 347 (1974):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-8\">Cross-examination is the principal means by which the believability of a witness and the truth of his testimony are tested. ... A more particular attack on the witness\u2019 credibility is effected by means of cross-examination directed toward revealing possible biases, prejudices, or ulterior motives of the witness as they may relate directly to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>issues or personalities in the case at hand. The partiality of a witness is subject to exploration at trial, and is \"always relevant as discrediting the witness and affecting the weight of his testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">Exploration of the allegation that Stevens had previously engaged in welfare fraud and had involved the defendant in that fraud could have aided the defense in its attempts to show that Stevens not only was a dishonest person, but also was willing to implicate her mother in a crime. Thus, I agree that the evidence should have been admitted, and the fact that it was not infringed upon the defendant\u2019s constitutional right of confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The lead opinion states that \"[w]here the error is not of constitutional dimension, the inquiry is whether the defendant\u2019s conviction constituted a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 391, n 7. Because I believe that the error is of constitutional dimension, I believe that the proper test is stated in the Court of Appeals opinion in <em>People v Catey, </em>135 Mich App 714; 356 NW2d 241 (1984). In the absence of preservation, if a constitutional question regarding the admissability of evidence is raised, we must determine whether it is decisive of the outcome of the case. See <em>id.; People v Banning, </em>329 Mich 1; 44 NW2d 841 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">I do not believe that the failure to allow this cross-examination was decisive of the outcome. The jury already knew that Peggy Stevens was receiving complete immunity for her testimony. This showed that Stevens had a motive to fabricate and that she was biased. It heard her admission that she participated in the planning of a murder. However, it still chose to believe her testimony that the defendant was a part of the conspiracy to kill the decedent. Thus, I do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>believe that the failure to allow cross-examination regarding the alleged welfare fraud warrants reversal of the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">As for the question whether Stevens\u2019 testimony about what Tony Hill said to the decedent before killing him fell under the coconspirator exception to the hearsay rule, I agree with Justice Levin that this issue was not properly preserved at trial, and I find that review of it is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">I would affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b634-6\">Riley, J., concurred with Brickley, J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
