KAPLAN, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b277-13\">This putative class action concerns mortgage pass-through certificates (the \u201cCertificates\u201d) issued by IndyMac MBS, Inc. (\u201cIndyMac MBS\u201d) in ten offerings pursuant to two registration statements and related prospectuses and prospectus supplements (the \u201cOffering Documents\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Lead Plaintiffs Wyoming State Treasurer and Wyoming Retirement System allege that the Certificates were issued pursuant to materially misleading Offering Documents in violation of Sections 11, 12(a)(2), and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The matter is before the Court on Lead Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification, appointment as class representatives, and appointment of class counsel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-14\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b277-15\">\n<em>I. The Parties</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b277-16\">\n<em>A. Lead Plaintiffs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b277-17\">Lead Plaintiffs were appointed on July 29, 2009.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Wyoming State Treasurer manages more than $10 billion in non-pension fund assets.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Wyoming Retirement System administers retirement programs.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Lead Plaintiffs allegedly purchased or acquired Certificates in the ten offerings pursuant and/or traceable to the Registration Statements.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-18\">\n<em>B. Defendants</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b277-19\">The three groups of defendants still party to this case include IndyMac MBS, the Individual Defendants, and the Underwriter Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>IndyMac MBS was a wholly-owned subsidiary of IndyMac Bank, F.S.B. (\u201cIndyMac Bank\u201d), which was closed by the FDIC on July 11, 2008, and is not a party to this case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> IndyMac MBS was the registrant of the securities covered by the Offering Documents.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">The Individual Defendants are IndyMac MBS\u2019s former officers and directors.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Each signed at least one of the Registration Statements.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The Underwriter Defendants are six financial institutions, all of whom were underwriters in the offerings and all of whom are alleged to have participated in drafting and disseminating the Offering Documents.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">\n<em>II. The Certificates</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\"><em>A </em>Certificate is a type of mortgage backed security that entitles its owner to a portion of the revenue stream generated by an underlying pool of mortgage loans,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> all of which were originated or acquired by IndyMac Bank.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> These loans then were transferred to IndyMac MBS, which bundled them into mortgage pools and transferred them to trusts.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The trusts issued the Certificates to IndyMac MBS,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> which sold them to the Underwriter Defendant(s), which in turn offered them to investors.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-18\">The Certificates\u2019 ratings have declined since their initial offerings, and the percentage of loans in the pools underlying each Certif\u00edcate that has defaulted is alleged to have increased as well.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-19\">\n<em>III. The Second Amended Consolidated Complaint</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b278-20\">The SACC<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> alleges violations of Sections 11, 12(a)(2,) and 15 of the Securities Act, based on Wyoming\u2019s claims that the Offering Documents misled purchasers of the Certificates by stating that IndyMac Bank evaluated information about borrowers\u2019 income, assets, and employment.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Relying heavily on two independent reports,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Wyoming alleges that these statements were false and misleading because IndyMac Bank actually had abandoned its underwriting standards and instead had \u201crapidly approved\u201d mortgage loans \u201cto people with poor credit or those who did not have the ability to repay the loans.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This allegedly made the Certificates \u201cfar riskier than represented ... [and] not equivalent to other investments with the same credit rating.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Wyoming alleges that borrowers defaulted <em>on </em>the <em>mortgage </em>loans <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>underlying the Certificates and that the value of the Certificates decreased.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Credit ratings agencies subsequently downgraded the Certificates\u2019 ratings to \u201cjunk.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">\n<em>IV. Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">On May 14, 2009 and June 29, 2009, respectively, Plaintiff Police and Fire Retirement System of the City of Detroit (\u201cDetroit\u201d) and Wyoming filed similar class action complaints.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Various parties moved to be appointed lead plaintiff and to consolidate the two actions.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The Court named Wyoming as lead plaintiff, granted the motion to consolidate, and ordered the filing of a consolidated class complaint.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Wyoming then filed the Amended Consolidated Complaint (\u201cACC\u201d) on Octobei\"29, 2009.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The Court later ruled on defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss the ACC, significantly narrowing the scope of this litigation.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> It dismissed claims as to all but the ten offerings in which Wyoming allegedly had purchased Certificates, holding that those were the only offerings with respect to which Wyoming had standing to sue. The only substantive claims set forth in the SACC that were allowed to proceed were the Section 11, 12(a)(2), and 15 claims based on IndyMac Bank\u2019s alleged abandonment of its underwriting standards.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Plaintiffs City of Philadelphia Board of Pensions and Retirement (\u201cPhiladelphia\u201d) and Detroit moved to intervene as to certain offerings which Wyoming had not purchased and as to which Wyoming\u2019s claims therefore had been dismissed.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The Court granted these motions in part and denied them in part, and Philadelphia and Detroit intervened as to three additional offerings.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Lead Plaintiffs then filed the SACC on August 15, 2011, adding Philadelphia and Detroit as plaintiffs-intervenors, but otherwise leaving the substance of the allegations unchanged.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-17\">\n<em>V. The Present Motion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b279-18\">Wyoming moves for an order certifying the following proposed class:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-19\">\u201cAll persons or entities who purchased or otherwise acquired beneficial interests in Certificates offered to the public in 10 Offerings (\u2018Offerings\u2019) ... pursuant or traceable to IndyMac MBS Registrations Statements dated February 24, 2006, as amended and/or February 14, 2007, as amended (\u201cRegistration Statements\u201d) ... and the Prospectuses and Prospectus Supplements issued thereunder for the Offerings and incorporated by reference (collectively, with the Registration Statements, the \u2018Offering Documents\u2019) and who were damaged thereby (the \u2018Class\u2019).\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AS2\">Wyoming moves also to be appointed class representatives and, pursuant to Rule 23(g), for approval of its counsel, Berman DeValerio, as class counsel.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Defendants oppose the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>motion, principally by asserting that. Wyoming has failed to satisfy Rule 23(b)(3)\u2019s requirements of predominance and superiority-</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\n<em>I. Legal Standards</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Before certifying a class, a district court is obliged to conduct a \u201crigorous analysis\u201d to determine whether the plaintiffs have satisfied all of the Rule 23(a) and Rule 23(b)(3) requirements.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> It \u201cmay certify a class only after [it] ... resolves factual disputes relevant to each Rule 23 requirement and finds that whatever underlying facts are relevant to a particular Rule 23 requirement have been established and is persuaded to rule, based on the relevant facts and the applicable legal standard, that the requirement is met.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The burden of demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that these requirements have been met, moreover, rests with the moving party.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Nevertheless, courts in this and other districts have held that suits alleging violations of Sections II, 12(a)(2), and 15 of the Securities Act are \u201cespecially amenable\u201d to class action certification and resolution.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">\n<em>II. Rule 28(a) Requirements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A-P\">The prerequisites to any class certification are that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-16\">\u201c(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class, (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class, and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-17\">\n<em>A. Numerosity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b280-18\">Rule 23(a)\u2019s first requirement, numerosity, generally is presumed \u201cat a level of 40 members,\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> and may be found where \u201cthe number of class members is sufficiently large so that joinder ... would make litigation needlessly complicated and inefficient.\u201d <footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Numerosity is appropriately found where \u201cthe joinder of all [class] members is impracticable.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Moreover, decisions in this district have concluded that a class may be certified even where certain sub-groups of that class do not meet the presumptive 40-member requirement.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-19\">Here, Wyoming has demonstrated that there are \u201cat least 714 unique investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Certificates in the 10 Offerings.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Defendants\u2019 own expert has indicated that there were at least 40 investors in all but two of the offerings,<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> 39 potential members in another, and 22 in the final.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>In this ease, it would be impractical to deny certification on the basis that two of the offerings in question did not meet the 40-member presumption level\u2014especially given that one of them is short, if at all, by just one member. There are more than 700 members in the class. Denying class certification for lack of numerosity in all the circumstances would present a considerable strain with no commensurate benefit. The numerosity requirement is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">\n<em>B. Commonality, Typicality, and Adequacy of Representation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The requirements of commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation are closely related.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Commonality is satisfied where a single issue of law or fact is common to the class.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> It is \u201cplainly satisfied\u201d in a securities case where \u201cthe alleged misrepresentations in the prospectus relate to all the investors, [because the] existence and materiality of such misrepresentations obviously present important common issues.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Typicality is satisfied where \u201ceach class member\u2019s claim arises from the same course of events and each class member makes similar legal arguments to prove the defendant\u2019s liability.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> So long as the \u201cplaintiffs assert ... that defendants committed the same wrongful acts in the same manner, against all members of the class, they establish the necessary typicality.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-12\">The adequacy of representation requirement is met where \u201c(1) plaintiffs interests are [not] antagonistic to the interest of other members of the class and (2) plaintiffs attorneys are qualified, experienced and able <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>to conduct the litigation.\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> It generally requires \u201cstrong evidence\u201d that the class representative\u2019s \u201cinterests are not antagonistic to those of the class.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">As with many other securities class actions, this ease turns on the central issue of whether certain statements and non-disclosures common to the Offering Documents rose to the level of material misrepresentations or omissions.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Plaintiffs here allege that (1) \u201cIndyMac Bank originated and/or acquired the risky mortgage loans that Indy-Mac MBS then bundled together into mortgage pools,\u201d (2) \u201c[p]ursuant to the Offering Documents, the IndyMac Entities [and] the Underwriter Defendants ... solicited, sold and distributed\u201d the offerings, and (3) \u201c[t]he Offering Documents contain untrue statements of material fact, omit to state material facts required to be stated therein, or omit to state material facts necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Previous instances of similar claims readily have been found to meet the requirements of commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Defendants\u2019 arguments that these requirements have not been met here focus on three assertions: (1) no named plaintiff has standing to assert claims with respect to one offering and the claims as to that offering must be dismissed, (2) Wyoming delegated investment decisions to parties who had direct meetings with IndyMac, subjecting it to unique defenses, and (3) Wyoming is subject to unique issues regarding materiality and damages.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> Defendants assert that these considerations are sufficient to defeat a finding of typicality, commonality, or adequacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-14\">Defendants\u2019 first argument regards Wyoming\u2019s standing to pursue claims as to offering INDX 2006-AR11 (\u201cAR11\u201d). A party does not have standing to bring a Section 12(a)(2) claim where it purchased the security in a private or secondary market.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Here, Wyoming purchased AR11 Certificates ten months after the initial offering and admits that it did so \u201cin the secondary market.\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> It therefore lacks standing to bring a Section 12(a)(2) claim as to AR11. The Court previously determined that Wyoming is time-barred from pursuing a Section 11 claim as to this same offering.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Accordingly, Wyoming does not have a valid claim with respect to this offering under either Section 11 or Section 12(a)(2).<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> While it is true generally, as Wyoming notes, that a lead plaintiff \u201ccan represent class members with section 12(a)(2) claims despite the fact that it only has section 11 claims,\u201d<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> or <em>vice versa, </em>that rule, if it may be so characterized, does not apply to this case. Wyoming cannot represent class members who purchased AR11 because it does not have any viable Securities Act claim as to that offering. Because no named plaintiff has a claim regarding AR11, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>all claims based on that offering are dismissed from this action. This of course does not affect the propriety of class certification as to the other nine offerings.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Defendants\u2019 second argument is that Wyoming\u2019s delegation of many or all of its investment decisions to investment ad-visors subject it to unique defenses. Questions as to what Lead Plaintiffs or their investment advisors knew as a result of meetings with IndyMac, however, \u201care insufficient to defeat\u201d a finding that commonality, typicality, or adequacy have been met \u201cbecause the nature of the claims that Plaintiffs must prove remains unchanged.\u201d<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> The commonality, typicality, and adequacy requirements may be met in a securities class action based on something as simple as a commonly alleged \u201cdisregard of underwriting guidelines.\u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> Whether or not investors\u2019 knowledge levels varied does not change the fundamental nature of the claims in the SACC that the Offering Documents were materially misleading.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">Finally, defendants argue that the issues Wyoming faces in demonstrating materiality and damages are unique and defeat a finding of commonality, typicality, or adequacy. The argument ignores that materiality for Securities Act claims is an issue subject to generalized proof.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> Similarly, damages in Securities Act claims are calculated based on a statutory formula,<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> so any differences in damages awards do not defeat class certification, particularly where, as here, they are \u201cmerely speculative.\u201d<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> \u201c[A] common course of conduct and a unitary legal theory for the entire class period\u201d is alleged, namely that the Offering Documents contain materially misleading statements or omissions, and commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation are satisfied.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-12\">\n<em>III. Rule 23(b)(3) Requirements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Axx\">\n<em>A. Predominance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b283-13\">Class-wide issues predominate \u201cif resolution of some of the legal or factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>questions that qualify each class member\u2019s case as a genuine controversy can be achieved through generalized proof, and if these particular issues are more substantial than the issues subject only to individualized proof.\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">While predominance requires a more rigorous showing than does commonality or typicality, it \u201cdoes not require a plaintiff to show that there are no individual issues.\u201d<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> Rather, \u201c[i]n determining whether common questions of fact predominate, a court\u2019s inquiry is directed primarily toward whether the issue of liability is common to members of the class.\u201d<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> Where issues of liability are \u201ccommon to the class, common questions are held to predominate over individual questions.\u201d<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> In determining whether the predominance requirement has been met, courts must consider both affirmative claims and potential defenses.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">\n<em>1. Relevant Legal Standards</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">To bring a successful claim under Section 11 of the Securities Act, a plaintiff must prove that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-7\">\u201c(1) she purchased a registered security, either directly <em>from </em>the issuer <em>or </em>in the aftermarket following the offering; (2) the defendant participated in the offering in a manner sufficient to give rise to liability under section 11; and (3) the registration statement \u2018contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>77</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-15\">The elements of a Section 12 claim are that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-16\">\u201c(1) the defendant is a \u2018statutory seller\u2019; (2) the sale was effectuated \u2018by means of a prospectus or oral communication\u2019; and (3) the prospectus or oral communication \u2018include[s] an untrue statement of a material fact or omit[s] to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>78</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-17\">Section 12 therefore offers parties a means of recovery against any \u201cstatutory seller\u201d whereas Section 11 is available against \u201coffering participants.\u201d<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> Liability under both provisions is limited in scope, but strict where applicable.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-18\">Section 15 liability is derivative of liability under Section 11 and/or Section 12(a)(2).<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> Where a plaintiff does not have a viable Section 11 or Section 12 claim, a Section 15 claim must fail as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-19\">Defendants facing Securities Act claims have several available defenses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Section 11 or 12(a)(2) claim will not succeed where a defendant shows that \u201cthe plaintiff knew of the untruth or omission at the time or his or her acquisition of the security.\u201d<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> Defendants similarly may avoid liability where they prove that a plaintiff had actual or inquiry notice of the materially misleading statements or omissions more than a year before its claims were filed.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfF\">Defendants may show also that a Section 11 claim against an underwriter was brought by a plaintiff who \u201cacquired the security after the issuer ha[d] made generally available to its security holders an earning statement covering a period of at least 12 months beginning after the effective date of the registration statement.\u201d<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> Such a showing then requires the plaintiff to demonstrate reliance on the material misstatement or omission alleged, which otherwise would be unnecessary.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7X\">Underwriter defendants may avoid Section 11 and Section 12(a)(2) liability as well by demonstrating that they conducted due diligence on the offerings that they underwrote and believed based on reasonable grounds that the statements alleged to be false were not misleading and that there were no material omissions.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5V\">Finally, a Securities Act defendant may avoid liability by showing that the loss of a security\u2019s value was due to something other than the alleged misrepresentation or omission.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-13\">\n<em>2. The Present Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b285-14\">Wyoming asserts that predominance may be found here because the SACC alleges \u201cviolations of Section 11 and Section 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act\u201d and that \u201cto prove [these] claims, Lead Plaintiffs and the Class must prove that [defendants made untrue statements or omissions that were material. These issues predominate in this case and can be demonstrated on a class-wide basis.\u201d <footnotemark>88</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-15\">Defendants\u2019 primary arguments that predominance has not been met here are that there are individual issues regarding (1) investor knowledge, (2) inquiry or actual notice by certain plaintiffs that would implicate the statute of limitations, and (3) investor reliance stemming from the issuance of certain trustee reports. They argue also that individual issues regarding liability and damages for prospective class members who purchased the offerings at different times pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>dominate.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">Defendants here, as in <em>Tsereteli v. Residential Asset Securitization Trust 2008-A8,</em><footnotemark><em>90</em></footnotemark><em> </em>focus their arguments on the reasoning of <em>New Jersey Carpenters Health Fund v. Residential Capital, LLC,</em><footnotemark><em>91</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which denied certification of two classes in related MBS Securities Act cases based in large part on the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to demonstrate that the predominance requirement had been met. The court there held that inferences of disparities in knowledge within the two proposed classes sufficed to defeat predominance.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> Defendants\u2019 reliance on <em>New Jersey Carpenters, </em>however, is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">\n<em>i. Knowledge and Notice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Defendants\u2019 first arguments center on assertions that (1) certain class members had individual knowledge of the defendants\u2019 alleged misstatements and omissions at the time they purchased their Certificates, and (2) there likely are individualized statute of limitations issues arising from actual or inquiry notice available at some time after class members purchased their respective Certificates.<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> They state that \u201c[p]laintiffs and their expert are conspicuously silent on the issue of investor knowledge.\u201d<footnotemark>94</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-15\">Defendants ignore the fact that knowledge is an affirmative defense, not a required element of a Securities Act claim. In order to defeat predominance on this basis, defendants must provide evidence that certain class members had differing levels of knowledge regarding the misleading nature of the statements or omissions when they invested sufficient to outweigh common issues.<footnotemark>95</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-16\">Defendants argue that Wyoming and other prospective class members likely had knowledge or notice of the alleged materially misleading nature of the Offering Documents. They rely first on Wyoming\u2019s categorization of the class as consisting of many \u201csophisticated and/or institutional investors.\u201d<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> They contend also that some prospective class members had the benefit of or themselves were investment advisors,<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> that some investigated the general \u201cdegradation of underwriting standards,\u201d<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> and that certain of them even predicted as early as 2005 that the housing market bubble would burst.<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> They claim as well that certain prospective class <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>members\u2014particularly Western Asset Management Company (\u201cWAMCO\u201d) and Pacific Investment Management Company, LLC (\u201cPIMCO\u201d)\u2014obtained information from IndyMac Bank about such issues as its loan underwriting guidelines.<footnotemark>100</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Investor sophistication does not alone defeat a finding of predominance in a class action.<footnotemark>101</footnotemark> Further, while demonstrating that certain class members are sophisticated investors may indicate that these class members were familiar with the MBS market and even understood that there were varying standards for and exceptions to underwriting guidelines used in the industry generally and by IndyMac Bank in particular, it does not establish that any prospective class member likely knew or had notice that the Offering Documents contained misstatements or omissions about IndyMac Bank\u2019s adherence to underwriting standards for the Certificates at issue in this case. Rather, the record indicates only that certain parties may have understood that there were problems with the declining quality of investments and with underwriting guidelines in the MBS sector as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Defendants point also to news stories and complaints filed in other courts, some of which discussed MBS and the housing market generally and some IndyMac Bank specifically.<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> They allege that these documents likely gave class members knowledge or notice of the allegedly misleading statements and omissions in the Offering Documents. But this does not defeat a finding of predominance either.<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> The only news articles cited that mention IndyMac Bank do not discuss the Certificates, the Offering Documents, or any of the facts that are the bases of the SACC. The same is true of the lawsuits cited, which are of two varieties. The first group was brought against certain prospective class members in this case.<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> Those lawsuits indicate, at best, that a few prospective class members previously were alleged to have disregarded their <em>own </em>underwriting guidelines. The second variety is a lawsuit filed in March 2007 against IndyMac Bancorp, Inc.<footnotemark>105</footnotemark> that alleged, among other things, that IndyMac Bank had \u201cloosened its underwriting guidelines.\u201d<footnotemark>106</footnotemark> But that complaint made claims under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and did not claim that IndyMac Bank had made material misstatements about its adherence to its underwriting guidelines. Nor did it refer to the Certificates or Offering Documents at issue in this case. In any event, these lawsuits all were publically available and therefore raise issues\u2014if any\u2014principally of knowledge, actual or constructive, subject to generalized proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-12\">The record before this Court therefore differs from that in <em>New Jersey Carpenters, </em>where the district court identified what it felt were specific statements by certain class members demonstrating individual knowledge of the structure of the underlying loans and certain underwriting guidelines set forth in relevant offering documents.<footnotemark>107</footnotemark> Moreover, as this Court already has noted, while the Second Circuit affirmed the denial of class certification in <em>New Jersey Carpenters, </em>it pointed out that \u201canother inference could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>have been drawn\u201d in that case but that the Circuit was not \u201callowed to second-guess the trial court\u2019s choice between permissible competing inferences.\u201d<footnotemark>108</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">The Court finds in this ease that the record before it does not contain enough evidence that any prospective class member or members likely knew or had notice of the alleged misstatements or omissions in the Offering Documents.<footnotemark>109</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">\n<em>ii. Reliance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">While Section 11 plaintiffs generally are presumed to have relied on allegedly false and misleading statements in offering documents, this presumption does not exist where the plaintiff \u201cacquired the security after the issuer has made generally available to its security holders an earning statement covering a period of at least 12 months beginning after the effective date of the registration statement.\u201d<footnotemark>110</footnotemark> Defendants argue that the class \u201cincludes investors who purchased certificates in 2008 and 2009, well after the initial offerings of the certificates.\u201d<footnotemark>111</footnotemark> Thus, they contend, \u201cinvestors who purchased more than a year after the initial offerings\u201d each will be required to show that they relied on certain trustee reports that were issued to accompany the offerings.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">As several courts already have held, the \u201cfactual premise of Defendant\u2019s argument is flawed.\u201d<footnotemark>112</footnotemark> Only reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, 20-F, 40-F, and 6-K, and annual reports made pursuant to Rule 14a-3 of the Exchange Act, are earning statements under the statute.<footnotemark>113</footnotemark> Accordingly, defendants have not shown that any class member is not entitled to the presumption of reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">\n<em>Hi. Damages and Liability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b288-12\">Defendants argue also that individual issues predominate because the various Certificates were issued pursuant to different Offering Documents and underwriting guidelines, resulting in individualized issues of damages and liability for different class members. These arguments are addressed in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-13\">\n<em>a. Falsity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b288-14\">Defendants first argue that the various offerings were backed by different loan groups and that \u201cdeviations from underwriting standards may have occurred with respect to loans in some loan groups, but not others.\u201d<footnotemark>114</footnotemark> Further, they assert that the Certificates each were originated under \u201cdifferent loan documentation programs,\u201d have performed differently, were subject to differing underwriting guidelines, and that each Certificate therefore will require individual consideration to determine if the pertinent offering documents contained materially mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>leading statements and omissions.<footnotemark>115</footnotemark> The SACC, however, alleges that the disclosures at issue for the offerings are \u201cuniform,\u201d and have impacted all of the offerings similarly.<footnotemark>116</footnotemark> Defendants have pointed to no substantial differences among the underwriting guidelines that applied to each group of loans, alleging only that the question of whether IndyMac Bank deviated from those guidelines \u201cmay\u201d have a different answer for some loan groups than for others.<footnotemark>117</footnotemark> Defendants\u2019 own expert, moreover, stated that he \u201cpresumed\u201d that the underwriting guidelines would be the same across different loans and offerings.<footnotemark>118</footnotemark> Wyoming, on the other hand, has provided evidence that the allegedly misleading statements in the Offering Documents about the underwriting standards were substantially similar.<footnotemark>119</footnotemark> It asserts also that the underwriting standards themselves were the similar across offerings.<footnotemark>120</footnotemark> Thus, to the extent plaintiffs are able to show that the statements or omissions regarding IndyMac Bank\u2019s adherence it its underwriting standards were false, the record indicates that this issue will be one subject to generalized proof.<footnotemark>121</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">Courts in this and other districts have found that such substantial similarity of the allegedly misleading statements in Offering Documents is sufficient for class certification, even where class members purchased different offerings at different times.<footnotemark>122</footnotemark> Issues related to falsity therefore do not defeat a finding of predominance in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-13\">\n<em>b. Materiality</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b289-14\">Defendants next argue that there are individualized issues of materiality sufficient to defeat predominance. These arguments overlook the fact that materiality in a case like this is determined on an objective rather than a subjective basis. It is established where \u201cthe defendants\u2019 representations, taken together and in context, would have misled a reasonable investor.\u201d<footnotemark>123</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>\u201c[W]hat a \u2018reasonable person\u2019 would have known, and when, can be proven on a class-wide basis.\u201d<footnotemark>124</footnotemark> Whether a misstatement or omission was material therefore presents a common rather than an individual issue.<footnotemark>125</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">c. <em>Due Diligence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Defendants argue that there \u201cwere different underwriters for each of the 10 offerings,\u201d a fact giving rise to individualized questions regarding whether each \u201cunderwriter adequately performed due diligence on a given offering.\u201d<footnotemark>126</footnotemark> Granted. But these individualized questions are not as to matters that must be proved by each class member. They are defenses that could prove unique to each underwriter. Thus, as alleged, this defense would not require individual plaintiffs to make separate showings. In any case, \u201cquestions of law or fact common to class members predominate\u201d<footnotemark>127</footnotemark> regardless of any individualized proof with respect to underwriter due diligence defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">\n<em>d. Loss Causation and Damages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AXh\">Finally, defendants assert that both the affirmative defense of loss causation<footnotemark>128</footnotemark> and damages calculations for each class member further undermine plaintiffs\u2019 arguments that common questions predominate.<footnotemark>129</footnotemark> Issues regarding individualized damages calculations generally, however, are \u201cnot sufficient to defeat class certification.\u201d <footnotemark>130</footnotemark> Furthermore, at least one court has rejected the argument that loss causation issues defeat predominance for class certification purposes.<footnotemark>131</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-15\">The Court is convinced that issues subject to generalized proof significantly predominate over any individualized considerations that are likely to arise in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-16\">\n<em>B. Superiority</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b290-17\">Finally, Wyoming must show that resolving this dispute as a class action would be superior to other means.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-18\">This consideration focuses on \u201c(A) the class members\u2019 interests in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions; (B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already begun by or against class members; (C) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum; and (D) the likely difficulties in managing a class action.\u201d<footnotemark>132</footnotemark> \u201cIn general, securities suits ... easily satisfy the superiority requirement of Rule 23.\u201d<footnotemark>133</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-19\">Requiring the prospective class members to bring individual actions, seek joinder, or else sit on their claims, would be inefficient. Smaller investors who were not allowed to partake in a class action would be unlikely to have the resources or the incentive to bring individual suits.<footnotemark>134</footnotemark> Further, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>parties are aware of no investors pursuing individual claims regarding these same offerings.<footnotemark>135</footnotemark> Rather, of the investors that have come forward since the Court\u2019s June 21, 2010 opinion on the motions to dismiss, all of them have sought to intervene, rather than file separate individual actions.<footnotemark>136</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Defendants argue that a class action would not be superior to individual suits because certain of the prospective class members are \u201csophisticated and/or institutional investors.\u201d <footnotemark>137</footnotemark> This alone does not suffice to undermine a finding of superiority.<footnotemark>138</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Defendants argue also that the superiority requirement has not been met because \u201c[p]laintiffs\u2019 proposed class includes foreign' entities.\u201d<footnotemark>139</footnotemark> While certain prospective class members here are foreign, a factor which can \u201ccounsel[] against a finding that the class action is superior to other forms of litigation,\u201d this is \u201cnot dispositive.\u201d<footnotemark>140</footnotemark> Where, as here, defendants do not identify which foreign entities\u2019 home countries would not give preclusive effects to this action, this argument carries little weight.<footnotemark>141</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">The Court is persuaded that concentrating this dispute in a class action in a single forum has clear benefits that outweigh any issues raised by defendants. Allowing this matter to proceed as a class action would avoid the \u201crisk of inconsistent adjudication\u201d and encourage \u201cthe fair and efficient use of the judicial system.\u201d<footnotemark>142</footnotemark> The Court can find no difficulties \u201clikely to be encountered in the management of this action as a class action apart from those inherent in any hard fought battle where substantial sums are at issue and all active parties are represented by able counsel.\u201d<footnotemark>143</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-16\">The Court has considered defendants\u2019 additional arguments and finds them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-17\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b291-18\">Wyoming\u2019s motion to certify the class, and for appointment as class representative and of class counsel [DI 276] is hereby granted, except that class certification is denied with respect to offering INDX 2006-AR11.

Goldman Sachs, </em>No. 09 Civ. 1110(HB), DI 139, the Court is mindful that there is some ambiguity in the law regarding the standard for determining whether the predominance requirement has been met in a Securities Act class action due to individualized knowledge defenses. The defendants in <em>Goldman Sachs </em>argue that a finding of predominance can be defeated where defendants show that it is \"likely\u201d that certain class members had knowledge. They argue that the district court has erred in requiring them to demonstrate that there in fact were certain plaintiffs who had knowledge. This Court declines to reach this issue, as it is immaterial to the outcome of this motion. Under either standard, the Court is convinced that defendants in this case have not demonstrated adequately that any asserted knowledge or notice defense is sufficient to defeat a finding of predominance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"110\">\n<p id=\"b288-16\">. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77k(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"111\">\n<p id=\"b288-17\">.
