Koltz appeal from an order of the Supreme Court, Dutchess County (Brands, J.), dated December 24, 2012, which granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">Ordered that the order is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-12\">\u201cIn moving for summary judgment in an action to foreclose a mortgage, a plaintiff establishes its case as a matter of law through the production of the mortgage, the unpaid note, and evidence of default\u201d <em>(Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v Webster, </em>61 AD3d 856, 856 [2009] [internal quotation marks and brackets omitted]). Here, the plaintiff sustained its initial burden of demonstrating its entitlement to judgment as a matter of law by producing the note and the mortgage, and submitting evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>default in payment (see <em>Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v DeSouza, </em>126 AD3d 965 [2015]; <em>One W. Bank, FSB v DiPilato, </em>124 AD3d 735 [2015]). In opposition, the defendants 254 Church Street, LLC, and James R. Koltz failed to raise a triable issue of fact relating to any bona fide defense to foreclosure (see <em>Baron Assoc., LLC v Garcia Group Enters., Inc., </em>96 AD3d 793, 793-794 [2012]). Furthermore, the Supreme Court properly determined that RPAPL 1303 and 1304, statutes governing pleading and notice requirements in connection with certain mortgages, were inapplicable to the instant action (see <em>Mendel Group, Inc. v Prince, </em>114 AD3d 732, 733 [2014]; <em>Horizons Invs. Corp. v Brecevich, </em>104 AD3d 475 [2013]; <em>cf. Independence Bank v Valentine, </em>113 AD3d 62, 66 [2013]). Accordingly, summary judgment on the complaint was properly awarded to the plaintiff.</p>\n<judges id=\"AgMq\">Leventhal, J.P., Chambers, Roman and Hinds-Radix, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
