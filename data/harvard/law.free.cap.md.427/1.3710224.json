After the two properties were valued by the Supervisor of Assessments for Baltimore City, Appellee, together at $38,138,600 for real property tax purposes, Cordish challenged the valuations in separate cases before the Property Tax Assessment Appeals Board, which affirmed, and thereafter before the Maryland Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">In both cases before the Tax Court, Cordish introduced appraisals and testimony that valued the properties at $29,900,000 collectively, based in part on the existence of ground leases owned by the City of Baltimore; the leases, themselves, however, were not introduced into evidence during the proceedings. The Supervisor of Assessments for Baltimore City, Appellee, argued that consideration of the ground leases was contrary to Section 8-113 of the Tax-Property Article, Maryland Code (1985, 2007 RepLVol.),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which requires, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>as a general rule, that interests subject to property tax under Section 6-102 of that Article be valued as though the lessee were the owner. The Tax Court affirmed the $38,138,600 valuation for the two properties collectively,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which was subsequently affirmed upon judicial review by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">Cordish appealed and, prior to any proceedings in the Court of Special Appeals, we granted certiorari, 424 Md. 628, 37 A.3d 317 (2012), to address the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-5\">Did the Maryland Tax Court err in its decision to discount the testimony offered by the Appellant because of the Tax Court\u2019s reliance on an erroneous understanding of law, offered by the Appellee in its testimony, that Md.Code Ann., Tax-Prop. \u00a7 8-113 prohibited the analysis of a ground lease and its affect on a commercial valuation of a property?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">We shall hold that the Tax Court did not err in disregarding the effect of the ground leases, because Cordish did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>establish that the leases in issue restricted its use of the properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">Commercial real property is valued, for property tax purposes, at its market value. Market value may be established in a myriad of ways, oftentimes depending on the context; three traditional methods are the cost to reproduce the property, comparison of prices of recently-sold comparable properties, and the capitalization of income approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">Under the cost to reproduce method, market value is the cost to build the same building or improvement on the land on which the property at issue is located. The Appraisal Institute, The Appraisal of Real Estate 335 (11th ed.1996). The cost to reproduce or replace the building is reduced by depreciation and then added to the value of the land itself to arrive at the total appraisal of the entire property. <em>Id. </em>at 340-41. Costs of reproduction or replacement of the building may include direct costs of construction, such as material and labor, and indirect costs, such as financing costs. Depreciation of a building represents deterioration, which is caused by its age and condition, as well as its \u201cobsolescence,\u201d which includes consideration of its functional adequacy and the market demand for the particular type of building. <em>Id. </em>at 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Under the sales comparison approach, the value of a commercial property is dependent upon the range of prices of recently-sold properties that are comparable to the property in issue. <em>Id. </em>at 397. Comparable properties are of the same or similar nature and, typically, geographical location as the property to be valued. <em>Id. </em>at 402. Once identified, comparable properties are juxtaposed with the property in issue to determine whether they differ in legal, financial and physical characteristics \u201cthat cause the prices paid for real estate to vary,\u201d including: the real property rights conveyed in the sale, market conditions affecting the sale, location, physical qualities, and use or zoning restrictions, among others. <em>Id. </em>at 402-04. The prices of the comparable properties are adjusted to account for these differences, in order to insure that the sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>prices of the comparables comport with the characteristics and conditions of the property at issue. <em>Id. </em>at 403-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">Under the capitalization of income approach, income earned from a property is most indicative of its value. <em>Id. </em>at 449. Essentially, the value of a property is based upon what income the property is expected to generate on an annual basis, reduced by its operating expenses to yield its net operating income.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 454, 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Once the net operating income is determined, comparable properties are consulted with respect to their market value as well as their net operating income during the relevant time in issue, in order to determine the capitalization rate or the rate that reflects the anticipated benefits and risk if the property were acquired. <em>Id. </em>at 459, 461, 514-15. In lieu of established capitalization rates for other properties, a property valuation based on the income approach may depend upon an assumed capitalization rate for the property in issue reliant upon market surveys of investor expectations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 514 n. 2. The capitalization rate may be upwardly adjusted for the risk of investing in the property in issue, or the likelihood that the property will not produce its anticipated income, as the uncertainty of future income loss is considered to detract from a property\u2019s market value. <em>Id. </em>at 514-515; <em>see also id. </em>at 459 (\u201cTo a real estate investor, risk is the chance of incurring a financial loss and the uncertainty of realizing projected future benefits.\u201d). Risk is evidenced by \u201cthe credit rating of the property\u2019s tenants [and] the stability of the property\u2019s income <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>stream.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 514. Once the capitalization rate is calculated, it is then applied to the property at issue, by dividing it into the net operating income to derive value. <em>Id. </em>The higher the capitalization rate, the lower the value. Alfred A. Ring, The Valuation of Real Estate 232 (2d ed.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">This last method, the income approach, is the preferred analysis in valuing an income producing commercial real property under Section 8-105(a)(l) of the Tax-Property Article:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aai\">(a) <em>Valuation. </em>\u2014 (1) Except for land that is actively devoted to farm or agricultural use, the supervisor:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-5\">(i) may value income producing real property by using the capitalization of income method or any other appropriate method of valuing the real property; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-6\">(ii) shall consider an income method in valuing income producing commercial real property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">That is what the parties used here.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">Cordish and the Supervisor of Assessments submitted competing appraisals and testimony to the Tax Court. They stipulated to the net operating income of the properties, as determined by an appraiser employed by the Supervisor of Assessments, who testified that she did not consider the ground lease in reaching her calculation because the ground leases were not provided to her, and, even if they had been provided to her, she was required to value the property in fee simple, i.e. as if the Cordish were the owner. The only dispute, therefore, appeared to be the capitalization rate to be applied to the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">Cordish, through its appraiser, presented testimony that the existence of the ground leases owned by Baltimore City, and the obligation to pay ground rent, made the property less marketable, raised the risk of investment, and thus required an increase in the overall capitalization rate; the ground leases, though, were not introduced into evidence. Although Cordish\u2019s appraiser concluded in both appraisals that, \u201c[a] Leasehold Interest offsets a property\u2019s marketability as compared to properties held in fee,\u201d he acknowledged on cross-examination that had he valued the property in fee simple, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>capitalization rate would have been lower, resulting in a higher value for the property. His appraisals, however, alluded to the lack of restrictions associated with the property, stating, \u201cWe are unaware of any easements or restrictions which would hinder development of the site.\u201d Cordish, nevertheless, maintained in its written submissions to the Tax Court that the existence of the ground leases required an increase in the overall capitalization rates and an ultimate decrease in the property\u2019s value subject to taxation, \u201cAll contracts <em>burdening </em>a piece of property affect its marketability ... because contracts that affect a commercial property\u2019s ability to make money, affect the Cap-Rate for purposes of valuation.\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">In its Memorandum and Order, the Tax Court, after consolidating the two cases, affirmed the Supervisor\u2019s higher assessments for the properties and determined that the Cordish appraisals valued the properties as leasehold interests, rather than in fee simple, contrary to Section 8-113 of Tax-Property Article. Valuing them as leasehold interests, the Tax Court found, served as \u201ca meaningful detraction to the properties\u2019 values\u201d with which it could not agree, because the court could not \u201cfind any evidence upon which it can credibly extrapolate what [Cordish\u2019s] valuations might have been if he had valued the properties as being held by the Petitioners in fee simple.\u201d Determining that the Cordish appraisals were not rehable, the Tax Court chose to rely upon the appraisals submitted on behalf of the Supervisor of Assessments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-5\">The Court declines to rely on the analysis presented by [Cordish] because their foundations are at variance with the statutory directive for the properties\u2019 valuations and there is no credible foundation by which the Court can cure this defect. In contrast, the Court finds [the appraisals of the Supervisor of Assessments\u2019] analysis both in conformance with the statutory directive and well reasoned. So, the Court is compelled to conclude that the Petitioners have not met the burden of proof necessary to justify a reversal of the [Property Tax Assessment Appeals Board] decisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>The Circuit Court, thereafter, affirmed the decision of the Tax Court, and Cordish timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">At the heart of this case is whether a ground lease may be considered in the valuation of a leasehold interest in income producing commercial property. If Cordish is correct, then the existence of a ground lease always would adversely affect the market value of the property. In contrast, if the Supervisor of Assessments is correct, no ground lease may be considered in such a valuation, because of the instruction in Section 8-113 of the Tax-Property Article that the lessee be treated as the owner. Cordish appears to argue that any ground lease constitutes a burden on the use of commercial property, whereas the Supervisor of Assessments ostensibly contends that a ground lease can never be considered as a burden. We conclude, however, that neither Cordish nor the Supervisor of Assessments is correct in its argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Under Section 6-102(e) of the Tax-Property Article, which is part of Title 6 of the Article, entitled \u201cTaxable Property; Imposition of Tax; Setting Tax Rates,\u201d Cordish\u2019s leasehold interests in government-owned property, \u201cwith the privilege to use the property in connection with a business that is conducted for profit,\u201d are subject to taxation, as if Cordish were the owner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-6\">(e) <em>Interests in government property. </em>\u2014 Unless exempted under \u00a7 7-211, \u00a7 7-211.1, or \u00a7 7-501 of this article, the interest or privilege of a person in property that is owned by the federal government, the State, a county, a municipal corporation, or an agency or instrumentality of the federal government, the State, a county, or a municipal corporation is subject to property tax as though the lessee or the user of the property were the owner of the property, if the property is leased or otherwise made available to that person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-7\">(1) by the federal government, the State, a county, a municipal corporation, or an agency or instrumentality of the federal government, the State, a county, or a municipal corporation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>(2) with the privilege to use the property in connection with a business that is conducted for profit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">Section 8-113 of the Tax-Property Article, entitled \u201cValuation of interests subject to tax under \u00a7 6-102 of this article,\u201d similarly prorides that the properties be valued as if Cordish were the owner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-5\">Interests subject to property tax under \u00a7 6-102 of this article shall be valued as if the lessee, person in possession, or user of the property were the owner of the property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">It is this language of the lessee being the \u201cowner of the property\u201d upon which the Supervisor of Assessments relies in order to ignore the existence of the Baltimore City ground leases.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">The language of ownership in Sections 6-102(e) and 8-113, however, is not determinative of the value of the properties, but rather the identification of the taxpayer; in this regard, the lessee is the \u201chypothetical owner\u201d of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">Sections 6-102(e) and 8-113 of the Tax-Property Article were derived from Sections 8(8)(e) and (f) of Article 81, Maryland Code (1957, 1961 Supp.). In 1961, Sections 8(8)(e) and (f) were enacted under the title \u201cWhat Shall be Taxed and Where,\u201d 1961 Maryland Laws, Chapter 884, to establish that leasehold interests in government-owned property could be taxed under certain circumstances and, at the same time, identify the lessee as the taxpayer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-9\">The following property, except in \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 10 provided, shall be subject to assessment to the owner and taxation for ordinary taxes in this State and in the county and/or city specified below:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-10\">(8) <em>Leaseholds and other limited interests in real or personal property. </em>\u2014 No leasehold or other limited interest in real or tangible personal property shall be subject to taxation except the following which shall be subject to taxation in the same amount and to the same extent as though the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>person in possession or the user thereof were the owner of such property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-4\">(e) The interest or privilege of any lessee, bailee, pledgee, agent, or other person in possession of or using any real or personal property which is owned by the federal or State governments, and which is leased, loaned, or otherwise made available to any person, firm, corporation, association, or other legal entity, with the privilege to use or possess such property in connection with a business conducted for profit ... shall be subject to taxation in the same amount and to the same extent as though the lessee or user were the owner of such property[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-5\">(f) All interests subject to taxation by subparagraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e) above, shall be valued and assessed at the full value of the property to the same extent as though the holders of the interests were the complete and absolute owners of such property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Maryland Code (1957, 1961 Supp.), Sections 8(8)(e) and (f) of Article 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">In similar circumstances, where the Legislature has enacted statutes providing that the lessee be subject to taxation in the place of the owner, we have interpreted such a provision to be a function of convenient, efficient tax collection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-8\">The provisions of Section 3(c), Article 81, Code of 1951, providing that the owner of certain limited interests in real and personal property shall be treated as the owner in fee for purposes of taxation, merely allows the person in possession to be taxed on the whole interest, where the whole interest is taxable, for the convenience of the tax authorities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-9\"><em>Meade Heights, Inc. v. State Tax Commission, </em>202 Md. 20, 27-28, 95 A.2d 280, 284 (1953). In <em>Philadelphia W. &amp; B. R.R. Co. v. Appeal Tax Court, </em>50 Md. 397, 411 (1879), we interpreted Section 73 of Article 81, Maryland Code (1860), which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>required a tenant \u201cto pay the taxes levied on the demised premises\u201d and then provided the tenant with the \u201cright of action to recover such money of the landlord,\u201d as \u201cintended as a means of facilitating the collection of taxes; there being many cases where the landlord might not be known, or might be absent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">In the present circumstances, hypothetical ownership is attributed to the lessee in order to identify the lessee as the taxpayer for the convenience of the tax collector, as we have noted heretofore interpreting similar provisions. As a result, we conclude that Sections 8-113 and 6-102(e) of the Tax-Property Article, when stating that the lessee of government-owned property is the owner, does so to identify its \u201chypothetical owner\u201d for tax purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">In concluding this, however, our analysis is not over. We also determine that Cordish is equally incorrect in its argument that all ground leases per se adversely affect value. Per se adverse effect cannot be presumed, however, because, as Cordish conceded at oral argument, ground leases do not always restrict the use of the property.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">In bolstering its per se argument by referencing a Tax Court decision, Cordish misses the point that the ground lease, determined to have diminished the income of the prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>erty in the case, had been proven to have been restrictive. In <em>Inner Harbor Marina of Baltimore, Inc. v. Supervisor of Assessments of Baltimore City, </em>No. 6280, 1991 WL 322991, at *1, 1991 Md. Tax LEXIS 10, at *3 (May 13, 1991), a ground lease owned by the City of Baltimore had been admitted into evidence before the Tax Court, which then determined that it contained \u201crestrictions not ordinarily required of a marina property owner\u201d that negatively impacted the property\u2019s income, under the income approach. <em>Id. </em>The same proof is not present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">We have only considered restrictions in leases as demonstrated by the evidence. In <em>Meade Heights, Inc. v. State Tax Commission, </em>202 Md. 20, 95 A.2d 280 (1953), we considered whether restrictions imposed by a lease and submitted into the record diminished the value of the property. Real estate developers leased land from the federal government in order to build and operate residential units on a military base in this State. To finance the construction of the buildings, the lease required the developers to obtain mortgage insurance, which was provided by the federal government on the condition that the developers limit subleasing to military personnel at fixed rents. The developers were assessed the full value of the buildings but they argued that restrictions imposed by the lease diminished their values. We observed, in dicta, that these restrictions could be considered in valuing the buildings, but that they were not shown to cause a \u201cpossible diminution in value,\u201d as occupancy was at 100% at the time of valuation, and the fixed subrents were \u201cadequate to retire the mortgage and show a handsome profit to the private investor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30, 95 A.2d at 285. In the future, however, if the demand in occupancy fell, \u201csuch a change would naturally be reflected in the subsequent annual assessments.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">In the present case, the ground leases were not admitted into the record, nor were the alleged restrictions in the leases proven, such as those asserted by Cordish in its brief before us as restrictions \u201cagainst demolishing one of the buildings, restrictions on signage, restrictions on height, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>many other requirements on maintenance, design, tenanting [sic], and development of the buildings which would not burden a typical downtown building owner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">Cordish contends, however, that it is the Supervisor of Assessments who should have entered the provisions of the ground leases into evidence before the Tax Court because the ground leases are recorded in the land records for Baltimore City. We disagree because it is Cordish\u2019s burden of proof and persuasion regarding adverse effects on valuation. <em>See Fairchild Hiller Corp. v. Supervisor of Assessments, 267 </em>Md. 519, 522-23, 298 A.2d 148, 150 (1973) (concluding that Tax Court reasonably concluded that the sales comparison analysis put forth by the taxpayer did not adequately reflect market value, as the recently-sold properties were not truly comparable, and therefore the taxpayer failed to show error in the real property assessment); <em>see also Taffet v. Supervisor of Assessments, </em>No. 712, 1989 WL 38622, at *1, 1989 Md. Tax LEXIS 3, at *2 (Apr. 13, 1989) (rejecting the taxpayers\u2019 contention that a rental lease decreased the property value where the only evidence they submitted was the lease itself, stating: \u201cA bold statement that the lease should be considered in value, without further evidence and support, is not sufficient for this Court to determine a value\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">In conclusion, we determine that although restrictions imposed by a ground lease may be considered for purposes of valuing commercial income producing properties under Section 8-113 of the Tax-Property Article, Cordish failed to prove that the ground leases in issue contained restrictions negatively affecting their value.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED.
