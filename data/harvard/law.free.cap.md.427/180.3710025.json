The petition alleged violations of the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (MLRPC) arising out of Respondent\u2019s representation of Chae Hong Min and his wife, Kyung Min, in the filing of an Application for Permanent Residence Status, an Application for Employment Authorization, and other immigration-related services. The petition charged Respondent with violating MLRPC 1.1 (competence); <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 1.3 (diligence);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 1.4 (communication);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 1.16 (de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>dining or terminating representation);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 8.1 (bar admissions and disdplinary matters);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and, 8.4 (misconduct).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>We issued an order, in accordance with Rule 16-752(a),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> designating the Honorable John Hennegan of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County to hear evidence on the matter and issue findings of fact and conclusions of law. After several unsuccessful attempts by Petitioner to obtain personal service on Respondent, a copy of our order, Bar Counsel\u2019s petition, and a writ of summons issued by the hearing judge were delivered to an employee designated by the Client Protection Fund of the Bar of Maryland to act as Respondent\u2019s agent for receipt of service, pursuant to Rule 16-753.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> When Respondent subsequently filed no answer or response to the petition, Petitioner moved for an Order of Default. The hearing judge granted the order on October 22, 2009 and sent a Notice of Default to Respondent on November 6, 2009. Respondent filed nothing in response.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">On December 11, 2009, the court conducted a hearing on the matter. Respondent did not appear at the hearing. Pursuant to Rule 2-323(e),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> all averments in Bar Counsel\u2019s petition were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>deemed admitted. Petitioner also offered into evidence the testimony of William M. Ramsey, an investigator it employed; Kyung Min, Respondent\u2019s former client; and a binder of documents relating to the representation. Respondent, not present, offered no evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Following the hearing, Judge Hennegan found by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent had violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4,1.16, 8.1, and 8.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">Judge Hennegan made a number of findings of fact, which we summarize as follows: On or about May 25, 2007, Respondent was retained by Chae Hong Min and his wife, Kyung Min, to file, on Mrs. Min\u2019s behalf, applications for permanent residence status, employment authorization, and other immigration benefits. Respondent charged a flat fee of $1,200, plus $1,365 for application costs, which the Mins paid on or about May 25, 2007. Respondent notified the Mins in June 2007 that their applications were complete, and, shortly thereafter, the Mins executed the applications. In July 2007, Respondent communicated to Mrs. Min that there were no issues with the applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">Mrs. Min received a notice from immigration authorities on or about September 7, 2007. She attempted to contact Respondent, but was unable to speak to him until sometime in October 2007. In October 2007, Respondent told Mrs. Min that she would receive her work permit within 30 days. Mrs. Min did not receive her permit. Additionally, Respondent received a request for information from immigration authorities on October 11, 2007. Respondent did not inform the Mins about the request for information and he did not respond to the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>The Mins received another notice from immigration authorities in February 2008, and they spoke to Respondent on or about February 14, 2008. Respondent promised to contact the immigration authorities and update the Mins on the status of their applications. He did not follow through on his promise. The Mins were unable to contact Respondent again until March 2008, despite leaving phone messages and calling a second phone number Respondent had provided to them, but that number was not in service the following day. When Mr. Min spoke to Respondent in March 2008, Respondent said that he was having personal problems, but would contact the Mins and provide more information about the case. Respondent did not provide the requested information. The Mins made several subsequent attempts to communicate with Respondent, through telephone message and a visit to Respondent\u2019s office in person, during regular business hours. At that visit, they were informed by an employee of a nearby office that Respondent was rarely in his office.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Despite these efforts, Respondent did not respond to the Mins.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Mrs. Min eventually filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to obtain her applications\u2019 Notice of Decision. The notice informed Mrs. Min that her applications were denied because the requested information had not been forthcoming.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Mr. Min filed a complaint with Bar Counsel, which was received on or about June 13, 2008. Bar Counsel sent Respondent notice of the complaint and a request for written responses within fifteen days of June 17, 2008. In a letter dated July 10, 2008, Respondent wrote that his personal troubles and severe depression caused him not to follow up with the Mins\u2019 representation. Respondent also included some, but not all, of the immigration documents relating to the representation. Respondent wrote that he could not locate the remaining documents and indicated he would continue to respond to the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>Bar Counsel sent Respondent a second letter on or about July 25, 2008, indicating that the case had been docketed and asking how long Respondent would need to complete his response. Respondent did not respond to this letter. Bar Counsel sent a third letter to Respondent on August 8, 2008, which indicated that Mr. Min had requested additional information regarding his case. Bar Counsel asked Respondent to provide the requested information within ten days of the letter. Respondent, again, did not respond to this letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">Bar Counsel\u2019s attempts to contact Respondent through its investigator, William M. Ramsey, were unsuccessful. Investigator Ramsey visited Respondent\u2019s office and home and left business cards in Respondent\u2019s home\u2019s door and mailbox, but Respondent did not respond. Investigator Ramsey was unable to contact Respondent on the telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Based on the foregoing facts, the hearing judge drew, by clear and convincing evidence, the following conclusions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-6\">Petitioner alleged that the following Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct, (MLRPC), were violated by Respondent: 1.1, dealing with competence; 1.3, dealing \"with diligence; 1.4, dealing with communication with the client; 1.16, dealing with the termination of the representation; 8.1(b), dealing with responding to a disciplinary authority, and 8.4(d), dealing with conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. For the reasons set forth below, there is clear and convincing evidence to find that each of these rules was violated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">A. Rule 1.1. Competence</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-8\">MLRPC 1.1 provides that: A lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client. Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-9\">The evidence established that the applications prepared and filed by Respondent were incomplete and that, even though he was notified by the U.S.C.I.S. that additional information was necessary, he failed to act in a timely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>manner to provide the additional information requested and complete the process. There is clear and convincing evidence that Respondent failed to demonstrate the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation of the Mins, in violation of MLRPC 1.1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-4\">B. Rule 1.3. Diligence</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-5\">MLRPC 1.3 provides that: A lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-6\">There is clear and convincing evidence that the same conduct which violated MLRPC 1.1 establishes a violation of MLRPC 1.3. Respondent violated MLRPC 1.3 when he failed to act with reasonable diligence and promptness when he ignored the U.S.C.I.S.\u2019s efforts to obtain additional information and failed to take the steps necessary to complete the application process. Respondent also violated MLRPC 1.3 when he failed to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in keeping the client advised of the progress of the applications and in responding to his client\u2019s efforts to obtain formation about the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\">C. Rule 1.4. Communication</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-8\">MLRPC 1.4(a) provides that: A lawyer shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-9\">(1) promptly inform the client of any decision or circumstance with respect to which the client\u2019s informed consent, as defined in Rule 1.0(f), is required by these Rules;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-10\">(2) keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-11\">(3) promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-12\">(4) consult with the client about any relevant limitation on the lawyer\u2019s conduct when the lawyer knows that the client expects assistance not permitted by the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct or other law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-x\">The evidence established that Respondent failed to promptly inform his client of the request for additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>information sent to him on or about October 11, 2007. Further Respondent failed to inform them that they had 87 days to submit the additional information. Additionally he neglected to inform them that the Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status had been denied on or about April 3, 2008. Respondent also failed to promptly comply with Mrs. Min\u2019s reasonable requests for information, failed to inform the Mins that he was closing his office and did not provide a working telephone number where he could be contacted. This conduct constitutes clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated MLRPC 1.4(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\">D. Rule 1.16. Declining or Terminating Representation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">MLRPC 1.16(d) provides that: [ujpon termination of representation, a lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client\u2019s interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled and refunding any advance payment of fee or expense that has not been earned or incurred. The lawyer may retain papers relating to the client to the extent permitted by other law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">In representing the Mins in this matter, Respondent charged a flat fee to complete Mrs. Min\u2019s immigration applications. He terminated the representation when he abandoned the representation, failed to provide all necessary services, and failed to keep the clients informed concerning the representation or his location. Respondent then failed to refund the unearned portion of the prepaid fee and failed to return papers to which the clients were entitled. There is clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated MLRPC 1.16(d). <em>See, e.g., Attorney Grievance Commission v. Tinsky, </em>377 Md. 646, 835 A.2d 542 (2003) (holding that an attorney\u2019s failure to notify his client of the closing of his office, taking a fee \"without appearing at trial and his disappearance while his client\u2019s cases were pending violated MLRPC 1.16(d)) and <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. McCulloch, </em>404 Md. 388, 946 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>1009 (2008) (holding that MLRPC 1.16(d) was violated when an attorney completed only a portion of the work required by the client, did not achieve the client\u2019s objectives, kept the entire fee and failed to refund the unearned portion of the fee).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-4\">E. Rule 8.1. Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\">MLRPC 8.1(b) provides that: An applicant for admission or reinstatement to the bar, or a lawyer in connection with a bar admission application or in connection with a disciplinary matter, shall not fail to disclose a fact necessary to correct a misapprehension known by the person to have arisen in the matter, or knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for information from an admissions or disciplinary authority, except that this Rule does not require disclosure of information otherwise protected by Rule 1.6.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">Respondent was sent letters on July 25 and August 8, 2008 by Assistant Bar Counsel. Respondent was asked in both of these letters to respond. Respondent ignored these requests. Respondent also failed to respond to investigator Ramsey\u2019s attempts to set up a meeting to discuss the complaint. Based on these facts, there is clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated MLRPC 8.1(b). <em>See Attorney Grievance Commission v. Fezell, </em>361 Md. 234, 253, 760 A.2d 1108, 1118 (2000) (holding that letters from Bar Counsel constitute lawful demands for information pursuant to MLRPC 8.1(b)), and <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Hallmon, </em>343 Md. 390, 407-08, 681 A.2d 510, 519-20 (1996) (holding that refusal to meet with an Assistant Bar Counsel about a complaint violated MLRPC 8.1.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\">F. Rule 8.4(d) Misconduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-8\">MLRPC 8.4(d) provides that it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice. Conduct that reflects negatively on the legal profession and sets a bad example for the public at large is prejudicial to the administration of justice. <em>At</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number><em>torney Grievance Commission v. Goff, </em>399 Md. 1, 22, 922 A.2d 554, 566 (2007).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-4\">Respondent failed to keep his clients informed, failed to diligently pursue the clients\u2019 immigration applications, abandoned the representation and failed to refund the unearned portion of the prepaid fee. Respondent also failed to respond to two or more lawful demands for information from Bar Counsel\u2019s office. There is clear and convincing evidence that such conduct is likely to negatively impact the public\u2019s perception of the legal profession and be prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of MLRPC 8.4(d). <em>See, e.g., Attorney Grievance Commission v. Tinsky, </em>377 Md. 646, 835 A.2d 542 (2003) ([holding that] an attorney engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice is in violation of MLRPC 8.4(d) when, after undertaking the representation of a client in two matters and having performed pursuant to that undertaking, the attorney, in effect, abandoned the representation); <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Mooney, </em>359 Md. 56, 82, 753 A.2d 17, 41 (2000) (holding that failure to represent a client in an adequate manner violated MLRPC 8.4(d)); <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Singleton, </em>315 Md. 1, 7-8, 553 A.2d 222, 224 (1989) ([holding that] a lawyer\u2019s neglect and lack of competence constituted conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">This Court has original and complete jurisdiction over attorney discipline proceedings in Maryland. In our independent review of the record, we accept the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact as prima facie correct unless shown to be clearly erroneous, and we review de novo the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Brown, </em>426 Md. 298, 314-15, 44 A.3d 344, 354 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Neither Petitioner nor Respondent filed exceptions to Judge Hennegan\u2019s findings of fact or conclusions of law, and Respondent did not appear at oral argument before this Court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Judge Hennegan\u2019s factual findings are therefore \u201cestablished for the purpose of determining the appropriate sanction.\u201d Md. Rule 16 \u2014 759(b)(2)(A). With respect to Judge Hennegan\u2019s conclusions of law that Respondent violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.16, 8.1(b), and 8.4(d), we agree, for the reasons that follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">MLRPC 1.1 requires that an attorney provide competent representation, which requires thoroughness and preparation. Although Respondent filed the applications for immigration benefits on Mrs. Min\u2019s behalf, he failed to demonstrate the proper level of thoroughness and preparation. The applications he submitted contained insufficient supporting evidence. Respondent exacerbated that error by failing to respond to the request from the U.S.C.I.S. for more information, despite his knowledge thereof. This failure ultimately led to the denial of Mrs. Min\u2019s applications. Such conduct demonstrates a lack of competency demanded by MLRPC 1.1. <em>See Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Kwarteng, </em>411 Md. 652, 658, 984 A.2d 865, 868 (2009) (agreeing with the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that the respondent attorney was incompetent, in part for failing to prepare responses to discovery requests and failing to preserve the client\u2019s right of appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">MLRPC 1.3 requires that an attorney act with \u201creasonable diligence and promptness.\u201d Respondent\u2019s conduct of wholly ignoring the requests for more information sent by U.S.C.I.S., information which was necessary to complete Mrs. Min\u2019s applications, also violated MLRPC 1.3. It is axiomatic that the failure to respond timely to requests for necessary information from an adjudicating agency demonstrates a lack of reasonable diligence. <em>See, e.g., Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Tinsky, </em>377 Md. 646, 651, 835 A.2d 542, 544 (2003) (concluding that attorney\u2019s failure to supply additional materials requested by the court demonstrated a lack of diligence). Moreover, Respondent\u2019s failure to keep the Mins informed as to the status of the applications and his failure to respond to the Mins\u2019s inquiries both violate MLRPC 1.3. <em>See Kwarteng, </em>411 Md. at 658, 984 A.2d at 868-69 (concluding that attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>violated MLRPC 1.3 by failing to communicate with and abandoning his client).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">MLRPC 1.4 requires that an attorney keep his/her client reasonably informed about the subject of representation and respond to requests for information in a prompt manner. Respondent failed to abide by these dictates, as well, by his failure to inform Mrs. Min about the request for additional information and, ultimately, that her applications had been denied. Despite repeated attempts to contact Respondent, the Mins were unsuccessful. Therefore, Respondent\u2019s conduct has also violated MLRPC 1.4. <em>See Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. De La Paz, </em>418 Md. 534, 554, 16 A.3d 181, 193 (2011) (concluding that attorney violated MLRPC 1.4 by failing to respond to his clients\u2019 letters and messages, to inform a client that his case had been dismissed, to inform clients that he had moved his practice, and to provide the client with new contact information).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">MLRPC 1.16(d) requires an attorney to take reasonably practicable steps to protect the client\u2019s interest upon terminating representation. Respondent, however, violated these mandates. Respondent terminated his representation of Mrs. Min by abandoning the matter before completion, failing to respond to Mrs. Min\u2019s messages, failing to provide sufficient contact information, and failing to inform of his intent to move (or close) his office. Moreover, he failed to refund any of the unearned fees and to return Mrs. Min\u2019s paperwork. <em>See De La Paz, </em>418 Md. at 555, 16 A.3d at 193-94 (concluding that attorney violated MLRPC 1.16(d) by failing to inform clients that he was moving his practice, to return a client\u2019s file and refund unearned fees).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">MLRPC 8.1(b) provides that an attorney must respond to lawful demands for information from the disciplinary authority. Respondent, multiple times, ignored Bar Counsel\u2019s letters to him, which specifically requested a response to the allegations. Moreover, Respondent ignored attempts of the investigator to communicate with Respondent about the allegations. The failure to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s inquiries with respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>to its investigation of a disciplinary matter clearly violates MLRPC 8.1(b). <em>See, e.g., Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Bleecker, </em>414 Md. 147, 174, 994 A.2d 928, 944 (2010) (attorney violated MLRPC 8.1 by \u201cfailing] to respond to repeated written requests for information from Bar Counsel.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Lastly, MLRPC 8.4(d) establishes that it is professional misconduct to \u201cengage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d Respondent\u2019s failure to pursue Mrs. Min\u2019s applications diligently and competently, as well as his failure to maintain sufficient communication with Mrs. Min, as demonstrated by our conclusion that Respondent violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.3, and 1.4, constitutes conduct that brings disrepute to the legal profession, in violation of MLRPC 8.4(d). Respondent\u2019s failure to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s attempted communications further contributed to that rule violation. <em>See Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Rose, </em>391 Md. 101, 111, 892 A.2d 469, 475 (2006) (concluding that the attorney violated MLRPC 8.4(d) by failing to respond \u201cpromptly, completely and truthfully\u201d to Bar Counsel, to keep the client informed of the matter of representation, and to provide diligent representation).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Having concluded that Respondent violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.16, 8.1(b), and 8.4(d), all that remains for us to determine is the appropriate sanction for Respondent\u2019s misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">Petitioner recommends disbarment as the appropriate sanction. Petitioner asserts that Respondent \u201cbetrayed the trust that his clients placed in him\u201d when he failed to provide the legal services they sought, ignored their efforts to obtain information about their case, gave them misleading information about their case, failed to respond to the immigration service\u2019s informational requests, and failed to return the unearned fee. Citing our decision in <em>Tinsky, </em>Petitioner argues that disbarment is the only proper sanction for a lawyer who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>fails to provide competent and diligent representation, abandons representation, and fails to return unearned fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">In selecting a sanction, we are cognizant of the principle that attorney discipline proceedings are not instituted to punish an offending lawyer, but rather to protect the public and the public\u2019s confidence in the legal profession. <em>Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Sucklal, </em>418 Md. 1, 10 n. 3, 12 A.3d 650, 655 n. 3 (2011). Imposition of a sanction protects the public in two ways: \u201cthrough deterrence of the type of conduct which will not be tolerated, and by removing those unfit to continue in the practice of law from the rolls of those authorized to practice in this State.\u201d <em>Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Usiak, </em>418 Md. 667, 689, 18 A.3d 1, 14 (2011) (quoting <em>Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Mahone, </em>398 Md. 257, 268-69, 920 A.2d 458, 465 (2007)). Our selection of an appropriate sanction is guided by the nature and gravity of the violation, the intent with which the violation was committed, and the particular circumstances surrounding each case, including aggravating and mitigating factors. <em>Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Khandpur, </em>421 Md. 1, 18, 25 A.3d 165, 175 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Petitioner\u2019s recommendation of disbarment finds support in two cases in which we disbarred an attorney for misconduct similar to Respondent\u2019s. In <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Brady, </em>422 Md. 441, 460-61, 30 A.3d 902, 913 (2011), we disbarred an attorney for violating MLRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.16 and 8.4. The respondent in that case failed to take fundamental steps in furtherance of his client\u2019s interest by neglecting to file a response to a motion to dismiss and failing to appear at a scheduling conference. <em>Id. </em>at 457, 30 A.3d at 911. Furthermore, the respondent failed to keep his client informed about the status of the case in the face of the client\u2019s requests for updates, collected unreasonable fees, failed to return unearned fees, and terminated the representation without notice to the client. <em>Id. </em>at 458-60, 30 A.3d at 911-13. We held that such misconduct, amounting to the effective abandonment of a client, \u201cwas sufficient to justify disbarment as the appropriate sanction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461, 30 A.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>at 913. Accordingly, we disbarred the <em>Brady </em>respondent. <em>Id., </em>30 A.3d at 913.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Similarly, we disbarred an attorney for violating MLRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.16, 8.1(b), and 8.4(d) in <em>Kwarteng, </em>411 Md. at 660-61, 984 A.2d at 870. Like the respondent in <em>Brady, </em>we noted that the attorney in <em>Kwarteng </em>\u201cin effect abandoned his representation of the complainant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 660, 984 A.2d at 870. Kwarteng did so by failing to prepare interrogatories, failing to respond to a motion for sanction, failing to preserve the client\u2019s right of appeal, failing to communicate with the client when the client repeatedly sought updates on the status of his case, and terminating the presentation by neglecting to pursue effectively the client\u2019s interests. <em>Id. </em>at 658, 984 A.2d at 868-69. Moreover, the attorney in <em>Kwarteng </em>violated MLRPC 8.1(b) when he failed to answer Bar Counsel\u2019s investigator\u2019s attempts to communicate with him. <em>Id., </em>984 A.2d at 869. We held that the only appropriate sanction for such misconduct, taken altogether, was disbarment. <em>Id. </em>at 661, 984 A.2d at 870.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\"><em>Brady </em>and <em>Kwarteng </em>inform the sanction in this case. In the absence of mitigation (as here), disbarment is the appropriate sanction when an attorney abandons a client by failing to pursue the client\u2019s interests, failing to communicate with the client, ignoring a client\u2019s repeated requests for status updates, terminating the representation without notice by failing wholly to provide effective services, and failing to return unearned fees. Respondent did all of this and failed to cooperate with Bar Counsel\u2019s lawful demands for information, in violation of MLRPC 8.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Accordingly, we order disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-761, FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST HEUNG SIK PARK.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b216-11\">.
