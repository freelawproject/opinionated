Discovering after he approached Lipella that the driver smelled of alcohol and slurred his speech, Barnhart administered to Lipella the three standard field sobriety tests (\u201cSFSTs\u201d), all of which he failed. His blood alcohol content (\u201cBAC\u201d) registered O. 16, based on a preliminary breath test administered in the field. Deputy Barnhart detained and transported Lipella to the Washington County Sheriffs Department where an official breathalyzer test was administered, which also registered a BAC of 0.16. His driver\u2019s license was confiscated for driving while intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">Upon judicial review of Lipella\u2019s license suspension, the Circuit Court for Washington County concluded that Deputy Barnhart failed to indicate adequately on the Motor Vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Administration (\u201cMVA\u201d) Form DR-15A<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the reasonable grounds for the underlying traffic stop that led to the license suspension. Therefore, the Circuit Court held that the ALJ\u2019s suspension of Lipella\u2019s license was \u201cunsupported by competent, material and substantial evidence in light of the entire record submitted.\u201d As we shall explain, the Implied Consent Statute does not require the officer to supply the grounds for the underlying traffic stop. Rather, the officer is required to provide on the DR-15A form the reasonable grounds for the suspect\u2019s intoxication. Thus, the ALJ concluded properly that the MVA mounted successfully a prima facie case, which was unrebutted, supporting the suspension of Lipella\u2019s license. Accordingly, we shall reverse the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">FACTUAL AND LEGAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">On August 29, 2009, at approximately 12:49 a.m., Deputy Barnhart of the Washington County Sheriffs Department observed a person, later identified as Lipella, traveling eastbound in a motor vehicle on Maryland Route 64 in Washington County.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Deputy Barnhart observed Lipella\u2019s car swerve twice onto the right shoulder and then move back onto the road, all the while traveling in excess of 65 mph. The posted speed limit was 50 mph. The Deputy signaled for Lipella to pull over. Upon first contact with the driver, Deputy Barn-hart detected a strong odor of alcohol emanating from his person. He asked Lipella to step out of the vehicle and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>administered the SFSTs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Lipella exhibited signs of intoxication during the first test, the horizontal gaze nystagmus test, and could not complete the other two tests, due apparently to his inebriation.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Deputy Barnhart requested of Lipella that he submit to a preliminary breathalyzer test (\u201cPBT\u201d). Lipella acquiesced. The test yielded a BAC reading of 0.16. Barnhart placed Lipella under arrest for driving while intoxicated and transported him to the Washington County Sheriff\u2019s Office. Before administering the second BAC test, the Deputy informed Lipella of his right to refuse the breathalyzer test and the consequences of: (1) a refusal to take the test; (2) a result of BAC over 0.08; and, (8) a result of BAC over 0.15. These rights and consequences are detailed also on the DR-15 Advice of Rights form, which is a replica of the language in \u00a7 16-205.1. Lipella agreed to submit to the second, certified breathalyzer test, which also resulted in 0.16 BAC reading. A DR-15A Order of Suspension was issued, Lipella\u2019s license was confiscated, and he was issued a temporary driver\u2019s license pending the results of an administrative hearing before an ALJ of the Maryland Office of Administrative Hearings. Deputy Barnhart forwarded a copy of the completed DR-15A, as required by the Implied Consent Statute, to the MVA. The form explained, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-6\">CERTIFICATION OF POLICE OFFICER</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8S\">I, the undersigned officer, had reasonable grounds to believe that the driver described and named above had been driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle on a highway or on any private property that is used by the public in general in this State while under the influence of alcohol, while impaired by alcohol, while so far impaired by any drug, any combination of drugs, or a combination of one or more drugs and alcohol that the person could not drive a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>vehicle safely while impaired by a controlled dangerous substance, in violation of an alcohol restriction of Section 16-813 of the Maryland Vehicle Law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-5\">REASONABLE GROUNDS: <em>VEHICLE WAS] STOPPED ON REASONABLE GROUNDS. UPON CONTACT WITH DRIVER I DETECTED A STRONG ODOR OF AN ALC[OHOLIC] BEVIERAGE] AND HE HAD SLURRED SPEECH. DRIVER FAILED SFST. PBT </em>\u2014 .16 [.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Lipella requested timely an administrative hearing regarding the ninety-day suspension of his license. At the hearing,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Lipella argued that, because Deputy Barnhart wrote on the DR-15A only that the \u201cvehficle wasj stopped on reasonable grounds!,]\u201d the MVA\u2019s paperwork did not meet its prima facie burden to show that the officer had reasonable grounds to stop initially Lipella\u2019s vehicle. Lipella maintained that the officer was required to list on the DR-15A the specific reasons for making the underlying traffic stop. Without such information regarding the initial stop, Lipella complained he was precluded from presenting a bad faith challenge to the grounds for the stop, as permitted by Code of Maryland Regulations 11.11.02.10(H) (2012).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">The MVA retorted that, based on this Court\u2019s interpretation of the Implied Consent Statute in <em>Motor Vehicle Administration v. Illiano, </em>390 Md. 265, 281, 888 A.2d 329, 340 (2005), the Deputy\u2019s duty to document and prove the driver\u2019s intoxication began after making the initial traffic stop and, thus, the motive for the initial traffic stop should not be considered. As this argument went, the basis for the traffic stop and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>evidence for suspecting intoxication are separate from one another, based on <em>Illiano, </em>390 Md. at 281, 888 A.2d at 340 (holding that the Legislature\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cstop or detain\u201d in \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(2) serves to sever the stop from the detention, and permits reasonable grounds to believe intoxication of the driver may arise post-stop to justify the detention and request for administration of a breath test). The MVA sought to bolster its argument by contending that the Legislature intended to make it easier to remove intoxicated drivers from Maryland\u2019s roads by not requiring suspicion of intoxication necessarily to be developed prior to approaching the driver. To this end, the Implied Consent Statute was enacted to prevent endless litigation and achieve swiftness in removing intoxicated drivers from endangering the public; therefore, the underlying traffic stop\u2019s constitutionality is not a permitted issue to be raised at a license suspension hearing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">As the MVA\u2019s argument continued, the ALJ should conclude that the MVA is required only to show, in making a prima facie case, that the officer had reasonable grounds to request the driver to take the official breathalyzer test. To this effect, the MVA relied upon <em>Motor Vehicle Administration v. Shea, </em>415 Md. 1, 18, 997 A.2d 768, 778 (2010), where we held that the ALJ\u2019s duty is to determine whether the officer had reasonable grounds to request the accused to take a test to determine the BAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">The ALJ suspended Lipella\u2019s license for ninety days because the DR-15A describing Deputy Barnhart\u2019s basis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>suspecting intoxicated driving, and the official BAC test result administered at the Washington County Sheriffs Office, were sufficient to constitute a prima facie case. Although he admitted the Alcohol Influence Report into evidence, the ALJ felt he did not need to rely on the report as corroborating evidence because the MVA presented a prima facie case otherwise, using the DR-15A and the BAC results.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Additionally, although Lipella suggested tangentially a possible defense of bad faith on the part of the police officer, he adduced no evidence to call the police officer\u2019s statements into question. This scenario is illustrated by the following exchange between the ALJ and Lipella\u2019s attorney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-6\">ALJ:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-7\">In the absence of bad faith, we don\u2019t even get into the stop. So I get Counsel\u2019s position, but I still think at this point, it\u2019s still a prima facie case, but it <em>could be refuted by evidence, </em>(emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-8\">ATTORNEY:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-9\">Well, that\u2019s what the problem is. We don\u2019t know what to refute, because he didn\u2019t tell us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-10\">ALJ:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-11\">Well, I can look at the corroboration to find out.[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AkQ\">ATTORNEY:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-12\">Well\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-13\">ALJ:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-14\">But it\u2019s still a prima facie case and in the absence of bad faith \u2014 and I can\u2019t make a presumption of bad faith \u2014 I have to make a presumption of good faith because the officer said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>he had reasonable grounds. So, I\u2019ll just go ahead and admit them.[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-5\">ATTORNEY:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-6\">Ok.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">In addition to not subpoenaing the Deputy to testify, Lipella did not testify on his own behalf at the hearing. Based on the admitted evidence, the ALJ held that the officer\u2019s stop was made in good faith and Lipella\u2019s license should be suspended for ninety days.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">Lipella filed a petition for judicial review with the Circuit Court for Washington County, pursuant to Maryland Code (1984, 2009 Repl.Vol.), State Government Article, \u00a7 10-222. He renewed his assertion that the DR-15A, as completed by Deputy Barnhart, was overly vague and insufficient to constitute a prima facie case by the MVA. Additionally, due to the MVA\u2019s lack of evidence as to the grounds for the traffic stop, he asserted that he was deprived of the opportunity to raise and prove the defense that the stop was made in bad faith. Lipella also argued that the Alcohol Influence Report should not have been admitted into evidence in the administrative hearing because it was not a sworn statement and, if excluded, the MVA had no evidence to corroborate or supplement the insufficient DR-15A.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">The MVA riposted that, under the Maryland Code (1984, 2009 RepLVol.), State Government Article, \u00a7 10-213(b), the ALJ may consider any probative evidence, as long it would be accepted commonly by reasonable and prudent individuals in the conduct of their affairs. <em>See </em>Md.Code Regs. 11.11.02.10(A) (2012). Furthermore, the MVA argued that \u00a7 16-205.1 enumerates the only permissible issues that may be raised at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>license suspension administrative hearings, and Lipella\u2019s \u201cinsufficient grounds for a stop\u201d argument was not one of them. Specifically, the MVA maintained that this Court held in <em>Motor Vehicle Administration v. Richards, </em>356 Md. 356, 368 n. 7, 739 A.2d 58, 65 n. 7 (1999), that the constitutionality of the underlying traffic stop was prohibited from being an issue at the administrative hearing, absent proof tendered by the driver that the officer acted in bad faith in making this stop. The MVA pointed out also that the DR-15A refers only to the reasonable grounds the officer had to believe the person was driving or attempting to drive under the influence, requiring no particular details be supplied in the first instance regarding the underlying traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The Circuit Court concluded that, in order to enable Lipella to elect whether to raise a bad faith defense, the officer must list on the DR-15A specifically what he contended were the reasonable grounds for the underlying traffic stop. The judge held that, without adducing the specific reasons for the stop, the MVA did not make a prima facie case on this record. The Circuit Court explained why it was reversing the ALJ\u2019s decision and remanding the matter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-6\">[TJhere should be the reasonable grounds for the stop were that x, y and z and Mr. Lipella would then have the opportunity to say, \u2018No, that wasn\u2019t true.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\">And therefore I do find that the findings of the Administrative Law Judge is unsupported by competent, material and substantial evidence in light of the entire record submitted. And also that it was arbitrary and capricious for this sanction to be imposed based on the reasonable ground being reasonable grounds.[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">The MVA filed timely a petition for a writ of certiorari with this Court, under Maryland Code (1973, 2006 RepLVol.), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 12-305, which allows for a direct appeal from the Circuit Court judgment regarding administrative hearings held under Title 16 of the Transportation Article. We granted the petition, <em>Motor Vehicle Administration v. Lipella, </em>415 Md. 607, 4 A.3d 512 (2010), to consider the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">In determining the sufficiency of an officer\u2019s sworn certification of grounds to request an alcohol concentration test under \u00a7 16.205.1, as recorded on the DR-15A, did the ALJ err in determining that the specific reasons for the underlying traffic stop need not be recorded under the section labeled \u201cREASONABLE GROUNDS?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">We shall reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court and remand with directions to affirm the decision of the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">In judicial review of a state administrative agency (such as the ALJ decision here, where he acted on behalf of the MVA by express delegation), we review the action of the agency directly, rather than the judgment of the intervening reviewing court. <em>See Consumer Prot. Div. v. Morgan, </em>387 Md. 125, 160, 874 A.2d 919, 939 (2005). Under the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act, a reviewing court may:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-9\">(1) remand the case for further proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-10\">(2) affirm the final decision; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-11\">(3) reverse or modify the decision if any substantial right of the petitioner may have been prejudiced because a finding, conclusion, or decision:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-12\">(i) is unconstitutional;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-13\">(ii) exceeds the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the decision maker;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-14\">(iii) results from an unlawful procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-15\">(iv) is affected by any other error of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-16\">(v) is unsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence in light of the entire record as submitted; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>(vi) is arbitrary and capricious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Md.Code (1957, 2009, RepLVol), State Gov\u2019t Art., \u00a7 10-222.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">In <em>United Parcel Service, Inc. v. People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County, </em>336 Md. 569, 577, 650 A.2d 226, 230 (1994), we held that a court\u2019s role in reviewing an agency\u2019s adjudicatory decision is narrow and \u201climited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d The substantial evidence test evaluates \u201cwhether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached.\u201d <em>Bulluck v. Pelham Wood Apts., </em>283 Md. 505, 512, 390 A.2d 1119, 1123 (1978). Furthermore, significant weight is given to any reasonable factual inferences that the ALJ draws in license suspension proceedings specifically, <em>Shea, </em>415 Md. at 18, 997 A.2d at 778 (quoting <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Delawter, </em>403 Md. 243, 256-57, 941 A.2d 1067, 1076 (2008)), as well as the statutory interpretations of an administrative agency in the field of its delegated authority from the Legislature. <em>See e.g., Md. Aviation Admin. v. Noland, </em>386 Md. 556, 571-72, 873 A.2d 1145, 1154-55 (2005); <em>Fogle v. H &amp; G Rest., Inc., </em>337 Md. 441, 445, 654 A.2d 449, 456 (1995) (holding that an agency\u2019s expertise in its own field should be respected). <em>See also </em>Md.Code (1984, 2009 RepLVol., 2011 Cum.Supp.), State Gov\u2019t Art., \u00a7 10-222(1), (h) (stating that \u201c[\u00a1Judicial review of disputed issues of fact shall be confined to the record for judicial review,\u201d and \u201c[i]n a proceeding under this section, the court may remand, reverse, or modify the decision of the administrative agency\u201d if, inter alia, the decision \u201cis unsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence in light of the entire record as submitted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">In reviewing the ALJ\u2019s decision, we consider only the evidence that was before the ALJ at the hearing. We will review first the evidentiary standards for administrative hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>ings; evaluate the plain language requirements of \u00a7 16-205.1 and how they relate to the DR-15A; and, finally review the sufficiency of the evidence with regards to the ALJ\u2019s ruling on Lipella\u2019s contemplated bad faith defense and the suspension of his license.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">As detailed in Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR) \u00a7 11.11.02.10 (2012),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> any proffered evidence that the ALJ determines to be probative and accepted commonly by reasonable and prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs, may be considered. In the present case, the ALJ admitted the Alcohol Influence Report. He mentioned that, although the Alcohol Influence Report would not be considered by him in determining whether the MVA had advanced a prima facie case, it could, if needed, be looked to for corroboration.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">An ALJ, presiding over an administrative hearing of a driver\u2019s license suspension matter, may consider also evidence that might not be admissible in a court proceeding. <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Weller, </em>390 Md. 115, 133-34, 887 A.2d 1042, 1053 (2005). In <em>Weller, </em>we approved the admission in evidence of a PBT in a license suspension hearing. 390 Md. at 138, 887 A.2d. at 1056. Weller argued that \u00a7 16-205.1 prohibits specifically the PBT from being used in any \u201ccourt action.\u201d <em>Weller, </em>390 Md. at 135, 887 A.2d. at 1054. We held that, because the administrative hearing is not a \u201ccourt action,\u201d the formal rules of evidence were not operative strictly and, thus, the PBT was permissible. <em>Weller, </em>390 Md. at 135, 887 A.2d at 1053-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">In <em>Motor Vehicle Administration v. McDorman, </em>364 Md. 253, 262, 772 A.2d 309, 314 (2001), we reiterated that hearsay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>evidence may be admitted in administrative hearings and, if credible, may be the sole basis of a successful prima facie case. (Citing <em>Eger v. Stone, </em>253 Md. 533, 542, 253 A.2d 372, 377 (1969)). Furthermore, we approved the use of an Alcohol Influence Report as evidence of a defendant\u2019s refusal of a breathalyzer test, which was the basis for the subsequent suspension of his driver\u2019s license. <em>Thomas v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>418 Md. 280, 298-300, 13 A.3d 1256, 1267 (2011).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">In the present case, the sworn DR-15A and the formal toxicology report of a BAC reading of 0.16 from the official breathalyzer test are prima facie case evidence, in and of themselves, proving a violation of \u00a7 16-205.1. <em>Accord Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Lytle, </em>374 Md. 37, 51-52, 821 A.2d 62, 70 (2003) (holding that the Legislature intended for the completed DR-15A to be prima facie evidence of a violation of \u00a7 16-205.1). The Alcohol Influence Report, as corroborative evidence, may be admitted in an administrative hearing under COMAR 11.11.02.10(A) because it is a probative document that a reasonable police officer uses in the conduct of his duties. Just as the PBT in <em>Weller </em>was probative because it made the fact that Weller was driving while intoxicated more likely so than not, the Alcohol Influence Report in the present case makes it more likely so than not that Deputy Barnhart had a reasonable belief that Lipella was driving while intoxicated. Therefore, the ALJ admitted properly here the Alcohol Influence Report as corroborating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>We examined, in detail, the plain meaning of \u00a7 16-205.1 in <em>Illiano, </em>390 Md. at 278-79, 888 A.2d at 337-38, in order to determine if the Legislature intended to separate proeedurally the events leading to the traffic stop from the detention events that lead to the request to take a breathalyzer test. <em>See also Richards, </em>356 Md. at 368 n. 7, 739 A.2d at 65 n. 7. The DR-15A was created, using the requirements set out in \u00a7 16-205.1 <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> as a precise model, to record the information that led the police officer to suspect intoxication. Neither the form, nor the statute, require the officer to document the events leading to the underlying traffic stop, unless those events formed a part of the officer\u2019s suspicion of intoxication. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>only requirement is that the officer provide the \u201creasonable grounds to believe that the person had been driving or attempting to drive ... while under the influence of alcohol ...,\u201d and, therefore, to request the driver submit to a chemical test. \u00a7 16-205(2)(viii).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">In <em>Illiano, </em>the officer did not stop Illiano while she was driving; on the contrary, Illiano brought her vehicle to rest directly behind the officer\u2019s patrol car on an active Maryland highway. 390 Md. at 269, 888 A.2d at 331-32. The officer developed no suspicions of possible intoxicated driving until he backed his patrol car alongside Illiano\u2019s and smelled alcohol on her breath. <em>Illiano, </em>390 Md. at 269, 888 A.2d at 332. Because, \u00a7 16 \u2014 205.1(b)(2) uses the disjunctive \u201cstop or detain,\u201d instead of \u201cstop and detain,\u201d this indicated that suspicions of intoxicated driving may arise separately from a traffic stop. <em>Illiano, </em>390 Md. at 277, 888 A.2d at 336-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">This Court approved various officer-driver encounters, ending in suspensions of persons\u2019 driver\u2019s licenses for intoxicated driving, even though they did not begin because of suspicion of intoxicated driving. For example, we affirmed a suspension that began when an officer approached a driver on the street, known as a \u201cconsensual encounter.\u201d <em>See Ferris v. State, </em>355 Md. 356, 373 n. 4, 735 A.2d 491, 500 n. 4 (1999) (citing <em>United States v. Werking, </em>915 F.2d 1404, 1408 (10th Cir.1990)). Another possible valid officer-initiated stop occurs when a non-moving violation of the Transportation Article attracts an officer\u2019s attention, such as being illegally parked on a highway, as demonstrated in <em>McDorman, </em>364 Md. at 262, 772 A.2d at 315. Also, a police officer\u2019s reasonable belief of criminal activity may lead to a lawful interaction with a driver not related to intoxication. <em>See Richards, </em>356 Md. at 357, 739 A.2d at 59-60; <em>Illiano, </em>390 Md. at 279-80, 888 A.2d at 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">If we were to accept Lipella\u2019s argument that the officer must document why the circumstances leading to the underlying traffic stop lead the officer to believe the driver was intoxicated, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to suspend a person\u2019s license for driving under the influence because there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>would be plausible, non-alcohol-related, explanations for many moving-violations: e.g., driving too fast; distracted driving; or reaching for something on the floor. Furthermore, any non-moving violations, such as an expired tag, a non-working headlight, or an illegally parked vehicle, could not lead to the suspension of a driver\u2019s license because the police officer would have no reason necessarily to believe the person was intoxicated before he approached the driver in the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">In <em>Richards, </em>a Maryland State Police Trooper stopped Richards in his vehicle on the basis that, because there had been a rash of criminal activity in the area, the trooper determined that Richards\u2019s actions were suspicious,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> but he had no reason to suspect intoxication before the stop. 356 Md. at 358-59, 739 A.2d at 59-60. What gave rise to a suspicion of intoxication was detection of a strong odor of alcohol emanating from Richards after the stop of his vehicle. <em>Id. </em>At the license suspension hearing, Richards challenged the constitutionality of the stop on the ground that the officer had no indications of Richards being intoxicated when the stop was made and, therefore, did not list the proper reasons to suspect intoxication on the DR-15A. <em>Richards, </em>356 Md. at 359-60, 739 A.2d at 60. Richards argued that none of the evidence revealed during or after the stop could be considered in the ALJ hearing because it flowed from an unconstitutional traffic stop. <em>Richards, </em>356 Md. at 367-68, 739 A.2d at 64-65. This Court rejected specifically the challenge to the constitutionality of the underlying traffic stop as a reason to prohibit the refusal, or results, of a breathalyzer in a license suspension hearing, unless the accused showed bad faith on the part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>the officer in making the stop. <em>Richards, </em>356 Md. at 368 n. 7, 739 A.2d at 65 n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">Lipella attempts (unpersuasively) to distinguish <em>Illiano </em>and <em>Richards </em>from the present case. <em>Illiano </em>provides an example of scenarios when there need not be a traffic stop preceding an officer developing reasonable suspicions of intoxication. 390 Md. at 269, 888 A.2d at 332. <em>Richards </em>demonstrates how the underlying stop need not be initiated solely because of suspicion of intoxicated driving. 356 Md. at 358, 739 A.2d at 59-60. In both cases, the suspicions of intoxication, SFSTs, and subsequent requests for a breathalyzer were sufficient, standing alone, to support the suspensions of the driver\u2019s licenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Applying in <em>Richards </em>the distinction between the basis for the underlying stop and the development of suspicions of intoxication, we concluded that the reasons for the stop do not bear necessarily on the suspicion of intoxication determination, as long as the stop was executed in good faith by the officer. 356 Md. at 368 n. 7, 739 A.2d at 65 n. 7. Deputy Barnhart\u2019s specific suspicions of intoxication on Lipella\u2019s part developed after he approached the car and smelled the alcohol odor on Lipella and heard Lipella slur his words. The request for a field breathalyzer was a result of these indications, not necessarily or solely because of Lipella\u2019s inability to keep the travel of his car within the lane markings, which may have been explainable otherwise as the result of distracted or drowsy driving, instead of intoxicated driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The DR-15A, which is based on \u00a7 16-205.1, compels enumeration by the officer only of the indications of the believed intoxication of the driver and does not compel attention to the reasons for the officer approaching the driver in the first instance if not believed to be indicative of the driver\u2019s intoxication. For example, under the section of the form labeled \u201cORDER OF SUSPENSION-ISSUE DATE (MONTH/DATE/YEAR)\u201d the only preprinted boxes able to be checked are those regarding driving while intoxicated; there is no comparable section regarding the initial stop. Addition<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>ally, in regard to the specific section of the form most relevant to the present case, \u201cCERTIFICATION OF POLICE OFFICER,\u201d the instructions do not direct the police officer to indicate why he or she stopped the driver in the first place, only what the police officer\u2019s reasonable grounds were to believe the driver was under the influence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-5\">I, the undersigned officer, had <em>reasonable grounds to believe </em>that the driver described and named above had <em>been driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle </em>on the highway or any private property that is used by the public in general in this State while <em>under the influence of alcohol, </em>while impaired by alcohol ... (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Based on the requirements of \u00a7 16-205.1, Barnhart\u2019s insertion of a notation on the form that \u201cvehicle] [was] stopped on reasonable grounds\u201d is superfluous to his later reasons to suspect intoxication, and if stricken from the DR-15A, the reasons for harboring suspicion of intoxicated driving would stand still because the Deputy detailed the smell of alcohol, slurred speech, and failed SFSTs on the DR-15A, which led to confirmatory 0.16 BAC readings on the two mechanical tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">An accused driver\u2019s right to argue that the officer acted in bad faith in making the initial stop or collecting the evidence of intoxication is acknowledged. In <em>Shea, </em>415 Md. at 17 n. 10, 997 A.2d at 777 n. 10, we ameliorated concerns about the lack of Fourth Amendment applicability to administrative hearings by explaining that COMAR 11.11.02.10(H)(1) provides for the possible exclusion of tainted evidence in an administrative hearing if it is shown the officer acted in bad faith. The ALJ, however, assumes good faith on the part of the officer unless the accused provides evidence of bad faith and asserts how it affects the hearing. <em>Richards, </em>356 Md. at 378, 739 A.2d at 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">For example, Illiano attempted to mount a bad faith argument by accusing the officer of fabricating the reasons for the initial traffic stop and the events that occurred after their first contact. <em>Illiano, </em>390 Md. at 271, 888 A.2d at 333. The ALJ found incredulous Illiano\u2019s description of the events <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>leading up to her being administered a PBT and, therefore, rejected her argument. <em>Illiano, </em>390 Md. at 271-72, 888 A.2d at 333. In <em>Chase v. State, </em>309 Md. 224, 253, 522 A.2d 1348, 1362 (1987), we held that credible evidence showing the officer\u2019s improper motives may be adduced by the accused in such a way that would be sufficient to require the State to rebut it and attempt to re-establish that the officer\u2019s actions were in accord with reasonable law enforcement activities. Bad faith is an affirmative defense, and it was incumbent upon Lipella to present evidence tending to show bad faith on the part of Deputy Barnhart. <em>See also Sheetz v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Balt., </em>315 Md. 208, 213, 553 A.2d 1281, 1283 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Lipella did not adduce at the administrative hearing evidence of bad faith on Barnhart\u2019s part; rather, he contended only that he could not begin to argue bad faith without knowing, from Barnhart\u2019s pen, why he was stopped initially. Lipella did not attempt to cure this deficiency, even after the AL J made it clear that, absent proof of bad faith, he would not consider the underlying traffic stop in his analysis of whether the MVA made out a prima facie case of Lipella\u2019s operation of his vehicle while intoxicated. Lipella could have sought a subpoena for Deputy Barnhart to appear for questioning at the suspension hearing; he did not. Lipella had the opportunity to present other evidence in an effort to implicate bad faith in the Deputy\u2019s initial stop; he did not. Having failed to mount a timely bad faith defense, Lipella waived effectively his right to raise such a claim on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">We turn now to whether there is substantial evidence in the administrative record to support the ALJ\u2019s suspension of Lipella\u2019s license. Whether the ALJ had enough evidence to suspend Lipella\u2019s license is determined by examining first the evidence that led the officer to request a breathalyzer test. <em>See Shea, </em>415 Md. at 18, 997 A.2d at 778; <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Shepard, </em>399 Md. 241, 251, 923 A.2d 100, 106 (2007). As established <em>supra, </em>the analysis of the evidence begins when the Deputy made contact with the Lipella.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>The ALJ credited that, after pulling over Lipella in his car, Deputy Barnhart detected a strong odor of alcohol and slurred speech emanating from Lipella. These indications were recorded on the DR-15A, which was enough to support reasonable suspicion to require Lipella to undertake the SFSTs. Lipella\u2019s failure in performing the SFSTs was recorded on the DR-15A. These factors led Deputy Barnhart to ask Lipella to submit to a field PBT, as authorized by \u00a7 16-205.1, resulting in a BAC of 0.16 reading. The 0.16 BAC result provided Deputy Barnhart with reasonable suspicion to transport Lipella to the Washington County Sheriffs Office for an official breathalyzer test. After reading the required DR-15, Advice of Rights, to Lipella, a toxicologist administered the official breathalyzer test, which resulted in a 0.16 BAC reading. The ALJ determined that the intoxication indications-slurred speech, odor of alcohol, failed SFSTs, and a PBT result of 0.16, as articulated on the DR-15A, along with the Result of Test for Alcohol Concentration Form, signed by the toxicologist-were sufficient for the MVA to make its prima facie case.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">We conclude that the ALJ\u2019s findings and conclusions that Deputy Barnhart possessed reasonable grounds to request Lipella to submit to a formal breathalyzer test at the Washington County Sheriffs Office were supported by evidence in the record as a whole, and that that evidence demonstrated Lipella\u2019s violation of \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(l)(i)(2). The ALJ\u2019s decision to affirm suspension of Lipella\u2019s driver\u2019s license for ninety days per \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(l)(i)(2)(A) was correct and supported by substantial evidence. The Circuit Court erred in reversing the ALJ\u2019s suspension of Lipella\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WASHINGTON COUNTY REVERSED.

It should be noted that <em>Thomas </em>was decided after Lipella's MVA hearing and the Circuit Court\u2019s review.
