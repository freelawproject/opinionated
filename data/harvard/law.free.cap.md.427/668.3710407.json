In that proceeding, the parties contested physical and legal custody of their two daughters. Prior to the merits hearing, a Circuit Court judge ordered preparation by court-related personnel a custody investigation report (hereinafter referred to sometimes as the \u201creport\u201d) to evaluate the custodial abilities of each parent. Apparently, the Circuit Court has in place a local, unwritten policy or \u201crule\u201d (as Mother\u2019s attorney referred to it in briefing and oral argument before us) that limits counsel of record in any child custody proceeding to viewing a single copy of such a report only in person in the Family Division Clerk\u2019s Office during normal public business hours. Counsel of record may make only hand-written notes of the contents of the report, yet are forbidden from copying verbatim significant passages.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-11\">The report in the present case was completed one week before the merits hearing. Mother\u2019s counsel was able only to review, in person and pre-hearing, the report for approximately 90 minutes. As a consequence, Mother\u2019s attorney moved, prior to commencement of the merits hearing, to exclude the report or, alternatively, to be provided with a copy of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>report. The Circuit Court denied the motion. At the conclusion of the hearing (during which the author of the report testified and the report was received in evidence on motion of Father\u2019s counsel), the judge granted a divorce and awarded custody of the children to Father, with visitation to Mother. The Court of Special Appeals, upon Mother\u2019s appeal, affirmed, in an unreported opinion, the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Mother petitioned successfully this Court for a writ of certiorari. <em>Sumpter v. Sumpter, </em>424 Md. 629, 37 A.3d 317 (2012). Neither Father\u2019s nor the children\u2019s best-interest attorneys opposed Mother\u2019s petition and, moreover, did not file briefs with this Court or appear at oral argument. Mother poses the question, \u201cDid the Court of Special Appeals err in refusing to vacate and remand the case to the [Cjircuit [Cjourt when the parties, their counsel[,] and the best interest attorney were not provided a copy of the custody investigation report[,] in violation of constitutional due process and the Maryland Rules?\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">If, as represented by Mother\u2019s counsel, the policy or rule is applied uniformly and vigorously to custody proceedings in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (as it was in this case), we may have reservations about its viability. We are apprehensive, however, to make a conclusive determination on the present case for at least two reasons. First, we are uncomfortable with the state of the record, which does not purport to elucidate the full contours of the policy or rule and how it is applied. Apparently, the policy or rule is unwritten. The only tangible and direct indicia in the record of the existence of the policy or rule (other than some verbal exchanges between the judge and counsel at the hearings) is a letter to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>Mother\u2019s counsel, which informed them that the report was completed and may be reviewed at the Family Division Clerk\u2019s Office. The scanty record does not reveal when or why the Circuit Court enacted the policy or rule originally. Second, Mother\u2019s appeals before this Court and the Court of Special Appeals were unopposed. Neither Father\u2019s nor the children\u2019s best-interest attorney filed responsive briefs or argued orally at either appellate level. No potentially interested person, e.g., the State Attorney General\u2019s Office on behalf of the Circuit Court or the hearing judge, moved to participate as an amicus curiae. Thus, Mother\u2019s contentions in this regard were uncontested, and, as such, the appellate \u201cdebate\u201d has been one-sided so far.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Therefore, we shall direct remand of the case ultimately to the Circuit Court, without affirmance or reversal, for supplementation of the record as to the full contours of the relevant policy or rule, why it exists (if it does), what (if any) alternatives were considered, any written expression(s) of the relevant rule or policy, and its application generally. Md. Rule 8-604(d)(1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Further, when the case returns to this Court, we invite the Office of the Attorney General of Maryland, in its role as legal counsel to the Circuit Court, to address, as amicus curiae, Mother\u2019s arguments in the present case regarding the viability and effect of the asserted policy or rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">The following evidentiary facts were adduced at the two-day merits custody/divorce hearing in the Circuit Court, held on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>13-14 December 2010. Mother, Father, and the children were represented each by counsel at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Mother and Father were married in Tennessee on 27 November 2001. The marriage yielded two daughters. The parties separated in June 2006. For some time thereafter, apparently by agreement of the parties, the children lived alternately with Mother in Baltimore, Maryland, and with Father in Edgewood, Maryland. In 2007, Mother and the children left Maryland and, after a brief stay in Georgia, settled in Jacksonville, Florida. The children spent the summer of 2007 with Father in Edgewood before returning to Mother in Jacksonville. In March 2008, Mother discovered that one of the daughters was assaulted sexually in Jacksonville by someone with whom Mother had a personal relationship. She sent the children to live with their maternal grandmother in Tennessee. The children returned to Jacksonville in late June/early July 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Another traumatic series of events took place in and around Mother\u2019s Jacksonville residence on 20 July 2008. Dari Waters, Mother\u2019s first cousin, attacked her in her home. The cousin then left Mother\u2019s home and murdered an individual living nearby. Jacksonville police officers responded to the incident and shot fatally the cousin when he resisted arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">The children returned to Maryland during the summer of 2009. They lived with Father and his fianc\u00e9e in Baltimore. At the merits hearing, the parties disputed the intended duration of the children\u2019s time with Father in Baltimore in 2009-2010. Mother testified that she permitted the children to live with Father for the 2009-2010 school year only. The hearing judge concluded, however, based on the testimony of non-party witnesses, that the parties agreed to allow the children to live with Father indefinitely.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">Father, self-represented at the time, filed a complaint for absolute divorce on 24 March 2010, seeking also sole physical and legal custody of the children. In response, Mother made several attempts, judicially and extra-judicially, to regain control of the children. First, she fabricated a story to dupe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>Father into sending the children to Georgia. She told Father that a relative of the children was injured mortally in Georgia, and that the relative wanted to see the children before the relative died. Father was skeptical of Mother\u2019s claim and refused to allow the girls to leave. Second, Mother attempted unsuccessfully to remove the children from their Baltimore school, without Father\u2019s permission or knowledge. Third, Mother went to the .Circuit Court courthouse to obtain an order granting her emergency custody of the children. A daughter from a previous marriage accompanied her. Serendipitously, Father was in the courthouse at the same time, accompanied by his fiancee and mother. The two entourages met and an altercation ensued. Father was charged with assault as a result, but the charge was <em>nol prossed </em>subsequently.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Father obtained counsel. His counsel filed an amended complaint for absolute divorce on 24 May 2010. The amended complaint requested temporary custody of the two children and an injunction against Mother from removing them from Maryland. Mother, self-represented at the time, filed an answer that same day, seeking custody of the girls. On 15 June 2010, Mother secured two pro bono publico attorneys. On 12 July 2010, the Circuit Court appointed a best-interest attorney for the children.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The merits hearing was scheduled for 13-14 December 2010. Prior to the hearing, the hearing judge ordered the Adoption and Custody Unit for the Circuit Court (\u201cACU\u201d) to evaluate the custodial abilities of the parents and to prepare a written custody investigation report. The judge directed that the report be completed by 1 November 2010. The ACU, however, did not complete the report until 3 December 2010. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>On that date, the ACU mailed to Mother\u2019s counsel (and presumably to counsel for Father and the children) a letter stating that the report could be reviewed by visiting the Family Division Clerk\u2019s Office in the courthouse. The letter did not elaborate further about the asserted Circuit Court policy or rule regarding access to custody investigation reports generally. Moreover, presumably, as the order directing preparation of the report provided, the hearing judge was sent a copy of the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">The report totals 164 pages and contains sensitive, personal information about the children, the parties, and the parties\u2019 families. The report is divided into two parts, findings and appendices. The findings are spread over 17 pages, but do not reach a conclusory recommendation regarding custody of the children. Rather, the findings summarize ACU-staff interviews with the children, the parties, and the parties\u2019 families, as well as recitation of their personal, criminal, health, education, housing, child protective services, and employment histories. The 17 appendices comprise the remaining 147 pages and contain supporting documentation for the findings. The appendices include Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services records for Mother, Father, and Father\u2019s fianc\u00e9e; school records for the children; mental health records for the children and Mother; peace orders awarded to Father\u2019s mother and Father\u2019s fianc\u00e9e against Mother; peace orders award to Mother against Father and Father\u2019s fianc\u00e9e; a guilty plea by Mother in a matter in the Superior Court of Liberty County, Georgia; a Jacksonville police report about the death of Mother\u2019s cousin; and, an order of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City removing a child of Mother from another marriage from the \u201cChild in Need of Assistance\u201d (\u201cCINA\u201d) program and placing her in Mother\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">On 6 December 2010, Mother\u2019s counsel received the letter notice from the ACU that the custody investigation report was available for viewing. That same day, both of her counsel visited the Family Division Clerk\u2019s Office at 2:30 p.m. It is represented to us by Mother that the Circuit Court has an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>unwritten policy or \u201crule\u201d that limits parties\u2019 attorneys\u2019 access to custody investigation reports. The rule prohibits counsel from viewing the report outside of the Family Division Clerk\u2019s Office and prohibits copying the report in any manner. Handwritten notes made from viewing the report are permitted, so long as verbatim transcription of significant passages are not made.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> How the latter provision is enforced goes unexplained. Mother\u2019s counsel studied and took notes from the report for 90 minutes, until the Family Division Clerk\u2019s Office closed to the public for the day and counsel was obliged to leave. Due to their self-described \u201cincredibly full\u201d schedules, Mother\u2019s two attorneys did not see the custody investigation report again until the merits hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">On 13 December 2010, the first day of the divorce and custody hearing, one of Mother\u2019s counsel moved in limine to exclude from evidence the custody investigation report or, in the alternative, that the hearing judge provide the parties\u2019 attorneys with copies of it. Mother\u2019s counsel argued that the application of the Circuit Court policy or \u201crule\u201d prejudiced his client\u2019s case for two primary reasons. First, the policy or rule prevented Mother\u2019s counsel from consulting with independent experts in preparation for the merits hearing. Second, the limited time to review and access the custody investigation report prevented Mother\u2019s counsel from reviewing the \u201cvoluminous\u201d report sufficiently to prepare for the hearing. Specifically, the \u201crule\u201d limited their ability to prepare Mother to testify and to prepare cross-examination of the author of the report, especially because the report was completed and made \u201cavailable\u201d only one week before the hearing. Prior to ruling on the motion, the hearing judge asked if Mother\u2019s counsel requested a continuance for additional time to review the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>report. Mother\u2019s lead counsel stated, \u201cI don\u2019t need a continuance, Your Honor. I need an actual copy of the report.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The hearing judge denied the motion. He explained that the Circuit Court imposes \u201cpractical restrictions\u201d on the access to custody investigation reports because of the sensitive information contained in them. He stated further that the burden is on counsel to create time in their hectic schedules to review the report sufficiently, at the Clerk\u2019s office, in order to prepare for the hearing. The judge reviewed also the content of the 17 appendices to the report. He observed that most of the documents in the appendices appeared to him to be easy to comprehend and otherwise already in possession of the parties or obtainable elsewhere by them. With regard to being unable to prepare and conduct a thorough examination of the report\u2019s author, the hearing judge observed that, \u201cwhile there is a prohibition on copying the report, there is no prohibition on having the report and using it in the course of the proceedings in the courtroom.\u201d The judge granted the parties\u2019 attorneys access to the custody investigation report during the hearing for purposes of examining witnesses. The hearing judge, however, would not permit the attorneys to study the report over the lunch break.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">The decision to limit the attorneys\u2019 access to the custody investigation report during the hearing proved, at times, a hindrance to the flow of the proceeding. The scene is reminiscent of the Greek mythological story of three Cyclopes with one eye between them that had to be passed around as needed or desired. Just before Father\u2019s attorney commenced her examination of the report\u2019s author, the following exchange occurred between the parties\u2019 attorneys and the judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_1\">MOTHER\u2019S ATTORNEY: Your Honor, may I have the custody report to use\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-7\">THE COURT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-8\">MOTHER\u2019S ATTORNEY: \u2014 to prepare for my cross-examination?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-9\">FATHER\u2019S ATTORNEY: Your Honor, actually, I was about to ask the same thing\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>THE COURT: Well, you\u2019re going to have to share it, then.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYK\">FATHER\u2019S ATTORNEY: \u2014 for purposes of examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-5\">THE COURT: Let\u2019s have [Father\u2019s Attorney] have it now, since it\u2019s her examination. [Mother\u2019s Attorney], if you need a few minute break before you cross, I\u2019ll allow you that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Additionally, Father\u2019s attorney requested the court\u2019s indulgence on three occasions while she located specific content in the report, explaining, \u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019m not that familiar with the report.\u201d Prior to Mother\u2019s cross-examination of the report\u2019s author, the hearing judge offered Mother\u2019s counsel a brief recess to review the report. Lead counsel declined, stating that his co-counsel would follow along in the report during his examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">At the end of the testimony of the report\u2019s author, Father\u2019s attorney moved to have the child custody report entered in evidence. Mother\u2019s lead counsel renewed his objection based on not having been given a copy of the report, reiterating the reasons articulated in his pre-hearing objection. He urged further that the report was cumulative, in light of the author\u2019s live testimony, thus diminishing the need to submit a document containing \u201cdouble, triple, and quadruple hearsay.\u201d The hearing judge overruled Mother\u2019s objection and allowed the report into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the judge granted a divorce and sole legal and physical custody of the children to Father. The judge observed that Father\u2019s testimony was credible and that he provided a stable environment for the children. He observed further that Mother had an \u201cimpaired\u201d character; admittedly lied to the court; failed to respond sufficiently to the sexual assault of her child; and attempted to remove surreptitiously the children from Maryland. He required that Mother be consulted by Father about \u201cmajor decisions involving the children\u201d and that she have access to the children\u2019s health and school records. The hearing judge awarded Mother a specific visitation schedule, attuned to holidays and the academic school year.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>Mother noted timely an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. Neither Father\u2019s nor the children\u2019s best-interest attorneys appealed or cross-appealed, nor filed a responsive brief with that court. Mother argued that the Circuit Court policy or \u201crule\u201d denying her counsel a copy of the report violated her due process rights.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A unanimous panel of the Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, affirmed the Circuit Court. The panel concluded that there was no violation of Mother\u2019s due process rights for two primary reasons. First, although having weeks to review the custody investigation report while preparing her appeal, Mother did not argue that any of the report\u2019s findings were untrue, misleading, or rebuttable. The panel concluded also that apparently Mother\u2019s counsel was knowledgeable sufficiently about the report at the time of the merits hearing in the Circuit Court because he did not move for a continuance and declined a recess to review the report prior to his cross-examination of the report\u2019s author. The panel\u2019s unreported opinion, however, indicated that its decision was a close call, noting that the Circuit Court\u2019s apparent access policy regarding custody investigation reports \u201ccould, under certain circumstances, be unfair to a litigant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A2e\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Mother continues to argue primarily that the Circuit Court policy or \u201crule\u201d violated her due process rights. Specifically, her counsel\u2019s limited access to the custody investigation report denied her the right \u201cto be aware of all of the evidence considered by the trier of fact in making an adjudicatory determination and to have the opportunity to challenge and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>answer that evidence.\u201d <em>Denningham v. Denningham, </em>49 Md.App. 328, 337, 431 A.2d 755, 760 (1981) (concluding that a judge violated appellant-father\u2019s due process rights by denying parties access to the custody investigation report that was admitted later into evidence). Although recognizing that, unlike in <em>Denningham, </em>her counsel had <em>some </em>access to the relevant custody investigation report, Mother maintains that the Circuit Court policy or rule is so restrictive that she was denied effectively the opportunity to review, challenge, and respond to the report in a meaningful manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Mother recapitulates the assertedly prejudicial limitations of the policy or rule that she identified at the custody hearing. First, the limited access to the custody investigation report prevented her counsel from reviewing sufficiently the \u201cvoluminous\u201d report and appendices. As a result, Mother\u2019s counsel could not prepare Mother for her hearing testimony, could not challenge fully the evidence by interviewing witnesses whose statements were incorporated in the report, and could not prepare an exacting cross-examination of the report\u2019s author. Further, without a copy of the report, Mother\u2019s counsel could not refer to the report during opposing counsel\u2019s examination (recalling that the hearing judge permitted only the examining attorney to possess the sole copy of the report during direct examination). Second, the rule prevented Mother\u2019s counsel from consulting pre-hearing with possible independent experts. The Circuit Court policy or rule limits attorneys to taking handwritten notes, which, she argues, lack the detail and context necessary for an expert to appreciate what he or she is expected to analyze and perhaps respond critically. <em>See </em>American Psychological Association, <em>Speciality Guidelines for Forensic Psychology, </em>http://www.apa.org/practice/guidelines/ forensic-psychology.aspx (last visited 10 July 2012) (highlighting rules 1.02 and 2.01, which require forensic psychologists to \u201cweigh all data, opinions, and rival hypothesis impartially\u201d and to base their competency on the \u201cpreparation and study they are able to devote to the matter\u201d). Mother argues also that the seven day notice of the report\u2019s completion and availability exacerbated the adverse effects of application of the Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>Court policy or rule in this particular case. Mother\u2019s counsel were limited in their ability to collaborate with her because she lived in Georgia at the time just prior to the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">The Circuit Court and the Court of Special Appeals endeavored to explain why Mother was not prejudiced by application of the policy or rule. The Circuit Court opined that the custody investigation report was comprehensible, without the need for intensive study. The Court of Special Appeals agreed, noting that Mother\u2019s counsel declined a continuance to review further the report, indicating, to it at least, that counsel was prepared sufficiently.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The intermediate appellate court added that Mother did not contend on appeal before it that any portion of the report was untrue, misleading, or rebuttable. The Circuit Court justified the policy or rule also by noting that its existence protects sensitive material about the parties and their children from being re-published more generally.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Circuit Court believed that an attorney\u2019s professional obligation to keep confidential custody investigation reports is not sufficient unto itself to safeguard the privacy of the parties and implicated individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">One hurdle to issuing a ruling in this case is the dearth of justification in the record for the Circuit Court policy or rule. This absence is significant when the greater context of the law and rules is considered. The report is a \u201ccase record,\u201d defined as \u201ca document, information, or other thing that is collected, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>received, or maintained by a court in connection with one or more specific judicial actions or proceedings.\u201d Md. Rule 16-1001(c)(1)(A), (e)(3). When sealing or limiting access to a case record, a trial judge must make findings about the interest sought to be protected from inspection, supported by specific findings. Md. Rule 16 \u2014 1009(d)(2); <em>see also Balt. Sun Co. v. Colbert, </em>323 Md. 290, 305, 593 A.2d 224, 231 (1991) (citing <em>In re Knight Publ\u2019g Co., </em>743 F.2d 231, 235 (4th Cir.1984) (\u201cA court ruling on a motion to seal judicial records should articulate the interest sought to be protected by the seal, supported by specific findings.\u201d)). When determining whether to preclude or limit inspection of a case record, as was the case here, the trial judge must consider \u201cwhether a special and compelling reason exists\u201d to justify restricted access. Md. Rule 16-1009(d)(4)(A). The trial court\u2019s final order that precludes or limits inspection of a case record \u201cshall be as narrow as practicable in scope and duration to effectuate the interest sought to be protected by the order.\u201d Md. Rule 16-1009(d)(3); <em>see also Colbert, </em>323 Md. at 306, 593 A.2d at 231. Moreover, the trial court must state why alternatives to sealing or limiting access to the case record were rejected. <em>Balt. Sun v. Thanos, </em>92 Md.App. 227, 246, 607 A.2d 565, 574 (1992) (discussing requirements for sealing a pre-sentencing report in a first-degree murder case).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">The limited record before us does not illuminate sufficiently the full contours of the Circuit Court policy or rule, its origin, the balancing of the interests sought to be protected by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>it against competing interests, whether less restrictive alternatives were considered and why they were rejected, and any special or compelling reasons to prohibit the parties\u2019 attorneys from receiving a copy of the custody investigation report. Effective review of the Circuit Court policy or rule is not possible given the paucity of the present record. <em>Thanos, </em>92 Md.App. at 246, 607 A.2d at 574. Therefore, remand to the Circuit Court for supplementation of the record is appropriate. <em>Colbert, </em>323 Md. at 307, 593 A.2d at 232; <em>Thanos, </em>92 Md.App. at 246, 607 A.2d at 574.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">We observe, without concluding, that the custody investigation report may have been \u201csealed\u201d effectively or limited by the Circuit Court policy or rule or otherwise subject to nondisclosure under the Maryland Access to Court Records Rules. The Maryland Access to Court Records Rules state that, generally, court records are presumed open to inspection by the public. Md. Rule 16-1002(a). The context of a custody investigation report, however, may trigger exceptions to the presumption of openness. For instance, the report may be unaccessible to the public because the hearing judge, through invocation of the Circuit Court policy or rule, \u201csealed\u201d it, Md.

In the 156th report of the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, the Rules Committee commented that \u201c[t]he proposed amendment to Rule 16-1002 makes clear that access to a case record by a party to the proceeding or counsel of record is not limited by the Rules in Title 16, Chapter 1000.\u201d Moreover, in the related context of CINA cases,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> counsel of record is permitted to \u201creview\u201d confidential and sensitive evidence about juveniles and their parents contained in the court record. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1973, 2006 RepLVol.), Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 3-827(a)(2)(iii) (allowing a party\u2019s attorney to \u201creview\u201d a confidential court record in a CINA proceeding).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">What constitutes an acceptable opportunity to \u201caccess\u201d or \u201creview\u201d such a record is not conceptualized so easily. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>practice of several other circuit courts around the State<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> concerning pre-hearing access to custody investigation reports indicates that \u201creviewing\u201d such reports includes allowing counsel of record to obtain a pre-hearing copy of a custody investigation report or a pre-hearing transcription of the author\u2019s oral report. In Prince George\u2019s County, for example, it appears that copies of the custody investigation report are made available to the parties\u2019 counsel and the assigned judge. Jeanne F. Allegra, <em>Elements of a Custody Evaluation, in Maryland State Bar Association Family Law News </em>13 (Feb. 2009), <em>available at </em>http://www.msba.org/sec_comm /sections/ family/newsletter/FamLawFebruary09.pdf. In Montgomery County, a \u201ccourt evaluator\u201d presents his or her custody investigation report orally, on the record, at a pre-hearing settlement conference.

A transcript of the evaluator\u2019s oral report may be ordered by a party\u2019s attorney. The Montgomery County Circuit Court may provide, in some cases, a copy of the child custody report to the parties, their counsel, and the assigned judge. In Harford County, a child custody evaluator provides, at a pre-hearing settlement conference, a verbal custody investigation report, which is rendered on the record. <em>Child CustodyfVisitation Evaluations, Family Services Program, Circuit Court for Harford County, </em>http://mdcourts.gov/family/harford. html#custodyevaluations (last visited 10 July 2012). Again, a transcript of the verbal report may be ordered by a party\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Our limited survey of other State circuit court practices concerning pre-merits-hearing access to custody investigation reports suggests that the apparent policy or rule of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, at least as portrayed to date in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>present case, may be much more restrictive than the policies of other circuit courts. Thus, it may be out of the mainstream, for reasons that presently are not apparent entirely. Although not the end-all and be-all of the present bone of contention, we note this seeming outlier status nonetheless. Assuming, for the sake of argument, that we are asked here to address the equivalent of a local rule and that the rule is applied consistently and strictly in that jurisdiction, such a local rule cannot be \u201cinconsistent with or ... superseded by the general rules of practice and procedure.\u201d <em>Bastian v. Watkins, </em>230 Md. 325, 330, 187 A.2d 304, 307 (1963) (discussing a Circuit Court rule regulating who may file pleadings in that court). We are reticent, however, on the state of this record to go \u201call in\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and announce that the Circuit Court\u2019s apparent policy or rule is impermissibly outside the mainstream and, if so, without adequate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">The alternative approaches of the other circuit courts described above, however, seem reasonable and appear to be \u201cas narrow as practicable in scope and duration\u201d to protect the privacy of persons discussed in a custody investigation report, but still allowing a full pre-hearing discovery of relevant evidence. Md. Rule 16-1009(d)(3). These practices enable the parties\u2019 attorneys \u201cto be aware of all of the evidence considered by the trier of fact in making an adjudicatory determination and to have the opportunity to challenge and answer that evidence.\u201d <em>Denningham, </em>49 Md.App. at 335, 431 A.2d at 759.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>The Circuit Court policy or rule here, by comparison, appears to impede significantly that ability. Counsel for the parties, it seems, could access the report pre-hearing only in the Clerk\u2019s office during its public hours, could not make verbatim notes of extensive passages from the report, and could not make or receive copies of the report (or any portion thereof). These limitations curtailed Mother\u2019s counsel\u2019s ability (and presumably Father\u2019s and the children\u2019s best-interest counsel as well) to prepare for the merits hearing, review critically the probable evidence contained in the report, or obtain independent expert opinions. For example, the merits hearing transcript suggests that the parties\u2019 attorneys were not prepared fully to cross-examine the report\u2019s author. At one point, both attorneys requested simultaneously possession of the single available copy of the report. Additionally, counsel received notice that the custody investigation report was completed approximately one week before the hearing. With such a short turnaround, providing the parties\u2019 attorneys with a copy or transcript of the custody investigation report could have provided them with a greater opportunity to incorporate the report into their respective preparation. Further, it may be unfair that parties who must pursue their child custody claims in Baltimore City<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> have diminished access to child custody reports, relative to parties similarly situated in other circuit courts throughout Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">While the seeming practice of Montgomery, Prince George\u2019s, and Harford counties fosters greater pre-hearing access by the parties\u2019 attorneys to custody investigation reports, they seem also to safeguard the privacy of the people discussed in those reports. An attorney\u2019s unique role as an \u201cofficer of the court\u201d diminishes ordinarily, to an acceptable level of risk, the concern that sensitive information in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>report will be disseminated more broadly. Maryland attorneys have an enforceable duty to treat sensitive records with care. <em>See </em>Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (MLRPC) 1.6(a) (\u201cA lawyer shall not reveal information relating to representation of a client unless the client gives informed consent, the disclosure is impliedly authorized in order to carry out the representation,\u201d or permitted by the MLRPC). Further, attorneys are obliged to follow the lawful and considered instructions of the court. <em>Falik v. Hornage, </em>413 Md. 163, 189-90, 991 A.2d 1234, 1250 (2010) (citing MLRPC 3.4(c));<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>see also </em>Md. Rules 15-201 to -208 (empowering the presiding judge to issue sanctions for contempt). Obviously, other circuit courts have confidence that their trial judges can implement confidentiality safeguards that balance sufficiently the privacy concerns of persons mentioned in a custody investigation report with the parties\u2019 and/or their counsels\u2019 need to discover and prepare to address the report\u2019s contents. <em>See Falik, </em>413 Md. at 189-90, 991 A.2d at 1250 (stating that the implementation of confidentiality restrictions should be left to the sound discretion of trial judges).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Although we are wary of the apparent policy or \u201crule\u201d of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City described to us so far, we are even more wary of issuing a definitive holding, as sought by Mother, on the limited, uncontested appellate record in this case.

The record contains a letter from the ACU to counsel, 10 days before trial, stating that the report could be reviewed by visiting the Family Division Clerk\u2019s Office in the courthouse. At trial, the judge explained that the Circuit Court imposes \u201cpractical restrictions\u201d on the access to custody investigation reports because of the sensitive information contained in them. The judge would not permit the attorneys to study the report over the lunch break. During trial, both attorneys requested use of the report at the same time, but the judge did not permit copying to facilitate that, and directed which counsel could use the report first. Thus, there is no need to remand to the Circuit Court to determine whether or how this restricted access policy was applied <em>in this case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">To be sure, the majority\u2019s goal to understand the full terms of the Circuit Court\u2019s policy, the rationale for adoption, and alternatives considered by the Court, is a laudable one. Perhaps we do not have full appreciation of the Circuit Court\u2019s thinking or the experiences with abuses by the parties or attorneys when given such reports. But the majority has not been clear about <em>how </em>the parties should accomplish the proposed \u201csupplementation of the record as to the full contours of the relevant policy or rule, why it exists (if it does), what (if any) alternatives were considered, any written expression(s) of the relevant rule or policy, and its application generally.\u201d Maj. Op. at 672, 50 A.3d at 1100-01. Certainly neither party can subpoena the judges who formulated and adopted the rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>to testify as to the \u201cfull contours\u201d sought by the majority. Moreover, unlike this Court, which has rule-making power and established procedures governing the adoption of rules, including a public hearing, and public records of the hearing as well as the recommendations made to the Court by its Rules Committee, no such power exists in the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">If the majority intends that the Circuit Court should provide some statement and explanation of the rule, either by oral opinion or by providing written documentation of the rule, then the opinion should say so. Absent a directive to that effect, the majority opinion leaves the parties, especially Petitioner, dangling.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The opinion does not say what occurs if Petitioner is unable to discover and add to the record, the \u201cfull contours\u201d of the rule, including the rationale for adoption and alternatives that were considered. Absent full supplementation of the record as called for, there is no clear pathway for the Petitioner to return to this Court for a decision on whether the rule survives the legal challenges posed by Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">If we do not decide the case on the present record, as I think we can, the opinion should direct that we are seeking clarification and explication of the rule or policy <em>by the Circuit Court, </em>and that if the Circuit Court does not provide same, we will decide the issue on the record we have. We certainly have the authority to issue such order. Moreover, often we are faced with a case having a less than desirable record. Normally, we proceed to decide it, allocating the burden of having failed to provide the record to the appropriate party and utilizing presumptions based on that burden. Here, if the record is incomplete regarding the nature of and rationale underlying the policy, it is the Circuit Court\u2019s failure, not that of the parties. The procedure adopted by the majority is not only highly unusual, but, in light of the clear application of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>restriction with respect to this highly relevant report, is decidedly unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Chief Judge BELL authorizes me to state that he joins the views expressed here.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b724-6\">.
