The facts presented in the pleadings indicated that Richardson, a longshoreman, fell asleep at the wheel while traveling home after working a twenty-two hour shift at his job site located at the Port of Baltimore. The injured motorist, Sergeant Michael Barclay, and his wife, Robin Barclay, (collectively, \u201cPetitioners\u201d or \u201cthe Barclays\u201d) filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Carroll County against several parties, including Richardson\u2019s employer, Ports America Baltimore, Inc. (\u201cPorts\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or \u201cRespondent\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>The complaint alleged that Ports was liable for Sgt. Barclay\u2019s injuries under two theories, <em>respondeat superior, </em>and primary negligence in failing to protect the general motoring public from an employee driving home following an unreasonably long shift. Ports filed a motion for summary judgment asserting that neither theory was grounds for relief under the facts presented. First, Ports argued that <em>respondeat superior </em>was inapplicable because Richardson was not acting within the scope of his employment while commuting home from work. Second, Ports contended' that it could not be held primarily liable for the injuries because it owed no duty to the public to ensure that an employee was fit to drive his personal vehicle home. The trial court agreed with Ports and granted the motion. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed. We agree with the judgments entered in both courts and affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">On January 17, 2006, Christopher Richardson was traveling home from work in his personal vehicle, westbound on New Windsor Road in Carroll County, after completing a twenty-two hour shift as a longshoreman at Dundalk Marine Terminal located in the Port of Baltimore. At approximately 7:28 a.m., Richardson fell asleep at the wheel and crossed the center dividing line, causing a head-on collision with Sgt. Michael Barclay of the Anne Arundel County Police Department, who was traveling eastbound on his way to work. Richardson died in the collision and Sgt. Barclay suffered catastrophic injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Richardson was a longshoreman, employed by Ports to operate machinery in order to load and unload vessels that entered the Port of Baltimore. On January 13, 2006, the captain of one such vessel, the \u201cSaudi Tabuk,\u201d notified Ports that it would be late arriving to Baltimore. In an effort to put the ship back on schedule for its next destination, Ports agreed to have longshoremen working around the clock. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>order to assign longshore work, Ports would issue a \u201cwork order\u201d to the Steamship Trade Association (\u201cthe STA\u201d) directing it to dispatch longshoremen who were members of the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association (\u201cthe ILA\u201d) and possessed particular skills that would be required on the specific job. The STA would then offer the shifts to the longshoremen, according to their union seniority. Under the collective bargaining agreement (\u201cCBA\u201d) in place at the time of the collision, a longshoreman could accept or decline a shift, and those who accepted could stay on for as many consecutive shifts<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as desired, in order to maximize earnings, or alternatively, \u201ccheck up,\u201d <em>ie., </em>leave work and go home, at which point the ILA would send the next most senior qualified longshoreman to finish the shift. Although a previous CBA had included a sixteen-hour limit on the workday, the provision had been removed under the agreement in effect at the time of the collision. Ports maintained that the limitation was removed at the insistence of the ILA, because it interfered with the assertion of the longshoremen\u2019s seniority rights. Richardson was initially offered a shift beginning on January 15, 2006, which he declined, and instead accepted an offer to work starting at 8 a.m. on Martin Luther King Day,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> January 16, 2006. He stayed on the job until he finally \u201cchecked-up,\u201d at 6:00 a.m. on January 17th and began the commute that culminated in the tragic incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">The Barclays filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Carroll County on January 24, 2008. The complaint named as defendants Lena Briscoe, Personal Representative of the Estate of Christopher E. Richardson, Ports, the STA, and the ILA. The complaint alleged that defendants Ports, the STA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>and the ILA<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> were vicariously liable for Richardson\u2019s negligence under the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior, </em>and that they also \u201cbreached their duty to the general public not to allow and/or encourage their employees to work in excess of a reasonable number of hours beyond the normal human tolerance,\u201d knowing that the employees commuted to and from work in their personal vehicles. On April 9, 2008, Briscoe filed cross-claims against the same defendants for indemnification. Ports and the STA moved for summary judgment on Barclay\u2019s direct claims and Briscoe\u2019s cross-claims. Following a hearing, the Circuit Court for Carroll County granted the motion on November 10, 2009. The court ruled first that Ports<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> could not be held vicariously liable for Richardson\u2019s acts under the applicable ease law. The Circuit Court judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-4\">[I]t is only when the employee is using his vehicle while carrying out the duties of his employment at the time of the accident that liability may be imposed on an employer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-5\">As P&amp;O Ports correctly argues, Plaintiffs have not presented any evidence to demonstrate that P&amp;O Ports expressly or impliedly consented to Mr. Richardson using his vehicle, let alone for a business purpose, at the time of the accident. Furthermore, the facts admissible as evidence do not indicate that Mr. Richardson\u2019s car was of such vital importance to P&amp;O Ports\u2019 business that employer control over the vehicle could be inferred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">(Internal citation omitted.) The Circuit Court judge also rejected Petitioners\u2019 contention further discussed <em>infra, </em>that the \u201cspecial mission\u201d exception, developed within workers\u2019 compensation law, could be applied in the <em>respondeat superior </em>context.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Lastly, the court rejected Barclay\u2019s argument that Ports was primarily, as opposed to vicariously, liable for allowing its employees to work an unreasonable amount of hours and then endanger the public by driving their personal vehicles home. The Court noted that, under Maryland law, Ports had no duty to protect third parties from fatigued employees acting outside the scope of employment in the absence of a \u201cspecial relationship.\u201d The Circuit Court judge explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-4\">The only special relationship in which an employer could be liable for harm caused to third parties by his employee acting outside the scope of employment is provided in Section 317 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts. Section 317 explains that an employer may have a duty to protect third parties if an employee committed a tortious act on the employer\u2019s property or by using the employer\u2019s chattel. Furthermore, the employer must know or have reason to know that he has control over the employee and understands the necessity of exercising control. None of these requirements are met in this case, in that the automobile accident occurred on a public road while Mr. Richardson was driving his own vehicle. Plaintiffs have not introduced any facts to show that P&amp;O Ports had the authority to control Mr. Richardson\u2019s driving to and from work. This Court does not find that a special relationship existed which would create a duty by P&amp;O Ports to protect a third party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Following this disposition, and pursuant to the Barclays\u2019 motion, the Circuit Court judge stayed proceedings between the Barclays and Briscoe, Personal Representative of the Estate of Christopher Richardson, and entered final judgments<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in favor of the STA and Ports. The Barclays then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>noted a timely appeal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Barclay v. Ports Am. Baltimore, Inc., </em>198 Md.App. 569, 18 A.3d 932 (2011). We granted Petitioners\u2019 request for a writ of certiorari, and now address the following questions, restated and reordered for brevity and clarity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-4\">1) Did the Circuit Court err in granting the motion for summary judgment when disputes of material fact existed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-5\">2) Can an employer be vicariously liable, under the \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d exception to the coming and going rule, for injuries suffered by a third party when an employee falls asleep at the wheel while driving home from an unreasonably long shift?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-6\">3) Do employers owe a duty to the motoring public to ensure that an employee not drive home when an extended work schedule caused sleep deprivation, increasing the likelihood that the employee could fall asleep at the wheel and cause injury to a third party?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Respondent also filed a cross-petition for certiorari, which asked two questions. The first asked, in essence, whether the Court of Special Appeals erred by suggesting, in <em>dicta, </em>that an employer may be liable for injuries caused by a fatigued employee during the commute home where the employer scheduled the employee to work unexpectedly long hours. The second inquired, essentially, whether Petitioners\u2019 claim that Ports allowed its employees to work in excess of a reasonable number of hours is so intertwined with the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (\u201cCBA\u201d) that state law in this case is preempted by federal labor law. We do not reach the questions raised by the cross-petition.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">Under Maryland Rule 2-501, the grant of a motion for summary judgment is appropriate only \u201cif the motion and response show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Rule 2-501(f). As we recently stated in <em>Muskin v. State Dep\u2019t of Assessments &amp; Taxation, </em>422 Md. 544, 30 A.3d 962 (2011), \u201c[w]hether a circuit court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is proper in a particular case is a question of law, subject to a non-deferential review on appeal.\u201d <em>Muskin, </em>422 Md. at 554, 30 A.3d at 967 (citing <em>Conaway v. Deane, </em>401 Md. 219, 243, 932 A.2d 571, 584 (2007); <em>Charles Cnty. Comm\u2019rs v. Johnson, </em>393 Md. 248, 263, 900 A.2d 753, 762 (2006)). Thus, \u201c[t]he standard of review of a trial court\u2019s grant of a motion for summary judgment on the law is ... whether the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions were legally correct.\u201d <em>Messing v. Bank of Am., N.A., </em>373 Md. 672, 684, 821 A.2d 22, 28 (2003) (citations omitted). \u201cIn reviewing a grant of summary judgment, we independently review the record to determine whether the parties generated a dispute of material fact and, if not, whether the moving party was entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Charles Cnty. Comm\u2019rs, </em>393 Md. at 263, 900 A.2d at 762 (internal quotation omitted). In determining whether a fact is material we have said that \u201ca dispute as to facts relating to grounds upon which the decision is not rested is not a dispute with respect to a <em>material </em>fact and such dispute does not prevent the entry of summary judgment.\u201d <em>O\u2019Connor v. Baltimore Cnty., </em>382 Md. 102, 111, 854 A.2d 1191, 1196 (2004) (quoting <em>Lippert v. Jung, </em>366 Md. 221, 227, 783 A.2d 206, 209 (2001)); <em>see Matthews v. Howell, </em>359 Md. 152, 161, 753 A.2d 69, 73 (2000) (\u201cA material fact is a fact the resolution of which will somehow affect the outcome of the case.\u201d (quotation omitted)); <em>Lynx, Inc. v. Ordnance Prods., Inc., </em>273 Md. 1, 8, 327 A.2d 502, 509 (1974) (noting that a material fact is that which is \u201cnecessary to resolve the controversy as a matter of law[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>We review the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and construe any reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the well-pled facts against the moving party. <em>D\u2019Aoust v. Diamond, </em>424 Md. 549, 574, 36 A.3d 941, 955 (2012) (citations omitted). Further, an appellate court ordinarily should limit its review of a grant of a motion for summary judgment to \u201conly the grounds upon which the trial court relied in granting summary judgment.\u201d <em>MRA Prop. Mgmt. v. Armstrong, </em>426 Md. 83 n. 17, 43 A.3d 397 (2012) (citing <em>River Walk Apartments, LLC v. Twigg, </em>396 Md. 527, 542, 914 A.2d 770, 779 (2007)); <em>accord Messing, </em>373 Md. at 684, 821 A.2d at 28 (\u201c[W]e review the trial court\u2019s ruling on the law, considering the same material from the record and deciding the same legal issues as the circuit court.\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Petitioners contend that there were material issues of fact that precluded the grant of summary judgment in this case. Specifically, they note disputes surrounding the extent of Ports\u2019 ability to control the work schedule of its employees and whether Ports had knowledge of both Richardson\u2019s fatigue and the fact that he was planning on driving home. Although we agree that these are factual disagreements, none of them rise to the level of materiality under our case law as the resolution of those facts would not affect the outcome of this case. <em>See D'Aoust, </em>424 Md. at 575, 36 A.3d at 956; <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>382 Md. at 111, 854 A.2d at 1196; <em>Matthews, </em>359 Md. at 161, 753 A.2d at 73; <em>Lynx, </em>273 Md. at 8, 327 A.2d at 509. This is evident upon the consideration of the applicable precedent, to which we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">This Court has recognized consistently the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior, </em>as \u201cit is hornbook law that an employer is ordinarily responsible for the tortious conduct of his employee committed while the servant was acting within the scope of the employment relationship.\u201d <em>Embrey v. Holly, </em>293 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Md. 128, 134, 442 A.2d 966, 969 (1982); <em>accord S. Mgmt. Corp. v. Taha, </em>378 Md. 461, 480-81, 836 A.2d 627, 638 (2003); <em>Oaks v. Connors, </em>339 Md. 24, 30, 660 A.2d 423, 426 (1995); <em>Dhanraj v. Potomac Electric Power Co., </em>305 Md. 623, 627, 506 A.2d 224, 226 (1986); Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 219 (1958). The doctrine is based on the principle that \u201c[bjecause \u2018the master holds out his servant as competent and fit to be trusted, ... he in effect warrants his servant\u2019s fidelity and good conduct in all matters within the scope of his employment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Oaks, </em>339 Md. at 30, 660 A.2d at 426 (quoting <em>Globe Indem. Co. v. Victill Corp., </em>208 Md. 573, 580, 119 A.2d 423, 427 (1956)). We have stated that, \u201c[fjor an employee\u2019s tortious acts to be considered within the scope of employment, the acts must have been in furtherance of the employer\u2019s business and authorized by the employer.\u201d <em>Taha, </em>378 Md. at 481, 836 A.2d at 638 (citing <em>Sawyer v. Humphries, </em>322 Md. 247, 255, 587 A.2d 467, 470 (1991)). Ordinarily, the issue of whether a particular act is within the scope of employment is properly decided by a jury, however, \u201cwhere there is no conflict in the evidence relating to the question and but one inference can be drawn therefrom, the question is one of law for the court.\u201d <em>Sheets v. Chepko, </em>83 Md.App. 44, 47, 573 A.2d 413, 414 (1990) (quotation omitted); <em>see Drug Fair of Md., Inc. v. Smith, </em>263 Md. 341, 346-347, 283 A.2d 392, 396 (1971) (\u201cWe recognize that the issue of whether a servant is acting within the scope of his employment is ordinarily a question for the jury but this is so, only if there is a factual dispute.\u201d (citations omitted)); <em>Lewis v. Accelerated Express, Inc., </em>219 Md. 252, 256, 148 A.2d 783, 785 (1959) (\u201c[Ujnder proper circumstances, the question of an act being within the scope of an employee\u2019s employment may become one of law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">We have twice considered, in depth, how the rule functions with respect to an employee\u2019s use of his or her personal automobile during a commute. In <em>Dhanraj v. Potomac Electric Power Co., </em>305 Md. 623, 506 A.2d 224 (1986), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIZ\">[Ojn account of the extensive use of the motor vehicle with its accompanying dangers, the courts have realized that a strict application of the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior </em>in the modern commercial world would result in great injus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>tice____ It is now held by the great weight of authority that a master will not be held responsible for [the] negligent operation of a servant\u2019s automobile, even though engaged at the time in furthering the master\u2019s business unless the master expressly or impliedly consents to the use of the automobile, and ... had the right to control the servant in its operation, or else the use of the automobile was of such vital importance in furthering the master\u2019s business that his control over it might reasonably be inferred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-5\"><em>Dhanraj, </em>305 Md. at 627-28, 506 A.2d at 226 (quoting <em>Henkelmann v. Insurance Co., </em>180 Md. 591, 599, 26 A.2d 418, 422-23 (1942)). In <em>Dhanraj, </em>the plaintiff attempted to hold an employer hable for injuries an employee caused while operating his personal vehicle during a commute from his home to an employer-operated training facility. We upheld summary judgment in favor of the employer because the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior </em>could only \u201cbe properly invoked if the master has, expressly or impliedly, authorized the [servant] to use his [or her] personal vehicle <em>in the execution of his [or her] duties, </em>and the employee [wa]s in fact engaged in such endeavors at the time of the accident.\u201d <em>Dhanraj, </em>305 Md. at 628, 506 A.2d at 226 (internal quotation and citations omitted). Under the facts presented, it was clear that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVJ\">[a]side from the initial request for attendance ... [the employer] was completely uninvolved in the travel aspect of the temporary assignment. [The employer] did not specify the mode of transportation or the route of travel.... [The employees\u2019] workday started when they arrived at the training center and ended when they departed. All commuting was done on their own time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-6\"><em>Dhanraj, </em>305 Md. at 625, 506 A.2d at 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Indeed, we emphasized that \u201c[i]t is essentially the employee\u2019s own responsibility to get to or from work.\u201d <em>Dhanraj, </em>305 Md. at 628, 506 A.2d at 226 (citing Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 229 cmt. d (1958)). Therefore, we announced that \u201cthe general rule is that absent special circumstances, an employer will not be vicariously liable for the negligent conduct of his employee occurring while the employee is traveling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>to or from work.\u201d <em>Dhanraj, </em>305 Md. at 628, 506 A.2d at 226. The employee in <em>Dkanraj </em>argued that the travel allowance was a \u201cspecial circumstance\u201d sufficient to establish the employer\u2019s consent to the use of the automobile and thereby invoke the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior. Dhanraj, </em>305 Md. at 628-29, 506 A.2d at 226-27. We rejected that argument, noting that the allowance was not tied to a particular mode of transportation, but was paid to an employee merely for reporting to work, or leaving work from, a location outside of his or her \u201cbase zone.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It was clear under the facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-4\">There was no consent, express or implied, by [the employer] to the use of [the employee\u2019s] automobile as the means of transportation to the training facility; [the employer] was not concerned with how he got there or how he got home at the close of the workday. [The employee] was entitled to the same allowance had he traveled in his own car, or as a passenger in another\u2019s car, or hired a taxicab, or walked, or even if he stayed for the [six-week training period] in a nearby motel. He used his automobile by his own choice and for his personal convenience; he was under no instruction, direction or duty to use it. The expense of the operation of the automobile was not born by [the employer], and [the employer] had no right of control over [the employee] in regard to it. The allowance paid did not represent maintenance of the automobile, nor was it based on the expense of its operation. In short, he could travel to and from the facility as he pleased, by any means or route he chose. [The employer\u2019s] only concern was that he take the course, not how he got there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-5\"><em>Dhanraj, </em>305 Md. at 630, 506 A.2d at 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">We reviewed and reaffirmed the same principles in <em>Oaks v. Connors, </em>339 Md. 24, 660 A.2d 423 (1995), where we again upheld a summary disposition in favor of the employer after a third party was injured by the alleged negligence of an employee commuting to work. In that case, the employer, Giant Food, Inc., required the employee to have a personal vehicle available for use in his duties as an ATM Sergeant, and would reimburse him for travel between his \u201chome store\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>the stores he visited. At the time of the collision, however, the employee was commuting from his residence to his \u201chome store\u201d and therefore had not yet begun his workday. We again pointed out that \u201c[d]riving to and from work is generally not considered to be within the scope of a servant\u2019s employment because getting to work is the employee\u2019s own responsibility and ordinarily does not involve advancing the employer\u2019s interests.\u201d <em>Oaks, </em>339 Md. at 32, 660 A.2d at 427 (citing <em>Dhanraj, </em>305 Md. at 628, 506 A.2d at 226, and Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 229 cmt. d (1958)).

It is clear that under <em>Dhanraj </em>and <em>Oaks, </em>any \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d must simply prove that the employee is, in fact, not only commuting to or from work, but additionally, is using his personal vehicle, as authorized by the employer, to engage in the execution of his duties on behalf of the employer.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Dhan</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number><em>raj, </em>305 Md. at 628, 506 A.2d at 226; <em>Oaks, </em>339 Md. at 31, 660 A.2d at 427.

Richardson chose to drive to and from work for his own convenience.

Ports paid none of the expenses associated with operating the automobile, and Ports had no control over Richardson in regard to its operation nor was its use \u201cof such vital importance in furthering the master\u2019s business that his control over it might [be] reasonably inferred.\u201d <em>See Dhanraj, </em>305 Md. at 631, 506 A.2d at 228.

In short, in accordance with our holdings in <em>Dhanraj </em>and <em>Oaks, </em>because Richardson was neither authorized to use his personal vehicle in the execution of his duties, nor engaged in those duties at the time of the collision, Ports may not be held vicariously liable for Richardson\u2019s motor vehicle tort. <em>See Dhanraj, </em>305 Md. at 628, 506 A.2d at 226; <em>Oaks, </em>339 Md. at 31, 660 A.2d at 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Petitioners next argue that Respondent is primarily, as opposed to vicariously, liable for Sgt.

In <em>Robertson v.

The case, however, is factually distinguishable from the instant case. In <em>Robertson, </em>the employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>had knowledge of the employee\u2019s fatigue because the employee notified the employer several times that he (the employee) was tired and wanted permission to go home. Further, the employer provided transportation for the employee to his vehicle following his shift, and while en route, \u201cthe obviously exhausted [employee] fell asleep with a [lit] cigarette in his hand in the presence of ...

The court\u2019s answer to this question, to the extent that it suggested that an employer could be liable for scheduling the employee to work unreasonably long hours, belies the court\u2019s predilection to expand liability in order to largely equate a legal duty with \u201can original moral duty.\u201d <em>See Robertson, </em>301 S.E.2d at 567. While the West Virginia court cited the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 317, and recognized the traditional principle \u201cthat an employer is normally under no duty to control the conduct of an employee acting outside the scope of his employment,\u201d it did not analyze the presence of a special relationship under the facts. <em>Robertson, </em>301 S.E.2d at 567.

There was no special relationship under \u00a7 317, the employer argued, because the accident did not occur on the employer\u2019s property, nor did it involve the employer\u2019s chattel. <em>Faverty, </em>892 P.2d at 707-08. The Court rejected this argument, noting that even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that there was no special relationship under \u00a7 317, the employer would not be able to invoke the general rule under \u00a7 315. Instead, according to Oregon case law, including its recognition of dram shop liability, the employer would still be \u201csubject to the general duty to avoid conduct that unreasonably creates foreseeable risk of harm\u201d to a third party. <em>See Faverty, </em>892 P.2d at 708, 710.

We find <em>Nabors Drilling, U.S.A. Inc. v. Escoto, </em>288 S.W.3d 401 (Tex.2009), to be particularly persuasive. In that case, the Supreme Court of Texas held that an employer was not liable for a third party\u2019s injury when a fatigued employee caused an accident during the commute home from work. The court explained, and we agree, that \u201c[cjonsidering the large number of [citizens] who do shift work and work long hours (including doctors, nurses, lawyers, police officers, and others), there is little social or economic utility in requiring every employer to somehow prevent employee fatigue or take responsibility for the actions of off-duty, fatigued employees.\u201d <em>Nabors, </em>288 S.W.3d at 410-11. It continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-5\">Even if we assume that injury to third persons from employee fatigue is sufficiently foreseeable, foreseeability alone is not sufficient to create a new duty. <em>See, e.g., Love, </em>92 S.W.3d at 456 (\u201cWe have declined to hold an alcohol provider liable for [drunk driving] injuries in some cases, not because the harm was unforeseeable, but because the defendant had no duty.\u201d). A duty to protect the public from fatigued employees would impose a substantial burden on employers, which we do not believe can be reasonably justified. Employers would have to inspect employees for signs of fatigue impairment, but ... no quantitative measure or criteria are available to determine an employee\u2019s level of fatigue or assess whether an employee is merely tired or is actually incapacitated. In addition, employers would be compelled to take steps to eliminate fatigue at work, a very difficult task when no certain amount or type of work is known to consistently cause fatigue impairment in all persons, and when an employee\u2019s off-duty conduct will affect his level of fatigue.... [Ojff-duty factors such as an employee\u2019s commute length, lifestyle, sleep cycle during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>weeks off, sleep disorders, and medications can affect worker fatigue. Expecting employers to monitor or control such factors would be unreasonable, especially when the risk of driving while fatigued is within the common knowledge of all drivers, and employees generally know not to drive when they are too tired. A duty that could, in effect, impose liability on employers for allowing employees to leave the work site if they exhibit any signs of possible fatigue would be far-reaching and onerous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><em>Nabors, 288 </em>S.W.3d at 411-12 (some internal citations omitted); <em>see also Behrens, </em>304 Ill.Dec. 303, 852 N.E.2d at 556-57 (\u201c[IJndividual employees are in the best position to determine whether they are sufficiently rested to drive home safely ... [Placing this burden on employers would be poor social policy that is likely to have an onerous impact, not only on employers, but also on the workforce.\u201d). The court indicated that even if the employer had the requisite knowledge of the employee\u2019s impairment, this alone would not be dispositive. Rather, the court said that, \u201csimply knowing that an employee is intoxicated or incapacitated is not enough for a duty to arise. Rather, the employer must <em>affirmatively </em>exercise control over the incapacitated employee.\u201d <em>Nabors, </em>288 S.W.3d at 407 (quotation omitted).

Indeed, in reaching its conclusion, the <em>Nabors </em>Court had to distinguish its earlier case of <em>Otis Engineering Corp. v. Clark, </em>668 S.W.2d 307 (Tex.1983), which had determined that an employer could be held primarily negligent when it had knowledge that its employee was intoxicated but nevertheless affirmatively escorted him to his vehicle and allowed him to drive away. <em>Nabors, </em>288 S.W.3d at 405-06 (\u201cIn the present case, [unlike in <em>Otis], </em>[the employer] did not have the requisite knowledge of employee impairment, nor did it exercise the requisite control.\u201d). The intermediate appellate court in <em>Kuykendall </em>also distinguished the facts of <em>Otis </em>from the facts presented, stating that \u201cTop Notch, took no affirmative act with respect to [the employee] operating a motor vehicle.\u201d <em>Kuykendall, </em>70 Md.App. at 251, 520 A.2d at 1118; <em>see also Hatfield, </em>197 Md. at 252, 78 A.2d at 755 (suggesting, by examining an out-of-state case, that a tavern owner may be liable to an injured third party if, for example, he or she placed a drunken patron into a vehicle and forced him to operate it). Thus, we conclude, in light of Maryland precedent, as augmented by persuasive authority, that an affirmative act of control by the employer <em>following </em>and prompted by the employee\u2019s incapacity must be present in order for a duty to arise, and we decline \u201cto create a duty where an employer\u2019s only affirmative act of control <em>preceded </em>the employee\u2019s shift and incapacity and amounted only to establishing work conditions that may have caused or contributed to the accident.\u201d <em>Nabors, </em>288 S.W.3d at 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">It is clear, in the instant case, that Ports did no more than merely establish the shift work schedule for the unloading of the Saudi Tabuk, and did nothing to affirmatively control whether Richardson drove home in a fatigued state.

This appellate determination aims to balance the equitable considerations with the judicial administrative interests implicated by the record. <em>See Miller Metal, </em>415 Md. at 229-230, 999 A.2d at 1017-18; <em>Ebrahimi v.

The factors most apparent in our case law, however, are those judicial administrative considerations weighing against certification. Thus, certification is not proper when \"[t]he appellate court may be faced with having the same issues presented to it multiple times ... and partial rulings by the appellate court may do more to confuse than clarify the unresolved issues.\u201d <em>Miller Metal, </em>415 Md. at 229, 999 A.2d at 1017-18 (quoting <em>Smith v.

The certification properly balanced the equitable considerations with the judicial administrative interests implicated by the record. Specifically, Sgt. Barclay suffered significant personal injury in the collision and incurred substantial medical bills. Considering the limited recovery likely from the Richardson estate, the trial judge may have recognized the financial hardship involved in Petitioners litigating against Richardson prior to an appeal, when meaningful recovery was primarily reliant on the liability of Ports and the STA. Most significantly, however, the risk was low in the instant case that an appellate court would be presented with the same issues in multiple appeals. <em>Cf. Miller, </em>415 Md. at 230, 999 A.2d at 1018 (noting that, under the circumstances, \u201cthe risk [was] great that separate appeals presenting the same issues would arise and therefore certification would be an inefficient use of judicial resources.\u201d); <em>see Lead, </em>386 Md. at 25, 871 A.2d at 553 (\"The purpose of Rule 2-602(a) is to prevent piecemeal appeals, which, beyond being inefficient and costly, can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>create significant delays, hardship, and procedural problems.\u201d); <em>Mortimer, </em>310 Md. at 645-46, 530 A.2d at 1240-41 (\u201cIn the context of multiple-claim or multiple-party litigation, or both, the purpose of the rules is to avoid the costs, delays, frustrations, and unnecessary demands on judicial resources occasioned by piecemeal appeals.\u201d (citations omitted)). First, it is clear that Richardson\u2019s negligence is not genuinely disputed; indeed, both Petitioners in their motion for authorization to file an appeal, and Respondents in their response, averred to the trial court that if summary judgment for the STA and Ports were upheld, Sgt. Barclay and his wife would likely settle with Richardson's estate. Secondly, even if a settlement were not reached, it cannot be said that the pending claim and the appeal \u201carise from a nexus of fact and law so intertwined that if we decide the one now, we may nonetheless face many of the same questions in determining the other later.\u201d <em>See Miller, </em>415 Md. at 229, 999 A.2d at 1018 (quotation and citation omitted). Despite the fact that the allegations against Richardson and Ports arise from the same incident, an appeal regarding Ports' alleged vicarious and primary liability would not involve the same legal questions presented in an appeal regarding Richardson's negligence, thus a partial ruling on appeal would not confuse the unresolved issues. <em>See Miller, </em>415 Md. at 229-30, 999 A.2d at 1018.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b313-8\">.

First, it is clear from our case law, that a party may not petition or cross-petition for certiorari from a judgment wholly in its favor. <em>See Wolfe v.

In the instant case, Ports prevailed in both the trial court and the Court of Special Appeals on the question of liability, and, therefore, cannot maintain a cross-petition for certiorari merely because it disagrees with <em>dicta </em>appearing in the intermediate appellate court's opinion.

As the trial and intermediate appellate courts\u2019 opinions demonstrate, summary disposition of the negligence claim in this case did not depend on an interpretation of the CBA.

An employer who calls for such extended effort has a variety of alternatives to protect from such a hazard \u2014 the engagement of an alert driver or a taxi or providing facilities for restorative rest before undertaking travel, to mention only a few.

The \"special mission\u201d exception to the \"going and coming rule,\u201d under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act \"provides that an employee is acting in the course of employment when traveling on a special mission or errand at the request of the employer and in furtherance of the employer\u2019s business, even if the journey is one that is to or from the workplace.\u201d <em>Garrity v.

In considering whether an employee was engaged in a special mission at the time of the injury, we have focused on factors such as whether there was urgency and an order which the employee was obliged to follow, such that an agreement could be inferred that the mission included commuting to and from the job site.. <em>See Alford, </em>270 Md. at 364, 311 A.2d at 417; <em>Reisinger, 165 </em>Md. at 195-99, 167 A. 51 at 52-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Although the general rule in both workers\u2019 compensation and <em>respondeat superior </em>jurisprudence is that an employee is not \"on the job\u201d while commuting to or from work, we decline, as we did in <em>Dhanraj, </em>to allow the special mission exception to inform our holding as to the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior </em>under the facts of this case. <em>Dhanraj, </em>305 Md. at 630-31, 506 A.2d at 227-28.

Petitioners cite <em>Bussard v. Minimed, Inc., </em>105 Cal.App.4th 798, 129 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Cal.Rptr.2d 675 (2003) to argue that Richardson was acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the collision. In that case, an employee caused a collision while driving home after becoming ill as a result of pesticides sprayed at her worksite. She explained to the responding police officer that she had felt dizzy and lightheaded from the pesticides before the collision. In determining whether the employer was vicariously liable for the third party\u2019s injuries, the court noted that California had defined \"scope of employment\u201d broadly, to include \"acts necessary to the comfort, convenience, health, and welfare of the employee while at work, [even] though strictly personal and not acts of service....\u201d <em>Bussard, </em>105 Cal.App.4th at 803-04, 129 Cal.Rptr.2d 675. Recognizing that, generally, an employee is not within the scope of employment when commuting to and from his or her place of employment, the court pointed to an exception where an employee foreseeably \"endangers others with a risk arising from or related to work.\u201d <em>Bussard, </em>105 Cal.App.4th at 804, 129 Cal.Rptr.2d 675. The California court found additional justification for this exception in California cases holding an employer vicariously liable when an employee caused an accident while driving home after consuming alcohol at work. <em>Bussard, </em>105 Cal.App.4th at 805, 129 Cal.Rptr.2d 675. Thus, the court noted that \"[s]o long as the risk is created within the scope of the employee\u2019s employment, the scope of employment must follow the risk so long as it acts proximately to cause injury.\u201d <em>Bussard, </em>105 Cal.App.4th at 805-06, 129 Cal.Rptr.2d 675 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Petitioners argue, citing <em>Bussard, </em>that \"Richardson's falling asleep and losing control of his vehicle was the natural and foreseeable consequence of the fatigue which manifested while on the job and awake for an extended number of hours.\" Petitioners\u2019 reliance on this case, however, is misplaced. Maryland law does not define \"scope of employment\u201d so expansively. <em>See Dhanraj, </em>305 Md. at 627-28, 506 A.2d at 226; <em>Oaks, </em>339 Md. at 30-32, 660 A.2d at 426; <em>Henkelmann, </em>180 Md. at 599, 26 A.2d at 422-23. Further, our intermediate appellate court in <em>Kuykendall v. Top Notch Laminates, Inc., 70 </em>Md.App. 244, 520 A.2d 1115 (1987), specifically rejected a principal rationale undergirding <em>Bussard </em>by holding that an employer could not be held vic\u00e1riously liable for the off-duty motor tort of an employee who became intoxicated at a work function. <em>Kuykendall, </em>70 Md.App. at 250, 520 A.2d at 1117 (analyzing'the facts in light of <em>Dhanraj </em>and concluding that, \"there is nothing in the complaint to indicate that [the employee] while driving home was furthering any business purpose of his employer.\u201d). As explained <em>infra, </em>we adopt the reasoning of that case regarding the primary negligence of an employer, however, it is an equally sound application of Maryland's <em>respondeat superior </em>doctrine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b325-5\">. We reject as insufficient Petitioners' claim that Richardson\u2019s additional three hours of incentive pay was meant to compensate him for the inconvenience of commuting home by car after a long day's work. First, the record demonstrates that the \"incentive pay\u201d or \"premium pay\u201d was for performance \"above the call of duty,\u201d as determined by a supervisor, and influenced by such things as the special skill of the laborer, and the operational challenges of a particular vessel. It was not tied to shift length, because the pay records for the Saudi Tabuk show that Richardson was one of eight longshoreman who worked at least twenty-hours, and, as the intermediate appellate court noted, out of those eight, five received bonuses, while three did not. Further, there was no notation as to the method of commute on the pay records. Second, even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that this incentive pay was compensation for the commute, this would not be enough, by itself, to establish that Richardson was furthering Ports\u2019 business at the time of the collision. <em>See Dhanraj, </em>305 Md. at 628-30, 506 A.2d at 226-27.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b326-6\">. The Court of Special Appeals relied on proximate causation in its analysis of the case at bar and elected not to discuss duty. <em>Barclay, </em>198 Md.App. at 583-584, 18 A.3d at 940 (\"Our decision, however, does not turn on \u2018duty;\u2019 nor does our decision turn on the narrow issue of whether Ports had some 'special relationship\u2019 with either Richardson or the public that could give rise to a duty. Instead, any error in either of these dimensions was harmless because the alleged facts do not demonstrate the requisite proximity of cause and effect.\u201d (footnote omitted)). As discussed <em>infra, </em>duty is a threshold question in any negligence action, and we shall dispose of the instant case on that element.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b328-8\">. As we noted in <em>Lamb, </em>303 Md. at 243, 492 A.2d at 1300-01, the particular special relationships between an actor and a third person that give rise to such a duty are set forth in Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7\u00a7316-19.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b330-11\">. In order to evade this natural conclusion based on the Restatement (Second) of Torts, Petitioners urge us to adopt the proposed Restatement (Third) of Torts \u00a7 41 which they contend is more in their favor. According to the Restatement (Third):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-12\">(b) Special relationships giving rise to the duty provided in [\u00a7 41](a) include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-13\">(3) an employer with employees when the employment facilitates the employee\u2019s causing harm to third parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-14\">Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for Physical Harm \u00a7 41(b)(3) (Proposed Final Draft No. 1, 2005). Relying on this section, Petitioners contend that a special relationship existed between Ports and Richardson because \"the unreasonably long schedule endured by Richardson at the directive of P&amp;O [Ports] caused Richardson\u2019s extreme fatigue, [and] his fatigue not only facilitated the harm to Petitioner \u2014 it was the immediate cause of the accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A6y\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>We agree with Respondent, that, even if we were to entertain adopting the language of the yet unpublished Restatement (Third), it would not change the conclusion in this case, because the section merely reiterates the requirements of the Restatement (Second) in a more succinct form. This is evidenced by proposed comment e, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1v\">Employment facilitates harm to others when the employment provides the employee access to physical locations, such as the place of employment, or to instrumentalities, such as a police officer carrying a concealed weapon while off duty, or other means by which to cause harm that would otherwise not be available to the employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-6\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 41 cmt. e.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">As this comment demonstrates, Restatement (Third) merely rephrases the same limitations explained in Restatement (Second), by stating that \u201cemployment facilitates harm\u201d to third parties where an employee has access to the property or instrumentalities of the employer. Thus, regardless of the Restatement relied upon, it is clear that for an employer to have a special relationship with an employee and thereby a duty to protect third parties for acts outside the scope of employment, there must be \u201ca real means of control over the employee which, if exercised, would meaningfully reduce the risk of harm.\u201d <em>Grand Aerie Fraternal Order of Eagles v. Carneyhan, </em>169 S.W.3d 840, 852 (Ky.2005) (citation omitted). Neither the Restatement (Second) nor the Restatement (Third) support the theory that on-the-job fatigue is a hazard facilitated by the employment sufficient to create a special relationship.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b334-5\">. We note that while we agree with its disposition of the case, the intermediate appellate court erred in giving any weight, persuasive or otherwise, to <em>Faverty, </em>because it is inconsistent with Maryland case law. The intermediate appellate court, in the case at bar, stated that its opinion did not \"hold that an employer has no duty to protect the public from risks that its employees pose, other than that imposed by <em>respondeat superior.\u201d Barclay, </em>198 Md.App. at 587, 18 A.3d at 942. Instead of discussing the concept of \"special relationship,\u201d however, the court went on to contrast the facts with those presented in <em>Faverty, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>noting that, in that case, \"the employer violated its stated scheduling policy and had an eighteen-year-old employee work twelve-and-a-half out of seventeen consecutive hours.\u201d <em>Barclay, </em>198 Md.App. at 588, 18 A.3d at 942. The court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">The point we wish to make is that the employers in these cases unexpectedly caused their employees to endanger others, thereby placing the employee in a position where he or she could not reasonably mitigate the attendant risks. As such, injury to third parties was a natural and probable consequence of the employers' actions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-7\"><em>Barclay, </em>198 Md.App. at 588, 18 A.3d at 943.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">By contrast, the intermediate appellate court noted that, due to his frequent long shifts, Mr. Richardson was charged \"with the knowledge that his employment posed a risk to third parties, and the law required him to mitigate that harm, lest he be liable for breaching his duty of general care.\u201d <em>Barclay, </em>198 Md.App. at 588, 18 A.3d at 943. We fail to understand how a person's level of fatigue after work is any more or less perceptible according to the amount of prior notice he or she receives as to shift length. Similarly, we fail to see the connection between this section of the intermediate appellate court\u2019s opinion and the presence or absence of a duty on behalf of the employer to the injured third party. Therefore, we disavow this analysis and apply our explanation of the applicable law, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b335-9\">. As described by one author:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxK\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>The major shortcoming in <em>Faverty </em>is, as the dissent aptly points out, the failure to say when the duty of the employer arises and to what extent it runs. The allegation is simply that the \"defendant was negligent in working [the employee] more hours than was reasonable under the circumstances.\u201d The court posits a general duty to avoid conduct that unreasonably creates a foreseeable risk of harm to a plaintiff, but does not say if the duty in <em>Faverty </em>arises at the point of scheduling the employee to work the extra shift, at the point of dismissing the employee after having worked the shift, or at some point in between. Moreover, the court provides no indication of what the duty entails. For example, one could ask whether there was a duty to inquire into [the employee's] success in balancing his school responsibilities with his job responsibilities in order to determine if he was getting enough sleep. The <em>Faverty </em>court's failure to adequately define the nature and scope of the duty imposed on the employer left the opinion open to the criticism that it was merely \u201ca value judgment about when and to whom employers should be responsible for their employees' off-work negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Gene P.
