Vandals, </em>Balt. Sun, 28 June 2012, at Al. Angry drivers are reported to have set fire to, hurled rocks at, and slingshot marbles at the cameras. In perhaps the most extreme example of retribution, we are informed that a man approached a car-mounted speed camera along the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, brandishing a shotgun and a hammer. He smashed two of the car\u2019s windows with the hammer before fleeing the scene (the occupant of the car was unhurt).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-12\">Not deterred, the local governments of Montgomery County, the Mayor and Council of Rockville, the City of Gaithersburg, and Chevy Chase Village (referred to collectively as Respondents) established speed cameras \u2014 defined technically as \u201cspeed monitoring systems.\u201d These systems recorded, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>among many others, Petitioners<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> traveling in their vehicles at least ten miles per hour over the posted speed limit on various stretches of road within those jurisdictions. Respondents issued to Petitioners citations, each carrying a maximum civil penalty of $40. Petitioners, leaning somewhat more to pacifism than the folks in the above news accounts, sought a less violent resolution of their grievances with the cameras by filing, after paying the penalties, a complaint in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. Counts I-VTI of Petitioners\u2019 ultimate complaint asserted claims sounding in tort. Counts VIII and IX sought declaratory and injunctive relief. Petitioners asserted that Respondents\u2019 contracts with their common speed monitoring system contractor, ACS State and Local Solutions, Inc. (\u201cACS\u201d), violated Maryland Code (1977, 2009 Repl.Vol.), Transportation Article, \u00a7 21-809(j).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 21 \u2014 809(j), in order to discourage abuse by contractors, prohibits \u201cMontgomery County\u201d from remunerating, on a per-citation basis, a contractor who \u201coperates\u201d a speed monitoring system on the county\u2019s behalf. The Circuit Court concluded that Respondents, and not ACS, operated their speed monitoring systems (within the meaning of the statute) and, regardless, \u00a7 21-809Q) applied to Montgomery County only, i.e., not the municipalities. The court opined further that, even if it were accurate to state that ACS operated the relevant speed monitoring systems, the statute does not envision a private cause of action to support Petitioners\u2019 tort-based claims. In any event, the trial court held that Petitioners waived their ability to maintain their complaint by paying voluntarily the citation penalties. Accordingly, the court granted Respondents\u2019 motions for summary judgment on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">Petitioners appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. The intermediate appellate court affirmed, agreeing with the Cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>cuit Court that \u00a7 21-809 does not contain an express or implied private cause of action to support the maintenance of Petitioners\u2019 tort claims. The Court of Special Appeals declared moot the declaratory and injunctive relief claims because Respondents amended their contract with ACS to state specifically their understanding that the governments operate the speed monitoring systems. Petitioners secured a writ of certiorari from this Court to review the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">We shall affirm the judgment of the intermediate appellate court, although not for all the same reasons it offered. As an initial matter, Petitioners, although arguing so in their brief, failed to question in their petition for writ of certiorari whether \u00a7 21-809(j) applies to all Respondents, not merely the local government of Montgomery County. Therefore, we shall not address it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Md. Rule 8 \u2014 131(b). We find no merit in Respondents\u2019 argument that Petitioners waived their ability to maintain the present litigation by paying voluntarily their speed monitoring system fines. Whether Petitioners were speeding at the time of their citation and whether Respondents\u2019 contracts with ACS violated \u00a7 21-809(j) are distinct and separate issues. Moreover, Maryland\u2019s permissive counterclaim rule of procedure does not preclude Petitioners from filing the present lawsuit, if actionable, after paying the fines.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Petitioners\u2019 momentum in this case ends there, however. Section 21-809 does not provide an express or implied private cause of action in tort, for the following reasons. First, \u00a7 21-809 is a general welfare statute that does not benefit a particular class of persons, let alone Petitioners. Second, the statute provides a remedy in the District Court for challenging speed monitoring system citations. These factors, combined with the lack of supporting legislative history endorsing an implied private right of action, establish that \u00a7 21-809 does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>not create a private cause of action. With regard to Petitioners\u2019 injunctive and declaratory relief claims, Petitioners concede that they lack the necessary taxpayer standing to pursue those claims, in the event we did not find a private cause of action in the statutory scheme. Accordingly, we shall not address their argument that the local governments\u2019 contracts with ACS violate \u00a7 21 \u2014 809(j).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">On 25 January 2006, the Maryland General Assembly, overriding then-Governor Ehrlich\u2019s veto, enacted House Bill 443 (2005), which was codified as Transportation Article, \u00a7 21-809. 2006 Md. Laws 15. The statute took effect on 24 February 2006. Section 21-809 authorized the use of speed monitoring systems on certain highways in school zones and residential districts in Montgomery County. Transp. Art., \u00a7 21-809(b)(i). The statute defines a \u201cspeed monitoring system\u201d as \u201ca device with one or more motor vehicle sensors producing recorded images of motor vehicles traveling at speeds at least ten miles per hour above the posted speed limit.\u201d Transp. Art., \u00a7 21-809(a)(5). When a speed monitoring system detects an offending motor vehicle, it is supposed to create a \u201crecorded image\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the rear of the motor vehicle, two time-stamped images showing a stationary object near the motor vehicle, and at least one clear and legible identification of the motor vehicle\u2019s entire license plate. Transp. Art., \u00a7 21-809(a)(4)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">The \u201clocal police department\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> issues and mails to the \u201cowner\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a citation for the speeding offense, which carries a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>civil penalty not exceeding $40. Transp. Art., \u00a7 21-809(c), (d). A citation recipient may pay the civil penalty or may elect to contest the citation at a District Court trial. Transp. Art., \u00a7 21-809(d)(5). The latter option must be printed on the citation. Md.Code (1978, 2006 RepLVol.), Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Art., \u00a7 7-302(e)(l). An owner is not subject to a civil penalty if a police officer issued to him/her a citation at the time of the moving violation or if an owner defends successfully against the citation in a District Court trial. Transp. Art., \u00a7 21-809(c)(1), (f)(1) &amp; (f)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">If a citation recipient elects a trial in the District Court, the local government must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the citation recipient violated the speed limit. Transp. Art., \u00a7 21-809(e)(3). The government must submit in evidence a certificate alleging the citation recipient violated the speed limit; a certificate of training, issued to the \u201cspeed monitoring system operator\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> upon completion of training; a daily log showing that the speed monitoring system operator performed successfully a self-test prior to producing a recorded image; and, a signed certificate of calibration, issued annually by an independent calibration laboratory. Transp. Art., \u00a7 21 \u2014 809(b)(2)\u2014(4), (e)(1). A citation recipient may demand the speed monitoring system operator be present at trial to testify. Transp. Art., \u00a7 21-809(e)(2). Moreover, the statute permits a citation recipient to argue in his or her defense that the vehicle or its registration plates were stolen before the violation occurred; he or she was not operating the recorded vehicle at the time of the violation; or, any other issues or evidence that the District Court deems pertinent. Transp. Art., \u00a7 21 \u2014 809(f)(l)(i)\u2014(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The gravamen of Petitioners\u2019 complaint centered on Transportation Article \u00a7 21-809(j), which provides, \u201cIf a contractor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>operates a speed monitoring system on behalf of Montgomery County, the contractor\u2019s fee may not be contingent on the number of citations issued or paid.\u201d Transp. Art., \u00a7 21-809(j). On or about 9 February 2007, Montgomery County contracted with ACS to \u201cprovide for the implementation, use, and servicing of photo speed enforcement technology and services as requested by [Montgomery] County.\u201d The Montgomery County \u2014 ACS contract specifies that ACS will \u201cprovide, install, and support all traffic camera equipment\u201d and \u201csupply an automated violation services solution.\u201d Under the section titled \u201cCompensation,\u201d the Montgomery County \u2014 ACS contract states that ACS shall be compensated \u201cat a rate of $16.25 per paid citation or $18,000 per month [for the duration] of the program, whichever is greater.\u201d Between 21 February 2007 and 28 May 2007, the municipalities entered separately into similar contracts with ACS. These contracts incorporate by reference the Montgomery County-ACS contract. The munieipalities-ACS contracts provide similar compensation formulae also: that ACS will be compensated at a rate of $16.25 per paid citation or $2,999 per month for the duration of the program, whichever is greater (Chevy Chase Village contracted for $16.25 per paid citation or $6,000 per month of the program).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Respondents issued speed monitoring system citations to Petitioners for speeding violations that occurred during 2007 and 2008. The Chevy Chase Village Police Department issued a citation to Janet Marburger for a violation occurring on 23 February 2008 and two citations to Matthew Charles Baker for violations occurring on 9 July 2008. The Rockville City Police Department issued a citation to Johnny Ray Garza for violations occurring on 11 and 13 November 2007, to Thomas Jeffrey Wheatley for a violation occurring on 19 July 2008, to Kenneth King Sleeman for violations occurring on 17 August 2008 and 29 September 2008, and to David Alfred Schiller for a violation occurring on 4 September 2008. The Gaithersburg Police Department issued a citation to Walter McKee for a violation occurring on 19 August 2008. The Montgomery County Department of Police issued a citation to Garza for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>violation occurring on 24 November 2007, to Sleeman for a violation occurring on 10 February 2008, to Aristone Luiz Pereira Jr. for violations occurring on 4 and 8 April 2008, and to Schiller for a violation occurring on 25 June 2008. Petitioners paid voluntarily the civil penalty associated with each of their citations; thus no District Court trials were conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Between September 2008 and June 2009, prior to the final disposition of Petitioners\u2019 claims in this litigation in the Circuit Court, Respondents amended their contracts with ACS. The amendments stated that ACS provides speed monitoring system equipment only, and that Respondents are solely responsible for the operation of their respective systems. Chevy Chase Village and ACS amended further their contract to change the compensation formula to a flat rate per month, i.e., compensation was not keyed to the number of successful citations issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">On 2 May 2008, Timothy P. Leahy, on his behalf and others situated similarly, filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. Leahy named the City of Rockville, Montgomery County, and the Town of Chevy Chase (not to be confused with the distinct municipality of Chevy Chase Village) as defendants. He alleged that the defendants\u2019 contracts with ACS violated Transportation Article \u00a7 21-809(j) by compensating ACS on a per-citation-paid basis. Leahy demanded a jury trial and $20 million in damages for the economic loss suffered by himself and others situated similarly for having paid \u201cunlawful\u201d fines. On 16 May 2008, Leahy filed an amended complaint, adding the City of Gaithersburg as a defendant. Leahy followed with a motion to certify the class of plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">Between 21 April 2008 and 21 July 2008, Rockville, Montgomery County, the Town of Chevy Chase, and Gaithersburg filed motions in opposition to class certification. Rockville, Montgomery County, and Gaithersburg filed also motions to dismiss. Additionally, Gaithersburg and the Town of Chevy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>Chase filed motions for summary judgment. On 30 July 2008, the Circuit Court granted the Town of Chevy Chase\u2019s motion for summary judgment. After a hearing on 26 August 2008, the Circuit Court granted the remaining defendants\u2019 motions, dismissing with prejudice Leahy\u2019s claims against them, and denied Leahy\u2019s motion for class certification, without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">On 6 October 2008, Petitioners<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> filed, on their behalf and others situated similarly, a second amended complaint against Montgomery County, Rockville, Gaithersburg, and Chevy Chase Village. The second complaint contained nine counts, entitled: violation of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, unjust enrichment, conversion, constructive trust, civil conspiracy, breach of fiduciary duty, constructive fraud, temporary restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, and declaratory relief. Montgomery County and Rock-ville answered. Gaithersburg and Chevy Chase Village filed a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment, which Petitioners opposed. After conducting a hearing on 12 February 2009, the Circuit Court denied Gaithersburg and Chevy Chase Village\u2019s motion, but permitted them to renew or file a new motion for summary judgment after completion of discovery. Gaithersburg and Chevy Chase Village filed an answer to the second amended complaint on 16 March 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Petitioners filed a third (and final) amended complaint against Respondents on 7 October 2009. The third amended complaint contained the same nine counts as the second amended complaint. Petitioners alleged that ACS operated the subject speed monitoring systems for Respondents and that Respondents compensated ACS on a per-citation basis. As such, Petitioners urged that the contracts between ACS and Respondents were in contravention of \u00a7 21 \u2014 809(j) and therefore were ultra Adres, rendering all of the previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>issued speed monitoring system citations invalid. Petitioners asked that Respondents refund the collected civil penalties stemming from the speed monitoring system violations, with interest. Respondents opposed Petitioners third amended complaint by filing, between 27 October 2009 and 2 April 2010, motions to strike and motions to dismiss or for summary judgment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">The Circuit Court granted Respondents\u2019 motions for dismissal and/or summary judgment at a 15 July 2010 hearing, issuing a written order to that effect on 3 November 2010. First, the Circuit Court concluded that \u00a7 21-809(j) applied to Montgomery County only. Second, the court found, based on undisputed material facts as pleaded, that Respondents operated the speed monitoring systems.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Section 21-809 requires a speed monitoring system operator to maintain diagnostic logs and to submit them into evidence at contested trials of citations. Respondents\u2019 employees performed these tasks, and thus, <em>a fortiori, </em>Respondents operate their speed monitoring systems. Moreover, Respondents did not delegate final decision-making authority to ACS to determine whether any particular recorded image constituted a violation of \u00a7 21-809 that should be pursued by citation, reserving that authority for themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>The Circuit Court opined further, in the alternative, that even if ACS were deemed to be the operator of the subject speed monitoring systems within the meaning of the statute, \u00a7 21-809 did not create a private cause of action for Petitioners to sue for an alleged violation of subsection (f) of the statute. Even if a private cause of action was authorized, the court concluded, Petitioners waived the right to sue separately on this ground after they paid voluntarily the civil penalties. On these additional bases, the Circuit Court granted Respondents\u2019 motion for summary judgment as to Petitioners\u2019 seven claims sounding in tort.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">Petitioners filed timely an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, which, in a reported opinion, affirmed the Circuit Court. <em>Baker v. Montgomery Cnty., 201 </em>Md.App. 642, 30 A.3d 267 (2011). The three-judge panel of the Court of Special Appeals addressed, as a threshold issue, whether a private cause of action exists. It noted that Transportation Article \u00a7 21-809 does not provide expressly for a private cause of action. <em>Baker, </em>201 Md.App. at 670, 30 A.3d at 284. The panel then analyzed whether the statute created implicitly a private cause of action, relying on the applicable analysis discussed in <em>Erie Insurance Company v. Chops, </em>322 Md. 79, 585 A.2d 232 (1991). The <em>Erie </em>factors, it concluded, militated against finding an implicit private cause of action in the statute because \u00a7 21-809 provides a District Court remedy. <em>Baker, </em>201 Md.App. at 670-79, 30 A.3d at 284-89. Moreover, because Petitioners are not in a particular class of persons intended to benefit specially from the statute, finding an implicit private cause of action would be inconsistent with the purpose of the statute. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the Court of Special Appeals concluded that Petitioners\u2019 seven claims sounding in tort were not actionable. <em>Baker, </em>201 Md.App. at 679, 30 A.3d at 289. The panel concluded that the remaining claims for injunctive and declaratory relief were moot, in light of the September <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>2008-June 2009 amendments to the Respondents \u2014 ACS contracts. <em>Baker, </em>201 Md.App. at 680-81, 30 A.3d at 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Petitioners filed a petition for writ of certiorari with this Court, which we granted on 16 March 2012. <em>Baker v. Montgomery Cnty., </em>425 Md. 227, 40 A.3d 39 (2012). Petitioners presented three questions for our review: whether Petitioners\u2019 payment of the speed monitoring system fine waived their subsequent ability to mount their challenge to the ACS contracts under Transportation Article \u00a7 21 \u2014 809(j); whether Transportation Article \u00a7 21-809 provides a private cause of action; and, whether the amendments to the Respondents\u2014 ACS contracts mooted Petitioners\u2019 injunctive relief and declaratory judgment claims.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">III. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">Under Maryland Rule 2-501, the grant of a motion for summary judgment is appropriate only \u201cif the motion and response show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Md. Rule 2 \u2014 501(f). The parties here agree that there are no genuine disputes of material fact generated on the record before the Circuit Court. Thus, as was said in <em>Breslin v. Powell, </em>\u201cThis case presents a question of statutory interpretation, and therefore, we review the trial court\u2019s disposition through summary judgment under a non-deferential standard of review.\u201d 421 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>Md. 266, 277, 26 A.3d 878, 885 (2011) (citing <em>Walter v. Gunter, </em>367 Md. 386, 392, 788 A.2d 609, 612 (2002)). We determine whether the trial court\u2019s decision was correct as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Wash. Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n v. Phillips, </em>413 Md. 606, 618, 994 A.2d 411, 419 (2010)). Our review of the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is limited ordinarily to the legal grounds relied upon explicitly in its disposition. <em>River Walk Apartments, LLC v. Twigg, </em>396 Md. 527, 542, 914 A.2d 770, 778-79 (2007) (quoting <em>Standard Fire Ins. Co. v. Berrett, </em>395 Md. 439, 450-51, 910 A.2d 1072, 1080 (2006)). Moreover, when construing a statute, we must</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATes\">\u201cdiscern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied.... \u201d We approach the statutory interpretation process by looking first at the plain language of a statute, giving the words their natural and ordinary meaning. If the language is clear and unambiguous on its face, our inquiry ends ordinarily. If, however, the language is ambiguous, we move on to examine the \u201clegislative history, case law, statutory purpose, as well as the structure of the statute\u201d to aid us in ascertaining the intent of the Legislature. When focusing on the relevant part of a statutory scheme, we attempt to harmonize the part with the whole, considering the \u201cpurpose, aim, or policy of the enacting body.\u201d When interpreting an ambiguous statute, we must reject any construction that would be illogical or nonsensical.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-4\"><em>Davis v. State, </em>426 Md. 211, 218-19, 43 A.3d 1044, 1048 (2012) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">IV. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">A. <em>Petitioners\u2019 Ability To Maintain the Present Action Against Respondents After Paying Speed Monitoring System Penalties Without Protest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">We conclude that, by paying the speed monitoring system penalties for issued citations, Petitioners did not waive their right to pursue subsequently a claim against Respondents for violating Transportation Article \u00a7 21-809(j), if such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>claim is otherwise actionable. Respondents urge to the contrary, arguing that principles of res judicata prevent Petitioners from doing so and that, instead of paying simply the civil penalties, Petitioners should have elected to stand trial in the District Court and raised the claimed violation of \u00a7 21 \u2014 809(j) as a counterclaim or defense in those proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Maryland\u2019s permissive counterclaim rule of procedure, Maryland Rule \u00a7 2-331(a),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> enables Petitioners to raise such a potential counterclaim as a separate action. \u201c[Wjhere the same facts may be asserted as either a defense or a counterclaim, and the issue raised by the defense is not litigated and determined so as to be precluded by collateral estoppel, the defendant in the previous action is not barred by res judicata from subsequently maintaining an action on the counterclaim.\u201d <em>Rowland v. Harrison, </em>320 Md. 223, 235-36, 577 A.2d 51, 57 (1990); <em>see also Moore v. Nissan Motor Acceptance Corp., </em>376 Md. 558, 831 A.2d 12 (2003). Here, Petitioners paid voluntarily their fines and did not challenge in the District Court, as a means to defeat assessment of the civil penalty, whether the speed monitoring systems were being managed in contravention of \u00a7 21-809(j). That Petitioners did not litigate their \u00a7 21 \u2014 809(j) claim in the District Court is not fatal at the threshold, in and of itself, to the present claim. In <em>Rowland, </em>the defendant withdrew from a circuit court before it was adjudicated her counterclaim against the plaintiff/veterinarian for professional malpractice; yet, this Court concluded that she could pursue her counterclaim in a subsequent, separate action. 320 Md. at 230, 577 A.2d at 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Respondents retort that a defendant may not bring a separate and subsequent action based on a prior counterclaim that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>could have been raised if \u201c[t]he relationship between the counterclaim and the plaintiffs claim is such that successful prosecution of the second action would nullify the initial judgment or would impair rights established in the initial action.\u201d <em>Rowland, </em>320 Md. at 232, 577 A.2d at 55 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 22(2)(b) (1982)). Whether Petitioners were operating their vehicles ten or more miles per hour over the posted speed limits at the time of their citations and whether Respondents\u2019 contracts with ACS contravene \u00a7 21 \u2014 809(j) are related distantly. The factual inquiry surrounding the former question involves principally who was operating the vehicle at the time and whether the speed of the vehicle was captured accurately. <em>See </em>Transp.

Instead, the bill file for House Bill 443 (2005) is replete with generalized statements from citizens, advocacy groups, and municipal politicians urging the General Assembly to authorize speed monitoring systems in order to slow down drivers; to protect pedestrians, bicyclists, and transit riders; and to free-up police officers to attend to other matters. Bill file for H.B. 433, 2005 Leg., 420th Sess. (Md. 2005). Even were we to assume that Petitioners are correct that the General Assembly intended the statute to benefit recipients of citations, issued according to speed monitoring systems established pursuant to the statutory scheme, whether it intended also that \u00a7 21-809 create an implied private cause of action is a separate issue. <em>Transamerica, </em>444 U.S. at 17-18, 100 S.Ct. at 246, 62 L.Ed.2d at 153; <em>Touche Ross, </em>442 U.S. at 578, 99 S.Ct. at 2490, 61 L.Ed.2d at 97 (\u201cBut the mere fact that [a statute] was designed to provide protection for [a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>class of persons] does not require the implication of a private damages action in their behalf.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Next, we look to the purpose of the statute. Section 21-809 creates rules and procedures for Montgomery County (and perhaps its municipalities) to operate a speed monitoring system. It does not provide expressly for a private cause of action, as we noted <em>supra </em>in footnote 14. The purpose of the statute also furnishes a remedy for challenging a speed monitoring system citation. Subsections (d), (e) and (f) of \u00a7 21-809 lay out a procedure for a citation recipient to demand a trial in the District Court of Maryland (sitting in Montgomery County, presumably) for an alleged violation. In his or her defense, a citation recipient may argue that his or her car or license plates were stolen or \u201c[a]ny other issues and evidence that the District Court deems pertinent.\u201d Transp. Art., \u00a7 21-809(f)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">\u201c \u2018[A]n elemental canon of statutory construction [is] where a statute expressly provides a particular remedy or remedies, a court must be chary of reading others into it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sugarloaf, </em>78 Md.App. at 556, 554 A.2d at 437 (quoting <em>Transamerica, </em>444 U.S. at 19, 100 S.Ct. at 247, 62 L.Ed.2d at 154-55). Under \u00a7 21 \u2014 809(f)(l)(iii), citation recipients, such as Petitioners, may (but are not obliged to) defend against receiving a citation on the basis that the local government violated \u00a7 21-809(j).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This militates against finding a separate, private cause of action to enforce the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>Finally, the legislative history of \u00a7 21-809 does not reveal a legislative intent to create an implied private cause of action.

In the context of this State\u2019s legislative process, the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Scull </em>opined that the difference in legislative record-keeping between Congress and the General Assembly reduced the persuasiveness of a state law\u2019s legislative history. 205 Md.App. at 577-80, 45 A.3d at 931-32 (citing <em>Sugarloaf </em>78 Md.App. at 558, 554 A.2d at 438). Nonetheless, \u201c \u2018where the plain language of a provision weighs against implication of a private remedy, silence within the legislative history as to a private cause of action reinforces the decision not to find such a right implicitly.\u2019 \u201d <em>Scull, </em>205 Md.App. at 580, 45 A.3d at 932 (quoting <em>IVTX, Inc. v.

Petitioners acknowledged also that some of them are neither Maryland residents nor Maryland taxpayers. \u201cA taxpayer may invoke the aid of a court of equity to restrain the action of a public official or an administrative agency when such action is illegal or ultra vires, and may injuriously affect the taxpayer\u2019s rights and property.\u201d <em>Citizens Planning &amp; Hous.

Moreover, Petitioners conceded at oral argument before the Court of Special Appeals that they cannot pursue their declaratory and injunctive relief claims unless a private cause of action exists under \u00a7 21-809.

State, </em>398 Md. 447, 466-67, 921 A.2d 196, 208 (2007) and <em>Remsburg </em>v. <em>Montgomery, </em>376 Md. 568, 584, 831 A.2d 18, 27 (2003)); <em>see also Horridge v. St. Mary's Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>382 Md. 170, 187, 854 A.2d 1232, 1241 (2004); <em>Muthukumarana v. Montgomery Cnty., </em>370 Md. 447, 487, 805 A.2d 372, 396 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">In <em>Gourdirte, </em>the plaintiff argued that the following language in the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act created an enforceable duty in the defendant drug manufacturer: \" 'The following acts and the causing thereof are prohibited: (a) The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any food, drug, device, or cosmetic that is adulterated or misbranded.\u2019 \u201d 405 Md. at 757, 955 A.2d at 790 (quoting 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 331(a) (2008)). We disagreed, noting that the statute was \"framed to protect the public in general.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>v. <em>Article of Drug Bacto-Unidisk, </em>394 U.S. 784, 798, 89 S.Ct. 1410, 1418, 22 L.Ed.2d 726, 797 (1969)). In <em>Muthukumarana, </em>a Maryland statute required all counties to have an operational 9-1-1 system to protect the safety and well-being of Marylanders. 370 Md. at 499-500, 805 A.2d at 403. The plaintiff posited that the statute placed on a 9-1-1 operator a duty of care to an injured citizen utilizing that service. <em>Id. </em>Again, we disagreed, stating that statutory language requiring \"broad\u201d emergency services did not evince a special benefit to a particular class of persons: \"In our view, acting to protect or assist a \u2018specific group of individuals,\u2019 sufficient to create a special relationship, involves more than general actions taken to serve members of the public at large in need of emergency telephone services.\u201d <em>Muthukumarana, </em>370 Md. at 499, 805 A.2d at 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">The assertedly relevant portion of the present statute, like the statutes in <em>Gourdine </em>and <em>Muthukumarana, </em>protects the public in general by prohibiting certain contingency fees, without enumerating a particular class of persons. Therefore, no actionable tort duty inures from \u00a7 21\u2014 809 to the benefit of Petitioners.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b747-7\">. Indeed, Respondents inform us in their brief that a speed monitoring system citation recipient contested her citation in the District Court, sitting in Montgomery County, by arguing that Montgomery County\u2019s contract with ACS violated Transportation Article \u00a7 21-809(j). She did not prevail in the District Court and appealed to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. The Circuit Court concluded ultimately that Montgomery County was the operator of its speed monitoring system and affirmed. <em>State v. St. John, </em>Criminal No. 112596 (Cir. Ct. Montgomery Cnty. 18 May 2009). Appellate review was not sought.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b747-8\">. Petitioners argue that, even if they cannot sue on an implied private cause of action in tort, the District Court would not have had jurisdiction over their claims for equitable and declaratory relief. <em>See </em>Md.Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>(1973, 2006 Repl.VoL, 2011 Cum.Supp.), Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Art., \u00a7 4-402(a), (c). Such claims, however, are separate from a private cause of action and ordinarily may be pursued independently in the Circuit Court. For the reasons to be explained in terms of the posture of the record in this case, Petitioners\u2019 injunctive and declaratory claims for relief are moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b750-7\">. As a result, we do not decide whether Petitioners had standing, on a basis other than an implied private cause of action under Transportation Article \u00a7 21-809, to seek a declaration that Respondents\u2019 contracts with ACS violate \u00a7 21-809Q) or to an injunction against Respondents' enforcement of their speed monitoring systems.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
