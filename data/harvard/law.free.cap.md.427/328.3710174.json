Bar Counsel charged London with violating several Maryland rules and statutes in his capacity as representative of Gregory Kane. Specifically, Bar Counsel alleged that London violated Maryland Rule 16-609(a) (Trust Account);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Maryland Code (1989, 2010 Repl. Vol.), Section 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article (Misuse of Trust Money);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the following Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMLRPC\u201d):<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (1) Rule 1.1 (Competence);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (2) Rule 1.3 (Diligence);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (3) Rule 1.4 (Communication); <footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> (4) </em>Rule 1.15(a) and (c) (Safekeeping Proper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>ty);<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (5) Rule 1.16(d) (Declining or Terminating Representation); <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and (6) Rule 8.4(c) (Misconduct).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">Following a hearing before a judge of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, the hearing judge issued Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law in which she concluded, by clear and convincing evidence, that London violated MLRPC Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, and 8.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>The AGC\u2019s investigation of London was triggered by the complaint of Gregory Kane. The hearing judge found Kane to be a credible witness, but said that \u201cLondon was not as credible in his testimony, with poor and incomplete records, and suggesting that much of the work he performed for Mr. Kane from 2006 until 2009 was without compensation.\u201d The hearing judge made the following findings of fact by clear and convincing evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-4\">1. Gregory Kane was introduced to Perry London in April, 2006 by Gladys Basilio in connection with the transfer of the real property located at 813 N. Carey Street from Ms. Basilio to Mr. Kane. Mr. Kane paid Mr. London $450 in cash on April 27, 2006 which represented the pre-payment of attorney fees at a rate of $150.00 per hour. Mr. London is not certain if those funds were deposited in his escrow account or in his regular account. Representing Ms. Basilio, Mr. London wrote to [Joseph] Kershner, Esquire of the Baltimore Housing Authority on April 27, 2006 and to Kyriakos [Marudas], Esquire, Assistant City Solicitor on May 11, 2006. Mr. London also had telephone contact with Mr. Marudas on July 28, 2006 and with Jennifer Lloyd, Esquire, Assistant City Solicitor. On July 31, 2006 Ms. Lloyd filed a Motion to Vacate [Judgment] and Dismiss as to 813 N. Carey Street. A handwritten note contained in [London\u2019s] file, dated April 27, 2006, indicated that once the title to the property was cleared, a recorded deed was to be forwarded to Friendly Outreach Services, Inc. The next activity in the file shows that the docket entries for the tax redemption case 24-C-99-005261 were printed on September 28, 2006, that a search of the State\u2019s Department of Assessments and Taxation Real Property Database was completed on April 3, 2007, and that a search of the City of Baltimore Tax Certificate Auction website was completed on May 15, 2007. Mr. Kane was copied on the April 27, 2006 correspondence to Mr. Kershner. There is no evidence that Mr. London ever prepared a deed for this property as he testified. There is no evidence documenting any other communication with Mr. Kane regarding this property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>2. A second file for the property located at <em>813 N. </em>Carey Street was created sometime in 2007. As of December 24, 2007 Mr. London was on notice that title to the property had not been transferred to Mr. Kane or to Friendly, his company. Lien Certificate Number 0570326, issued on December 28, 2007 at the request of Mr. London, indicated that a deed could not be recorded until clearance was obtained from the Tax Sale Section. On both December 28, 2007 and January 8, 2008 an inquiry was made to the City of Baltimore Tax Sale Work Records which indicated that the issues under case number 24-C-99-005261 regarding title to the property had not been resolved. On June 26, 2008 Mr. London wrote to the tenant at 813 N. Carey Street on behalf of Friendly, providing formal notice to [the] tenant to vacate the premises. A copy of the notice was sent to Friendly. By November 2008 the metered water bill for the premises was addressed to Gladys Basilio c/o Friendly Outreach Services. On December 11, 2008 Mr. London applied again for a Lien Certificate, which was issued on December 15, 2008. There is no other activity recorded in this file until April 1, 2010 when an inquiry was made to the Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation Real Property [Database] which indicated that the property located at 813 N. Carey Street was still titled to Gladys Basilio. There is no evidence documenting any other communication with Mr. Kane regarding this property. There is no evidence that Mr. London ever prepared a deed for this property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-4\">3. Sometime after July 3, 2006 Mr. Kane and Marriam Robinson agreed on the sale of property located at 2701 Classen Avenue in Baltimore City for a price of $11,000. Mr. Kane and Ms. Robinson came to Mr. London with a signed option agreement for the sale and an anticipated settlement date of August 20, 2006. By September 27, 2006 Mr. London knew or should have known that there were a number of outstanding liens on the property, that real property taxes had not been paid since 2003, that there may have been additional delinquent taxes for years prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>2003, and that Marriam Robinson was the personal representative of the Estate of Clifford Robinson, Jr., the recorded owner of the property. On October 13, 2006 Mr. London wrote to Ms. Robinson to discuss the liens, property taxes and water bills. There is no evidence that there was any communication with Mr. Kane regarding this development. Although Mr. London testified that nothing else happened, a draft of a deed of assignment from Marriam Robinson to Monique Donigan, Mr. Kane\u2019s new wife and business partner, reflects a date of February 8, 2007. As of March 30, 2007 $6,025.18 was required for Mr. Robinson\u2019s estate to redeem the property for unpaid taxes. On December 11, 2008 Mr. London completed an application for [a] lien certificate for the Classen Avenue property, listing Clifford Robinson as the owner. There was no evidence of any action on the case after this date, nor any communication with [Mr.] Kane, Ms. Donigan, or any of their agents. Mr. London belatedly recalled that he was paid $500 in cash in 2006 as a flat fee for his work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-6\">4. A file was opened for 428 Mosher Street on or about April 3, 2007, when a search of the State of Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation Real Property [D]atabase was conducted. A second search was conducted on June 8, 2007. On June 18, 2007 Shameka L. Littles transferred title to the property located at 428 Mosher Street to Friendly in a deed prepared by Perry A. London and notarized by Arthur London. There is no evidence that this deed was ever recorded. On May 13, 2008 the City of Baltimore Department of Public Works sent a letter to Ms. Littles at the Friendly business address regarding a request for a hearing for the metered water bill for the property. The hearing was scheduled for June 3, 2008 and Mr. London acknowledges the receipt of $500 in cash from Mr. Kane to attend this hearing, accompanied by James Cook, a Friendly employee. A handwritten note \u201cemail by 7/1 any documentation re: fire and ownership and letter of authorization from Littles\u201d is contained in the file. There is, however, no indication of when or how this request was transmitted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>Mr. Kane. On August 6, 2008 Ms. Littles signed a handwritten authorization for Mr. London to represent her at a hearing regarding the water bill. There is no evidence of any further communication between Mr. Kane and Mr. London about the outstanding water bill. Mr. London testified that he did not appear at any subsequent hearings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-4\">5. On September 9, 2009 Mr. Kane faxed to Mr. London nine pages related to a Petition to Foreclose Right of Redemption filed by Harbor Pier Homes, LLC under case number 24-C-09-004563 for the property located at 428 Mosher Street. On September 30, 2009 Mr. London filed an Answer on behalf of Shameka Littles, representing that she was the title holder and owner of the property and intended to redeem the property. The file contains a copy of the Response from the Petitioner, indicating that $11,533.36 was due as of November 3, 2009 to redeem the property. There are no other documents in the file other than the Court\u2019s Order dated March 23, 2010 denying the petition to redeem and indicating that \u201cJames Cook is not a Defendant in [this] case[\u201d] and that it was unclear to the court what interest he had in the property! ] It is undisputed that Mr. Cook was an employee of Friendly. There is, however, no copy of anything filed with the Court by Mr. London other than the September 30, 2009 Answer. There is no documentation of any communication between Mr. London and Mr. Kane or his agents regarding this property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">6. There is a file regarding 809 N. Carey Street which indicates that Mr. London received a fax from the City of Baltimore Department of Finance, Collection Division regarding this property on September 19, 2007. There is no evidence of any other activity until April 1, 2009 when a search was run on the Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation Real Property Database. There is no documentation of any communication between Mr. London and Mr. Kane or any of his agents regarding this property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">7. There is a file regarding 2123 Division Street, a distressed property which may have been purchased by Friendly Outreach Services through a tax sale. Respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>dent\u2019s Exhibit # 6 indicates that a Petition to Foreclose Rights of Redemption, filed by someone other than Mr. London in May 2005, was dismissed in March 2008 for lack of prosecution. On December 15, 2008 Mr. London obtained the tax lien record for the property. There is no documentation of any communication between Mr. London and Mr. Kane or any of his agents regarding this property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-4\">8. There are no files to reflect the corporate work which Mr. London says he completed nor are there any files that correspond with the $2,300 payment made by check on June 8. 2007 and [the] $1,500 payment made by check on November 29, 2007.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">9. The adding machine tape prepared by Mr. London reflects, in part, outstanding liens and taxes for 813 N. Carey Street, 2701 Classen Avenue and 2123 Division Street. At the bottom Mr. London made a hand written annotation \u201cplus $100 filing fee, plus 2 hearings and bail arrangements.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\">10. None of the records contain a clear description of the nature and scope of the work to be performed by Mr. London or a record of the compensation to be paid to Mr. London.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">From these facts, the hearing judge concluded that London violated MLRPC Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, and 8.4, but she could not conclude that any of the other alleged violations had taken place. Specifically, the hearing judge opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-9\">1. Petitioner alleges that the Respondent violated Rule 1.1, Competence. Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. No particular level of prior experience in real estate matters is required and it appears as if the Respondent knew which government agencies and personnel to interact with in an attempt to pursue his client\u2019s objectives. However, there is clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent failed to maintain complete and well documented client files, failed to keep the client informed of developments, failed to act diligently in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>pursuing the Ghent\u2019s objectives, and failed to maintain reliable records with regard to client funds. Therefore, the court concludes that the Respondent failed to provide competent representation to Gregory Kane.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-4\">2. Petitioner also alleges that the Respondent violated Rule 1.3, Diligence. A lawyer is required to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a chent. The Respondent was retained in connection with the 813 N. Carey Street property in April 2006 and by March 2010 the transfer of the title remained unresolved. There is no record of any [legal] services performed in relation to this property from September 2006 until April 2007, from January 2008 until June 2008, and then again from December 2008 until April 2010. The Respondent was retained in connection with the 2701 Classen Avenue property in July 2006. There is [no] evidence of any activity from March 2007 until December 2008. The passage of time adversely affected Mr. Kane\u2019s position with respect to each of these properties, as interest continued to accrue with respect to the outstanding bills and liens. For the 428 Mosher Street property the Respondent drafted a deed to transfer the title from Sham[e]ka Littles to Friendly Outreach Services, Inc. in June 2007[, and] in June 2008 the Respondent requested documentation of ownership from the client. While he requested an authorization from Ms. Littles, there is no evidence that he drafted one for her signature. Based upon the Respondent\u2019s repeated failure to monitor the work that had been undertaken, the court concludes that the Respondent\u2019s representation displayed neglect and a lack of diligence in dealing with Mr. Kane\u2019s business interests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-5\">3. Petitioner next alleges that the Respondent violated Rule 1.4, Communication. A lawyer is required to keep the chent reasonably informed about the status of the matter undertaken and to promptly comply with reasonable requests for information. There is clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent failed to maintain regular written or oral communication with Mr. Kane regarding the representations that had been undertaken and failed to keep <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>Mr. Kane apprised of [and] explain the status of the cases. Moreover, correspondence to the tenant on behalf of Friendly at a time when the Respondent knew that the title had not been transferred forms the basis for the court\u2019s conclusion that the Respondent misrepresented to the client the actual status [of the] work undertaken for 818 N. Carey Street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-4\">4. Petitioner also alleges that the Respondent violated Rule 1.15, Safekeeping Property. It is impossible to determine how much money was paid to the Respondent, when it was paid, and where it was deposited, due to the utter lack of record keeping of both the Respondent and Mr. Kane. While [the] lack of record keeping by the Respondent is extremely troubling, the court is unable to conclude that the Respondent violated Rule 1.15.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-5\">5. Petitioner alleges that the Respondent violated Rule 1.16, Declining or Terminating Representation. This court is unable to find a record of legal work completed by the Respondent or a record of time spent on Mr. Kane\u2019s matters. In this case the Commission is unable to show clearly the amounts of money paid to the Respondent and the dates when he was paid. There is also no record to support that the Respondent\u2019s assertion that he advanced money on behalf of Mr. Kane, incurred costs, or paid any fees [is untrue]. The court is unable to conclude that the Respondent violated Rule 1.16.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">6. Petitioner also alleges that the Respondent violated Rule 8.4, Misconduct. The Respondent\u2019s business practices are careless and negligent, with no clear log of activity performed on behalf of the client and no clear record of payments received. The court is convinced that the Respondent [misled] the client into believing that substantive work was being performed on the various cases. Specifically with respect to the property located at 813 N. Carey Street, the Respondent indicates in his answers to interrogatories that he prepared a deed to transfer 813 N. Carey Street and gave it to Mr. Kane to record. There is, however, no copy of any deed in the files. Instead there are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>inquiries in 2006, 2008, and 2010, all of which indicate that title to the property had not been transferred. The court concludes that the Respondents\u2019 conduct involved the misrepresentation of work he had performed for Mr. Kane and that the misrepresentation was willful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-4\">7. Petitioner next alleges that the Respondent violated Maryland Rule 16-609, Trust Account-Prohibited Transactions. This court believes that the Respondent has improperly handled unearned fees, depositing them in his operating account rather than in his trust account. However, the Commission has been unable to prove this by clear and convincing evidence and the court is unable to conclude that the Respondent violated Maryland Rule 16-609.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-5\">8. Petitioner also alleges that the Respondent violated the Maryland Annotated Code Business Occupations and Professions Article \u00a7 10-306, Misuse of Trust Money. This court believes that the Respondent has improperly handled cash received from Mr. Kane. The court also believes that the missing financial records indicate that the Respondent has been less than candid with the Commission and the court. The fact that there were no notations of any of the files surrendered to the Commission suggests that the file folders may have been substituted. However, since there is no clear evidence that Mr. Kane provided the Respondent with the $3,000 in cash from the purchase price for the Classen property to pay off the liens, the court is unable to conclude that the Respondent has misused trust money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-6\">Summary</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-7\">Based upon the record available, this court concludes that the Respondent has violated Rule[s] 1.1,1.3,1.4, and 8.4 and that the violations were caused by the Respondent\u2019s careless and negligent business practices. The record shows the aggravating factor of the prior disciplinary action against the Respondent in 1977. No mitigating factors were offered by the Respondent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">As we recently explained in <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Tanko:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-7\">In attorney discipline proceedings, this Court has original and complete jurisdiction and conducts an independent review of the record. We accept a hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact unless we determine that they are clearly erroneous. That deference is appropriate because the hearing judge is in a position to assess the demeanor-based credibility of the witnesses. In that regard, the hearing judge is permitted to pick and choose which evidence to rely upon from a conflicting array when determining findings of fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-8\">We review de novo the hearing judge\u2019s proposed conclusions of law. In other words, the ultimate determination ... as to an attorney\u2019s alleged misconduct is reserved for this Court. In that regard, we examine the record to ascertain whether there was sufficient evidence to support the hearing judge\u2019s legal conclusions, by a clear and convincing standard of proof. (Citations and quotation marks omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A18\"><em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Tanko, </em>427 Md. 15, 45 A.3d 281 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">Exceptions</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">Neither London nor Bar Counsel note any exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact, and we shall therefore accept them as established.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Md. Rule 16-759(b)(2)(A) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>(\u201cIf no exceptions are filed, the Court may treat the findings of fact as established for the purpose of determining appropriate sanctions, if any.\u201d); <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Butler, </em>426 Md. 522, 44 A.3d 1022 (2012) (same). London notes several exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s legal conclusions, arguing that his conduct did not amount to a violation of MLRPC Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, or 8.4. We shall address the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Before discussing the individual conclusions, however, it is useful to address London\u2019s overarching objection to the hearing judge\u2019s memorandum opinion. London broadly asserts that the hearing judge \u201cfailed to take into consideration the fact that London had moved his offices and all records were in storage.\u201d Because of the move, he asserts, he \u201cdid not have accessibility to the stored records,\u201d which made it \u201cdifficult for [him] to specifically respond to the statements of ... Kane.\u201d He points out that he \u201cprovided his files to the Commission immediately upon request\u201d and further asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\">The files relevant to the Court\u2019s inquiry had been provided to Bar Counsel through Bar Counsel\u2019s investigator and were not therefore available to the Respondent. The [hearing judge\u2019s] reference to these files placed the Respondent and Counsel in a difficult position since the Respondent (and thus, Counsel) did not have the ability to review same.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Yet the hearing judge recognized and dealt with the lack of records in her memorandum opinion. The opinion begins by observing that the case is \u201csomewhat challenging\u201d because \u201cneither party was able to offer clear documentation to support its version of the professional duties undertaken nor the responsibilities to be met by the Respondent.\u201d Ultimately, however, the hearing judge held the lack of records against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>London, finding that he was \u201cnot as credible in his testimony\u201d in part because of his \u201cpoor and incomplete records[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">To be sure, London made his defense more difficult by not being able to produce many of his records and, presumably, not retaining copies of the records that he provided to Bar Counsel. But a lack of records cannot prevent the hearing judge from finding violations of the MLRPC. If we were to hold that a lawyer\u2019s inability to produce records could prevent findings and conclusions based on clear and convincing evidence, we would allow bad lawyers to insulate themselves from prosecution by hiding, destroying, or simply not keeping records. Such a result would be contrary to the purposes underlying the MLRPC. Kane\u2019s testimony provides a sufficient evidentiary basis for the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions, especially since he was found to be a \u201ccredible witness\u201d while London was found to be \u201cless credible.\u201d <em>See Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. McGlade, </em>425 Md. 524, 540, 545, 42 A.3d 534, 543, 547 (2012) (ratifying the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion, based on the testimony of two credible witnesses, that the respondent had committed a violation of MLRPC Rule 8.4(c)); <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Byrd, </em>408 Md. 449, 481, 970 A.2d 870, 888 (2009) (\u201cJudge Rubin, as he was entitled to do, found Hoffman\u2019s testimony regarding the falsity of Byrd\u2019s reports to be highly credible, accurate, and reliable. Based on that testimony, there was sufficient evidence to support Judge Rubin\u2019s finding that Respondent\u2019s reports to the bankruptcy court were false, and that he knew they were false when he filed the reports.\u201d (quotation marks and punctuation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Furthermore, as described in more detail below, sound record-keeping is an essential part of competent representation, and an attorney\u2019s failure to keep or produce records can itself lead to a violation of the MLRPC. <em>See, e.g., Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Taylor, </em>405 Md. 697, 718, 955 A.2d 755, 767 (2008) (\u201c[A]n attorney violates Rule 8.1(b) when he fails to make a timely and orderly reply even though the failure was because of disorganization in his record keeping practices.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>(citing <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Sapero, </em>400 Md. 461, 486, 929 A.2d 483, 498 (2007) (lawyer violated the MLRPC when he \u201cattempted to comply with the subpoena, but did not comply, in a timely manner, because of disorganization in his record keeping practices\u201d))). In sum, London has no one to blame but himself for his inability to produce the records that he suggests would have supported his side of the story.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Cf. In re Gabriel, </em>110 N.M. 691, 799 P.2d 127, 128 (N.M.1990) (\u201cWhile appropriate record keeping of necessity involves an investment of time, there is no reason to believe that one who has attained the level of education required of a licensed attorney cannot either manage to meet these requirements or hire and train an employee to do so and provide appropriate supervision to that person.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Exceptions to Conclusions of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\"><em>A. Rule 1.3 </em>\u2014 Diligence</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">London notes an exception to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that he violated Rule 1.3, which provides: \u201cA lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">In this case, the hearing judge concluded that London\u2019s \u201cneglect,\u201d \u201crepeated failure to monitor the work,\u201d and lack of \u201cactivity\u201d on several client matters constituted a violation of Rule 1.3:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">The Respondent was retained in connection with the 813 N. Carey Street property in April 2006 and by March 2010 the transfer of the title remained unresolved. There is no record of any [legal] services performed in relation to this property from September 2006 until April 2007, from January 2008 until June 2008, and then again from December 2008 until April 2010. The Respondent was retained in connection with the 2701 Classen Avenue property in July 2006. There is [no] evidence of any activity from March 2007 until December 2008. The passage of time adversely affected Mr. Kane\u2019s position with respect to each of these properties, as interest continued to accrue with respect to the outstanding bills and liens. For the 428 Mosher Street property the Respondent drafted a deed to transfer the title from Sham[e]ka Littles to Friendly Outreach Services, Inc. in June 2007[, and] in June 2008 the Respondent requested documentation of ownership from the client. While he requested an authorization from Ms. Littles, there is no evidence that he drafted one for her signature. Based upon the Respondent\u2019s repeated failure to monitor the work that had been undertaken, the court concludes that Respondent\u2019s representation displayed neglect and a lack of diligence in dealing with Mr. Kane\u2019s business interests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">The failure to consistently monitor and manage a client\u2019s business is a classic example of a Rule 1.3 violation. <em>See, e.g., Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Fox, </em>417 Md. 504, 523, 11 A.3d 762, 773 (2010) (\u201cRespondent maintained a system for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>monitoring his active cases that was insufficient, causing Respondent to forget about [the client\u2019s] case____It appears that at some point Respondent began ignoring [the client]. Therefore, this Court finds Respondent in violation of Rule 1.3.\u201d). As we said in <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Montgomery, </em>\u201cthis Court has consistently regarded neglect and inattentiveness to a client\u2019s interests to be a violation of the Canons of Ethics warranting the imposition of some disciplinary sanction.\u201d <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Montgomery, </em>296 Md. 113, 120, 460 A.2d 597, 600 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">London argues that his conduct did not display neglect or a lack of diligence because he \u201ccontinued to monitor the various undertakings requested by the client.\u201d That may be so, but monitoring without diligent action is still a violation. For example, in <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Lee, </em>we found that an attorney who took no action in his client\u2019s matter \u201cuntil almost one year after payment of the fee\u201d had violated this rule. <em>See Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Lee, </em>390 Md. 517, 526, 890 A.2d 273, 278 (2005). Here, London\u2019s procrastination and neglect was even more egregious, as the hearing judge found, by clear and convincing evidence, that London had failed to take action in the 813 N. Carey Street matter for periods of 7 months (September 2006 to April 2007); 5 months (January 2008 to June 2008); and 16 months (December 2008 to April 2010); and in the 2701 Classen Avenue matter for a period of 21 months (March 2007 to December 2008). Such neglect is certainly a violation of the diligence norm. Moreover, by failing to prepare an authorization for Littles, London \u201cneglected to perform\u201d the necessary services for his client, which also constitutes a violation of Rule 1.3. <em>See Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Patterson, </em>421 Md. 708, 737, 28 A.3d 1196, 1213 (2011) (lawyer violated Rule 1.3 when he \u201cneglected to perform any kind of services or undertake research, to collect documents to support the complaint\u201d).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number><em>B. Rule 84 </em>\u2014 Misrepresentation</p>\n<p id=\"AJ\">London notes an exception to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that he violated Rule 8.4, which lists misrepresentation among several examples of professional misconduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-4\">It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to ... (c) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation!.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">The hearing judge concluded that London\u2019s misrepresentations regarding the 813 N. Carey Street matter constituted misconduct under Rule 8.4:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">The court is convinced that the Respondent [misled] the client into believing that substantive work was being performed on the various cases. Specifically with respect to the property located at 813 N. Carey Street, the Respondent indicates in his answers to interrogatories that he prepared a deed to transfer 813 N. Carey Street and gave it to Mr. Kane to record. There is, however, no copy of any deed in the files. Instead there are inquiries in 2006, 2008, and 2010, all of which indicate that title to the property had not been transferred. The court concludes that the Respondents\u2019 conduct involved the misrepresentation of work he had performed for Mr. Kane and that the misrepresentation was willful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">London contends that he did not willfully misrepresent to the client the status of work undertaken for 813 N. Carey Street. He first asserts that no misrepresentation occurred because he simply did what Kane requested, which was to \u201cprepare a deed to transfer 813 Carey Street[.]\u201d He did not take the extra step of recording the deed, he says, for two reasons: (1) \u201cMr. Kane is experienced in real estate and ... was ... able to undertake the recording of the deed,\u201d and (2) \u201cMr. Kane sought to minimize the costs of all legal representa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>tion and therefore, avoid or at least reduce costs by recording the deeds himself.\u201d He points out that Kane was able to record the deed himself, and that a deed need not be recorded to pass title.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Bar Counsel responded at oral argument that, although Kane may have been able to record the deed himself, Kane testified that London told him that he had \u201cfiled the deed\u201d and that he \u201chas the deed and it\u2019s taken care of.\u201d These statements are contrary to London\u2019s characterization of an agreement in which London would prepare a deed and Kane would file it. Moreover, Kane testified that he \u201cnever received any deeds\u201d from London. Thus, regardless of whether London prepared a deed and didn\u2019t file it or never prepared it at all, his \u201cmisrepresentation of [the] work he had performed\u201d clearly constituted a violation of Rule 8.4(c). We dealt with similar facts in <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Reinhardt, </em>in which we found a Rule 8.4(c) violation because the lawyer</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-5\">was dishonest and misrepresented the truth when he told his client that he was working on the case when, in fact, he had lost the file and was not working on the case at all. In dealing with his client, Respondent exhibited a lack of probity, integrity and straightforwardness, and, therefore, his actions were dishonest in that sense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-6\"><em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Reinhardt, </em>391 Md. 209, 222, 892 A.2d 533, 540 (2006); <em>see also Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Webster, </em>402 Md. 448, 462-63, 937 A.2d 161, 169 (2007) (\u201cRespondent acted dishonestly and deceitfully in violation of M[L]RPC 8.4(c) when he lied to his client about his failure to file the petition and did not promptly return her fee.\u201d); <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Harrington, </em>367 Md. 36, 48, 785 A.2d 1260, 1267 (2001) (lawyer violated Rule 8.4(c) by leading his client to believe he had filed a legal malpractice lawsuit when actually he had not).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">At the very least, London failed to communicate regarding a material fact of his representation concerning 813 N. Carey Street. The failure to communicate a material fact with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>client, when done in a misleading way, is a violation of Rule 8.4(c). <em>See Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Brown, </em>426 Md. 298, 44 A.3d 344 (2012) (\u201cThis Court will find a [Rule] 8.4(c) violation also when an attorney conceals material information from his or her client, despite not misrepresenting explicitly the information.\u201d (citing <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Bleecker, </em>414 Md. 147, 168-69, 994 A.2d 928, 940-41 (holding that the lawyer\u2019s \u201cconcealment from his client of material information regarding the dismissal of her case represents a violation of Rule 8.4(c)\u201d))); <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Calhoun, </em>391 Md. 532, 548, 894 A.2d 518, 527 (2006) (\u201c[0]ne can mislead by silence and lack of communication.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">Again, London\u2019s failure to keep adequate records clearly played a role in the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion, as she observed that there was no copy of the deed that London claims to have prepared. London is responsible for this evidentiary gap. With no reason to doubt the hearing judge\u2019s finding that Kane was a more credible witness than London, we conclude that the evidence is plainly sufficient to support a violation of Rule 8.4(c).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\"><em>C. Rule 14 </em>\u2014 Communication</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">London notes an exception to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that he violated Rule 1.4, which provides, in pertinent part: \u201cA lawyer shall ... keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter.\u201d Rule 1.4(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>The hearing judge concluded that London\u2019s general lack of communication with Kane, combined with his misrepresentation regarding 813 N. Carey Street, constituted a violation of Rule 1.4:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-4\">There is clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent failed to maintain regular written or oral communication with Mr. Kane regarding the representations that had been undertaken and failed to keep Mr. Kane apprised of [and] explain the status of the cases. Moreover, correspondence to the tenant on behalf of Friendly at a time when the Respondent knew that the title had not been transferred forms the basis for the court\u2019s conclusion that the Respondent misrepresented to the client the actual status [of the] work undertaken for 813 N. Carey Street.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">London argues that he did not violate Rule 1.4. He points out that \u201cKane was unavailable on many occasions\u201d and that he \u201cexpended a great deal of time and effort in order to communicate with him.\u201d He says that he \u201ceither directly or through the agents of Mr. Kane apprised him of the status of all matters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Yet London\u2019s misrepresentation alone constitutes a violation of Rule 1.4. <em>See Webster, </em>402 Md. at 469, 937 A.2d at 173 (lawyer violated Rule 1.4 by lying to his client, saying that he had filed a petition when he had not); <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Steinberg, </em>395 Md. 337, 369-70, 910 A.2d 429, 448 (2006) (lawyer violated Rule 1.4 by lying to his client about having filed a petition); <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Guida, </em>391 Md. 33, 41, 43-44, 891 A.2d 1085, 1089, 1091 (2006) (lawyer violated Rule 1.4 by representing that he had filed and moved forward with an adoption proceeding \u201cknowing full well that he had never filed the action with the court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Furthermore, London\u2019s difficulty in reaching his client cannot excuse his failure to keep the client reasonably informed. <em>See, e.g., Byrd, 408 </em>Md. at 457-59, 970 A.2d at 874-76 (lawyer violated Rule 1.4 by failing to notify his client of a trial date, despite his contention that he \u201chad not been able to reach his client in a couple of weeks and the last time he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>spoken to his client, she told him that she was going out of town for the 4th\u201d (quotation marks omitted)). For these reasons, this exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><em>D. Rule 1.1 </em>\u2014 Competence</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">As a sort of summary of London\u2019s violations of the MLRPC, the hearing judge concluded that London failed to provide competent representation under Rule 1.1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. No particular level of prior experience in real estate matters is required and it appears as if the Respondent knew which government agencies and personnel to interact with in an attempt to pursue his client\u2019s objectives. However, there is clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent failed to maintain complete and well documented client files, failed to keep the client informed of developments, failed to act diligently in pursuing the client\u2019s objectives, and failed to maintain reliable records with regard to client funds. Therefore, the court concludes that the Respondent failed to provide competent representation to Gregory Kane.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">London objects to this conclusion, arguing that he did not fail to provide competent representation to Kane. Although he admits to not having kept complete or well-documented files, he contends that he \u201cdid keep the client informed of developments; and he acted diligently in pursuing the client\u2019s objectives.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">Sound record-keeping is an essential part of competent representation. Rule 1.1 requires, among other things, the \u201cthoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.\u201d An important part of a lawyer\u2019s thorough preparation is keeping detailed, accurate, and accessible records. In <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Agiliga, </em>422 Md. 613, 616, 31 A.3d 103, 105 (2011), we based our conclusion that a lawyer had violated Rule 1.1 in part on his \u201cfailure] to maintain records concerning the cases of [certain clients]\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>\u201cMinimal records ... regarding [other clients].\u201d <em>See also Taylor, </em>405 Md. at 718, 955 A.2d at 767 (\u201c[A]n attorney violates Rule 8.1(b) when he fails to make a timely and orderly reply even though the failure was because of disorganization in his record keeping practices.\u201d); <em>Sapero, </em>400 Md. at 486, 929 A.2d at 498 (lawyer violated the MLRPC when he \u201cattempted to comply with the subpoena, but did not comply, in a timely manner, because of disorganization in his record keeping practices\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">London may have kept perfectly good records, but because he moved them into storage in such a way that prevented access to them, they were of no use. Without reasonable access to a client\u2019s records, a lawyer cannot hope to meet the standard of \u201cthoroughness and preparation necessary for the representation.\u201d Rule 1.1. In light of <em>Agiliga </em>and the purpose of Rule 1.1, we think London\u2019s failure to maintain accessible records constitutes a violation of Rule 1.1, and therefore overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Sanction for Violation of MLRPC Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.15, and 8.4</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Bar Counsel recommends that London be disbarred in light of his \u201cprior disciplinary record and the finding that he willfully misrepresented the status of cases to his client.\u201d Disbarment is \u201cparticularly appropriate in this case[,]\u201d Bar Counsel contends, because London was previously disbarred in 1977<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and because \u201cdisbarment is normally the appropriate sanction for intentionally dishonest conduct.\u201d In response, London\u2019s counsel suggested at oral argument that a mentoring program would be more appropriate, contending that London\u2019s unethical actions can be attributed to \u201cnegligent and careless\u201d practice. London\u2019s counsel, who is a personal friend of his, offered to serve as his mentor.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Yet as Bar Counsel correctly points out, \u201cwhen it appeal's that the attorney has engaged in intentional dishonest conduct ... disbarment will be the appropriate sanction absent compelling extenuating circumstances.\u201d <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Keiner, </em>421 Md. 492, 523, 27 A.3d 153, 172 (2011) (quotation marks and punctuation omitted) (quoting <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Palmer, </em>417 Md. 185, 207, 9 A.3d 37, 50 (2010)). Here, London presented no mitigating circumstances, and his previous disbarment militates toward disbarring him again. <em>See Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Velasquez, </em>380 Md. 651, 661, 846 A.2d 422, 428 (2004) (\u201c[T]he appropriate sanction is disbarment. This is especially so where, as in this case, the respondent previously has been disbarred.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">Concerning the misrepresentation, we find guidance in <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Lane, </em>367 Md. 633, 790 A.2d 621 (2002), in which we disbarred a lawyer for misrepresentations to his clients. As we described, the lawyer had \u201cfailed to diligently act on his clients\u2019 behalf and he then compounded this failure by engaging in a pattern of deceitful and lying conduct designed to conceal his lack of diligence.\u201d <em>Lane, </em>367 Md. at 647, 790 A.2d at 629. This is similar to what Kane described in his testimony: that London met with him as many as 10 times about the 813 N. Carey Street matter, each time representing that he was working on transferring and filing the deed, but never completed the task. Kane testified: \u201cAfter three to four years of getting the run around from [London], I was able to [complete the transfer myself] within days.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">We observed in <em>Lane </em>that such \u201ccontinual deceit\u201d could \u201cherald problems for [the lawyer\u2019s] future clients.\u201d 367 Md. at 647, 790 A.2d at 629. Thus, because \u201cthe purpose of this proceeding is to protect the public,\u201d we disbarred the lawyer. <em>Id. </em>at 647-48, 790 A.2d at 629. We also disbarred lawyers for intentionally misrepresenting work to their clients in <em>Webster, </em>402 Md. at 462-63, 474, 937 A.2d at 169, 176, and <em>Steinberg, </em>395 Md. at 369-70, 376, 910 A.2d at 448, 452.

Moreover, after reviewing the very limited record, and keeping in mind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>that the hearing judge\u2019s factual findings were based on her determination that Kane's testimony was credible, we would hold that her factual findings are supported by clear and convincing evidence, were we faced with exceptions to them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b380-5\">. London contends that his banking records \"were not requested and were placed in storage along with the files, records, and other papers which were part of [his] practice.\u201d Thus, he says that he \"disagrees with the Court that the inability to obtain these records constitutes careless and negligent business practices\u201d and instead \"submits that the inability to obtain these records does not constitute a violation of Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, and 8.4.\u201d Yet the record indicates that these records were requested during discovery when Bar Counsel sought production of \"all files maintained by you in connection with your representation of Gregory Kane[,]\u201d \"all records of funds received by you from Gregory Kane and your handling of those funds[,]\u201d and \"all records of funds pertaining to your attorney escrow account for the period of May 2006 until May 2009, including but not limited to checks, deposit slips, bank statements and client ledgers.\u201d London indicated in his response to Bar Counsel's request that the records relating to money were \"in storage and arrangements have been made to remove them from storage at which time they will be provided.\u201d Even so, many records were not provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">London also \"believes further comment is required\u201d regarding the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that he did not violate Section 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article (Misuse of Trust Money). Although the hearing judge concluded that there was insufficient evidence to find a violation, it observed that the lack of notations on any of the files suggested that certain file folders may have been substituted. London disagrees with this interpretation, explaining that his counsel \u201cinsisted ... [on verifying] that there were no notations on the files ... to evidence the fact that the testimony of Mr. Kane that the amounts paid were noted on the file and signed by him (Kane) was a lie.\u201d Yet whether the lack of notation evidenced a possible substitution, a lack of payment, or both, is irrelevant, because none of the trial judge's conclusions were based on that interpretation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b382-6\">. London additionally posits that \"the client continued to come to him for additional representation which would rebut any allegation that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>client was dissatisfied with the information being provided to him and the services being rendered.\u201d Yet even if Kane were satisfied with the services being rendered (a claim which Kane\u2019s complaint and testimony belie), it would be no defense to an MLRPC violation, as client consent cannot excuse unethical practice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b385-7\">. London also objects to the juxtaposition of \"willful misrepresentation\u201d alongside \"careless and neglectful business practices\u201d in the hearing judge\u2019s memorandum opinion. He argues that these two conclusions are inconsistent: either there was willful misrepresentation or carelessness, but there cannot have been both. Yet simply reading the trial judge\u2019s opinion reveals that these two ideas are not inconsistent. The opinion mentions carelessness and negligence in connection with London\u2019s failure to keep a \"clear log of activity performed on behalf of the client\u201d or a \"clear record of payments received.\u201d In contrast, the opinion mentions willful misrepresentation in connection with its conclusion that London \"misled the client into believing that substantive work was being performed on the various cases.\u201d These conclusions are not inconsistent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b388-8\">. <em>See generally In re Reinstatement of London, </em>356 Md. 173, 738 A.2d 852 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
