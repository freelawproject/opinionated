Jackson Hewitt, Inc., </em>422 Md. 352, 30 A.3d 193 (2011). In their brief, petitioners present two questions, which we have modified slightly and condensed into one:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGn\">Does the Maryland Credit Services Businesses Act (\u201cthe CSBA\u201d) apply to a tax preparer who receives payment from a lending bank for \u201cfacilitating\u201d a consumer\u2019s obtention of a refund anticipation loan (\u201cRAL\u201d), where the tax preparer receives no direct payment from the consumer for this service?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">According to the February 4, 2009 complaint, respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>prepared Gomez\u2019s 2006 federal income tax return,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and \u201cobtained an extension of credit for ... Gomez in the form of a RAL[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] from [a] lender,\u201d Santa Barbara Bank &amp; Trust (\u201cSBBT\u201d), \u201cin anticipation of her income tax refund.\u201d Attached to the complaint were six pertinent documents: (1) the 8-K filing to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission filed by Jackson Hewitt Tax Service Inc.; (2) a \u201cProgram Agreement\u201d between SBBT and respondent; (3) a \u201cTechnology Services Agreement\u201d between SBBT and Jackson Hewitt Technology Services Inc. (\u201cJHTSI\u201d); (4) the \u201cTaxpayer Information Form,\u201d produced by the franchisee of respondent that prepared Gomez\u2019s tax return; (5) the RAL \u201cApplication and Agreement,\u201d between SBBT and Gomez; and (6) the RAL \u201cTruth-in-Lending Act (TILA) Disclosure Form,\u201d produced by SBBT.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AoB\">According to the 8-K,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-5\">Under the SBBT Program Agreement, SBBT will offer, process and administer certain financial products, including RALs, to customers of certain of [respondent\u2019s] franchised and company owned Jackson Hewitt Tax Service locations (\u201cthe SBBT Program\u201d). In connection with the SBBT Program Agreement, SBBT will pay [respondent] a fixed annual fee. Pursuant to the SBBT Technology Services Agreement, JHTSI will provide certain technology services and related support in connection with the SBBT Program. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>Under the SBBT Technology Services Agreement, JHTSI will receive a fixed annual fee as well as variable payments tied to growth in the SBBT Program.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The Program Agreement specifically states that respondent \u201c(i) is the franchisor of the Jackson Hewitt Tax Service\u00ae tax preparation system to independently owned and operated franchisees ... and (ii) through Tax Service of America, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary, owns and operates Jackson Hewitt Tax Service locations.\u201d It also provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-6\">6. [Respondent\u2019s] Obligations and Procedures. [Respondent] agrees, in connection with the operation of the [RAL] Program, to: (i) conduct such advertising; (ii) prepare forms and other written materials; (iii) cause its offices to be equipped with computer equipment and hardware; (iv) maintain personnel; (v) train such personnel and EROs[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] with respect to the Program Protocols; and (vi) take such other actions, in each case as reasonably necessary to advertise and accommodate the facilitation of Financial Products to Applicants at its expense, as well as the following specific duties:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-7\">6.2 Application Process. [Respondent] shall require participating EROs to require that each Applicant (i) complete and sign an application in a form developed by SBBT and reviewed by [respondent] prior to each Tax Season ... which application may also include a loan agreement ... and a disclosure statement meeting the requirements of the federal Truth-in-Lending Act....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">The Information Form indicates that Gomez had requested a RAL, lists $2,323.00 as her anticipated federal refund and $1950.97 as the \u201cestimated amount of [her] RAL disbursement (this amount is net [of] all fees to be deducted from the loan and does not include any state refund amount ...),\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>states that she owes $284.00 \u201cto [her] Jackson Hewitt Tax Service office\u201d for tax preparation services.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The Application and Agreement explains that a \u201cRAL is a loan from SBBT in the amount of all or part of your refund. Your refund is used to pay back the loan.\u201d To accomplish that, the borrowers</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">authorize SBBT to receive your income tax refund(s) on your behalf and to make disbursements from your refund(s) as authorized by this Agreement. You authorize SBBT to establish a temporary deposit account (the \u201cAccount\u201d) in your name for the purpose of receiving a direct deposit of your refund.... If and when SBBT receives your income tax refunds, you authorize SBBT to deduct from your Account an SBBT tax refund handling fee and any other amounts, fees and charges authorized by this Agreement. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">The Application and Agreement also states that \u201cSBBT will pay compensation to [respondent] and an affiliate[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] ... in consideration of rights granted by [respondent] to SBBT and the performance of services by [respondent] on behalf of SBBT.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">The Disclosure Form reflects an \u201cAnnual Percentage Rate\u201d of 85.089%, which is \u201c[t]he cost of ... credit as a yearly rate.\u201d It also lists $2,323.00 as the \u201cTotal Loan Amount,\u201d which includes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-9\">\u2022 $1,950.97 as the \u201c[a]mount paid directly to you;\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-10\">\u2022 $284.00 as the \u201c[t]ax preparation fees paid to\u201d respondent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-11\">\u2022 $29.95 as the \u201cSBBT tax refund account handling fee;\u201d and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-12\">\u2022 $58.08 as the \u201ctotal prepaid finance charge (SBBT bank fee).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>Asserting that respondent is a \u201ccredit services business\u201d under the CSBA<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>, the complaint reasons that Gomez <em>\u201cindirectly </em>\u201d paid respondent for arranging<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the RAL, because the RAL \u201cincluded in its principal amount\u201d the $284.00 tax preparation fee, which the complaint describes as \u201cthe cost of obtaining this extension of credit[.]\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The complaint also reasons that respondent \u201creceived money from ... SBBT in connection with the extension of credit to\u201d Gomez,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and alleges violations of the CSBA, Md.Code Ann., Com. Law (\u201cCL\u201d), \u00a7 14-1901 <em>et seq. </em>and the Maryland Consumer Protec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>tion Act (\u201cthe CPA\u201d), <em>id. </em>\u00a7 13-301 <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>More specifically, the complaint states that respondent failed: (1) \u201cto obtain a license from the Commissioner ... as is required by\u201d \u00a7 14-1902 of the CSBA; (2) \u201cto obtain a surety bond as required by\u201d \u00a7 14-1908; and (3) \u201cto provide [Gomez] with the documents and disclosures required by\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 14-1904 to -1906, \u201cincluding but not limited to the buyer\u2019s rights and other disclosures\u201d and \u201cdetachable copies of a notice of cancellation and a contract with the necessary inclusions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Respondent moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. It acknowledges that, \u201c[i]n exchange for being permitted to offer its products in [respondent\u2019s] offices, in 2006 ... [SBBT] agreed to pay [respondent] a fixed fee,\u201d but asserts that Gomez made a payment for the RAL <em>only </em>to SBBT and \u201cdid not pay anything of value to [respondent] in exchange for receiving credit services.\u201d Because respondent did not receive <em>direct payment </em>from Gomez for credit services, respondent asserts that she \u201cfailed to state a claim under the CSBA as a \u2018consumer\u2019 who purchased services from a \u2018credit services business.\u2019 \u201d Respondent adds that Gomez\u2019s \u201cinterpretation of the CSBA would lead to absurd results in applying the statute to tremendous numbers of retailers throughout Maryland who have never registered under the CSBA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">On June 18, 2009, the Circuit Court held a hearing on the motion to dismiss, and on June 23, 2009, the court filed a Memorandum Opinion and Order. The court determined that the definitions \u201ccredit services business\u201d in \u00a7 14-1901(e) and \u201cconsumer\u201d in \u00a7 14-1901(c) of the CSBA were ambiguous \u201cbecause the language can be read in a number of different ways.\u201d Turning to the legislative history, the court concluded that the General Assembly enacted the CSBA to regulate <em>credit repair agencies, </em>and not RAL facilitators:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>It is manifest that the reason why the General Assembly passed the CSBA was to protect unsuspecting Marylanders from credit repair agencies who offered to \u201cfix\u201d their credit rating, or to obtain loans for the credit impaired customer, in exchange for a fee. The CSBA simply was neither intended nor designed to cover firms engaged in the business of selling goods or services to their customers, when such goods or services are not aimed at improving one\u2019s credit rating. Nor was it intended to cover the extension of credit by a third-party, not privy to the primary transaction, which is ancillary to the customer\u2019s purchase of the goods or services provided by the merchant....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-5\">[Gomez] is [sic] this case neither had a contract with [respondent] in return for credit services nor a contract for the extension of credit. The documents appended to her complaint make it clear that her contract in this regard was with SBBT and that the fee she paid for the extension of credit was paid by her to SBBT. The only fee [Gomez] was obligated to pay to [respondent] was the $284.00 she agreed to pay for the preparation of her income tax returns.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Accordingly, the Circuit Court dismissed the CSBA claim for failure to state a claim, and dismissed the CPA claim because it was \u201cdependant upon a cognizable [CSBA] claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">Gomez noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. That court affirmed the Circuit Court, reasoning that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-8\">[t]he plain meaning of the [CSBA] ... supports [respondent\u2019s] position and we think the legislative history undergirding the enactment of CSBA and subsequent amendments indicates that the General Assembly did not contemplate the statute\u2019s application to businesses such as [RAL facilitators].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-9\"><em>Gomez v. Jackson Hewitt, Inc., </em>198 Md.App. 87, 94, 16 A.3d 261, 265 (2011). The intermediate appellate court held, based on the analysis of an analogous credit services statute in <em>Midstate Siding &amp; Window Co. v. Rogers, </em>204 Ill.2d 314, 273 Ill.Dec. 816, 789 N.E.2d 1248, (2003), that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>the words \u201cin return\u201d suggest that the business to which the [CSBA] applies will receive payment from the consumer for <em>credit services, </em>here, the extension of credit. Like Midstate, respondent \u201csells a service \u2014 income tax preparation \u2014 and that is the only service that [Gomez] paid [respondent] to perform.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-5\"><em>Gomez, </em>198 Md.App. at 110-11, 16 A.3d at 275 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The Court of Special Appeals\u2019s examination of the legislative history of the CSBA revealed that \u201call indications [are] that the General Assembly understood its original 1987 enactment of the CSBA to be for the purpose of regulating <em>credit repair </em>agencies who take fees from consumers to improve or extend credit, or to give advice or assistance in such matters.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 113, 16 A.3d at 277 (emphasis added). As to the 2001 and 2002 amendments to the CSBA, the legislative history indicated that those amendments were \u201cprimarily aimed at \u2018payday loans,\u2019 \u201d from which the court concluded that neither \u201cthe amendments [n]or the legislative history indicate that the General Assembly ever contemplated regulating a business engaged in income tax return preparation that acts as a facilitator to permit a customer to pay a third party for a RAL.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 116-17, 16 A.3d at 277-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">As to two Advisory Notices, dated January 24, 2005 and May 15, 2008, issued by the Commissioner and interpreting the CSBA to apply to RAL facilitators, the Court of Special Appeals determined that, under the standard for judicial deference to agency interpretations established in <em>Marriott Employees Fed. Credit Union v. Motor Vehicle Administration, </em>346 Md. 437, 697 A.2d 455 (1997),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-8\">[t]he Advisory Notices ... fail to disclose the methods that the Commissioner employed in interpreting the CSBA to apply to tax preparers involved with RALs. It is [also] undisputed that this interpretation was not reached through any kind of adversarial process. Moreover, the interpretation, in our view, contradicts the plain language of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>statute. Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in failing to accord great deference to the Commissioner\u2019s interpretation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><em>Gomez, </em>198 Md.App. at 120-21, 16 A.3d at 281. The court was not persuaded by an opinion of the Office of the Attorney General, 79 Md. Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 98 (1994), which it described as \u201caddressing a substantially different set of facts\u201d from those in the instant case, in which \u201capplication of the CSBA was not the focus.... \u201d <em>Gomez, </em>198 Md.App. at 119 n. 6, 16 A.3d at 280 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Finally, \u201c[i]n light of the uncertainty as to whether tax preparers involved in RALs were intended to be covered by \u00a7 14-1901 of the CSBA,\u201d the court said, \u201cwe find consonant with our determination, the fact that the legislature deemed it propitious to enact C.L. \u00a7 14-3806(b),\u201d <em>id. </em>at 122 n. 8, 16 A.3d at 282 n. 8, part of new subtitle 38 in Section 14 of the Commercial Law Article (the \u201c2010 RAL legislation\u201d), which was \u201cspecifically aimed at regulating tax preparers involved in facilitating RALs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 121, 16 A.3d at 281. According to the court, this \u201cclarif[ying]\u201d legislation, enacted by 2010 Md. Laws, ch. 730, \u201cdirectly addresses both direct <em>and indirect </em>payments to the tax preparer\u201d by prohibiting tax preparers from charging fees to their clients who obtain RALs that exceed fees charged to clients who do not obtain RALs. <em>Id. </em>at 122 n. 8, 16 A.3d at 282 n. 8. As the court saw it, based on the legislative history,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-6\">it appears that the General Assembly\u2019s decision to create the new provisions was prompted by the Commissioner\u2019s erroneous interpretation of the CSBA [as applying to RAL facilitators] because it enacted provisions that expressly define refund anticipation loans and the roles that facilitators of those loans play, provide for disclosures to the consumer, prohibit specific acts relating to fees and misrepresentations and provide that a violation is an unfair or deceptive trade practice under the [CPA].... While this enactment does not provide the basis for our construction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>the CSBA, we believe it further supports our interpretation of the General Assembly\u2019s intent with regard to the CSBA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 123-24, 16 A.3d at 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>both the grant of a motion to dismiss, <em>Reichs Ford Rd.

This dictionary definition of \u201cpurchase\u201d requires that the recipient of goods, or in this case, services, pay money or other consideration for obtaining such services. It also requires that the provider of services receive payment for such services. It does not, however, require a <em>direct payment </em>from the recipient to the provider for the services. Nothing in section 407.635(l)\u2019s definition of a \u201cbuyer\u201d requires that the payment from the buyer to the credit services organization be a direct payment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-7\">Similarly, nothing in section 407.637.1\u2019s definition of a \u201ccredit services organization\u201d as a person who provides services \u201cin return for the payment of money or other valuable consideration\u201d requires that it be a direct payment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Jackson Hewitt notes that the dictionary definition of the phrase \u201cin return\u201d is \u201cto give or perform in return: repay\u201d and \u201cto respond in kind.\u201d Although Jackson Hewitt argues that this language contemplates only a direct exchange of payment for services between the buyer and the credit services organization, we do not read it so narrowly. As long as the credit services organization provides services to the buyer, the buyer pays for those services, and the credit services organization receives payment for the services, section 407.637.1 is satisfied. There is nothing explicit or implicit in the plain and ordinary meaning of the phrase \u201cin return\u201d that requires a direct payment from the buyer to the credit services organization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 86 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">We shall assume that respondent \u201cprovides] advice or assistance to a consumer with regard to ...

That said, to be subject to the CSBA, that \u201cadvice or assistance\u201d must be provided <em>\u201cin return </em>for the payment of money or other valuable consideration[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 14-1901(e) (emphasis added). <em>Merriavu-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary </em>998-99 (10th ed. 2000) defines \u201creturn\u201d in part as \u201cin return: in compensation or repayment\u201d and \u201cto give or perform in return: REPAY.\u201d In the context of the CSBA and \u00a7 14-190.1(e), \u201cin return\u201d can reasonably be understood to envision an exchange of assistance for payment between the consumer and the provider of that assistance and to mean that any payment to the credit services business for such assistance in obtaining the extension of credit must come <em>directly </em>from <em>the consumer. </em>This understanding of \u00a7 14-1901 is consistent with \u00a7 14-1902(1), which prohibits a credit services business from \u201c[r]eceiv[ing] any money or other valuable consideration <em>from the </em>consumer; <em>unless </em>the credit services business has secured from the Commissioner a license under Title 11, Subtitle 3 of the Financial Institutions Article[.]\u201d (Emphasis added.)

Presumably, were they not exempted, any of the entities listed under \u00a7 14-1901(e)(3) could be covered by the CSBA if they met the definition of \u201ccredit services business\u201d provided by \u00a7 14 \u2014 1901(e)(l)(i)\u2014(iii). Rather than specifically \u201cexempting\u201d RAL facilitators from the CSBA, this interpretation would simply mean that tax preparers who do not receive payment directly from the consumer are not a \u201ccredit services business.\u201d Nor are we persuaded that the enumerated exceptions necessitate an inclusion of anything not contained on that list. \u201c[N]ot all statutory enumerations are limited by\u201d the canon of <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius.

At the heart of a RAL is a tax refund that is intended to secure the loan. It is illogical to think that the General Assembly was concerned that a tax preparer would falsely generate or represent a tax refund. Similarly, \u00a7 14-1904 requires a credit services business to provide the consumer with a written information statement, which, under \u00a7 14-1905(a), must contain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-6\">(1) An accurate statement of the consumer\u2019s right to review any file on the consumer maintained by any consumer reporting agency, and the right of the consumer to receive a copy of a consumer report containing all information in that file as provided under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681g) and under \u00a7 14-1206 of this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-7\">(2) A statement that a copy of the consumer report containing all information in the consumer\u2019s file will be furnished free of charge by the consumer reporting agency if requested by the consumer within 30 days of receiving a notice of a denial of credit as provided under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681j) and under \u00a7 14-1209 of this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-8\">(3) A statement that a nominal charge not to exceed $5 may be imposed on the consumer by the consumer reporting agency for a copy of the consumer report containing all the information in the consumer\u2019s file, if the consumer has not been denied credit within 30 days from receipt of the consumer\u2019s request;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>(4) A complete and accurate statement of the consumer\u2019s right to dispute the completeness or accuracy of any item on the consumer contained in any file that is maintained by any consumer reporting agency, as provided under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681i) and under \u00a7 14-1208 of this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">(5) A complete and detailed description of the services to be performed by the credit services business for or on behalf of the consumer, and the total amount the consumer will have to pay for the services; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">(6) A statement that accurately reported information may not be permanently removed from the file of a consumer reporting agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">With the exception of section (5), such provisions are more clearly applicable to consumers seeking to improve or repair their credit score. As respondent points out, \u201c[t]here is nothing in these provisions that ... contemplates RAL transactions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">Section 14-1906 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-9\">(a) <em>Requirements. </em>\u2014 Every contract between a consumer and a credit services business for the purchase of the services of the credit services business shall be in writing, dated, signed by the consumer, and shall include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-10\">(3) A complete and detailed description of the services to be performed and the results to be achieved by the credit services business for or on behalf of the consumer, including all guarantees and all promises of full or partial refunds and a list of the adverse information appearing on the consumer\u2019s credit report that the credit services business expects to have modified and the estimated date by which each modification will occur[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">Certainly, respondent has no control over the consumer\u2019s credit report and has not been engaged to modify that report.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-12\">Finally, when \u201cseeking to ascertain legislative intent, [a court] may consider the consequences resulting from one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>meaning rather than another, and adopt that construction which avoids an illogical or unreasonable result, or one which is inconsistent with common sense.\u201d <em>Tucker v.

But, even if we assume that petitioners\u2019 interpretation is not unreasonable, a review of the legislative history, along with other extrinsic aids, confirms that view.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">As this Court recently said in <em>Brooks v.

As we see it, this language denotes an intent, on the part of the legislature, to regulate companies in the business of improving or extending credit, particularly those that over promise and mislead consumers and not companies, such as [respondent], who are in the business of tax preparation and offer to send business to a third party for a loan, without receiving a fee from the consumer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 112, 16 A.3d at 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Looking beyond the legislative history of H.B. 472, petitioners claim that the 2001, 2002, and 2010 amendments to the CSBA, which focus on payday lenders, demonstrate that the CSBA is not limited to credit repair agencies. In 2001, the General Assembly enacted S.B. 882 (cross-filed as H.B. 973) to amend the CSBA. S.B. 882 took the list of activities from which, under \u00a7 14-1902, \u201ca credit services business, its employees, and independent contractors who sell or attempt to sell the services of a credit services business\u201d are prohibited, recodified it under newly-created subsection (a), and added newly-created Section (8) to that list. Section (8) stated that a credit services business shall not, \u201c[s]ubject to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section\u201d \u2014 which was also created by S.B. 882 \u2014 \u201cassist a consumer to obtain an extension of unsecured closed end credit at a rate of interest which, except for federal preemption of State law, would be prohibited under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Title 12, Subtitle 1, 3 or 10 of this Article.\u201d 2001 Md.

Subsection (b) stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-4\">(b)(l)(i) In this subsection, \u201cPayment Instrument\u201d means a check or a draft ordering a person to pay money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-5\">(ii) \u201cPayment Instrument\u201d includes a money order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-6\">(2) Under subsection (a)(8) of this section, an extension of unsecured closed end credit includes an extension of credit for which a payment instrument is held to ensure payment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6mN\">Subsection (b) also created the Short-Term Small Consumer Loan Study Commission for the purpose of determining \u201cthe need for short-term, small consumer loans,\u201d to \u201cidentify the reasons why traditional lenders may not be fully meeting the need for short-term, small consumer loans in the State,\u201d to \u201cevaluate alternatives to help meet the need for short-term small consumer loans,\u201d and to report to the General Assembly and make a recommendation and proposal for legislation if necessary. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">The \u201cBackground\u201d section of an analysis produced by the Senate Finance Committee on S.B. 882 explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-8\">Under Maryland law, the permissible annual interest rate is 33% for small loans (under $6,000). However, under federal law, a federally insured depository institution, whether federal or state-chartered, may charge the interest rate permitted in its home state to borrowers across state lines, regardless of the legal rate in the borrower\u2019s state. Thus, for example, a bank in South Dakota, which has no interest limit, may charge a Maryland borrower an interest rate exceeding the State\u2019s 33% limit. <em>A credit services business, operating in Maryland, may broker the t?nnsaction between the borrower and the lender.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-9\">Testimony on Deferred Presentment Services (SB 601 of 2001) indicated that <em>payday lenders are partnering with a federal bank in order to </em>\u201cimport\u201d <em>rates into Maryland.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AuV\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">Included in the bill file is a letter, in support of S.B. 882, from the Director of Public Policy for the Maryland Center for Community Development to the Senate Finance Committee, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>which states that \u201cout of state banks are exporting <em>payday loans </em>to Maryland through third parties \u2014 brokers. This bill will assure that the state has the ability to enforce the small loan laws by <em>prohibiting a broker from arranging a loan </em>that is otherwise illegal by state law.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Also in the bill file is a letter to Senator Delores Kelley and Delegate Maggie McIntosh from Assistant Attorney General Robert Zarnoch (now an associate judge on the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland), in his capacity as Counsel to the General Assembly, opining that S.B. 882 \u201cis not preempted by or in conflict with federal laws regulating national banks and federal savings and loan associations.\u201d The letter explains that S.B. 882</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-4\">is <em>primarily aimed at \u201cpayday loans\u201d </em>and particularly, third party arrangements that some federally-insured depository institutions, such as national banks and federal savings and loan associations, have entered into with local agents (usually a check cashing business) to broker such loans. Because these federally-insured depository institutions may charge[, under \u00a7 85 of the National Bank Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 <em>et seq.,] </em>the interest rate permitted in their home states to Maryland borrowers, a payday borrower may be charged interest in excess of State usury laws. Senate Bill 882/House Bill 973 would not prevent federally-insured depository institutions from directly making payday loans at \u201cexported\u201d rates of interest. <em>The legislation is aimed only at local agents and the role they play in facilitating payday loans and interest rates in excess of those permitted by Maryland law </em>....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Finally, the bill file contains the Commissioner\u2019s written testimony regarding S.B. 882,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">which would prohibit the facilitation of <em>payday loans </em>in Maryland <em>by third-party agents of lenders.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-8\">During the 2000 Legislative Session the practice of out-of-state, federally insured depository institutions \u201cexporting\u201d high interest payday loans from the states where they are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>located into Maryland was raised. This practice is permitted by federal law. Nevertheless, by rejecting legislation that would have permitted these high cost loans to be made by Maryland domiciled lenders, the General Assembly made a strong public policy statement against such loans.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-5\">The federal preemption of State law as <em>to the interest rates </em>charged by the lenders together with alliances with third-party agents has provided some <em>check cashing agencies </em>with a means to avoid the Maryland usury law ceiling and to participate in making payday loans at unconscionable interest rates, far in excess of those permitted by Maryland law. While SB 882 does not and cannot interfere with the federally insured lender\u2019s ability to <em>directly </em>make those loans in Maryland, it does not prohibit local agents from facilitating the transactions.[<footnotemark>31</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">\n<em>Under the [CSBAJ, if a lender compensates a third-party to assist Maryland consumers obtain credit, the agents are subject to the Act.

Last year the General Assembly passed SB 882 which attempted to achieve this result. Amendments to that bill resulted in its failure in fact to <em>prevent payday lending as intended. </em>During the interim, a payday lender who is the agent of a third party lender has begun doing substantial business in Maryland. This bill would prohibit the activities now being conducted by that agent and should achieve the results the legislature intended last year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">Finally, in 2010 the General Assembly enacted H.B. 79 (cross-filed as S.B. 678), which added section (7) to \u00a7 14-1902,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> which states that a credit services business shall not</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>[c]harge or receive any money or other valuable consideration in connection with an extension of credit that, when combined with any interest charged on the extension of credit, would exceed the interest rate permitted for the extension of credit under the applicable title of this articled]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AA\">2010 Md. Laws, eh. 385. According to the sponsor of S.B. 678, the bill</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-5\">merely clarifies that all fees associated with <em>a payday loan </em>fall under the usury cap here in the State of Maryland, which is for a loan above $6,000 is [sic] 33%, below $6,000 is 24%. The necessity for the bill is this new business model out there allowing an out-of-state business to surpass the usury caps here in the State which have been in place for at least the past 25 years____ [W]hat we are trying to deal with is the <em>gouging of the public by essentially one company. </em>One company that charges up to 600 percent for a payday loan if you calculate in the fees that they charge---They are based in Texas. This is all done over the internet. Other states have prohibition [sic] exactly like this and what we are trying to do is close that loophole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">The Maryland Consumer Rights Coalition (MCRC) submitted written testimony to the Senate Finance Committee stating that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-11\">SB 678 is needed to close a loophole in [the CSBA] and supports <em>the legislature\u2019s intent to prohibit payday lending </em>in Maryland. Payday loans are not legal in Maryland and never have been.... Ten years ago, check cashers tried to get Maryland law amended to authorize payday loans at 391 percent APR for a two-week loan. Ten years ago, the Maryland legislature rejected that initiative and refused to make payday lending legal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-12\">Then, payday lenders partnered with banks in a \u201crent-a-bank scheme.\u201d Working with out-of-state banks, the payday lenders claimed to be brokering loans for their partner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>banks. To redress the issue, the Maryland legislature amended the [CSBA] to prevent this practice. Undeterred, payday lenders then tried to disguise payday loans as secured transactions or as payments for other services. Ace Cash Express changed its loan design to claim such transactions were \u201csecured.\u201d In 2002, the [CSBA] was amended to include secured transactions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">Recently, online lenders have tried again to subvert the Maryland legislature\u2019s decision to cap loans at 33 percent. Online payday lenders are partnering with predatory service organizations to charge interest plus service fees, making the APR up to 600 percent, far exceeding the Maryland\u2019s [sic] rate cap....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">SB 678 clarifies that all fees be included within the 33 percent cap. Closing this loophole protects Maryland consumers from predatory payday lenders and is consistent with past actions the Maryland legislature has undertaken to maintain a 33 percent rate cap in the state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-7\">Payday lending companies are not located in Maryland. Consumers are accessing payday loans online....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-8\">MCRC urges the Committee to support SB 678 to ensure that loans are brokered in such a way that the 33 percent cap is inclusive of all transaction costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">According to petitioners, the legislative history of the 2001 amendment \u201cdemonstrates that the General Assembly ... was well aware that: (1) the CSBA applies to persons who assist consumers in obtaining credit from third-party lenders; and (2) the assistance need not be related to credit repair services.\u201d Moreover,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-11\">[t]he legislative history suggests that the General Assembly was concerned as much, if not more so, with the relationship between the loan arranger and the out-of-state-lender ... as it was with the exact nature of the loan product itself, particularly in light of the fact that the State could regulate the activities of loan arrangers while the out-of-state lenders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>and their loan products were often beyond the General Assembly\u2019s reach due to federal preemption.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Petitioners assert that the enactment of the 2002 amendment \u201cfurther confirms that the General Assembly was fully aware that the CSBA applies to businesses that assist Maryland consumers in obtaining extensions of credit, <em>no matter what the purpose or intent of the loan or other extension of credit,\u201d </em>and that the 2010 amendment \u201cprovides further support for concluding that the Act applies to <em>all </em>extensions of credit.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">To be sure, the legislative history of the amendments indicates that the reach of the CSBA extends beyond ordinary credit repair services. On the other hand, the legislation was clearly industry specific and did not address expressly the issue of direct or indirect payment from the consumer to the RAL facilitator as presented in this case.

The 2001 and 2002 amendments to the CSBA directly targeted payday lenders, not RALs, and the General Assembly did not expressly indicate an awareness of the Commissioner\u2019s interpretation until 2010, when it passed the RAL legislation.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Moreover, as noted by the Court of Special Appeals, the 2005 and 2008 Advisory Notices \u201cfail to disclose the methods that the Commissioner employed in interpreting the CSBA to apply to tax preparers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>involved with RALs.

France, </em>277 Md. 432, 460, 357 A.2d 78, 94 (1976) (\u201cIt is a fundamental principle that the law does not favor repeals by implication.\u201d). They argue that the two laws can be \u201cconstrued in harmony,\u201d and to the extent they overlap one another, \u201cthe more specific enactment [shjould be operative.\u201d Respondent counters that \u201cthe RAL statute \u2014 and the accompanying legislative history files \u2014 evidences that ... the General Assembly never intended that the CSBA apply to RALs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">We are not persuaded by petitioners\u2019 argument that the 2010 RAL legislation was intended to supplement the CSBA and that RALs would be jointly regulated by both the CSBA and the 2010 RAL legislation. First, by arguing against a \u201crepeal by implication,\u201d they presuppose the application of the CSBA to RAL facilitators, a position with which we do not agree. Second, we agree with respondent that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">If the Court were to determine that both the CSBA and the RAL statute apply to [respondent], it would necessarily result in absurd and illogical consequences. Without doubt, confusion would result from the disclosures required by the CSBA \u2014 and that confusion would be compounded when combined with those required by the RAL statute. For example, if both the CSBA and RAL statute apply, a consumer would have to be presented with two separate contracts \u2014 one for a RAL and one for credit services \u2014 in different fonts and including substantially different disclo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>sures. <em>Compare </em>C.L. \u00a7 14-1906 <em>with </em>C.L. \u00a7\u00a7 14-3804; 14-3806.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-4\">Strikingly, the CSBA includes a three-day cancellation period, whereas the RAL statute requires that a RAL facilitator promptly process a RAL application. <em>See </em>C.L. \u00a7\u00a7 14 \u2014 1906(b); 14~3806(a)(6). Now, if under the CSBA, a tax preparer must wait three days before processing an application, that wait would violate the RAL statute\u2019s requirement that the application be processed \u201cpromptly.\u201d If, however, a RAL application is processed promptly, yet a taxpayer decides to \u201ccancel\u201d a credit services agreement, there is really nothing to rescind. The processing has been completed once the application is electronically transmitted to a bank. It is therefore impossible for a RAL facilitator to comply with both the CSBA and the RAL statute....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-5\">Finally, the RAL statute provides that a \u201cfacilitator\u201d <em>may </em>facilitate RALs if the facilitator complies with the RAL statute. <em>See </em>C.L. \u00a7 14-3802 (\u201cUnless the facilitator has complied with this subtitle, a facilitator ... may not\u201d solicit or facilitate the purchase of a RAL.). It does not say that the facilitator must comply with the RAL statute <em>and </em>the CSBA before facilitating a RAL.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Third, we are persuaded by the legislative history of the RAL legislation that the General Assembly never intended the CSBA to apply to RALs. Both The \u201cCurrent Law/Background\u201d section of the Fiscal and Policy Note for H.B. 1206 and the \u201cBackground\u201d section of the Floor Report for H.B. 1206 discuss the CSBA, and state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-7\">On May 15, 2008, the Commissioner ... issued an advisory notice on the application of the [CSBA] to tax preparers that facilitate [RALs].... The [Commissioner interpreted [the CSBA] to apply to all businesses (except those specifically excluded under [the CSBA]) that assist consumers in obtaining extensions of credit, including tax preparers who are compensated to assist consumers in obtaining a[RAL] from third-party lenders.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Based on this statement, it is clear that the General Assembly was cognizant of the Commissioner\u2019s position that the CSBA applied to \u201ctax preparers who are compensated to assist consumers in obtaining a [RAL] from third-party lenders,\u201d but it is hardly clear that the General Assembly agreed with the Commissioner. Passing the 2010 RAL legislation, rather than clarifying by amendment the CSBA, as it did in the case of payday loans, is, in our view, a strong indication that the General Assembly did not share the Commissioner\u2019s position that RAL facilitators were covered by the CSBA. Instead, it enacted provisions specifically related to the business to be regulated, including defining \u201crefund anticipation loan\u201d and \u201cfacilitator,\u201d and providing for applicable disclosures and fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Fourth, there is no reference in the 2010 RAL legislation to the CSBA and the need for a license from the Commissioner, but there is a direct reference to the CPA, which would be unnecessary if the CSBA was also applicable to RALs. <em>Compare </em>CL \u00a7 14-1914 (violation of CSBA is violation of CPA) <em>with </em>CL \u00a7 14-3807(a) (violation of 2010 RAL legislation is violation of CPA). Moreover, there are certain express enforcement and penalty provisions in the 2010 RAL legislation independent of those of the CSBA. <em>See </em>CL \u00a7 14-3807(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">In sum, we believe that, read in the context of the legislation as a whole, the plain language of the CSBA can reasonably and most logically be understood as reflecting the legislative intent that the \u201cpayment of money or other valuable consideration\u201d <em>in return for credit services </em>flow <em>directly </em>from the consumer to the credit services business. Therefore, under the CSBA, respondent is not a \u201ccredit services business,\u201d and Gomez is not a \u201cconsumer.\u201d In our view, the CSBA\u2019s legislative history, and the adoption of the 2010 RAL legislation specifically regulating RALs, supports and confirms that interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

The <em>Midstate </em>dissent explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">[T]he Rogers ultimately agreed to the contract <em>only </em>because Midstate offered its services to help them obtain third-party financing. The parties' agreement indicated no cash payments and stated that the contract amount of $19,600 was subject to a loan. It disclosed no information about the applicable interest rates or monthly payment amount. Midstate concedes that it assisted the Rogers in securing a third-party loan. One of its sales representatives provided the Rogers with a credit application and directed them to complete it. The representative informed the couple that Midstate would obtain financing for them and that they would make monthly payments for approximately 15 years. Again, the representative failed to provide any information concerning the actual amount of the monthly payments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-8\">After the representative's visit, a Midstate loan assistance employee reviewed the Rogers\u2019 credit application. The employee testified that Midstate assists customers with financing and that her job is to help qualify customers for loans. In this capacity, she reviews more than 50 credit applications each week. In this case, she received the Rogers' credit application, reviewed it, and then contacted a number of lending institutions on their behalf, forwarding their credit application in an effort to secure a loan. The first three institutions she contacted refused to extend credit to the Rogers. Eventually, Mid-state secured a loan commitment from Bank One at a rate of 11.35%, adjustable monthly, but the Rogers found this interest rate unacceptable. The record contains no evidence that the Rogers <em>ever </em>independently met, or otherwise undertook loan negotiations, with <em>any </em>lending institution. Thus, Midstate acted as a <em>de facto </em>representative for the Rogers in obtaining the loan commitment, for the mutual benefit of both parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-9\"><em>Midstate, </em>204 Ill.2d at 325-26, 273 Ill.Dec. at 824, 789 N.E.2d at 1255-56 (Kilbride, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b184-8\"><em>. </em>The Illinois Credit Services Act states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-9\">(a) \u201cBuyer\u201d means an individual who is solicited to purchase or who purchases the services of a credit services organization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-10\">(d) \"Credit Services Organization\u201d means a person who, with respect to the extension of credit by others and in return for the payment of money or other valuable consideration, provides, or represents that the person can or will provide, any of the following services:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-11\">(i) improving a buyer\u2019s credit record, history, or rating;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-12\">(ii) obtaining an extension of credit for a buyer; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-13\">(iii) providing advice or assistance to a buyer with regard to either subsection (i) or (ii).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-14\">815 Ill.

Rather, \u00a7 14-906(a)(2) presupposes the existence of a credit services business that is disclosing terms and conditions of payment by the consumer that could include some required payment to another person.

The weight given an agency's construction of a statute depends on several factors \u2014 the duration and consistency of the administrative practice, the degree to which the agency\u2019s construction was made known to the public, and the degree to which the Legislature was aware of the administrative construction when it reenacted the relevant statutory language. <em>Magan </em>v. <em>Medical Mutual, </em>331 Md. 535, 546, 629 A.2d 626, 632 (1993). Other important considerations include \"the extent to which the agency engaged in a process of reasoned elaboration in formulating its interpretation\u201d and \u201cthe nature of the process through which the agency arrived at its interpretation,\u201d with greater weight placed on those agency interpretations that are the product of adversarial proceedings or formal rules promulgation. <em>Balto.
