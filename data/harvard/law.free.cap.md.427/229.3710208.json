State, </em>410 Md. 352, 978 A.2d 717 (2009), the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals in the present case shall be reversed. Petitioner here, Pablo Guillermo Lancaster (Pablo), is the brother of Jovon Brian Lancaster (Jovon), the petitioner in <em>Lancaster, id. </em>They were codefendants tried together on the same charges, on the same record, and received the same convictions and sentences. Pablo raises as his sole appellate challenge in the present case whether the trial court abused its discretion in issuing a pre-trial protective order that was applicable to the brothers\u2019 trial. Jovon raised essentially the same question in his appeal, which question was answered in his favor. <em>Lancaster, </em>410 Md. at 355 &amp; n. 1, 978 A.2d at 719 &amp; n. 1. There is no principled basis upon which Pablo\u2019s question should be answered differently, including our rejection of the State\u2019s harmless error argument in each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">Judges Harrell and Raker dissent here for the reasons explained in Judge Murphy\u2019s dissent in <em>Lancaster, </em>410 Md. at 382-84, 978 A.2d at 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.
