The plaintiff\u2019s attorney procured to be taxed by the clerk of the city court of Brooklyn (in accordance with the pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>vious practice of that officer) a bill of costs including an item of one hundred and fifty dollars, for fifteen term fees.

J. Dean, &amp; Sidney V. Lowell, </em>for the defendant;</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9\">Argued: I. That all terms of the city court at which causes were tried by the court and jury, were circuit, for all purposes to which provisions as to circuit trials applied, and that in taxing costs for such cases, they must be so taxed;\u2014and:</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-7\">II. If not taxed in the same manner as in the supreme court, no costs could be taxed at all, as the only provision for the taxation of costs was the section of the Code referred to (307); and cited the local judiciary act for Brooklyn <em>(Laws of </em>184.9, \u00a74).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b147-8\">Geo. G.

The same restriction applies as at the circuit. The plaintiff can only be allowed for five terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">Ro costs of the motion, to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
