The cause must be sent back for the purpose to enable them to do so. \u2022</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-12\">Motion to correct a case made for the purpose of an appeal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-13\">After the decisions in this cause immediately hereinabove reported, the plaintiff appealed to the court at general term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>from the order made by Hr. Justice Bocees, by which his renewed motion for a new trial was denied ; and at the general term the court directed the appeal to be dismissed. Ho written opinion was delivered at the time of the dismissal of the appeal ; and upon inquiry of the judges as to the grounds of their decision, a controversy arose between the parties to the cause,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-5\">\u25a0 as to whether it was dismissed on the ground that the order was not appealable, or on the ground that the papers were not all before the court. The defendant\u2019s counsel insisted that it was because of the omission from the appeal papers of the printed case used before the court of appeals on the former appeal, the <em>remittitur </em>from that court, and the opinion of the chief judge of that court. The plaintiff insisted that there had been no such omission ; and moreover that no objection was taken to moving the appeal on this ground; or that if any was taken it was done by communication to the court in his absence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-6\">When, therefore, the plaintiff made up a <em>\u201c </em>case \u201d for an appeal to the court of appeals from the order dismissing the appeal, and included in it the papers above mentioned, the defendant\u2019s attorney moved.the court, at general term, to strike out these papers.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b133-7\"><em>J. </em>Genter, for the motion.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b133-8\"><em>Henry C. </em>Adams, plaintiff in person, opposed.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1g\">I. It was the duty of one party as much as the other to bring the papers before the appellate court <em>(Code of </em>1863, \u00a7 328). Those papers are <em>\u201c </em>a certified copy of the order appealed from, and <em>the </em>papers \u201d <em>(i. </em>e., the original papers used at special term). But,if they were not before the appellate court,. then the court had no power to act in the case at all, under counsel\u2019s objection against <em>moving </em>it, and the court should have sent the case over the term. The court had no right to receive the papers, if Hr. Genter\u2019s objection to moving the case was well founded ; and, after receiving those papers, and finding that objection well taken, the court should have there <em>stopped. </em>The court had ' no right to hold the case, and dismiss the appeal under Hr. Genter\u2019s objection to plaintiff\u2019s <em>moving the </em>case, which was secretly handed up. A dismissal of the appeal was not asked or called for by that paper, .nor otherwise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b134-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>II. There is no such thing as dismissing an appeal in such a case, for defects in the papers, nor for any cause. The reason for this is that this was a <em>non-enumerated </em>motion, heard at special term <em>(Rule </em>40), and there is no rule providing for <em>the </em>dismissal of appeals in that class of cases. The only rules providing for the dismissal of appeals, are rules 42 and 43, and they apply exclusively to <em>enumerated </em>motions, and a dismissal can he had only on a regular application therefor, upon notice, and upon proper cause shown.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b134-5\">III. As to the appeal having been dismissed on the ground of defect of papers, this is an eleventh hour device to break the plaintiff down in his case. There was no such ground taken by the court. Potter, P. J., says, upon the heels of the term, upon his recollection, then undoubtedly fresh, that the appeal was dismissed upon the ground that \u201c it was regarded as <em>not </em>an appealable order,\u201d and thinks \u201c Justice Bocees\u2019 views were adopted, and that the opinion was unanimous,\u201d\u2014and the papers upon which the court arrived at that conclusion are now returned to the court of appeals, and this court has no right to strike ourt a line of the papers upon which tljpy acted on that appeal, upon this pretence of \u201c defect of papers.\u201d</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b134-6\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"A0N\">The defendants should have made their motion to correct the ease, in the court of appeals, as the cause is now in that court upon the appeal; and no. action which may be taken by this court can be of any service to the defendants unless the case is sent back for the consideration of this court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Motion denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b134-8\"> In the court of appeals the respondent moved at the June term, 1865, to dismiss the appeal: 1st. Upon the ground that the order appealed from is not appealable. 2nd. If the said order shall be deemed appealable, then, that this court send the case back to the supreme court to correct the files of their court, and the errors complained of by defendants in this motion, by striking out of <em>the </em>case the papers and matters, which it was alleged were not before the general term, that were before the special term, held by Mr. Justice Bockes.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">The court <em>held </em>the order not appealable; ruling that they could not go behind the statement of one of the members of the court below, which was read by the respondent, that the order of dismissal was by reason of defect of papers.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">Accordingly, the appeal to the court of appeals was dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
