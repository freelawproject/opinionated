The above condition of the bond was not the only one it contained, but as they do not need to be considered they will not be mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">It is conceded that the bond was duly executed and that the written report as required by the bond was not furnished to the Commissioner of Immigration. The defendant claims that the bond was. unauthorized by the act of February 20, 1907, c. 1134, \u00a7 26, 34 Stat. 906 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1913, vol. 2, \u00a7 4275), and that the bond is therefore void. The defendant also claims that the complaint should have been dismissed, not only upon the above named ground, but because there is absolutely no proof of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">At the close of the case the defendant moved for the direction of a verdict, which motion was denied, and an exception was taken. Thereupon the plaintiff moved for the direction of a verdict in its-favor, which motion was granted, and a verdict was directed for the full amount of the bond. The important questions involved in this case are similar to those involved in the case brought between the same parties on the bond of Giovanni Pace, just decided by this court, 229 Fed. 527,-C. C. A.-, \u00e1nd are governed by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
