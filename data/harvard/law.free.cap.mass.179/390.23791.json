While this action was pending he brought an action against the indorser. This court deciding that the note was void but that the payee had a cause of action on the common counts, the payee discontinued his suit against the indorser on the note and proceeded in his suit against the maker on the count for money lent. <em>Held, </em>that the plaintiff\u2019s concurrent pursuit of his alternate and inconsistent remedies waived neither of them, and that, by suing <em>the </em>indorser on the note while his suit against the maker was pending, he had not elected to rely on the note so as to prevent him from recovering on the common counts when the note was held to be invalid.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b408-8\">In an action by a bank for money lent, the cashier of the plaintiff was asked, what transaction took place between the plaintiff and the defendant, and answered <em>\u201c </em>We on December 29th made a loan to \u201d the defendant, and further stated that lie personally attended to the transaction. The answer was objected to on the ground that the witness was permitted to state a conclusion in describing the transaction as a loan, and that whether a loan was made was a question solely for the jury. <em>Reid, </em>that the answer was the statement of a fact within the personal cognizance of the witness, and properly admitted.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b408-9\">In an action by a bank for money lent upon a note held to be void because made by the defendant to her husband, the defendant died between two trials of the case. At the new trial, the administrator of her estate, then the defendant, offered in evidence the declarations made by his intestate after the action was brought, to the effect that she never borrowed any money of the plaintiff. The declarations were offered under St. 1896, c. 445, as in an action against the administrator of a deceased declarant in which the cause of action was supported by oral testimony of a promise or statement made by the deceased person. <em>Held, </em>that the declarations were not admissible under St. 1896, c. 445, because it did not appear that the action was supported by oral testimony of a promise or statement made by the intestate. <em>Whether, </em>the declarations were admissible under St. 1898, c. 535, was not considered, because they were not so offered.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-10\">Contract, with counts upon three promissory notes and for money lent and money had and received, as stated in the opinion of the court.

Whicher, she said to her counsel, \u2018 Why, that can\u2019t be so, for such an idea never entered my head. Louis asked me if I would sign some notes as a mere matter of form, and told me that I would never hear of it again. When I went into the office on that day I sat at the table and he laid before me on the table some papers and said, \u201c Write your name there, Aunt Isabella,\u201d and I did so, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>and I never heard of the matter again after I signed my name in the office that day until Mr. King came to the house.\u2019 That to another witness she said, 11 never had any money.' I never borrowed any money from the Granite Bank.\u2019 That when she signed these papers she had no idea that any loan was being made with her. That she said in substance that Louis E. Whicher had no authority from her to procure any loan for her. To another witness, that she was nonplussed that the bank claimed that they had made her any loan. That she repeatedly said she never went near the bank ; that she never in any way, form, shape or manner borrowed any money, or, what they were pleased to term, a loan. She spoke to one of Mr. King as having deliberately lied upon the stand, and said to another that Mr. Claflin and Mr. King both lied in the matter of. their testimony to the court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-4\">The foregoing evidence was offered under St. 1896, c. 445, as in an action against the administrator of the deceased declarant in which the cause of action was supported by oral testimony of a promise or statement made by the deceased person.

A. Whicher and Company, and testified that nothing was said at any of the interviews about a loan by her at the Granite Bank or to her at the Granite Bank; that she had never made any application to the Granite Bank for a loan, that' the Granite Bank' had never approached her at any time to lend her any money, and that she had never authorized or directed any one to raise a loan for her at the Granite Bank.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b410-6\"><em>S.

The declaration contains counts upon three notes of $5,000 each, and also counts for money lent and money had and received. The case has been twice before this court. The first time it was held that the notes were void because made payable by the defendant\u2019s intestate to the order of her hus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>band and the defendant\u2019s exceptions were sustained. <em>National Granite Bank </em>v. Whicher, 173 Mass. 517. At the second trial upon an offer to show that the money was lent to the defendant\u2019s intestate the court ruled that the plaintiff could not recover upon the common counts for money lent or money had and received and the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions were sustained. 176 Mass. 547. The case has now been tried a third time, \u2014 the plaintiff relying wholly upon the count for money lent. There was a verdict for the plaintiff and the case is here upon the defendant\u2019s exceptions to the admission and exclusion of certain evidence, to the refusal of the presiding judge to give certain rulings and to certain rulings or instructions that were given.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">We take up the exceptions in the order in which the defendant has argued them on his brief. The first relates to the record of a suit which was brought by the plaintiff against Thomas A. Whicher, one of the indorsers of the notes, in March, 1898, and which was discontinued in October, 1900. The second relates to an agreement made in November, 1898, between the plaintiff and Louis E. Whicher, another indorser, in which the plaintiff agreed not to sue him upon the notes, though \u201creserving ... all rights against . . . other parties on said notes,\u201d in consideration of Whicher\u2019s agreement to pay on or before January 1, 1894, any amount remaining unpaid on the notes, not exceeding $3,750. These were offered by the defendant and admitted by .the court <em>de </em>bene. The exceptions do not state for what purpose they were' offered. At the close of the evidence the court excluded them and ruled \u201c that neither the bringing of said action nor the making of said agreement was such an election to treat the notes in suit as valid as would prevent the plaintiff from maintaining this action.\u201d The defendant excepted to the exclusion of the record and agreement, and to this ruling. There is nothing in the exceptions to show that either at the time of the ruling or at any other time in the course of the trial the defendant claimed that the record and agreement were admissible for any other purpose than to show an election on the part of the plaintiff to treat the notes as valid. The court evidently understood that that was the purpose for which they were offered and ruled accordingly. If the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>relied on any other ground of admissibility he should have then called the attention of the court to it; not having done so he is confined to their competency on the question of election. We think that the ruling of the court was right. The present action was brought nearly two years before the suit against Thomas A. Whicher was instituted and was pending when the writ was sued out in that ease. The declaration contained counts on the notes and also counts for money lent and money had and received. At the time therefore when the plaintiff brought its action against Thomas A. Whicher as indorser it was pursuing in this action its remedies against the defendant as maker of the notes and on the common counts for money had and received and money lent, and it has continued to pursue and is now pursuing the remedies to which it wras and is entitled in this action. It is difficult, therefore, to perceive how by bringing the action against Thomas A. Whicher as indorser the plaintiff has manifested its determination to rely upon the notes. At the time when it brought that action it was relying on its right to recover for money lent as well as on the notes, and as the court says in <em>Whiteside </em>v. Brawley, 152 Mass. 133, in such a case \u201c as the plaintiff takes both positions he cannot be said to have elected.\u201d The situation disclosed by the evidence is the case of a party pursuing concurrently all of its remedies until the court decides which remedy it is entitled to and until it obtains satisfaction and not a case of election. If the plaintiff had discontinued the present action after bringing suit against Thomas Whicher, and after it knew that the defendant\u2019s intestate denied her liability, it is possible that it might be held to have elected to rely upon the notes. <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Munger, </em>121 N. Y. 126. But it did not do that. On the contrary after the decision of this court in this action that the notes were invalid, it discontinued the action against Thomas, and pursued its remedy on the count for money lent which had always been a part of the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">The agreement with Louis E. Whicher stands no better, we think, than the record of the action against Thomas, and was rightly excluded for like reasons. Taken in connection with this suit which was then pending against the maker of the notes, and with the suit that was brought against Thomas, it manifests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>not a choice of remedies nor an intention to rely upon the notes to the exclusion of other remedies, but a purpose on the part of the plaintiff to avail itself of all its rights and remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">The next exception is to allowing the plaintiff\u2019s cashier to testify in answer to the questions, \u201cDid the bank in December, 1891, have any business transaction with Mrs. Whicher ? \u201d and \u201cwhat was the transaction?\u201d \u201c We on December 29 made a loan to Mrs.\" Isabella S. Whicher.\u201d We see no error in the admission of the testimony. The answer was the statement of a fact within the personal cognizance of the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The last exception which the defendant has argued relates to the exclusion of evidence which was offered of declarations made by Mrs. Whicher, the defendant\u2019s intestate. These were offered under St. 1896, c. 445, which provides that \u201c In the trial of an action against an executor or against an administrator of a deceased person in which the cause of action is supported by oral testimony of a. promise or statement made by said deceased person, evidence of statements written or oral made by said deceased person . . . tending to disprove or show the improbability of such statement or promise having been made, shall be admissible.\u201d Evidence was subsequently admitted of what Mrs. Whicher testified to at the last trial and it may be doubted whether if the evidence that was offered and excluded had been admissible, the defendant was harmed by its exclusion. But we think that it was rightly excluded. The evidence was admissible only in case the cause of action was supported by oral testimony of a promise or statement made by Mrs. Whicher. There was no such testimony and therefore the statements made by her were inadmissible. Whether it was admissible under St. 1898, c. 535, we need not consider. It was not so offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The defendant has not argued any of the other exceptions that were taken and we treat them as waived, except so far as included in the matters that have already been considered. We see no error in the instructions that were given, or in the refusal or omission to instruct as requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\"><em>Exceptions </em>overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
