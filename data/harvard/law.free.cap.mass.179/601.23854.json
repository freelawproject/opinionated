There was a safe way of removing the belt which he knew. He was using another way, when the belt caught in a space between the collar and a fixed pulley, and the plaintiff was carried up to the shafting and injured. <em>Held, </em>that if the way of removing the belt adopted by the plaintiff was dangerous, the risk was an obvious one which he must have known and chose to incur, and that he could not recover.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>In an action at common law by a workman in a factory against his employer for personal injuries, it appeared, that the plaintiff was injured while attempting to remove a belt from a revolving shaft. The plaintiff offered to show, that h\u00e9' told the defendant, that there ought to be a shipper on the belt, to ship it over the loose pulley and to hold it there, and also to show, that the belt would not stay on the loose pulley because there was no shipper to drop into a notch to hold it. The evidence was excluded. <em>Held, </em>that the exclusion of the evidence was right, as there was no evidence that the machine ever had a shipper, and the defendant was not bound to change the condition of the machine in this respect.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b622-5\">Tort, at common law, for personal injuries sustained by the plaintiff while in the employ of the defendant.

It had a loose and a fixed pulley, and a belt which communicated power from shafting about eight feet above the floor. On this shafting was a fixed pulley. About four months before the accident the shafting had been lengthened to the left as one faced the machine, and where the old and new shafting came together there was a collar consisting of two pieces of metal fastened together by set screws. The plaintiff testified that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>was there when the change was made, and knew that there was a coupling and a pulley there. It was customary, at the close of work for the day, to take the belt off the shafting; and it was while the plaintiff was engaged in this work, that the belt, which was a little wider than the space between the collar and the fixed pulley above, was caught in this space, and the plaintiff, who was standing on the floor, in some way got his hand caught, and he was carried up to the shafting and his hand and arm were injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The plaintiff was a man about sixty-seven years of age. He was not a machinist by trade, but had worked in the mill for forty years, substantially on the same kind of work, \u2014 making leather board, and button board since that came in about twelve years before. During these twelve years he had been a finisher of button board, and this work required the use of calender rolls and the trimming machine. For twelve or thirteen years he was foreman of the shop, but for some years before the accident he had not been foreman, owing to the fact that during this time the defendant\u2019s son was acting in that capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">It would be difficult to find a case where a man had had more experience than the plaintiff. He had worked for the defendant\u2019s father for ten years before the son succeeded him. He had worked for the son thirty years. So far as the running of machinery was concerned, he undoubtedly knew as much as any one, and had no need of any instructions. <em>Stuart </em>v. <em>West End Street Railway, </em>163 Mass. 391, and cases cited. <em>Ruchinsky </em>v. <em>French, </em>168 Mass. 68. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Cotton Mills, </em>169 Mass. 67, 71. <em>Lowcock </em>v. <em>Franklin Paper Co. </em>169 Mass. 313. We may dismiss, therefore, the idea that the plaintiff has any ground of recovery based upon the need of instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">There is nothing in the case to show any defect in the machine or in the belt. The only point on which the plaintiff relies is that the space between the collar and the fixed pulley was not large enough to admit the belt without danger of its being caught; but he does not rely on this, in the brief of his learned counsel, as a distinct proposition, but only as coupled with the proposition that he should have been warned of the danger. As the question is however presented by the original declaration, we proceed to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>It appears from the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, that before the shafting was lengthened, his practice was to get the belt off the fixed pulley on the shafting to the <em>left; </em>that, although there was plenty of room to the right, he continued this practice after the shaft was lengthened ; and that, although he used the machine but a few times after the shaft was lengthened, yet he knew all that there was to know about it. He testified as follows: \u201cWe never had any trouble with the belt until the day I was hurt. There never was a time before when this belt got bound between the tight pulley and the machine when I had trouble in getting it out.\u201d It further appeared that back of the machine was what was called the apron, and that a'person standing on the apron copld lift the belt, which was slack, from the space between the fixed pulley and the collar, over the collar and on the shaft beyond; and that the reverse of this was always done when the plaintiff sought to put the belt on to the fixed pulley. It also appeared that the shafting was in front of a window, and but four or five feet above the machine. The whole thing was therefore in plain view, and the plaintiff had as much opportunity as any one to see what was there, and to judge whether the thing which he had to do could be done in safety-in the way he chose to do it. There was nothing hidden or concealed from his sight, and nothing which he did not know all about. Being a man of experience a.nd intelligence, he was allowed to do his work in his own way. While there was a safe way of removing the belt, he chose another. If this way was dangerous, the danger was an obvious one, about which he must have known as well as any one in the shop. The accident appears to have been caused solely by carelessness on his part in attempting to-remove the belt, in a dim light, from a rapidly revolving shaft, <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Tillotson, </em>140 Mass. 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Two exceptions were taken to the exclusion of certain evidence offered by the plaintiff, and we proceed to consider them. The plaintiff offered to show that he told the defendant that there ought to be a shipper on the belt, to ship it over to the loose pulley and to hold it there. There was no offer to show when this was said, and the evidence might have been excluded on this ground. The objection to it is however a broader one. There was no evidence that the machine ever had a shipper, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>and the defendant was not bound to change the condition of the machine in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The plaintiff also offered to show that the belt would not stay-on the loose pulley because there was no shipper to drop into a notch to hold it. This is disposed of by what we have already said.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b627-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>INDEX.

Crabtree, 474. 4. A real estate broker who has not been successful in procuring a customer for his principal is never entitled to recover on a <em>quantum meruit </em>for work done. If his work was in fact the efficient and predominating cause of a sale concluded by another, or if the principal is unable or refuses to sell to a customer furnished by the broker in accordance with the terms of the offer, the broker is entitled to his commission; otherwise, to nothing at' all. <em>Ibid. </em>5. In an action by a real estate broker to recover a commission, it appeared, that the plaintiff was employed by the defendant, to procure a lessee for a certain hotel, and knowing the terms then acceptable to the defendant the plaintiff conducted negotiations with G. and P. on the matter, satisfying himself that they were willing to comply with the defendant\u2019s terms but getting no offer from them. The defendant then changed his mind and said he had decided not to let the hotel. Thereupon the plaintiff told the defendant that G. and P. were ready to take the hotel on the terms hitherto asked. Later the defendant dismissed the plaintiff and employed another broker who let the hotel to G. and P. substantially on the terms previously named. The jury were instructed, that if at the time the defendant changed his mind the plaintiff had gone so far in his negotiations with G. and P. that they had agreed to take a lease of the hotel on the terms named, and the defendant on being told of this had declined to let the hotel and afterwards had made substantially the same trade with G. and P. through another broker, the plaintiff could recover his commission. <em>Held, </em>that, if there had been any evidence to go to the jury that G. and P. had agreed to take a lease of the hotel on the terms named, there would have been no error in these instructions, but, there being no such evidence, an exception to the instructions was sustained. On the evidence, all that the jury would have been warranted in finding was that G. and P. were believed by the plaintiff to be ready to take the hotel on the terms named but that they never made an offer to that effect. <em>Whether </em>the plaintiff under different instructions could have recovered a commission without proving that G. and P. made an offer to take the hotel on th&lt;^ terms named, the court did not decide. <em>Ibid. </em>Liability of treasurer of corporation for misappropriation of funds, see Corporation, 3. <em>Scope of Authority. </em>6.

If an honest contract to build a schoolhouse, made by a town with a contractor who is also one of its building committee and by his vote created the majority which accepted his bid, is voidable on the ground that the agent contracted with himself, the facts, that the circumstances became fully known to the inhabitants and were discussed and voted upon at two \u00bb special town meetings without any repudiation of the contract, are sufficient to warrant a finding that the town had ratified the act of the committee. <em>Sylvester </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>236.

The decision in Af&amp;s v. <em>Schmidt, </em>168 Mass. 339, that an agreement to submit all disputes to a tribunal constituted by the parties themselves is void, has no application to an agreement of submission to arbitration under Pub.

Moreover, that the provision in regard to waiving an appeal could not be construed to exclude an appeal to the court in case of dishonest dealing or to prevent the arbitrators from presenting a question of law to the court, and that the provision for a decree in equity was at most simply invalid. <em>Ibid.

ASSIGNMENT. <em>For Benefit of Creditors. </em>1. In this Commonwealth the time named in a common law assignment for the benefit of creditors within which creditors may sign is regarded as of the essence of the contract, and the creditors who sign within that time acquire thereby the right to have the property distributed among them. <em>National Bank of Commerce </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>415. 2. An assignment for the benefit of creditors contained a provision, that no creditor should be deemed a party to it or entitled to the benefit of its provisions who failed to assent in writing to its terms within thirty days from its date, provided, that one who was a creditor at the date of the assignment might become a party after thirty days with the written consent of the assignee. The assignee by a writing indorsed on the assignment extended the time within which creditors might become parties to a period of four months from the date of the instrument. One of the creditors, knowing when the time of signing expired, neglected to sign until after the expiration of the four months and on application to the assignee was refused permission to sign. In a suit in equity brought by this creditor, to have the assignee ordered to give his written consent to the plaintiff\u2019s becoming a party to the assignment,' a demurrer to the bill was sustained, on the ground that the defendant was justified in refusing his consent. The fact, that the assignment contemplated a <em>pro rata </em>distribution among the creditors of the assignor and that the plaintiff was a creditor, was not enough to entitle the plaintiff to relief. The assignment also contemplated that only those creditors who signed it within the required time should become parties to it, and the plaintiff had not become a party in the manner provided. <em>Ibid. </em>Assignee for benefit of creditors may maintain action in his own name, see Contract, 19.

[179 ATTACHMENT. <em>Bond to dissolve. </em>1. A bond to dissolve an attachment on land under Pub. Sts. c. <em>161, \u00a7 66, is </em>not invalidated by a failure properly to describe the land, if the name of the action and the attachment are referred to, the description of the property necessarily appearing in the officer\u2019s return. <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Wasserman, </em>537. 2. In a bond to dissolve an attachment, given in 1900, a reference to Pub. Sts. c. 171, \u00a7 23, and St. 1888, c. 405, in regard to special judgments in case of proceedings in insolvency, is not inapplicable, for when such bond is given it cannot be known that the bankruptcy act of 1898 will not be repealed before final judgment, and, in case of a repeal, these provisions might be important. <em>Ibid. </em>3. A bond to dissolve an attachment of land of the principal obligor on a writ against a third person was given and accepted without first having an appraisal of the attached property under Pub. Sts. c. 161, \u00a7 126. The condition of the bond began as follows: \u201c if the above bounden F. W. shall pay to the plaintiff in said action the amount, if any, that he may recover in the action of <em>B. </em>v. <em>R. W., </em>within thirty days after the final judgment in said action; and after said B. shall establish his title to the land in a writ of entry against said F. W.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that by providing for the payment of the amount recovered in the final judgment \u201c after said B. shall establish his title to the land in a writ of entry \u201d and by executing the bond without an appraisal of the land the obligor waived the requirement for an ascertainment of the value of the land and substituted the amount of the final judgment for the appraisal, that the subsequent provisions of the bond, taken in connection with the statutes made it necessary to treat the words \u201c within thirty days \u201d in the condition of the bond as contradictory and immaterial, and that .the bond would be binding for the payment of the judgment on the establishment by the plaintiff of his title to the land attached in a writ of entry, in accordance with the provisions of Pub. Sts. c. 181, \u00a7 128, that being a condition precedent to recovery on the bond, <em>Ibid. </em>AUCTION. <em>A uthority of Auctioneer. </em>1. Because an auctioneer is the agent of both seller and buyer for the purpose of signing a memorandum of a sale made by him, it does not follow that his agency for the one is coextensive in its nature and duration with that for the other. His agency for the buyer is usually conferred when the bid is accepted and begins with the fall of the hammer. Such an authority must be exercised contemporaneously with the sale. But the auctioneer\u2019s agency for the seller is generally more extensive and may cover a time both before and after the sale. When such authority exists and is not revoked, the auctioneer may bind the seller by a memorandum signed within a reasonable time. <em>White </em>v. <em>Dahlquist Manuf. Co. </em>427.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>Mass.] INDEX. 613 2. At an auction sale of lots of real estate the terms of sale required a \u201cdeposit \u201d of $100 upon each sale. In a suit in equity by a purchaser of two separate properties at the sale, to enforce the contract to convey the lots to him, it appeared, that the defendant had placed the two properties with the auctioneer for sale ; that immediately after the auction a memorandum of one of the plaintiff\u2019s purchases was given to him by the auctioneer, and the plaintiff gave to the auctioneer his check for $100, the defendant being present; that the auctioneer told the plaintiff that it would be time enough to bring the $100 for the other purchase the next day ; that the next day the plaintiff brought to the auctioneer his check for $100 upon his second purchase and received a memorandum of that purchase signed by the auctioneer ; and that the auctioneer cashed both checks and obtained the money. <em>Held, </em>that a check so given and accepted fairly might be said to be a deposit within the general understanding of the word as used at sales by auction. <em>Held, also, </em>that the signing of the memorandum by the auctioneer on the day after the sale was good for the purpose of satisfying the statute of frauds, his agency for the seller still existing. <em>White </em>v. <em>Hahlquist Manuf.

[179 BANKRUPTCY. <em>Levies and Liens. </em>1. The effect of section 67f of the United States bankruptcy act of 1898 is not to avoid the levies and liens therein referred to against all the world, but only as against the trustee in bankruptcy and those claiming under him, so that the property may pass to and be distributed by him among the creditors of the bankrupt. <em>Frasee </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>456. <em>Unrecorded Bill of Sale. </em>2. St. 1883, c. 73, provides that an unrecorded mortgage of personal property \u201c shall not be valid against any person other than the parties thereto.\u201d By the United States bankruptcy act of 1898 the title to all property which the bankrupt before the filing of the petition \u201c could by any means have transferred or which might have been levied upon and sold under judicial process against him \u201d is vested in the trustee in bankruptcy.

St. 1897, c. 510, does not give the State board of health exclusive jurisdiction of nuisances affecting the purity of the sources of water supply. There is nothing in that statute which takes away or limits the power of local boards of health to deal with nuisances in their respective jurisdictions. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Heath, </em>385. 2. Under Pub. Sts. c. 80, \u00a7 20, giving town boards of health the power to examine into, destroy, remove or prevent \u201call nuisances, sources of filth, and causes of sickness \u201d within the town, those boards have jurisdiction over nuisances affecting the purity of the water supply as well as other causes of sickness. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>INDEX. 615 Mass.] 3. The jurisdiction over nuisances given to town boards of health by Pub. Sts. c. 80, \u00a7\u00a7 20-27, is summary in its nature, and the orders made thereunder are not subject to judicial examination and revision at the instance of parties affected by them before they are carried out. After they are carried out, however, the questions whether there was a nuisance, and, if so, whether it was caused or maintained by the parties charged therewith, may be litigated. <em>Stone </em>v. Heath, 385. 4. Where a town board of health adjudged certain deposits on land of the plaintiff to be a nuisance, and the plaintiff\u2019s land and deposits thereon of the character complained of lay partly in the town to which the board belonged and partly in an adjoining town, it was <em>held, </em>that the order of the board must be taken as limited in its scope to the town to which the board belonged, and an objection that it was in excess of their jurisdiction was not well founded. <em>Ibid. </em>5. When a town board of health has adjudged that a nuisance exists, the question what influences or motives may have set the board in motion is immaterial. <em>Ibid. </em>6. It furnishes no ground for interference with a town board of health, who have adjudged certain deposits on land of the plaintiff to be a nuisance as creating danger of pollution to the water supply of the town, that the action of the board was taken with a view to affecting proceedings in a suit pending in the Superior Court between the plaintiff and the company supplying the town with water. <em>Ibid. </em>No jurisdiction of Superior Court to restrain town board of health abating nuisance, see Superior Court.

A statute of Virginia legalizing the marriages of colored persons living together as husband and wife on February 27, 1866, provided, that, where the parties had ceased to cohabit before that date, all the children of the woman recognized by the man to be his should be deemed legitimate. Before the date named in the statute a man slave left his slave wife in Virginia and acquired a domicil in Massachusetts. Later he visited Virginia and there recognized as his a child of his slave marriage domiciled there. The father died intestate, domiciled in Massachusetts and leaving property here. <em>Whether </em>the Virginia child was entitled to the distributive share of a legitimate child in Massachusetts, or whether in order that the statute should have such exterritorial effect both parties must have been domiciled in Virginia when the act of recognition was performed, even if the domicil of the child and the bodily presence of the father would be sufficient to make the statute operative in Virginia, <em>quaere. Irving </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>216. 2. The defendant agreed to convey to the plaintiff for the price of $6,000 certain land and buildings in Massachusetts, and the contents of the buildings. The contract was made in New York and the deed was to be delivered and the money paid at the office of the defendant\u2019s agent there. The defendant was unable to give a good title, but made the contract in good faith being unaware of the defect. By the law of New York the plaintiff could recover in such a case only nominal damages and expenses, while in Massachusetts he could recover his loss of profit. <em>Held, </em>that the measure of damages was to be determined by the law of New York where the contract was made and to be performed, and that there was nothing in our procedure or mode of administering remedies to make these damages more or less. <em>Atwood </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>514.

Article 18 of the Amendments to the Constitution is as follows: \u201c All moneys raised by taxation in the towns and cities for the support of public schools, and all moneys which may be appropriated by the State for the support of common schools, shall be applied to, and expended in, no other schools than those which are conducted according to law, under the order and superintendence of the authorities of the town or city in which the money is to be expended; and such moneys shall never be appropriated to any religious sect for the maintenance, exclusively, of its own school.\u201d St. 1898, c. 496, \u00a7 3, provides that \u201c Any town of less than five hundred families or householders in which a public high school or a school of corresponding grade is not maintained shall pay for the tuition of any child who resides in said town and who attends the high school of another town or city, provided the approval of such attendance by the school committee of the town in which the child resides is first obtained. If any town in which a public high school or a school of corresponding grade is not maintained neglects or refuses to pay for tuition as provided in this section such town shall be liable therefor to the parent or guardian of the child furnished with such tuition, if the parent or guardian has paid for the same, and otherwise to the town or city furnishing the same, in an action of contract. \u2019 \u2019 There is a further provision making the town liable if the school committee refuses its approval of such attendance in a case covered by the statute. <em>Held, </em>that the statute is constitutional. The words of the amendment requiring expenditures to be confined to schools \u201c which are conducted according to law, under the order and superintendence of the authorities of the town dr city in which the money is to be expended \u201d as applied to this statute mean the town or city in which the school is where the tuition is given and where payment for it is to be made. <em>.Fislce </em>v. <em>Huntington, </em>571.

The plaintiff, a dealer in nursery stock, wrote to the defendant in England, who had previously filled orders for him, stating that he should want certain rhododendrons and other plants for the coming season, enumerating the sizes of the plants and the number of each size wanted, adding <em>\u201c </em>Kindly inform us by return mail the cost of these plants and we will cable as to filling order.\u201d The defendant answered giving the prices of the plants wanted, except of one size of rhododendrons which he could not supply. In this letter the defendant suggested a cable code by which, if the plaintiff should cable the words \u201c Light,\u201d \u201c Medium \u201d and \u201c Extra,\u201d he would be understood to order respectively three of the sizes of rhododendrons at the prices named in the letter. In reply the plaintiff cabled \u201c Ship as ordered.\u201d The defendant made no reply and shipped no goods. The plaintiff procured rhododendrons in this country at higher prices than those named by the defendant, and sued the defendant for failure to ship the rhododendrons named in the defendant\u2019s letter. <em>Held, </em>that there was no contract, that the message was not equivalent to an order to the defendant to ship such of the rhododendrons mentioned in the plaintiff\u2019s letter as the defendant had stated prices for, and there had been no order to which the message <em>\u201c </em>Ship as ordered \u201d might refer, and it naturally might refer to an order by mail on its way or to be sent. <em>Shady Hill Nursery Co. </em>v. <em>Waterer, </em>318.

They did some work before the agreement and after its execution did more, undertook the defence of suits and levied assessments, which were paid, the defendants paying $750. Thereafter the defendants\u2019 firm was dissolved and went out of business, and the defendants notified the plaintiffs thereof. Later upon a demand for the rest of their subscription the defendants refused to pay it. <em>Held, </em>that the committee by signing the agreement promised not only to accept the subscribers\u2019 money but to perform the duties named, and that \"either this promise or the subsequent work of the committee invited by the agreement was a good consideration for the defendants\u2019 subscription, the court inclining to the view, that the plaintiffs\u2019 promise alone was the consideration, but declaring that, if the acts and not the promise constituted the consideration, the defendants\u2019 promise became binding upon the first substantial act done by the committee, and, that the defendants\u2019 promise was entire and not a series of promises to pay successive sums upon successive steps by the committee. <em>Held, also, </em>on the question of damages, that the defendants did not notify the plaintiffs to stop performance until the defendants\u2019 liability had been fixed by a demand under the contract; and, even if such a notice had been given in advance, the plaintiffs would have had the right to go on with this contract where there was a common interest in the performance and where the part done and that which remained to be done appeared to be largely interdependent. <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Meles, </em>114.

Of agreement for building loan. 8. A mortgage note read as follows : \u201c For Value Received, I promise to pay to A. B. or order, $30,500, in three months from this date, with interest to be paid monthly at the rate of one and one-half per centum per month, during the said term, and until the said sum is paid in full.\u201d The note was secured by a mortgage on land on which the promisor was about to erect a block of buildings, and the consideration for the note was a written agreement for a building loan whereby the mortgagee agreed to advance to the mortgagor the sum of $30,500 in specified instalments from time to time as the work on the buildings progressed. The agreement provided that the mortgagee should not in any case be liable to make any of the stipulated payments after foreclosure of the mortgage. The note, mortgage and agreement were all delivered as one transaction about a mouth after the date of the note. Thereafter advances were made from time to time in accordance with the agreement until the mortgagor made default and the mortgage was foreclosed. <em>Held, </em>that the legal effect of the contract was that the mortgagee should have interest upon the full amount of the principal of the note from the date of the note and so long as he was under a legal obligation to furnish the money, whether it was set apart or not, and that this obligation ceased only upon the foreclosure of the mortgage. <em>Bangs </em>v. <em>Fallon, </em>77.

I also understand that this sign, as well as all other signs placed on or in the building occupied by me, advertising Rochester beer, remain the property of your company and can be removed by you or them at any time which you may elect. Should you find it necessary at any time, by reason of my not drawing your beer, to remove the special board sign in question, and should objections of any kind be raised by the owners of the building to having said sign torn down, I hereby agree to reimburse you or your company to the amount of the cost of the labor and lumber required <em>in </em>the building of such a sign, and hereby grant you the privilege to obliterate the sign matter by repainting.\u201d A postscript added \u201cIn reference to my reimbursing your company for the labor and lumber used in the within mentioned sign, I mean to convey the idea that <em>only </em>in case I should use the board for new sign or advertising purposes, that you are then to be reimbursed to the extent of its cost as above stated.\u201d The</p>\n<p id=\"b642-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>INDEX. 622 Contract <em>(continued). </em>[179 sign having been erected, the dealer, after the expiration of his license for that year, ceased to sell Rochester beer and used the signboard to advertise the beer of another company. <em>Held, </em>that the dealer\u2019s promise to reimburse the brewing company for the cost of the sign was not contingent on his ceasing to sell their beer within the period of his then existing license, and that the labor mentioned was not limited to the labor of carpenters. <em>Held, also, </em>that in an action against the dealer on his promise, evidence offered by him, to show that the sign was of benefit to the brewing company and not to him, and that the cost of the sign had been charged off by the company on its account books, rightly was excluded as immaterial. <em>Rochester Brewing Co. </em>v. <em>Killian, </em>158. Of option of corporation to take its stock at appraised value. 10. The following provision, omitting unessential words, was printed on the back of all the certificates of stock of a certain company : \u201c Should the person to whom this certificate is issued desire to sell any of his shares of stock, he shall cause such shares to be appraised by the directors of this company, which it shall be their duty to do on request, and shall thereupon offer the same to them for the use of the company at such appraised value ; and if said directors shall choose to take such shares for the use of the company, such person shall, upon the payment or tender to him of such appraised value thereof, and the dividends due thereon, transfer and assign such share or shares to said company; provided that the said directors shall not be obliged to take such shares at the appraised value aforesaid, unless they shall think it for the interests of the company; and if they shall not, within fifteen days after such shares are offered to them in writing, take the same and pay such person therefor the price at which the same shall have been appraised, such person shall be at liberty to sell and dispose of the same shares to any person whomsoever.\u201d One of the original stockholders requested the directors of the company to appraise his shares under the foregoing provision. They refused to do so, whereupon the stockholder sold his shares at auction and sued the company on its alleged contract to have the shares appraised on such request, alleging that by reason of the refusal of the directors to appraise his shares they had sold for much less than their true value. <em>Held, </em>on demurrer, that the defendant had not made the agreement alleged, but that the plaintiff had agreed to cause his shares to be appraised by the directors, and, what the declaration alleged had not been done, was the thing that the plaintiff agreed to cause to be done. <em>Held, also, </em>that the purpose of the appraisal was to fix the price to be paid for the stock, if the company should elect to take it, and that the stockholder had no right to an appraisal unless the stock was to be taken for the company. <em>Whiton </em>v. <em>Batchelder </em>\u00a7\u2022 <em>Lincoln Corp. </em>169. Of agreement concerning execution of trust. 11. Six heirs at law and legatees of a certain testator, three of whom were the trustees under his will, made an agreement in writing containing the following: \u201c The amount of income from said Estate which has never yet been paid to us, and which is still remaining in the hands of the Trustees</p>\n<p id=\"b643-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>Mass.] INDEX. 623 of said Estate undivided, appears on the hooks of account of said Est\u00e1te as \u2018 undivided income account,\u2019 and is the property of us individually free and clear of any trust, in equal proportions, to wit one fifth part of said undivided income belonging to each one of us, and forms no part of said Trust Estate and shall not go to the last survivor of us, but shall be paid to each of us upon demand or to our Executors or Administrators ; and if any share of said 1 undivided income \u2019 as aforesaid or any other accrued income shall be paid after the decease of any one of us, it shall carry interest from the day of the death of that one of us, to be paid out of the said trust estate; the share of said G. being applied upon his promissory notes now . held by said Trustees agreeably with the terms of an agreement signed by him, dated March 8th, 1872, and now in the hands of said Trustees.\u201d Also <em>\u201c </em>that the whole income from said trust estate for the year 1874 and for each and every year subsequent thereto, shall each year be paid over by the said Trustees to the person or persons entitled to receive the same by the terms of said Will\u201d; and \u201c that the trust Estate which shall pass to the last survivor of us shall be, and shall be limited to the capital sum which said Trustees received in trust at the death of said D. H. with the natural increase thereof, but not any income derived therefrom up to the time when the last survivor shall become eptitled to the whole of said estate by the terms of said will.\u201d In a suit in equity against the trustees, to enforce the trust arising from this agreement, the trustees set up the statute of limitations. <em>Held, </em>that the effect of the agreement was not to convert the relation between the plaintiff and the trustees into that of debtor and creditor, but to provide for the execution and carrying out of the trust in accordance with the terms thus <em>established; </em>that the defendants were to continue to hold the property in trust and to account for it as trustees; and consequently that the claim was not barred by the statute of limitations. <em>Pearson </em>v. <em>Treadwell, </em>462.

The contractor shall also sign and duly attest a.statement, before final payment is made, that all claims for materials provided or labor performed on this property are paid and satisfied in full, and that there are no claims whatsoever against the owner of this property.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that the foregoing requirements were conditions precedent which the contractor must fulfil before he could sue on the contract. <em>Leverone </em>v. <em>Arando, </em>439. 13. A building contract provided, that.\u201c the contractor under the direction and to the satisfaction of C., architect, acting for the purposes of this contract as agent of the said owner, shall and will provide all the materials and perform all the work mentioned in the specifications and shown on the drawings.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that this did not go further than to make the architect the agent of the owner in the matter of deciding whether the work done fulfilled the requirements o\u00a3 the specifications and drawings, and did not give him authority to waive, in behalf of the owner, the terms on which the owner had stipulated that the payments were to be made when the work described had been done to the architect\u2019s satisfaction. <em>Ibid. </em>14. A contractor, who has altered a house under a contract requiring the work to be performed to the satisfaction of the architect of the owner, and requiring a certificate of the architect\u2019s approval before payment, may recover for items of extra work specially ordered by the owner without the knowledge of the architect, although the architect has given no certificate of approval. <em>Ibid. </em>15. The mason\u2019s specifications of a building contract contained the provision, \u201c All needed permits must be obtained from the proper authorities.\u201d The construction of a bay window was included under the mason\u2019s specifications, and it appeared, that a permit for a bay window would be issued only upon a personal application by the owner of the property. It further appeared, that before the making of the contract the owner had applied twice for such a permit and had failed to obtain one, and that the permit was obtained, by him six weeks after the contract was signed. The owner being sued on the contract sought to be allowed in recoupment for damages caused by the work being suspended for six weeks immediately after it was begun on account of the want of the bay window permit and also the amount of $22 expended by him in finally procuring such a permit. <em>Held, </em>that, if by the proper construction of the above provision of the specifications it was made the duty of the plaintiff to obtain the bay window permit, he had not undertaken, by agreeing to perform the work prescribed in the specifications, to insure that the permit would be issued without delay. <em>Held, also, </em>that the defendant was not entitled to be allowed the $22 paid by him, as the provision did not throw upon the plaintiff the duty of obtaining the bay window permit, which had to be obtained on the personal application of the owner. <em>Qucere, </em>whether the requirement went any further than to provide that no work should be done until a permit had been obtained. <em>Ibid. </em>16.

The contractor, at the request of the owner and his architect, put in a new three inch waste pipe in a place not to interfere with the bay windows, and connected the sinks with it. Before this was done, there was a discussion between the parties as to whether the new pipe would be an extra, and the architect with the consent of the defendant gave the plaintiff 'a written order \u201c to proceed at once and finish plumbing according to contract, and if there is any additional cost for three inch pipe and connections, the same will be allowed.\u201d In a suit by the contractor in which he was not allowed to recover on the contract on account of his non-performance of conditions precedent, it was <em>held, </em>that the plaintiff was entitled to recover for putting in the new waste pipe and connecting the kitchen sinks with it as extra work outside of the contract. <em>Held, also, </em>that the trial judge did not err in leaving to the jury the question whether this plumbing was covered by the contract, as it was not a question of the construction of a contract, but depended upon what plumbing was in the building before the alterations were made, a question of fact for the jury. <em>Held, also, </em>that this extra work was covered by the written order, and that extrinsic evidence was competent to identify the \u201cthree inch pipe and connections \u201d mentioned in the order. <em>Leverone </em>v. <em>Arando, </em>439.

One cannot be held liable on an implied contract to pay for that which he declined to permit to be done on his account, except that when one refuses to perform an obligation which the law imposes upon him, the law in some cases treats performance by another as performance for him and implies a contract on his part to pay for it.

In an action on an account annexed to recover for services rendered at the request of the defendant in the settlement of a claim against a city for damages for land taken under the right of eminent domain, if the amount named in the declaration is the amount which it was agreed the plaintiff should receive, if successful in making the settlement, this does not prevent him from recovering the reasonable value of his services although the settlement was not made by him, if on the evidence the jury could have found that he was entitled to be paid for his services if they were not successful. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Haskell, </em>312. 19.

It further provided that <em>\u201c </em>Within thirty days from the filing of any stockholder\u2019s dissent, as above provided, the, lessee shall file its petition with the supreme judicial court sitting within</p>\n<p id=\"b648-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>INDEX.

Under this provision, the lessee filed petitions against certain holders of the preferred .stock of the lessor who had filed their written dissent under the above provision, alleging that the respondents or the persons whose shares they held voted for the approval of the lease and were not entitled to the rights of dissenting stockholders, and prayed for a decree that the respondents were not entitled to have their shares purchased by the lessee under the above provisions or, in the alternative, if the respondents were so entitled, that they might be ordered to deposit their certificates and that commissioners might be appointed to appraise the value of their shares for purchase by the lessee. <em>Held, </em>that under the provisions of the section above named the court had jurisdiction to declare that the respondents were not entitled to the rights of dissenting stockholders under the act, as well as to grant the alternative relief in case they were so entitled, it being more convenient to allow the petitioner to try all questions in one proceeding than to require it to file a separate additional bill, the petitioner having to proceed within thirty days by the 4terms of the statute and there not being time to try first the one question and then the other. <em>Boston </em>\u00a7\u2022 <em>Maine Railroad </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>62. 5.

If goods sold and paid for are not delivered, the measure of damages usually is their market value at the time and place at which they should have been delivered, but special circumstances may make the vendee\u2019s actual loss greater than the sum given by this common rule. When the special circumstances are known to both parties and each has contracted with reference to them, the party in fault justly may be held to make good to the other whatever damages he has sustained as the reasonable and natural consequences of a breach under the circumstances contemplated by the parties. <em>Semble, </em>that a vendor may always avoid such consequential liability by expressly declining to assume it, as in order to hold him his assent must be found from the facts.

In an action of tort for the conversion of articles of plumbing taken from an unfinished house of the plaintiff by a plumber on the failure of the contractor who employed him, it appeared that, after work upon the house had been abandoned by the contractor, the plaintiff caused the house to be completed, and that $1,500 of the contract price had not been paid by the plaintiff to the contractor. The defendant offered to show, that all the cost of plumbing work done under the plaintiff\u2019s direction after he took possession, including the replacing of the articles removed by the defendant, was paid for out of this $1,500. The evidence was excluded. The defendant contended that the plaintiff by the application of the $1,500 to the plumbing had recouped his damage from the contractor and could not recover it again. <em>Reid, </em>that the evidence rightly was excluded. The $1,500 belonged to the plaintiff and not to the contractor and its application to one purpose or another was immaterial. <em>Munroe </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>165. DECEIT. 1. For the purpose of supporting an action of deceit refraining from action to the plaintiff\u2019s loss in reliance upon the false representations of the defendant in legal effect is acting upon the falsehood. It makes no difference whether a plaintiff has been induced to buy property or to refrain from selling it. <em>Fottler </em>v. <em>Moseley, </em>295. 2. The question whether certain reported sales of the stock of a corporation are fictitious may have an important bearing upon the conduct of a man holding some of the shares and thinking of selling them, and a false representation knowingly made by a broker, that the reported sales were</p>\n<p id=\"b651-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>Mass.] INDEX. 631 genuine, which induced such stockholder to retain his shares to his loss instead of selling them, will support an action of deceit, if the jury find that on the facts the representation was material. <em>Foltler y.

Whether the loss suffered by a director of a corporation from his retaining certain shares of the stock of the corporation which he had intended to sell, after a broker falsely and fraudulently had represented to him that certain reported sales of the stock were genuine, is attributable to the fraud, is a question of fact for the jury. <em>Ibid. </em>Materiality of evidence to show damages in action for false representations concerning credit of another, see Evidence, 8.

In 1682 the town of Gloucester voted at a town meeting that \u201c Jacob Davis and others joyninge along with him hath liberty of the streame at the head of the Little River to sett up a saw milne.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that by this grant, though without words of inheritance, a fee in the easement passed to the grantees. The rigid rules of construction applicable to modern conveyances are not to be applied to transactions of this kind, which took place soon after the settlement of the country when conveyancing was little understood. For the same reason the easement granted was not limited to damming the waters of the stream for the purpose of running a saw mill. <em>Gloucester Water Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Gloucester, </em>365. 2. In 1860 and thereafter two brothers P. and A. held each one undivided quarter of certain land. J. the son of P. acquired a mortgage on this land. In 1891 P. died leaving his interest to J. Four years later J. produced an unrecorded release from A. to P. dated February 1, 1880, by which he contended that A. had conveyed to. P. all his interest in the land. J. recorded this release in 1895, and entered to foreclose his mortgage. In 1896 A. died, and thereafter his heirs brought a bill against J. to redeem from the mortgage. J. set up the release of February 1, 1880, in defence to the bill. The release, after referring to a deed of other land not material, referred to a certain deed from one G. to A., the grantor, dated December 19, 1854, and continued as follows: <em>\u201c Now </em>therefore the said P. did verbally agree to and with A. now of said Everett that if he the said A. would pay one half of the purchase money with all other incidental expenses connected with said parcels, and pay one half the costs of all improvements connected with or on said parcels he would convey to him an undivided half part of his interest in the same, I, the said A., having failed in every particular to perform my part of the conditions to be done and performed by me to entitle me to the same do hereby absolutely release all my right, title and interest in and to said parcels of real estate that I may have acquired in any way whatever, and I do hereby remise, release and quitclaim unto the said P. and his heirs and assigns and do absolve him from all obligations under his promise.\u201d There was a deed from G.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>632 INDEX. [179 to A. dated December 19,1854, but it did not convey the land in question. The mortgaged land was conveyed by another deed from G. to A. dated June 1, 1854, not named\u2019 in the release. It appeared, that the recitals in the release were not in accordance with the facts; also, that after the date of the release no change was made in the treatment of the property and that after that date as before A. was treated as the owner of a one quarter interest in the land, for eleven years during which P. lived, and for four years after P.\u2019s death during which P.\u2019s clerk was living, and that in 1891 J. in a letter to certain park commissioners offered to sell the land, stating that he was duly authorized by the owners, P. one quarter interest, A. one quarter interest, and two others mentioned. <em>Held, </em>that the release of February 1, 1880, if it ever took effect at all, applied to the land conveyed to A. by the deed of December 19, 1854, and not to the land sought to be redeemed from the mortgage, which was conveyed to him by the deed of June 1, 1854. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>555.

A devise to the testator\u2019s children gives a vested interest unless the will shows a contrary intention. <em>Stanwood </em>v. <em>Slamvood, </em>223. 2. When by a will real property is given to several persons by name to be shared equally among them, they take as tenants in common, and not as joint tenants or as a class, and if one of them dies before the testator his share lapses and does not go to the survivors, unless they are the heirs at law of the testator. <em>Ibid. </em>3. A testator devised all his real estate to a trustee, for the equal benefit of his five children named who were to receive the net income equally during a certain period, at the termination of which, the trustee was to divide the property held by him under the trust equally among the testator\u2019s \u201c said children and their respective heirs and assigns.\u201d One of the children died before the testator, and another of them died after the testator but before the time of distribution. <em>Held, </em>that the gift was not to the children as a class with right of survivorship, but that the children took a vested interest as tenants in common. Consequently, that the share of the child who died after the testator went to the executor of that child, and that the share of the child who died before the testator lapsed, and was held by the trustee upon a resulting trust for the benefit of the testator\u2019s heirs at law. <em>Ibid. </em>4. <em>Semble, </em>that a provision in a will, that the trustees thereunder shall have no power to sell any part of certain land devised for a charitable use, would not be construed as an attempt to limit the power of the court to authorize a sale, even if it is possible to limit it and thus make specific land inalienable forever. Per Holmes, C. J. <em>Amory </em>v. <em>Attorney General, </em>89. 5. A testatrix, having by her will directed that all her real estate, consisting of an estate called Seven Oaks, should be devoted to a certain charitable</p>\n<p id=\"b653-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>Mass.] INDEX. 633 use, and that the trustees should have no power to sell any part of Seven Oaks, made in a codicil the following provision : \u201c I hereby cancel everything in my said will, which limits the charitable uses to which my real estate and other property in B. shall be put by the beneficiaries therein named and described; and I now direct that said beneficiaries may use such estate and the income of the trust fund, for all and any such purposes as shall be approved and sanctioned by the trustees holding for them,\u201d and authorized the trustees to lease or sell any portion of the real estate with the assent of the beneficiaries and to use the proceeds \u201c for improvements or other needs of same charity.\u201d Held, that the above directions in the codicil did not mean that the fund might be used for any purpose, whether charitable or not, which the trustees might approve, but only that it might be used for such charitable uses as they approved, the words \u201c any such purposes \u201d referring back to the words \u201ccharitable uses.\u201d <em>Amory </em>v. <em>Attorney General, </em>89. 6. A testator left the residue of his estate to his wife \u201c to have and to hold at her free will and disposal during the remainder of her life,\u201d and, at her death, left \u201c such portions of the estate as may remain \u201d to his daughter. In an action by the widow of the testator to recover damages for a refusal to purchase from her certain land on the ground that she could not give a good title under her husband\u2019s will, it was <em>held, </em>that the testator left the plaintiff the disposal of his estate and the determination of how much of it should remain, and therefore that she had at least a power to convey a fee. <em>Sawin </em>v. <em>Cormier, </em>420. 7. A will contained this provision : \u201cI do hereby give and bequeath to my legal heirs all my estate of every description with the exclusion of my brother L.\u2019s heirs, and it is my will that they shall have no part or parcel of my estate; also that part that would legally belong to my brother S. I do hereby order to be held in trust by my said executor and the income to be paid by my said trustee to the said S. yearly, and when in the opinion of my said trustee that the said S. or any of his family need it for their necessary support then my said trustee is at liberty to pay over the whole' or any part of the principal as he may deem best.\u201d At the time of the testator\u2019s death he held three notes against S. the earliest of them dated after the execution of the will. There was nothing to show that when the will was executed S. was indebted to the testator or that it was expected that he would be. <em>Held, </em>that, in ascertaining the \u201c part that would legally belong \u201d to S., the word \u201c legally \u201d should not be interpreted in its strict and technical sense, and that the indebtedness of S. to the testator should not be deducted. <em>Bigelow </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>331. 8. A testator died seised of four parcels of land, leaving a widow, one son and one daughter. One half of one parcel of land, on which was his house, he gave to his son when he should arrive at the age of twenty-one years and gave him the remaining half on the death of the testator\u2019s widow. He also gave his son another parcel either outright or on the same terms. The remaining two parcels he gave to his daughter when she should arrive at the age of twenty years. Then followed this clause: <em>\u201c </em>My personal estate to be divided, in the manner following after my estate</p>\n<p id=\"b654-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>684 INDEX.

D.\u201d Both the son and daughter survived the widow and both died childless after reaching the age of twenty-one years. <em>Held, </em>that the contingency intended to be described was the event of the testator\u2019s children dying childless before reaching the age of twenty-one years, and that G.

Where a grantor in pursuance of a common scheme imposes restrictions on land sold to various grantees, he can waive his own right to enforce the restrictions but not that of any of his grantees. <em>Ivarson </em>v. <em>Mulvey, </em>141. 4. A restriction on suburban land to continue for eight years only, that no dwelling house placed thereon \u201c shall contain more than two tenants, or be constructed for more than two families,\u201d is violated by the construction of a house of three stories containing seventeen rooms available for three families although the owner does not intend to use it for more than two families until the eight year limit of the restriction has expired. <em>Ibid. </em>5. Where an owner divides a tract of land into building lots and as part of a general scheme for its improvement inserts in the deeds of sale restrictions as to the purposes for which the land may be used, if it sufficiently appears that the intent of the grantor was to benefit the lot owners generally, it is not necessary, in order that the restrictions should be enforceable, that they should be exactly the same in all the deeds, if the differences are not substantial. <em>Also, </em>the fact that two of the lots, one sold before the plan was made, and the other a very small one, were sold without restrictions is not inconsistent with a general scheme of the grantor imposing restrictions on the remaining lots. <em>Bacon </em>v. <em>Sandberg, </em>396. 6. It appears to be settled in this Commonwealth, that a plaintiff is not prevented from enforcing in equity a building restriction by the fact that he has not objected to a violation of the restriction by some one in the neighborhood other than the defendant. But, when the plaintiff has violated the restriction himself, the question whether he is entitled to relief depends largely on whether the plaintiff\u2019s breach of the restriction was so material and substantial as to enable the court to say that it ought not to interfere in his behalf. <em>Ibid. </em>7. In a suit to enforce an equitable restriction in the deed of the defendant, that no building or structure should be placed within thirteen feet of a certain street, it appeared, that the defendant had put up a one story building the whole of which was within the prohibited thirteen feet, and that the plaintiffs had violated the same restriction in their own deeds by projecting from their respective houses bay windows, piazzas and steps into the</p>\n<p id=\"b656-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>636 INDEX. [179 restricted space. <em>Held, </em>that, although the plaintiffs could not invoke the aid of a court of equity to prevent the defendant from erecting a piazza, bay window or steps extending into the restricted space, the building of a separate house in this space was something which they had not done, and' they were entitled to a decree ordering the defendant to remove the structure thus erected by him. <em>Bacon </em>v. <em>Sandberg, </em>396.

When land is taken for a reservoir \u201c to take and hold water,\u201d all water which gathers in the reservoir from springs or by percolation, not flowing in a stream, by necessary implication also is taken. <em>Gloucester Water Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Gloucester, </em>365. 2. A corporation created for the purpose of supplying a city with water was given the right to take water from ponds. The charter contained a provision, that the corporation within a certain tim\u00e9 \u201c after the taking of any land or water rights \u201d should file in the registry of deeds \u201c a description of any land so taken \u201d and a further provision, that no application should be made for the assessment of water rights until the water was \u201c actually taken and diverted \u201d by the corporation. The corporation took and diverted the water of a certain pond for less than a year, supplying the city with water therefrom while its principal reservoirs were in process of construction and then abandoned the use of the water of the pond and never resumed it. No description of the water taken was filed in the registry of deeds. <em>Held, </em>that, without deciding whether the actual diversion of water would be a legal taking of it within the meaning of the statute authorizing the taking, such a temporary use of the water for less than a year, then abandoned and never resumed, was not a legal taking of the water within the meaning of the act as against a person who had rights in that water and who had not elected to treat it as a taking of it. <em>Ibid. </em>Whether water rights can be taken by eminent domain without a writing, see Estoppel, 4.

A deed was given by an administrator in obedience to a decree of the Probate Court, under Pub. Sts. c. 142, \u00a7 4, for the specific performance of an agreement to convey the land. All parties acted in good faith, but the deed was void, because the decree was made without notice to persons interested. The grantee paid the purchase money in accordance with the agreement, occupied the premises for about twelve years with the knowledge of the heirs at law of the grantor\u2019s intestate and, without objection from anybody, made substantial repairs and additions and paid the taxes. In a writ of entry brought by one claiming under an heir at law of the grantor\u2019s intestate, to recover the premises, it was <em>held, </em>that, as an equitable defence under St. 1883, c. 223, \u00a7 14, the tenant had a title in the property that would be enforced in equity, being in the position of an equitable assignee of the original contract of sale. <em>In this case </em>the original contract of sale ran to the husband of the tenant. <em>Held, </em>that the tenant\u2019s rights as equitable assignee were not affected by the marital relation. <em>Nazro </em>v. <em>Long, </em>451. <em>To restrain Foreclosure of Mortgage. </em>2. A bill in equity, to restrain the foreclosure of a mortgage on the ground, that after the delivery of the mortgage and note there was a material alteration of the note without the plaintiff\u2019s assent, contained no allegation of fraud or of fault on the part of the mortgagee, and no allegation that the note or the debt which the mortgage was given to secure had been paid or that there was any tender or offer of payment. <em>Held, </em>that the bill did not state a case which entitled the plaintiff to relief in equity. <em>Jeffrey </em>v. <em>Rosenfeld, </em>506. <em>To restrain Sale below Agreed Price. </em>3. In a suit in equity by the owner and manufacturer of a proprietary medicine, the trade-mark of which was registered in the patent office of the United States and in the office of the secretary of this Commonwealth, against a retail dealer in drugs and medicines, to restrain him from selling the medicine .below a certain price, it appeared, that the medicine was sold by the plaintiff under a written contract by which the purchaser agreed that he would not sell nor allow any one in his employ to sell the medicine at less than a certain price per box, which was a higher price than that at which the defendant was selling it to the public, that the defendant bought the medicine knowing the conditions on which it was sold by the plaintiff, but did not buy it from the plaintiff or from one who purchased it from him. There was nothing to show that the defendant had faudulently induced or procured the breach of a contract between the plaintiff and any of his vendees. <em>Held, </em>that the contracts made with the plaintiff by the original purchasers could be enforced only against them, and that a purchaser from a purchaser had an absolute right to dispose of the property as he pleased. <em>Garst </em>v. <em>Hall Lyon Co. </em>588.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>638 Equity Jurisdiction (continued). INDEX. [179 <em>Continuing Trespass. </em>4. The defendant, a manufacturing corporation, owned a strip of land eleven feet wide running through the land of the plaintiff and had the right to use it as a raceway for its mill. The defendant in clearing out the raceway widened it to twenty feet or more, thus making an unlawful use of the plaintiff\u2019s land which it intended to continue. In a suit in equity seeking an injunction and also an order to the defendant to restore the plaintiff\u2019s land to its condition before the trespass, it was <em>held, </em>that the plaintiff was entitled to an injunction against such a continuing trespass, but, as the value of the land interfered with was very small and the advantage to the plaintiff of restoring it to its former condition would be very slight, and the expense to the defendant would be much greater than the advantage to the plaintiff, that justice and equity did not require that the defendant should be ordered to restore the land to its former condition, but that the damages suffered by the plaintiff from the acts already done should be assessed, and the defendant be enjoined from further unlawful acts. <em>Cobb </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Chemical Co. </em>423. <em>Specific Performance. </em>Of agreement to leave property by will. 5. A woman eighty-five years old offered in writing to give to her sister, seventy years old, all the property she should leave at her decease, if the sister and her daughter would come and stay with her during the remainder of her life. The younger sister accepted the offer and with her dough-' ter came from a distant State and stayed with the older sister until her death thirty-eight hours after their arrival. She died intestate, leaving real estate worth about $4,000 and personal property worth about $2,000. In a suit in equity brought by the surviving sister against the administrator of the estate of the deceased sister and the heirs at law of the deceased, it was <em>held, </em>that the contract was fair and equal, and, although it could not have been specifically enforced against the plaintiff, was of such a nature that the time for performance by the defendant could not come until the plaintiff\u2019s part had been fully performed, that the plaintiff had fully performed her part of the contract, and that, considering the situation of the parties and their relation to each other and the moderate size of the estate, the plaintiff should not be relegated to her rights in an action at law, but was entitled to a decree ordering that the real estate be conveyed to her and that the administrator pay over to her all personal property remaining in his possession after satisfying all claims against the estate. <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>30. Of oral agreement to redeliver pledged stock. 6. The plaintiff had transferred certain stocks to the defendant, a bank, as security for his note for $5,000. Thereafter the plaintiff was adjudged an insolvent. The defendant on its own petition was ordered by the Court of Insolvency to sell the securities and apply the proceeds upon the note. Thereupon the plaintiff and defendant made an oral agreement, that the plaintiff should procure some one to purchase certain of the securities for</p>\n<p id=\"b659-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>Mass.] INDEX. 639 $1,000, which sum when paid should be credited upon the note, that the defendant should bid in the remaining securities for $2,700 in all if no higher bid was made for them and the amount of the bids should be indorsed upon the note, that the defendant should hold and carry the securities thus'bid in, and, upon receiving from the plaintiff the amount of its bids with interest, and the balance of the $5,000 of the note with interest, should convey the securities to the plaintiff. In pursuance of this agreement the plaintiff procured a purchaser who paid $1,000 for the securities to be sold for that sum, and the defendant delivered those securities and indorsed the payment on the note and on the same day bid in at auction the remaining securities for $2,700 and indorsed that amount on the note. The defendant proved for the balance of its claim in insolvency and received a dividend. The plaintiff received his discharge. In a bill for a specific enforcement of this contract, by ordering the defendant to deliver the securities to the plaintiff on his paying to the defendant the balance of his indebtedness, it was <em>held, </em>that the contract was entire, embodying a single scheme, each part having reference to the others, by which the plaintiff might save his collateral ; that, assuming the contract to be within the statute of frauds, the statute was satisfied by the payment of the $1,000 by the purchaser procured by the plaintiff and the acceptance and receipt by him of the securities thereby purchased; that the plaintiff\u2019s agreeing to procure and procuring such purchaser could be found to be a good consideration for the promise of the defendant ; and that the contract was one which the court would specifically enforce in spite of there being no mutuality of remedy when the contract was made, as the plaintiff must perform his part of the contract by tendering the balance of his indebtedness before the time for performance by the defendant could arise. <em>French </em>v. <em>Boston National Bank, </em>404. As to power of Probate Court to decree specific performance against administrator, see Probate Court, 1. <em>Laches. </em>7. An executor of a <em>cestui que trust </em>seven and a half years after his appointment brought a bill in equity against the trustees to enforce a trust arising from a written agreement in force before his appointment. The delay of the executor appeared to have been principally if not wholly due to a desire on his part to avoid litigation, some of the trustees apparently taking the ground at one time that they were not liable. <em>Held, </em>that under such circumstances loches could not be imputed to the executor. <em>Pearson </em>v. <em>Treadwell, </em>462. 8. In a suit to enforce an equitable restriction in the deed of the defendant, as to the place and manner in which he might build upon his lot, it appeared, that the defendant obtained a permit to build on May 9, and that the building was finished about June 10 or 12, that on May 17 a petition was circulated to stop the work and presented to the mayor of the city, that about May 20 one of the plaintiffs had a conversation with the defendant and objected to the building on the ground of restrictions, that on May 27 and June 1 letters complaining of the building were written to</p>\n<p id=\"b660-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>640 INDEX. [179 the defendant, that on June 5 or 6 the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney had an interview with the defendant in which the defendant said he would let the plaintiffs know in a short time whether he would remove the building or not, that the building was not removed, and on June 14 the bill was filed. Held, that there was, nothing in these facts to show unreasonable delay on the part of the plaintiffs in bringing their bill, or anything showing either actual consent or passive acquiescence on their part, and that the defence of loches was wholly unsupported. <em>Bacon </em>v. <em>Sandberg, </em>396.

Where a bill in equity contains no averment of any fraudulent act or conduct on the part of the defendant, the use of the word \u201c fraudulently \u201d in characterizing his acts, adds nothing to the averments'of fact in the bill. <em>Garst </em>v. <em>Hall </em>$\u2022 <em>Lyon Co. </em>588. <em>Answer under Chancery Rules. </em>2. Under the Chancery Rules adopted by this court in 1884 and still in force, all answers, except in case of bills for discovery, are to be treated as pleadings merely and cannot be excepted to for insufficiency. Rules 17 and 18 are to be construed as applying only to bills for discovery. <em>Pearson </em>v. <em>Treadwell, </em>462. <em>Remedy at Law. </em>3. The objection to jurisdiction in equity that the plaintiff has an adequate . remedy at law cannot first be taken after a master\u2019s report has been filed. <em>Haskell </em>v. <em>Merrill, </em>120. <em>Master\u2019s Report. </em>4. Exceptions to a master\u2019s report based on evidence cannot be considered unless the evidence is reported. <em>Haskell </em>v. <em>Merrill, </em>120. 5. Exceptions will not lie to a master\u2019s report on the ground that he used the words \u201cloan,\u201d \u201csecurity\u201d and \u201cdelivery\u201d in his findings thereby stating conclusions of law from facts. Such words by stating a conclusion allege by implication that facts exist which justify it. If it becomes material to separate the pure facts, the party wishing this can ask for a ruling. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b661-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>Mass.] INDEX. 641 <em>Construction of Petition. </em>6. A petition, under St. 1889, c. 442, to determine the nature and extent of the rights of way claimed by the respondents, under a certain deed, in and over a private way called Townsend Place in Boston, alleged, that the petitioners were the owners of certain lots of land situated on Townsend Place with the buildings thereon together with a right of way and of drainage in, upon, and over said Townsend Place as appurtenant to said lands. <em>Held, </em>that it was the title to the right of way and not the title to the land of Townsend Place that was intended to be and was the subject of the petition. <em>Minot </em>v. <em>Cotting, </em>825.

One owning land on the line of a proposed sewer in Boston agreed with the street commissioners and the head of the sewer department that he would convey to the city his land within the lines of a new street where the sewer was to run, in consideration that nothing should be paid for sewer assessments on his adjoining property or for the right to enter the sewer therefrom, and conveyed the land. Subsequently it was voted by the aldermen, with the approval of the mayor, that the assessments for this sewer be assumed by the city on account of the adjoining estates not being benefited by the sewer. A permit to connect the premises with the sewer was issued by the sewer department and the connection was made. A purchaser of this land, on inquiring before his purchase at the collect- or\u2019s office and the sewer department, was informed that there were no assessments or charges against the land. Later this purchaser sued the city for injuries from an overflow of the sewer caused by the alleged negligence of the city. The defence relied upon was that the plaintiif\u2019s drain was not lawfully connected, because there was no payment before entering the drain at the rate of two cents per square foot of all land benefited by the connection, as required by the Kev. Ord. of Boston of 1885, c. 27, \u00a7 15. <em>Held, </em>that, even if for any reason the city had a right to repudiate its bargain, and if the issue of the permit was beyond the power of the sewer department, the city could not repudiate its agreement while still holding the land conveyed to it, and that until he had notice to the contrary the plaintiff had a right to rely on the information which he had received from the city and to assume that he was entitled to protection as one lawfully connected with the sewer. <em>Hendrie </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>59. <em>By Conduct. 2. </em>In a suit by a woman to enforce against the estate of her deceased sister an agreement of the deceased to leave all her property to the plaintiff, it is YOL. 179. 41</p>\n<p id=\"b662-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>INDEX.

In an action to enforce a contract of the defendant to convey certain land to the plaintiff, it appeared, that the plaintiff visited the office of the defendant\u2019s counsel who in the presence of the defendant gave the plaintiff a draft of a deed of the land prepared for execution by the defendant and by his wife as releasing dower, to take to the plaintiff\u2019s conveyancer who was to examine the title. Later the plaintiff demanded a deed of the land which the defendant refused. Neither the plaintiff nor his attorney had returned the draft and so far as appeared had retained it in their possession. <em>Held, </em>that the plaintiff by his retention of the draft in no way lost his right to require a deed. <em>White </em>v. <em>Dahlquist Manuf. Co. </em>427. 4. Cases holding that the owner of water rights may treat the actual diversion of the water by a municipality or corporation having a statutory right to take water as a legal taking of it, may rest upon the ground that the defendant is estopped to deny that there has been a legal taking, and are not decisive of the question, whether a man can be deprived of his property by an act <em>in pais </em>purporting to be done under the right of eminent domain unaccompanied by a writing or other declaration defining the measure of interference with his ownership of the property.

The fact, that the demandant in a real action has made out a case sufficient to entitle him to go to the jury, does not throw the burden of proof upon the tenant. <em>Jaquith </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>192. 2. An auditor\u2019s report without changing the burden of proof makes it incumbent upon the other party to go forward with evidence to rebut and control it, but, after evidence has been put in on both sides upon the matters dealt with by the auditor, it would be error to instruct a jury, that there was a presumption of fact that the auditor\u2019s report was right. In such a case it is for the jury to consider the evidence anew and to settle for themselves how far they should be influenced by the report. <em>Wyman </em>v. <em>Whicker, </em>276.

In an action for the conversion of a bond, the defendant introduced evidence for the purpose of showing that the bond was pledged as security by the plaintiff to certain brokers under whom the defendant claimed, and that the plaintiff\u2019s account with the brokers at that time was short. The plaintiff testified, that at no time had he been indebted to the brokers and that on one or two occasions during the period in question he lent the brokers money which was repaid by their checks. The plaintiff against the defendant\u2019s objection was allowed to pub in evidence five checks from the brokers to him dated during the period in question. <em>Held, </em>that the checks tended as far as they went to corroborate the plaintiff\u2019s case and were admissible as against a merely general objection. <em>Scollans </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>346. In action by broker for commission. 4. In an action by a real estate broker to recover a commission for services in effecting an exchange of lands, finally completed by other brokers and with certain changes in the bargain which the plaintiff contended were unessential details, it is proper to exclude evidence, offered by the defendant, as to the particular steps taken and the trouble experienced by' the other brokers in carrying out the new features of the modified bargain, with which the plaintiff did not pretend to have anything to do and which he contended were not essential parts of the transaction; even if under any circumstances it would be pertinent, whether the plaintiff could have done the things which were done by the other brokers, and if the trouble of others would have been a criterion of what the plaintiff could have done. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>400. 5. In an action by a real estate broker to recover a commission for services in effecting an exchange of lands which was finally completed by other brokers, a letter from one of these other brokers to another of them, offered by the defendant as <em>\u201c </em>a part of the history of the transaction which culminated in the sale,\u201d may be excluded as immaterial besides being <em>res inter alios.

The plaintiff offered to show that the defendant held other property of hers more than sufficient to cover all loans which the defendant had made to her and which he had a right to apply to the payment of the loans, and that the defendant did not investigate and report to the officer the state of the general account between him and the plaintiff. <em>Held, </em>that the evidence properly was excluded as immaterial, having no bearing whatever upon the pledging of the property of another which was the only thing that the defendant was reporting to the officer. <em>Held, also, </em>that evidence to show an offer of the plaintiff to pay the defendant after her discharge from arrest was likewise immaterial, as also was evidence that the plaintiff gave the pawn ticket to the owner of the pledged articles and had no intention of committing a fraud, neither of these facts being known to the defendant at the time he called in the officer. <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Collateral Loan Co. </em>268. To show damages in action of deceit. 8. In an action for false representations of the defendant whereby the plaintiff was induced to place $5,000 in the defendant\u2019s hands for investment, it appeared, that the plaintiff intrusted the sum named to the defendant for investment and thereafter received from him certificates purporting to represent shares in an investment association. The plaintiff was allowed to testify that she received $20 in July, $100 in October, and $100 the next January on her investment, and nothing more ; also that she had endeavored in every manner to realize on her investment, by way of collection, without success. She was also allowed to testify, that thereafter the defendant advised her to employ a New York lawyer to compel . one S. to return to her her money, this evidence being admitted to show an admission by the defendant as to the value of the certificates. <em>Held, </em>that, on the question of damages, it was competent for the plaintiff to show what she had paid the defendant and what she had received in return, and that the admission of the defendant was competent on the question of the value of the certificates. <em>Stannard </em>v. <em>Kingsbury, </em>174. To show fraud against creditors. 9. In a real action to recover land conveyed to the tenant through a third person by her husband, on the ground that the conveyance was fraudulent as against creditors, the demandant asked the tenant\u2019s husband \u201c How much were you indebted in 1898 at the time of your examination as a poor debtor ? \u201d and stated that his offer was, to show that the witness at the time of the examination referred to had no debts other than the claim of the bank represented by the demandant. <em>Held, </em>that the question properly was excluded, the fact sought to be proved having .no legitimate bearing on the question in issue. <em>Jaquith </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>192.

By the law of Vermont an instrument of adoption of a child is required to be acknowledged before the judge of probate of the district where it is filed.

In an action by an actress against the proprietor of a theatre, to recover for the breach of an oral agreement to employ the plaintiff during the fall and winter season of a certain year, the plaintiff was allowed to testify to a conversation with the defendant, which resulted in her signing a written contract for the summer season containing a provision that it might be terminated by either party by two weeks\u2019 notice in writing, and also resulted in an oral agreement for the following fall and winter season from which the two weeks\u2019 notice clause was by special agreement omitted. <em>Held, </em>that the defendant was in no way harmed by the admission of the evidence of the conversation, by which the plaintiff did not seek to vary or control the written contract, but merely to show the circumstances under which the Sral agreement was made. <em>Drake </em>v. <em>Allen, 197. </em>Parol evidence admissible to identify certain extra work mentioned in written order, see Contbact, 16. <em>Res Gestee. 17. </em>When a transaction is competent in evidence, declarations which are part of and characterize it are competent for the same purpose for which the transaction itself is competent. <em>O'Connell </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>250. 18. In an action of tort in the nature of trespass <em>quare clausum, </em>to determine a disputed boundary, the defendant testified that his deed was delivered to him elsewhere than on the premises, but that a few days before its delivery, he went upon the premises and through the house and yard in company with his grantor who then pointed out to him a fence as a boundary. This was admitted, not as evidence of boundary, but as evidence of seisin of the defendant\u2019s grantor. <em>Held, </em>that the evidence was competent to prove seisin, the pointing out of the fence as the boundary being part of the <em>res gestee. Ibid. Admissions and Confessions. </em>19. In a criminal case the defendant\u2019s failure to reply to a statement made in his presence concerning a material matter and under such circumstances as to call for a reply or denial, is evidence against him. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O'Brien, </em>533. 20. One who claimed under a deed of release, wishing to show that it conveyed a certain lot of land belonging to the grantor which was not expressly described in it, testified as follows: \u201c I showed him [the grantor] that release, and asked him what it meant, and he said, 11 don\u2019t know.\u2019 I said, 1 That is your signature.\u2019 He said, \u2018Yes,\u2019 and I said, \u2018You made it out,\u2019 and he said, \u2018 Yes, I made it out,\u2019 and then said, \u2018 I don\u2019t remember about it.\u2019 \u201d It appeared, that at this time the grantor seemed to be failing and his memory to be very poor. <em>Held, </em>that the evidence did not warrant a finding of a master, that when the deed was shown to the grantor \u201c he did not attempt to repudiate it or deny that it applied to the property \u201d which was the subject of the suit, as there was nothing in the evidence which showed that the question, whether the release applied to the land in dispute, was ever presented to the mind of the grantor. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>555.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>Mass.] INDEX. 647 <em>Declarations of Deceased Persons. </em>21. On an exception to the admission of the declarations of a deceased person under St. 1898, c. 535, if it appears that the declarant was dead at the time of the trial, the admission of the evidence shows that the presiding judge was satisfied that the declarations were made in good faith before the beginning of the suit and upon the personal knowledge of the declarant. <em>Dixon </em>v. <em>New England Railroad, </em>242. 22. In an action by a bank for money lent upon a note held to be void because made by the defendant to her husband, the defendant died between two trials of the case. At the new trial, the administrator of her estate, then the defendant, offered in evidence the declarations made by his intestate after the action was brought, to the effect that she never borrowed \u25a0 any money of the plaintiff. The declarations were offered under St. 1896, c. 445, as in an action against the administrator of a deceased declarant in which the cause of action was supported by oral testimony of a promise or statement made by the deceased person. <em>Held, </em>that the declarations were not admissible under* St. 1896, c. 445, because it did not appear that the action was supported by oral testimony of a promise or statement made by the intestate. <em>Whether, </em>the declarations were admissible under St. 1898, c. 535, was not considered, because they were not so offered. <em>National Granite Bank </em>v. <em>Tyndale, </em>390. <em>Opinion: Experts. </em>23. On the issue of the soundness of mind of a testatrix, each of four witnesses was asked whether he or she, during the time mentioned, observed in the testatrix \u201cany peculiarity of manner, speech or conduct.\u201d The witnesses answered \u201c No \u201d or \u201c Never.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that the question did not call for an opinion but for a fact, and was admissible. <em>Hogan </em>v. <em>Roche, </em>510. 24. In an action by a bank for money lent, the cashier of the plaintiff was asked, what transaction took place between the plaintiff and the defendant, and answered \u201c We on December 29th made a loan to \u201d the defendant, and further stated that he personally attended to the transaction. The answer was objected to on the ground that the witness was permitted to state a conclusion in describing the transaction as a loan, and that whether a loan was made was a question solely for the jury. <em>Held, </em>that the answer was the statement of a fact within the personal cognizance of the witness, and properly admitted. <em>National Granite Bank </em>v. <em>Tyndale, </em>390. 25. In an action to recover for injuries occasioned by the plaintiff, who had gone into the defendant\u2019s shop to purchase furniture, catching her foot in the curled up edge of a worn rubber mat of poor quality, a salesman for fifteen years of the rubber company which supplied the matting in question, who had seen rubber mattings in various stages of wear and part of whose work had been to replace rubber matting that was worn out and who to a certain extent was familiar with the effect of various degrees of wear on rubber mattings, was allowed against objection to testify as to the effect of wear upon such.rubber matting as that in which the plaintiff caught her foot under the conditions assumed to exist in the case. <em>Held,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b668-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>INDEX. 648 Evidence <em>(continued). </em>[179 that whether a witness called as an expert has the requisite qualifications and knowledge is largely a matter for the trial judge and his finding thereon will not be interfered with unless it clearly appears to be erroneous, and that under this rule the court could not say that allowing the witness to testify as an expert was erroneous, or that what he testified to was matter of common knowledge. <em>Toland </em>v. <em>Paine Furniture Co. </em>501.

EXECUTION. <em>Validity of Levy and Sale. </em>1.. An obvious mistake in an officer\u2019s return on a levy of execution does not defeat the levy. <em>Frazee </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>456.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>Mass.] INDEX. 649 2. Where all of a debtor\u2019s right, title and interest in certain land is sold on execution and a deed is given by the officer to the purchaser at the sale, it need not appear either in the officer\u2019s return or in the deed, whether the property sold was free from or subject to incumbrances. <em>Frazee </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>456. 3. An officer levied an execution on six different parcels of land and after-wards abandoned the levies on all the lots but one, which he sold on execution. He gave no notice before the time of the sale of the abandonment of the liens on the other lots. <em>Held, </em>that the failure to give notice of the abandonment was no ground for invalidating the sale, as it could not have operated to the prejudice of the debtor. More bidders rather than fewer would have been present in consequence of the failure to give such notice. <em>Ibid. Notice to Debtor of Sale. </em>4. Pub. Sts. c. 172, \u00a7 46, provides that, in giving notice to a debtor of a sale of his property on execution, if the debtor does not reside within the precinct of the officer serving the execution and is not found by him therein, such officer shall send by mail post-paid a copy, of the notice addressed to the debtor at his place of residence as described in the execution. An execution served by a deputy sheriff of Middlesex County described the debtor as having a usual place of business in Boston. The return of the officer showed that he made diligent search for the debtor within his precinct but was unable to find him or that he had any agent or attorney or any abode last and usual or otherwise therein, and that he sent by mail post-paid a notice of the time and place of the sale and a copy of the execution to the debtor addressed to a certain number on a certain street in South Boston, but did not state that the debtor resided at the street and number named. The debtor was present at the time and place appointed for the sale and at the successive adjournments thereof. <em>Semble, </em>that if the notice had been addressed to the debtor at Boston, without adding the street and number, it probably would have been good. <em>Whether, </em>if so, the addition of the street and number and the part of Boston would invalidate the notice, the court did not consider, as the return could be amended by stating, if that was the fact, that the debtor resided at the street and number in South Boston named. <em>Frazee </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>456. <em>Adjournment of Sale. </em>5. Where an officer\u2019s return sets out that a sale on execution was adjourned from time to time by direction of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, the court cannot say that such adjournments were not adjournments for \u201cgood cause\u201d within the meaning of Pub. Sts. c. 172, \u00a7 30. <em>Frazee </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>456. <em>Validity of Deed to Purchaser. </em>6. A deed to a purchaser at a sale on execution conveying \u201c all the right, title and interest which the said D. had, at the time when the same was attached as aforesaid,\u201d is not bad on the ground that it does not appear that there was any attachment, if earlier in the deed the right, title and interest of the debtor in certain land is spoken of as having been seized on execution. <em>Frazee </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>456. *</p>\n<p id=\"b670-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>650 INDEX.

In a real action, by a judgment creditor representing a debt established by a suit in Kansas, to recover land conveyed to the tenant through a third person by her husband, on the ground that the conveyance was fraudulent as against creditors, there was evidence, that at the time of the conveyance the grantor had other property worth several times the amount of the claim of the demandant\u2019s predecessor in title, that his other indebtedness was small, that some of his property worth several thousand dollars stood recorded in his name, and that the conveyance was made in pursuance of a promise to his wife, given before the bringing of the original suit in Kansas by the demandant\u2019s predecessor, at which time the land stood in the grantor\u2019s name and could have been attached here, the demandant\u2019s predecessor electing to sue in Kansas and to attach the grantor\u2019s real estate there. <em>Held, </em>that, on this evidence, a request for a ruling that the demandant was entitled to a verdict as a matter of law rightly was refused, the question of fraud being one not of law but of fact for the jury. <em>Ibid. </em>Whether false representations are material; acting upon falsehood; loss attributable to deceit, see Deceit, 1-3.

St. 1881, c. 167, created a corporation for the purpose of supplying the city of Gloucester with water. Section 3 required the corporation, after the taking of any land or water rights under the provisions of the act <em>\u201c </em>otherwise than by purchase \u201d to file in the registry of deeds a description of the land so taken. <em>Held, </em>that the corporation had the power, recognized as above, to acquire land and water rights by purchase, as an incident to its business of securing and selling water, and that under this power it could purchase and hold a privilege of damming and flooding formerly used by a saw mill, although the running of a mill was beyond its charter powers. <em>Gloucester Water Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Gloucester, </em>365. 2.

The water company had acquired by deed a mill privilege in a certain stream and a pond created by damming it. It had used the waters of the pond temporarily to supply the city with water while constructing its reservoirs, and had then discontinued the use. It did not own the land under the pond. The city objected <em>to </em>paying for the mill privilege on the grounds, that the waters of the pond were not in actual use when the property of the water company was transferred to the city, that the mill privilege did not give the right to use the pond as a water supply and that the waters of the pond could not so be used without acquiring a fee in the bottom of the pond. <em>Held, </em>that the city had the right to acquire the fee in the bottom of the pond, that without acquiring the mill privilege the pond could not be used as a water supply, that the mill privilege was of value as a step towards the ownership of <em>the pond </em>as an auxiliary water supply, and that the mill privilege was the property of the water company owned and used by it within the meaning of the section above named. <em>Gloucester Water Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Gloucester, </em>365. 3. St. 1895, c. 451, an act enabling the city of Gloucester to supply itself and its'inhabitants with water, by \u00a7 16 made that right conditional on the city\u2019s purchasing the property of the Gloucester Water Supply Company, if that company should elect to sell its property to the city, and in that case provided, that \u201c said city shall pay to said company the fair value thereof \u201d and that \u201c such value shall be estimated without enhancement on account of the future earning capacity, or future good will, or on account of the franchise of said company.\u201d Commissioners, appointed to value the property under the provisions of the act, excluded evidence of past earnings of the water company, and allowed the sum of $75,000 in addition to the cost of duplication of the plant less depreciation, in consideration of the fact that the plant was a going concern and in full operation at the time of the transfer. They allowed nothing for the powers of the water company which had never been exercised, to take additional sources of water supply, but considered the existence of such supplementary sources so far as they prevented impairment of the property on the ground that the company\u2019s sources shortly might be exhausted. The commissioners found \u201c the fair value \u201d of the property transferred by the company to the city September 24, 1895, \u201cto be the sum of $600,500, with interest from September 24, 1895.\u201d They fixed the amount of costs, including their own fees, and apportioned them between the parties. <em>Held, </em>that the evidence of past earnings rightly was excluded. The franchise of the water company was not exclusive, but so long as it had no competitor it was practiT cally in the enjoyment of an exclusive franchise, so that the earnings during this period were not proper evidence of the \u201c fair value \u201d of the property. <em>Held, also, </em>that the allowance above the cost of duplication, less depreciation because the corporation was sold as a going concern was justified, and that there was nothing in St. 1895, c. 451, forbidding it. Whether the provisions of the act, excluding future earning capacity and future good will, would allow present earning capacity and present good will to be taken into account or not, the element of value that came from the property being sold as a going concern was not excluded from consid-</p>\n<p id=\"b674-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>654 INDEX.

While the matter of the assessment was before an auditor, St. 1897, c. 197, \u00a7 2 was passed amending this provision by changing the words \u201ctwo years\u201d to \u201cone year.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that the change in the limitation could not have been intended to apply to pending assessments and that this assessment could be enforced. <em>Sanford </em>v. <em>Hampden Paint </em>\u00a7\u2022 <em>Chemical Co. </em>10.

Assuming that a sale on execution of property- insured against fire, and the expiration of the time for redemption, might be a violation of the provision in the standard form of policy, that the property shall not be sold without the assent in writing of the company, there is no violation of the provision so long as there is a right of redemption leaving an insurable interest in the policy holder. <em>Stuart </em>v. <em>Reliance Ins. Co. </em>434. 5. A fire insurance policy in the standard form, containing the usual prohibition of the sale of the property insured without the assent in writing of the company, was made payable in case of loss to a mortgagee named. A creditor of the assured mortgagor sold the property on execution. Thereafter the mortgagee foreclosed and through-another conveyed the property back to the assured mortgagor. \u2022 The insurance company did not assent in writing to the sale on execution or to the foreclosure sale. After the sale on execution and again after the foreclosure sale the assured notified the agent of the insurance company through whom the policy was issued of the respective sales and requested him to notify the company and keep the policy in force. After foreclosure the mortgagee released his interest as mortgagee in the policy, and the agent assented in writing to the release. Thereafter the assured made a new mortgage of the property and the policy was made payable to the new mortgagee. To this the agent assented in writing in behalf of the company. The company was organized in another State and the agent held a certificate as agent of the company issued by the insurance commissioner under St. 1894, c. 522, \u00a7 91. In an action on the policy, it was <em>held, </em>that, whether the sales were within the prohibition of the policy or not, the circumstances would warrant a jury in finding, that the recognition of the policy thereafter by the agent as a valid and subsisting policy was within the scope of his authority, and that under the statute named the company was bound by it; <em>also, </em>that the agent\u2019s action well might have been found to have been taken with the knowledge and acquiescence of the company or at least with such notice on its part as required it to exercise its right to avoid the policy within a reasonable time, or to be regarded as having waived it. <em>Ibid. </em>Sworn statement \u201cforthwith rendered.\u201d 6. Buildings insured against fire under a policy in the Massachusetts standard form were destroyed by fire on October 3. The sworn statement required to be \u201cforthwith rendered to the company \u201d was mailed to it by the assured on December 8, and was received on December 10 or 12. The assured was a woman whose husband was \u201c somewhat of an invalid.\u201d On October 7, she was called to visit a sick grandchild who died on October 9. The severe illness of the child\u2019s mother detained her until the latter part of October. She returned to a village near her destroyed home and remained until the day after election in November. She then moved to another State and was ill there for about two weeks. In an action on the policy, it was <em>held, </em>that there was no evidence that would warrant a jury in finding that she used due diligence in sending the statement as soon as she reasonably could, which was a condition precedent to recovering on the policy.

A life insurance policy, made payable on the death of B. L., the assured, to M., H. and J., contained a provision permitting the substitution of a new beneficiary with the consent of the company, and provided that no such change should be valid unless signed by the president, secretary or treasurer of the company. The following instrument executed by the assured was assented to by the company in letters signed by its secretary: \u201cI hereby transfer, assign and turn over unto A. G., creditor and relative, all my right, title and interest in Policy No. 2032 issued by the A. M. Life Insurance Company on the life of B. L. and all benefit and advantage to be derived therefrom subject to all the conditions of the contract.\u201d The assignee was a creditor to a large amount and the nearest relative of B.

JOINT TENANTS : TENANTS IN COMMON. 1. By the great weight of authority, every co-tenant is entitled as a matter of right to a partition. Per Hammond, J. <em>O'Brien </em>v. <em>Mahoney, </em>200. 2. The general rule is that a tenant in common is entitled to partition as a matter of right, and the facts, that the estate of an ancestor, whose two heirs at law hold as tenants in common, is in course of settlement, that the uncontested charges against the estate exceed the amount of personal property shown by the inventory, and that one of the heirs at law has a pending claim against the estate greater, if sustained in full, than the inventoried value of both the real and personal property of the estate, afford no ground for denying a partition to the other heir at law. <em>Ibid. </em>Devise to several persons by name taking as tenants in common, see Devise and Legacy, 2, 3.

The statute contemplates a delivery by the creditor himself or by any one for him, and the paper may be left at the usual place of abode of the respondent by a postal carrier as well as by an officer qualified to serve civil process. The provision for mailing a demand to a debtor without the Commonwealth merely prescribes a convenient method of</p>\n<p id=\"b680-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>660-INDEX.

See also Mechanic\u2019s Lien. \u2022 LIMITATIONS, STATUTE OF. <em>Construction. </em>1. It is the uniform rule of construction for statutes of limitation, that a statute shortening the period for. enfoi-cing a liability is not held applicable where the result would be to deprive one of the right to enforce a claim without a reasonable time to act before being barred. Per Hammond, J. <em>Sanford </em>v. <em>Hampden Paint </em>\u00a7\u25a0 <em>Chemical Co. </em>10. * <em>Relief from Special Limitation. </em>2. A creditor of the estate of a deceased intestate, who has failed to bring suit on his claim within two years from the time that the administrator of the estate gave bond for the discharge of the trust, is not entitled to relief under Pub. Sts. c. 136, \u00a7 10 on the ground that he refrained from bringing suit at the suggestion of the administrator of the estate relying on certain statements made in good faith by the administrator. <em>Powow River National Bank </em>v. <em>Abbott, </em>336. 3. In a bill in equity under Pub.

See Agency ; Negligence ; Employers\u2019 Liability, 15-19. MECHANIC\u2019S LIEN. 1. A mechanic\u2019s lien under Pub. Sts. c. 191, is created as soon as the labor is performed. The filing of the certificate required by \u00a7 6 is not necessary to create the lien. It merely keeps it alive and prevents its dissolution. <em>Wiley </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>360: 2. A mechanic\u2019s lien, under Pub. Sts. c. 191, is assignable and passes with an assignment of the debt which it secures. <em>Ibid. </em>3. In a suit to enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien, it appeared, that the petitioner had contracted to build a house for a price named, one half to be paid when the shingles and clapboards were on and the other half when the hopse was finished. <em>Held, </em>that the contract did not stipulate for a credit inconsistent with the enforcement of the lien given by the statute and could not be construed as a waiver of it. <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>597. 4. In a suit to enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien, it appeared, that in the same instrument in writing the petitioner agreed to build three houses one on each of three lots not contiguous, each for a price named. <em>Held, </em>that there were three contracts, one in respect to each of the houses, and the fact that they were contained in the same instrument was immaterial to the enforcement of the separate liens which the statute gave for each house. <em>Ibid. Priority as to Mortgage. </em>5. In a suit to enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien, it was assumed, that where an owner of land makes a contract with a builder and then mortgages his</p>\n<p id=\"b682-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>INDEX. [179 662 Mechanic's Lien <em>(continued). </em>land, a subsequent change of plan by agreement between the builder and the owner of the equity cannot authorize the establishment of liens in favor of the builder for an amount in excess of that called for by the contract as it stood when the mortgage was made. In the particular case, it was not shown that the extra charges accrued after the making of the mortgage, so that no error appeared in a finding for the petitioner. <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>597. <em>Assignment of Contract. </em>6. On a petition by two petitioners to enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien, it appeared, that the labor and materials for which the lien was claimed were performed and furnished under a written contract between a builder, one of the petitioners, and the respondent ; that the work was begun and carried on by the builder up to a certain time, when he assigned his contract to the other petitioner. The assignee employed the builder to complete the contract, and from that date, until work upon the contract ceased, all labor and materials were furnished to the builder by the assignee. <em>Held, </em>that the assignment was not a bar to the lien ; that as to the respondent, there being no novation, the builder remained the contractor, and the assignee, in doing or furnishing the work after the assignment, acted under the authority which the contract gave to the builder, so that in effect the builder performed the work, and his lien could be enforced for the benefit of his assignee. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Dugan, </em>153. <em>Contract substantially performed. </em>7. On a petition to enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien, it appeared by the findings, that a contract for the erection of a building, made by the petitioner with the owner of the land, had been substantially but not completely performed, and also that extra work had been done in connection with the erection of the building at the request of the owner. A request to enter judgment for the respondent was refused. <em>Held, </em>that the refusal was right, there being clearly a lien for the extra work, and, also, that the petitioner might establish his lien for the amount due him in equity and good conscience for the benefit conferred by him on the landowner by placing the structure on the land, that the claim was within the language of Pub. Sts. c. 191, \u00a7 1, a debt for labor and materials furnished, and that the provisions of \u00a7 2 in regard to a lien for labor alone bad no effect upon it. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Dugan, </em>153. <em>Instantaneous Seisin. </em>8. In a suit to enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien, it appeared, that the alleged owner of the land on which the lien was claimed mortgaged it on the same day that he acquired title, but the deed to him bore date a number of days before it was delivered, and the mortgage was not a reconveyance to his grantor and was not shown to have been for the purchase <em>money </em>or to have been a part of the same transaction as his purchase. <em>Held, </em>that a finding of fact that the alleged owner\u2019s seisin was not instantaneous could not be disturbed. <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>597.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Mass.] index. 668 <em>Issues for Jury. </em>9. If a respondent to a petition to enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien wants further issues presented to the jury, he must ask for them under Pub. Sts. c. 191, \u00a7 21, and, having omitted to do so, he cannot object after a finding for the petitioner on each of the issues presented to the jury, that the findings are not sufficient to justify the establishment of the lien. If the issues and the answers thereto do not make out a case, the court will assume that the other necessary facts were conceded or found by the judge. <em>McAuliffe </em>v. Dyme, 214. <em>Parlies to Petition. </em>10. A builder, who had partly constructed a house under a contract, assigned the contract, and the work thereafter was done by the builder for his assignee. A petition to establish a mechanic\u2019s lien was filed in the names of and verified and signed by both the builder and the assignee. The respondent took no objection to the form of the petition except by a request made at the trial to order judgment for the respondent. The judge ordered the lien established in the name of the builder. <em>Held, </em>that the respondent was not harmed by the fact that the petition was made in both names, that the respondent\u2019s relation to the builder was not changed by the assignment, and, if the assignee ought not to have joined in the petition, his joining was no ground for giving a judgment for the respondent. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Dugan, </em>153. <em>Bond to dissolve. </em>11. The holder of a mechanic\u2019s lien who takes a bond under Pub. Sts. c. 191, \u00a7 42, from one claiming to have an interest in the property on which the lien is to be enforced, is not estopped thereby from denying V such interest or contesting the validity of the bond. <em>Taunton Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Burrell, </em>421. 12. W., the owner of land on which there was a mechanic\u2019s lien, transferred it through a third person to his wife by a conveyance which was fraudulent and void as against creditors. Thereafter he gave to the mechanic a bond under Pub. Sts. c. 191, \u00a7 42, to dissolve the lien, purporting to release the land altogether therefrom. A mortgagee of the land brought a suit in equity against the mechanic to enjoin him from enforcing his lien. W. and his wife had a child. <em>Held, </em>that it was unnecessary to decide whether W. when he gave the bond had an interest in the property within the meaning of Pub. Sts. c. 191, \u00a7 42 ; that, if W. had such an interest as entitled him to give a bond under the statute, and if the bond was not invalidated hy his attempt to release the land altogether instead of \u201c his interest in such property,\u201d as authorized by the statute, the bond in any case could go no further than to release his interest, and the defendant could not be prevented from asserting his lien subject to W.\u2019s tenancy by the curtesy initiate. <em>Ibid. </em>Discharged by payment to assignee for benefit of creditors of lienor, see Contract, 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>664 index.

The provisions of St. 1888, c. 390, \u00a7\u00a7 60-63, in regard to the payment by a mortgagee of a tax unpaid by the mortgagor, cannot operate to deprive a mortgagee of rights arising from the express terms of the mortgage. <em>Worcester </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>41. 2. In a suit in equity against a mortgagee to have the surplus of the proceeds of a foreclosure sale applied to the plaintiff\u2019s claim, the mortgagee is entitled to be allowed for counsel fees incurred by him in preventing or removing an injunction to restrain the foreclosure proceedings, this being a reasonably necessary expense of those proceedings. <em>Bangs </em>v. <em>Fallon, </em>77. 3. A mortgagee is entitled to be allowed a fee paid by him to an auctioneer for his services in conducting a foreclosure sale, if it appears that he paid in good faith no more than the usual price for such services, although there is a reasonable probability that by searching among auctioneers he might have found one who would have undertaken to conduct the sale for a smaller compensation. <em>Ibid. </em>4. If a mortgagee, who holds a surplus from the proceeds of a foreclosure sale, keeps no special deposit of the balance in his hands after satisfying his claims, and there is nothing to show that he has not used the money . in his business, he is chargeable with interest upon the surplus from the date of the sale when he received it. <em>Ibid. </em>6. A mortgage note provided that interest thereon should be paid monthly at the rate of one and one half per centum per month. The mortgage stated the condition to be the payment of a certain sum of money, \u201c with interest, as expressed in the note hereby secured,\u201d without naming any rate of interest. It was contended, that the mortgage stated the rate of interest only by reference to a private unrecorded document and thereby failed to comply with the registration laws, and that no rate of interest being named in the mortgage the rate must be six per cent per annum under Pub. Sts. c. 77, \u00a7 3. <em>Held, </em>that the mortgage deed gave notice that some interest was to be paid and the rate and times of payment were ____I_</p>\n<p id=\"b685-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Mass.] index. 665 stated in the note, and the reference to the note was sufficient to put persons having claims subject to the mortgage upon inquiry. <em>Bangs </em>v. <em>Fal</em>lon., 77.

The city authorities of Boston desired to acquire certain land adjoining land of the city used for a hospital. The price of the land was $226,000. The borrowing capacity of the city under St. 1885, c. 178, limiting its indebtedness was but little over $24,000, and it had no money in its treasury available for the purchase of the land. It was arranged with the owners of the land that they should mortgage it to third parties for $202,000 and the city should buy it subject to the mortgages for $24,000. The mortgages were to be payable three years after the conveyance to the city, with a privilege to the owners, their grantees and assigns to pay them off before maturity. The city was not to be mentioned in the mortgages and the deeds to the city were to contain the statement, that the city was not to be held liable in any way for the payment of the mortgages or the interest thereon. Upon a petition of more than ten taxable inhabitants of Boston, under St. 1898, c. 490, to enjoin the city from carrying out the transaction, it was <em>held, </em>that the proposed action of the city must be enjoined as an attempted evasion of St. 1885, c. 178, and within its prohi___</p>\n<p id=\"b686-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>666 INDEX. [179 Municipal Corporations <em>(continued). </em>bition; that the transaction was in substance and effect a purchase of the land by the city for the sum of $226,000 of which it was to pay $24,000 in cash and the rest in three years with interest, with the privilege of paying sooner, and this notwithstanding the fact that the city could not be sued for the balance of the purchase money, the manner in which the indebtedness was created being immaterial, if the result was to subject the city to a present liability, direct or indirect, which the taxpayers eventually would be called upon to meet. <em>Browne </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>321. <em>Powers of City Council. </em>2. Under the charter of Everett, St. 1892, c. 355, the city council has no power to make an agreement of settlement of a pending petition for damages for land taken to widen a street under the betterment acts, where at the time of the taking no agreement was made under St. 1884, c. 226, and therefore a vote of the city council accepting a proposal of such an agreement of settlement is void and cannot be put in evidence by a petitioner for damages to show the value of his land taken for the widening. <em>Green </em>v. <em>Everett, </em>147. 3. Section 23 of the charter of Everett, St. 1892, c. 355, gives the city council of that city the power to lay out and widen streets. <em>Semble, </em>that under this power the city council, in taking land to widen a street, could by a vote accepting a proposal in writing make an agreement under St. 1884, c. 226, with the owner of land taken, that the city should abate the betterments to be assessed upon the remainder of such owner\u2019s land upon a reduction of his claim for damages for land taken, notwithstanding \u00a7\u00a7 21, 26 and 33 of the charter providing, that the city council shall take no part in the executive business of the city, that all the executive powers of the city shall be vested in the mayor, and that no liability shall be incurred by or in behalf of the city until the city council has voted an appropriation sufficient to meet it. These provisions were passed <em>alio intuitu </em>and do not limit the powers of the city council to lay out, alter or widen ways under general laws. <em>Ibid. </em>4. In the amended charter of the city of Lowell, St. 1896, c. 415, \u00a7 3, creates a department of supplies, and \u00a7 7 prohibits the city council from taking part in the purchase of material or in the making of contracts for the city. In the year 1900 the city council of Lowell passed an ordinance approved by the mayor, providing, <em>\u201c </em>That all printed matter for the city of Lowell shall hereafter bear the imprint of the Union Label of the Allied Printing Trades Council of Lowell, Mass.,\u201d and \u201c That in calling for bids for city printing hereafter, the chief of the department of supplies shall make stipulation in accordance with \u201d the foregoing requirement. The board of health of Lowell advertised for bids for printing certain blanks and letter heads, and accepted a bid of $24.50 from a bidder who had a right to use the union label, declaring by vote that they did so for that reason, and rejecting a bid of $16.55 from a bidder who had not the right to use the label. On a petition of more than ten taxable inhabitants under St. 1898, c. 490, to enjoin the payment of money by the city under the contract, it was <em>held, </em>that the ordinance was invalid,</p>\n<p id=\"b687-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>Mass.] INDEX. 667 as an attempt to interfere in the making of contracts for printing, by directing with whom the contracts should be made, and was in direct conflict with the provisions of the amended charter; that, whether the ordinance applied to the board of health or not or whether or not they called for bids in accordance with it, the fair inference was that in awarding the contract that board did not exercise their untrammelled judgment but were controlled by the illegal behest of the ordinance which they supposed to be binding upon them; so that the contract was void and the money of the city was about to be illegally expended, which brought the case within St. 1898, c. 490. <em>Goddard </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>496. 1 <em>Officers and Agents. 5. </em>If a city or town, instead of leaving the repair of its ways to the public officers designated by the statutes, undertakes to make the repairs by its own agents, it is liable for injuries caused by their negligence. <em>Butman </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>1. 6.

The plaintiff was a passenger and wished to pass through the train to the rear car. Finding one of the cars crowded, he stepped off the platform of the car intending to go to the rear of the train on the outside. It was very dark and he could not see and did not know where he was stepping. The train was on a bridge over a river, and the plaintiff fell through into the water below and was injured. The platform from which the plaintiff</p>\n<p id=\"b689-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>Mass.] INDEX. 669 stepped was about seven hundred feet from the station. The plaintiff was familiar with the station and the bridge. He knew that the train had backed toward the river, but did not know how far it had backed and underestimated the distance. <em>Held, </em>that the plaintiff did not use due care;\u00abthat he took the chances and must abide the result. <em>Kellogg </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>595. 6.

In an action to recover for injuries sustained by the plaintiff, a woman sixty-one years old, in falling from a train when she was attempting to \u2022 alight, after the train had stopped at her station and started again, it appeared, that the accident happened about three o\u2019clock in the afternoon, that the plaintiff wore a veil and carried a handbag and a bundle containing some books tied with a string, that when she and other passengers started to leave the car one of the books slipped out, that she stooped and picked it up and while walking to the end of the car was trying to get the book under the string, that before reaching the end of the car she saw a brakeman come into the car, shut the door and sit down, that the other alighting passengers at this time were on the platform of the station, that she opened the door, stepped out on to the platform of the car, and began to descend the steps on the opposite side from the station platform, saw that the train was moving, either stepped off or fell off of the lower step after the train had started, and struck the ground some distance from the end of the station platform. <em>Held, </em>that a verdict should have been ordered for the defendant; that the plaintiff either stepped off the train when she knew it was in motion or, if she fell, descended the steps when if she had used her faculties she could not have failed to notice that the cars were moving, and in either case was not in the exercise of due care. <em>Ibid.

In an action against a teamster for injuries to the plaintiff caused by being thrown from the back of a covered one horse wagon of the defendant, it appeared, that the defendant had been employed by a carpenter for whom the plaintiff worked, to transport some materials from a building to the carpenter\u2019s shop, and that the plaintiff got into the wagon at the invitation of the driver and of his employer, that the wagon stopped about five feet from the door of the shop, there being another team in the way, and the plaintiff was standing in the back of the wagon and was about to hand out a box to his employer, when the horse started and he was thrown out. The horse probably was started by the driver in trying to get his wagon to the right place in front of' the shop door, the other team having moved away. <em>Held, </em>that there was no evidence of negligence on the part of the driver. The facts that the wagon moved and that the plaintiff, without the driver\u2019s knowledge, happened to be standing in such a way as to lose' his balance when it started, would not justify a finding that the driver was negligent. There was nothing that required the driver to give notice that he was going to move forward five feet. <em>Firth </em>v. <em>Rich, </em>206. 11. In an action against a street railway company for injuries caused by the plaintiff being ran into by a car of the defendant, it appeared by the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, that the plaintiff was driving in an open wagon approaching a street along which the defendant\u2019s tracks ran ; that when eighty feet distant from the tracks he had a clear view of the tracks for a distance of from three hundred to three hundred and fifty feet from the corner he was approaching; that he looked in both directions and no car was in sight; that from this point until his horse was actually upon the track his view was so obstructed by trees that he could not see a car coming from the right; that when on the track he saw a car ten or twelve feet away coming from the right at the rate of from ten to sixteen miles an hour; that the horse turned or was turned by the plaintiff to the left and was struck on his hind quarters by the car and the plaintiff thrown out and injured; that the plaintiff drove over the eighty feet intervening between his view of the tracks and the point of collision at the rate of from four to five miles an hour, which was the usual rate of speed of the defendant\u2019s cars at this place; that while so driving the plaintiff listened but heard no gong and no noise indicating the approach of a car; that it was shortly after seven o\u2019clock on the evening of November 24, and a light snow was falling with a little rain. <em>Held, </em>that there was evidence to go to the jury that the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care; that it might have been more prudent, to drive over the eighty feet where the plaintiff\u2019s view to the right was obstructed at the usual rate of speed of the defendant\u2019s cars at that point, than to have driven more slowly and thus have given a car which was more than three hundred feet away when the plaintiff saw the tracks more time to get to the crossing, and the court could not say as a matter of law that the plaintiff should have got down</p>\n<p id=\"b691-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>Mass.] index. 671 from his wagon, gone forward in advance of his horse and looked to see whether a car was coming before driving on to the crossing. <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Wakefield </em>$\u2022 <em>Sloneham Street Railway, </em>542. <em>In a Building. </em>12. In an action for personal injuries, there was evidence, that the plaintiff had come to the defendant\u2019s shop to purchase furniture and had followed a salesman and a friend through a doorway hung with portieres into a room where the light was dim and less than in the room she had left, when her foot caught and she fell down a flight of stairs leading to the basement and was injured, that a rubber mat over which she passed was curled up at the edge, was of cheap material and much worn and had been in the same condition for two or three months previously, also that at the time of the accident the head of the staircase was unguarded although a desk was usually kept there. The plaintiff contended that her fall was I due to the bad condition of the mat and the unguarded condition of the staircase. <em>Held, </em>that there was evidence for the jury of the defendant\u2019s negligence. <em>Toland </em>v. <em>Paine Furniture Co. </em>501. <em>Collision of Vessels. </em>13. In an action against a steamboat company to recover for injuries alleged j to have been received from a steamboat of the defendant running down the plaintiff\u2019s fishing boat while at anchor, it appeared, that the plaintiff\u2019s boat was a fourteen foot boat propelled by oars, that the plaintiff and a companion anchored their boat close to the outer edge of the channel in Hull Gut in Boston harbor, and began to fish; that there was fog or haze in the Gut at the time; that the defendant\u2019s steamboat coming through the Gut on its regular trip when not far distant from its landing place at Hull came into collision with the plaintiff\u2019s boat or passed so near it as to cause the plaintiff to jump out and receive the injuries complained of; that the steamer was running at a low rate of speed and was giving the signals and warning prescribed by the United States statutory regulations in case of fog; and that the plaintiff gave no signal and had no means on board his boat of giving any signal. The regulations provide that in fog or mist, whether by day or night, a vessel when at anchor shall, at intervals of not more than one minute, ring the bell rapidly for about five seconds, and another provision requires, that <em>\u201c </em>All rafts or other water craft, not herein provided for, navigating by hand power, horse power, or by the current of the river, shall sound a blast of the fog-horn, or equivalent signal, at intervals of not more than one minute.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that on all | the evidence the plaintiff was not entitled to recover, as it was impossible to say that his violation of the statutory regulation by his lack of signals did not contribute to the accident. <em>Semble, also, </em>that the plaintiff was negligent in anchoring his boat in an improper place and in doing nothing when he saw the steamboat coming, he having made no effort to cut I his anchor rope or to row out of danger, and that it could not be said that anchoring his boat in an improper place did not contribute to the collision. <em>Chesley </em>v. <em>Nantasket Beach Steamboat Co. </em>469.

To dump a load of stone on the wooden platform of a stone crusher and start up the engine of the crusher letting off steam just as a horse which is being driven on a roadway twenty-five feet away and in plain sight is opposite to it, may be found to be a negligent act on the part of the agents of a city operating the crusher. <em>Butman </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>1. <em>Employers\u2019 Liability. </em>Assumption of risk. 15. In an action at common law by a workman in a factory against his employer for personal injuries, it appeared, that the plaintiff, a man of great experience and long service in the factory, was injured while attempting in a dim light to remove a belt from a rapidly revolving shaft. There was a safe way of removing the belt which he knew. He was using another way, when the belt caught in a space between the collar and a fixed pulley, and the plaintiff was carried up to the shafting and injured. <em>Held, </em>that if the way of removing the belt adopted by the plaintiff was dangerous, the risk was an obvious one which he must have known and chose to incur, and that he could not recover. <em>Cushman </em>v. <em>Cushman, </em>601.

In an action under St. 1887, c. 270, \u00a7 1, by a plumber\u2019s helper against his employer, it appeared, that the defendant was doing the plumbing work of a building in process of construction. There were no stairs in the building, but access from floor to floor was had by means of ladders connecting stagings built in the elevator well on the level of each floor. The plaintiff was injured by one of these stagings giving way when he was upon a ladder resting on it. The defendant had nothing to do with the construction of the stagings. They were built before he began his work and were used by all the workmen of the different contractors. <em>Held, </em>that there was no evidence which would warrant a jury in finding that the ladders and stagings formed a part of the ways or works of the defendant within the meaning of the act. <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>190. Duty to provide safe appliances. 17. In an action at common law by a workman in a factory against his employer for personal injuries, it appeared, that the plaintiff was injured while attempting to remove a belt from a revolving shaft. The plaintiff offered to show, that he told the defendant, that there ought to be a shipper on the belt, to ship it over the loose pulley and to hold it there, and also to show, that the belt would not stay on the loose pulley because there was no shipper to drop into a notch to hold it. The evidence was excluded. <em>Held, </em>that the exclusion of the evidence was right, as there was no evidence that the machine ever had a shipper, and the defendant was not bound to change the condition of the machine in this respect. , <em>Cushman </em>v. <em>Cushman, </em>601.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>Mass.] INDEX. 673 18. A superintendent in a factory changed the check valve of an oil governed air hoist, taking out the half inch valve that had come with it and inserting in its place a three quarters inch valve, which was guaranteed by its manufacturer to stand a pressure of three or four hundred pounds | per square inch. If the whole air pressure of the hoist was turned on without a load being attached to the piston rod, the pressure would be from twenty-seven to twenty-eight hundred pounds per square inch. In about two weeks this valve split, and the superintendent replaced it by another three quarters inch valve of the same kind. He did this without ascertaining how much pressure the new valve would stand or how much it might be subjected to when the hoist was in use. He testified, that he did not consider himself an expert mechanic, and thought the preceding ' \u00a1 valve split because it had some flaw or defect in it. About ten weeks ' later, when the plaintiff was about to hook a load on the hoist, he was injured by an accident caused by the new valve splitting in the same way that the preceding one had done. The defendant showed, that the plaintiff had been told never to turn on the whole air pressure when no load I was attached, and not to turn on any air pressure at all until it was needed to lift a load, but it appeared, that the only practical way of hooking on a load was to start the hoist slowly rising and to hook on the load as it ascended, that this required an* opening of the air valve, that the apparatus in an oil governed air hoist prevents the operator from knowing immediately on opening the air valve how much air pressure has been turned on, and that in operating such a hoist it might happen that the whole pressure was on, without the operator necessarily having made an unreasonable use of the machine. The plaintiff testified, that he did not know whether he had the full head of air pressure on at the time of the accident or not though he \u201c probably \u2019\u2019-did have it on. <em>Held, </em>that these facts would warrant a finding that the defendant did not use due care in furnishing a safe hoist. <em>Held, also, </em>that the plaintiff did not assume the risk of the accident, that he was not chargeable with knowledge that the defendant\u2019s superintendent had substituted a three quarters inch check valve, not designed to stand the pressure to which it might be subjected, and had never taken the risk of such a hoist. <em>Held, also, </em>that the jury were warranted in finding that the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care. <em>Slattery </em>v. <em>Walker </em>\u00a7\u2022 <em>Pratt Manuf.

Construction. </em>The defendant, a real 'estate agent, procured for one H., who wished to build a house on a certain lot, a building loan and mortgage for $10,500. The mortgagee advanc\u2019ed under the mortgage $4,500 to the mortgagor, and $6,000 to the defendant. This sum the defendant deposited in a bank in his name as trustee, and drew checks upon it signed as trustee with which he made payments on account of the mortgagor for building materials, . lumber and otherwise. H. delivered to the plaintiff, a lumber dealer, an order on the defendant to pay for lumber. The defendant accepted it in the words \u201c Accepted as I am conveyancer for the mortgagee of Lot 5, Lancaster Terrace \u201d and inserted a similar description after his name in</p>\n<p id=\"b695-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>Mass.] index. 675 the body of the order. The order contained the words \u201c Charge the same to the $1,800 payment \u201d and also the words \u201c Said order to be paid on or before November 1st, \u201999.\u201d The $1,800 payment referred to was the last payment to be made upon the building contract and did not become due until after November 1,1899, and after the date of the writ. The defendant when he accepted the order had in his hands enough of the trust fund to discharge the obligation. In an action on the order, it was <em>held, </em>that the defendant was not an agent of the mortgagee but a trustee holding funds of the mortgagor to be applied to the building of the house, and by his acceptance bound himself personally. Whether the words inserted by the defendant in the order, after its execution by the drawer, and the language of the acceptance, limited the defendant\u2019s liability to the amount of the trust fund in his hands, was not considered, as he had ample funds in his hands at the time. <em>Held, also, </em>that the direction to \u201c Charge the same to the $1,800 payment \u201d merely indicated to what sum as between the drawer and acceptor the payment of the order should be charged, and that the defendant by his acceptance was bound to pay the order by November 1, 1899, at the latest. <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>Abbott, </em>300. .

[179 PHARMACY. St. 1896, c. 397, \u00a7 9, provides that the license of a registered pharmacist shall not be revoked for a cause punishable by law until after conviction by a court of competent jurisdiction. A registered pharmacist pleaded guilty to a complaint in the Superior Court charging him with an unlawful sale of intoxicating liquor, and thereupon that court ordered the complaint placed on file, and there was no other order or proceeding in the case. <em>Held, </em>that this was a conviction within the meaning of the above clause and that the license of the pharmacist could be revoked on a charge of keeping intoxicating liquors for the purpose of unlawful sale. <em>Munldey </em>v. <em>Hoyt, </em>108. PLEADING, CIVIL. <em>Demurrer. </em>1. Under Pub. Sts. c. 167, \u00a7 12, it is sufficient to allege as a cause of demurrer for a defect of substance, that the declaration does not state a legal cause of action. The words \u201c substantially in accordance with the rules contained in this chapter \u201d need not be added unless the defect relied on is one of form. <em>Whilon </em>v. <em>Batchelder </em>\u00bfr <em>Lincoln Corp. </em>169. <em>General Denial. </em>2. In replevin under our practice there may be a judgment for a return under a general denial, which is broader than the old plea of <em>non cepit </em>and puts in issue the plaintiff\u2019s right of possession. <em>D'Arcy </em>v. <em>Steuer, </em>40. <em>In Tort. </em>General denial: Justification: 3. In an action for trespass to the person, where assault and unlawful arrest and imprisonment are alleged, and the defence is a general denial not setting up a justification, whether the allegation in the declaration that the arrest and imprisonment were unlawful makes it an issue whether the arrest if proved was unlawful, <em>qucere. Dixon </em>v. <em>New England Railroad, </em>242. 4. In an action by a passenger against a railroad company for alleged unlawful arrest of the plaintiff by a police officer at the request of a conductor of the defendant, on the charge of evading the payment of fare, the defendant introduced evidence that the conductor, having come with the plaintiff into the presence of the police officer, demanded payment of the fare, which the plaintiff refused in the police officer\u2019s presence, that the police officer examined the ticket and said it was not good because it was punched, that the conductor then again demanded payment of the fare, which the plaintiff, again refused, and that the police officer thereupon arrested the plaintiff. The plaintiff asked for a ruling, that the question of the good faith of the police officer in making the arrest, as testified to in the case, was not an element' to be considered by the jury in determining the case. This ruling was refused. <em>Held, </em>that the refusal was right. The jury could find that the conductor did not himself assault or arrest the plaintiff and that his words and acts were not a direction to</p>\n<p id=\"b697-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>Mass.] index. 677 make the arrest, but a demand that the officer snould exercise the jurisdiction which the statute had given him, and that the officer made the arrest upon his own authority and judgment in view of what he himself had seen and heard, and upon this aspect of the case the good faith of the officer and his belief, that a fraudulent evasion of fare had been consummated under his own eyes, could not be said to be immaterial. <em>Held, also, </em>that although the answer in this case was a general denial and did not set up the defence of a justification, which always must be pleaded, yet the evidence above stated in regard to the acts of the police officer was admissible, not merely in mitigation of damages, but could be considered upon the question whether the arrest was the act of the police officer alone, and, if this was found by the jury to be the fact, it was a defence, because in that case the allegations that the wrongs were done by the defendant and its officers were not proved. <em>Dixon </em>v. <em>New England Railroad, </em>242. PLEDGE. An owner of machinery attempted to pledge or mortgage it by giving an unrecorded bill of sale of it and retaining possession of the property. After the transaction, the pledgor paid the attempted pledgee a monthly rent \"for the use of the machinery. <em>Semble, </em>that the fact that the parties went through the form of paying and receiving the rent although evidence of a change of possession did not conclusively establish it. <em>Haskell </em>v. <em>Merrill, </em>120. POWER. <em>Of Appointment. </em>1. It is a familiar rule of law, that a donee of a power of appointment, who is given authority to choose and appoint an object of the power according to his judgment and discretion, cannot delegate the exercise of that discretion to another. But one having an estate with a power of appointment, under which he may give an absolute interest, or may put limitations on the use and enjoyment of that which otherwise would be such an interest, properly may exercise the power by giving one substantially the whole interest in the property and the whole control of it, in the form of a right of personal use and enjoyment during his life, with a right to appoint who shall have it after his death. <em>Thayer </em>v. <em>Rivers, </em>280. 2. A will giving to the testator\u2019s children life estates with power of testamentary appointment contained this provision: \u201cIt is my will that my daughters and son shall have power of disposing of their respective shares of my estate among my lineal heirs, to have and enjoy the same upon such terms and provisions as may be prescribed by my children.\u201d A daughter of the testator, in attempted execution of this power, gave life estates to such of two nieces and a nephew as should survive her, and after their respective deaths the trustee was directed to convey the proportion or share of the trust fund which had been enjoyed for life by the decedent to such person or persons except the husband of one of the nieces as the</p>\n<p id=\"b698-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>678 INDEX. ' [179 decedent might by will appoint; and, in default of such appointment, to convey the share to the issue of the decedent. The nephew survived his aunt and died leaving a widow and two children, and by his will appointed his share of the property to his wife for life and after her death to his children in equal shares. <em>Held, </em>that the appointment by the daughter of life estates to her two nieces and her nephew was good, but that the attempted gift to her nieces and nephew of the power to appoint anybody except the husband of one niece was void, because, whether or not it was void for other reasons, it purported to authorize an appointment to others than the lineal heirs of the original testator and thus exceeded the terms of the power under which she attempted to act. Therefore the attempted appointment in the will of the nephew under the invalid authority was as if it had never been made, and his share of the property went to his children under the appointment in his aunt\u2019s will providing that in default of appointment by him it should go to his issue. <em>Thayer </em>v. <em>Rivers, </em>280. Power of sale in mortgage a power coupled with an interest and irrevocable, see Mortgage, 6. PRACTICE, CIVIL. <em>Appeal. </em>1. An appeal from an order or judgment of the Superior Court on an award, under Pub. Sts. c. 188, \u00a7 12, must be founded on matter of law apparent upon the record, and one wishing to object to the ground on which a judge of the Superior Court granted or denied a motion to confirm an award must raise the question by exception, and not by appeal, unless the ground of the decision appears upon the record. <em>Giles </em>v. <em>Royal Insurance Co. </em>261. 2. A suit to enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien was brought in a district court against the owner of the land on which the lien was claimed and his mortgagee. The District Court ordered the lien established, and the owner appealed but the mortgagee did not. In the Superior Court both the owner and the mortgagee appeared and were represented at the trial and both excepted to the rulings of the judge of that court who ordered the lien established. The points raised involved the rights of the mortgagee. <em>Held, </em>in a decision sustaining the lien, that whether the appeal of the owner alone brought up the whole case was immaterial, as all parties had been fully heard. <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>597. <em>Auditor\u2019s Report. </em>Auditor\u2019s report- as <em>prima facie </em>evidence, see Auditor, 1.

Sts. c. 153, \u00a7 5, nor such error as would justify disturbing a verdict for the plaintiff. <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>576. <em>Double Costs. </em>4. In this case it was adjudged that the exceptions were frivolous and appeared to have been intended for delay, and double costs were awarded against the tenant from the time when the exceptions were alleged by him, with interest from the same time at the rate of twelve per cent a year upon the damages. <em>Demelman </em>v. <em>Bristol!, </em>163. <em>Finding of Jury. </em>5. On a petition to enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien, the first issue was \u201cDid the ' petitioners perform the labor and furnish the materials set forth in the petition under the contract therein set forth? \u201d Upon this issue the jury answered \u201cNo,\u201d but their answers upon the other issues showed that they meant by this answer merely that the contract had not been fully performed. <em>Held, </em>that the answer should be thus interpreted and was no bar to the establishment of the lien. <em>Moore v. Dugan, </em>153. <em>Election of Remedy. </em>6. The payee of an indorsed promissory note brought an action against the maker with counts on the note and for money lent and money had and received. While this action was pending he brought an action against the indorser. This court deciding that the note was void but that the payee had a cause of action on the common counts, the payee discontinued his suit against the indorser on the note and proceeded in his suit against the maker on the count for money lent. <em>Held, </em>that the plaintiff's concurrent pursuit of his alternate and inconsistent remedies waived neither of them, and that, by suing the indorser on the note while his suit against the maker was pending, he had not elected to rely on the note so as to prevent him from recovering on the common counts when the note was held to be invalid. <em>National Granite Bank </em>v. <em>Tyndale, </em>390. <em>Exceptions. </em>7. If there has been no preliminary understanding or arrangement for saving a party\u2019s rights, it is too late to except to a finding as unwarranted by the evidence after it has been made. The rule is the same when the finding is made by a judge as when made by a jury. <em>Keohane, petitioner, </em>69. 8.

It is not correct to say, that a railroad ticket is only a symbol of the contract between the company and the passenger and a piece of evidence showing what the real contract is. A railroad ticket may be more than a symbol, and it may not show what the real contract is. Per Barker, J. <em>Dixon </em>v. <em>New England Railroad, </em>242. 2. A passenger may have a right to transportation between two stations on a railroad because of his purchase of a certain ticket, and yet if the ticket itself is not in Order, a conductor is not bound to take it inpayment of fare. <em>Ibid. </em>3. In an action by a passenger against a railroad company for alleged unlawful arrest of the plaintiff on the charge of evading the payment of fare, it appeared, that the plaintiff, without obtaining a stop-over check, got off at a station after his ticket, which entitled him to travel to a station beyond, had been punched twice by the conductor. He took the next train to continue his journey and offered the same ticket which the conductor of that train refused to accept. It was shown, that, under the rules of the railroad, the punching of the ticket twice by the first conductor cancelled it and made it uureceivable for passage on another train. <em>Held, </em>that on these facts it was right to instruct the jury, as matter of law, that under the circumstances the ticket was not good for the plaintiff\u2019s passage on that train at that time, and that it was not a ticket that the conductor was obliged to take in payment of fare. <em>Ibid. Liability for Fire. </em>4. In an action against a railroad company under Pub. Sts. c. 112, \u00a7 214, to recover for the destruction \u00f3f the plaintiff\u2019s property by five communicated by a locomotive engine of the defendant, the plaintiff is not bound to show ordinary care on his part. If the fire was caused by sparks from the defendant\u2019s engine, the plaintiff can recover unless his negligence was gross or such as to amount to fraud. <em>Bowen </em>v. <em>Boston </em>5\u2019 <em>Albany Railroad, </em>524. 5. The evidence in this case stated in the opinion was held to warrant a finding of the jury that the fire which destroyed the plaintiff\u2019s mill was caused by sparks from one of the defendant\u2019s locomotives. <em>Ibid. </em>6. In an action under Pub. Sts. c. 112, \u00a7 214, to recover for the destruction of the plaintiff\u2019s mill by fire alleged to have been communicated by a locomotive engine of the defendant, the defendant introduced evidence tending to show that the engines which ran by the plaintiff\u2019s mill were equipped with spark arresters and extension fronts and standard netting, and would not and could not throw out sparks so as to set a fire. The plaintiff in rebuttal was allowed against objection, to introduce evidence tending to show that a certain kind of engine used by the defendant which ran by the plaintiff\u2019s mill when equipped with spark arresters and netting of the standard kind, all in good condition, would throw out sparks and set fires and had done so ; that there were no appliances that would prevent a locomotive under all circumstances from throwing out</p>\n<p id=\"b702-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>682 index. . [179 live sparks and setting a fire ; and that an engine with an extension front and a spark arrester with a netting of the kind exhibited would sometimes give out live cinders so as to set a fire. <em>Held, </em>that the evidence in rebuttal rightly was admitted, as it bore directly upon the issue, whether an engine of the defendant caused or could have caused the fire. Whether the witnesses possessed the necessary experience and knowledge to qualify them to testify was for the presiding judge to say. <em>Bowen </em>v. <em>Boston </em>\u00a7\u2022 <em>Albany Railroad, </em>524. Negligence on railroad, see Negligence, 4-7. REAL ACTION. . 1. Under Pub. Sts. c. 173, \u00a7 18, giving the tenant in a writ of entry compensa, tian for improvements if he has held the premises under a title which he had reason to believe to be good, a tenant cannot be allowed for improve- \u201e ments made after the bringing of the writ. <em>Demelman </em>v. <em>Bristoll, </em>163. 2. Under Pub. Sts. c. 173, \u00a7 14, a demandant prevailing is entitled to the net rental value of the premises during the time they are detained by the tenant, including their detention pending the tenant\u2019s motion for a new trial. <em>Ibid. </em>3. A demandant in a real action claiming title under a sale on execution must prove that there was a valid judgment on which the execution issued, and the recital of the judgment in the execution is not the best or proper evidence to prove it as against a tenant who is a stranger to the proceedings on the execution, whatever might be the case if the judgment debtor were the tenant. <em>Frazee </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>456.

A dealer who sells intoxicating liquors in Massachusetts for transportation to the proprietor of a bar room in another State where the resale of the liquors by the purchaser would be illegal, and who correctly supposes that the purchaser intends to sell the liquors in his bar room in the other State but is wholly indifferent as to whether he does so or not, the pur- . chaser knowing that the seller has no motive in making the sale except to sell his goods in Massachusetts in the usual course of business, may recover the price of the liquors in an action of contract. His divining correctly the defendant\u2019s intention does not connect the sale with the illegal consequences sufficiently to make it invalid. <em>Graves </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>53. <em>Indivisible Offer. Acceptance. </em>2. The plaintiff covenanted to sell and deliver to the defendant the capital stock of a certain company he then owned consisting of two hundred shares and comprising'in all $5,000 par value, and \u201c in furtherance of this option \u201d agreed to at once indorse the certificates in blank and deliver them to X. to be by him held in escrow and delivered to the defendant in the following manner: On payment of $1,000 within fifteen days from .the date hereof X. to deliver to the defendant forty shares, and on payment of $2,000 within thirty days thereafter eighty shares, and on a further payment of $2,000 within thirty days after the second payment, the remainder of the shares. \u201c It is understood and agreed that this option expires and becomes null and void if not accepted within fifteen days and in that event X. is to immediately return to me said certificates delivered to him in escrow.\u201d The defendant paid the first $1,000 and received the stock for it and afterwards refused to make further payments. There was evidence that the defendant said to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney \u201c that he would not be forced to pay for the certificates; that he would pay for them when he got good and ready.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that the offer was an indivisible one to sell the whole lot of two hundred shares, and that there was evidence of its acceptance. Even if the defendant could make a payment and receive stock under the offer without accepting it, his statement to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney might be found to imply an admission that he bought the stock. <em>Held, also, </em>that evidence of the market value of the shares, offered by the</p>\n<p id=\"b704-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>684 INDEX. [179 Sale <em>(continued). </em>defendant to show that there was little change of value from the contract price, rightly was excluded, as the action was not for the breach of an executory contract but for goods bargained and sold and this action would lie. <em>Semble, </em>that even an action for goods sold and delivered might lie. <em>Obery </em>v. <em>Lander, </em>125. <em>Stoppage in Transitu. </em>3. The right of stoppage <em>in transitu </em>may be exercised in spite of the fact that the vendor has accepted the purchaser\u2019s promissory note and receipted his bill for the goods, if he produces the note in court and tenders it to the maker\u2019s assignee and trustee in bankruptcy. It is immaterial that the note was indorsed by the plaintiff to a bank for collection or was discounted by the bank, if the ^plaintiff has the note in his possession at the commencement of the suit and tenders it at the hearing. <em>Brewer Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Sf Albany Railroad, </em>228. 4. The right of stoppage <em>in transitu </em>can be exercised as long as the goods are in the hands of the carrier either <em>qua </em>carrier or as warehouseman. The transit does not terminate until the goods are in the possession, actual or constructive, of the purchaser, and the purchaser is not in or entitled to possession until he has discharged the carrier\u2019s liens, unless the carrier makes an agreement with the purchaser to hold the goods as his bailee or agent. <em>Ibid. Rescission. </em>5. The defendant in Gloucester gave to a salesman of the plaintiff, a corporation having a cash register factory in Ohio, a written order to ship to him one of the plaintiff\u2019s No. 14 cash registers as soon as possible, and agreed \u201c on the fulfilment of the above \u201d to pay $130, ten dollars in cash and the remainder in twelve notes for ten dollars each payble in successive months. The title was not to pass until the last payment was made. The plaintiff\u2019s Boston agent wrote to the defendant \u201c This register will be shipped you as soon as received from the factory.\u201d Six days after this and eight days after the original order, the plaintiff\u2019s salesman delivered to the defendant one of the No. 14 cash registers, whereupon the defendant paid $10 in cash and gave twelve notes for $10 each as agreed. Three days later the defendant returned the register with a letter stating that it was not what he had ordered, which was true, and demanding the return of his money and notes, and bought elsewhere a cash register of another make. The plaintiff by letter then acknowledged that the register was sent by a mistake and added \u201c This error we will correct in a few days.\u201d Whereupon the defendant refused to receive any register from the plaintiff and demanded the cancellation of the order and the return of the money and notes. Thereafter the plaintiff tendered to the defendant and the defendant refused to receive a register in all respects in accordance with the order. The plaintiff retained the money and notes, and sued the defendant in contract, alleging that default had been made on one or more of the notes whereby all of them had become due. At the trial by a judge without a jury, the plaintiff contended that the first delivery was intended by the plaintiff as a loan for temporary use until the register</p>\n<p id=\"b705-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>Mass.] INDEX. 685 ordered could be made at its factory and shipped. The judge found that, whether the first delivery was intended as a loan or not, the defendant did not so understand it but supposed the register was delivered in performance of the order, and, upon ascertaining that it was not such a machine as he had ordered, was justified in returning it and supplying his need elsewhere, and ruled, that the plaintiff did not have the right to compel the defendant to take and pay for the machine tendered later, and found for the defendant. <em>Held, </em>that this ruling was correct and the finding justified by the facts, and that, even upon the plaintiff\u2019s theory, it had no right upon the first delivery, which by its own account was either a mistake or a temporary loan, to receive the money and notes, and ought to have returned them upon request, and, if the defendant was liable at all for his refusal to receive the machine tendered lat.er, his liability would be for a breach of the agreement to purchase, and not upon the notes which were without consideration. <em>Hailwood Cash Register Co. </em>v. <em>Lufkin, </em>143. SCHOOL. St. 1898, c. 490, \u00a7 3, provides as follows: \u201cNo member of the school committee of a town in which a public high school or a school of corresponding grade is not maintained shall refuse to approve the attendance of any child residing in such town in the high school of some other town or city if such child has completed the course of instruction provided by the former town, and, in the opinion of the superintendent of schools or the school committee of said former town, is properly qualified to enter such high school. If the school committee of such town refuses to grant such approval such town shall be liable for the tuition of such child, in the same manner and to the same extent as if the parent or guardian of such child had obtained the approval of the school committee.\u201d Under this statute a parent made a request of the school committee of a town of the class described in the statute maintaining no high school or school of corresponding grade, for their approval of the attendance of his child at the high school of a neighboring town. The request was not granted and no reason was given for not granting it. The child had completed the course of instruction provided by the home town. The father sent his child to the high school in the neighboring town and sued the home town under the statute for the sum paid for tuition. It appeared, that the child might have gone on with his studies in the home town in some unusual way and probably have been as far advanced as he was by attending the high school in the neighboring town, and thus have been ready to enter the high school which was established the next year in the home town. <em>Held, </em>that these facts warranted, if they did not require, a finding that the school committee refused to grant their approval of the attendance, and that such refusal made the town liable under the statute. <em>Fiske </em>v. <em>Huntington, </em>571.

The statutory regulations enacted by Congress to prevent collision of vessels are to be interpreted in the same way in the common law courts of a State as they are in the courts of the United States, if the action is for a maritime tort committed upon navigable waters within the admiralty jurisdiction of the United States. These are not mere prudential regulations, but binding enactments; and, when a vessel has committed a positive breach of statute, she must show, not only that her fault probably did not contribute to the disaster, but that it could not have done so. <em>Chesley </em>v. <em>Nantasket Beach Steamboat Co. </em>469.

A resident of a certain city, who had taxable personal property there in his individual name and also had in his name as trustee for a New York corporation of which he was a director certain shares of corporations organized in other States, was assessed and taxed both on the property held by him as an individual and on that held as trustee. He presented no sworn list of his individual property, but, several months after the warrant had been committed to the collector, filed a sworn statement purporting to relate only to the property held by him as trustee, alleging that he had as trustee no property in his hands liable to taxation. In an action brought against him as trustee to recover the tax, the jury found that the assessors \u201c ascertained as nearly as possible the particulars of the personal estate held by the defendant as trustee for the purposes of making this assessment,\u201d and that \u201c having obtained those particulars they estimated such property at its just value according to their best information and belief.\u201d The court being of opinion that the evidence fully justified the findings of the jury, <em>held, </em>that the defendant could not question the valuation of the assessors, his grievance, if any, being one of overvaluation for which his only remedy was by the statutory proceeding for an abatement. <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>Glidden, </em>486. <em>Collection. </em>4.

A deed under a valid tax sale passes a paramount and new title, and a seisin from the moment of conveyance. <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Lancy, </em>183. 6. In case of a conveyance under a tax sale it will be presumed that possession followed the tax title, especially in the case of marsh land probably not occupied by any one. <em>Ibid. </em>7. A conveyance, on foreclosure sale, of land that has been sold for taxes and is in possession of the purchaser at the tax sale, although under St. 1891, c. 354, it passes the rights of entry and of action, does not disseise the holder of the tax title. <em>Ibid. </em>8. St. 1888, c. 390, \u00a7 40, provides, that in case of a tax sale the collector may sell the whole or any part of the land and after satisfying the taxes and charges shall pay the balance \u201c to the owner of the estate \u201d upon demand. <em>Held, </em>that the word \u201cowner\u201d as used in this clause does not include a mortgagee not in possession, unless his interest as mortgagee has been taxed to him as real estate under Pub. Sts. c. 11, \u00a7 14. The mortgagee, however, has an equitable lien on the proceeds of the land, which he may enforce in equity against the grantee of the mortgagor or his assignee with notice. <em>Worcester </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>41. Mortgagee\u2019s lien on surplus of proceeds. 9 A mortgage of land provided, that the mortgagor should pay all the taxes and assessments upon the premises and that in default thereof he YOL. 179. 44</p>\n<p id=\"b710-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>INDEX. [179 690 Tax (continued). should pay to the mortgagee all sums that the mortgagee should reasonably pay for such taxes, and that in case of a sale under the power contained in the mortgage the mortgagee should retain from the proceeds all sums secured by the deed. The mortgagor failed to pay a tax and the land was sold for taxes under St. 1888, c. 390. The mortgagee on learning of the sale redeemed the land from it under the provisions of the same statute. In a suit in equity by the mortgagee to recover the surplus of the proceeds from the tax sale, it was <em>held, </em>that, in enforcing his lien on such proceeds against the grantee of the mortgagor, the mortgagee was entitled to have the amount paid by him to redeem from the tax sale treated as part of the mortgage debt. <em>Worcester </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>41. Enforcement by mortgagee as claimant in trustee process of lien on surplus of proceeds of tax sale, see Trustee Process. Redemption. 10. If a tender to redeem from a tax sale under St. 1888, c. 390, \u00a7 57, has been prevented by the conduct of the holder of'the tax title in wilfully and successfully eluding a mortgagee of record having the right to redeem, who has been searching for him for the purpose of paying him and has written to him repeatedly offering to pay, the mortgagee is in the same position, as against the person eluding him, as if the tender had actually been made, and if his attempt to make the tender was made in good faith within two years after he had actual notice of the sale, the lien is discharged, and he can maintain a writ of entry for the land. <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Lancy, </em>183. 11. The right of a purchaser at a foreclosure sale and of his assignee to redeem from a tax sale is settled; and this right exists although the mortgage was given after the lien for taxes had attached and the foreclosure was before the tax sale. <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Lancy, </em>112. 12. Where the holder of a tax title has evaded one holding under a mortgagee and thus prevented a redemption, a bill in equity to redeem the land may be brought under St. 1888, c. 390, \u00a7 76, at any time within five years from the tax sale. The remedy, by paying the city treasurer, given by \u00a7\u00a7 58, 59 of the same chapter, is cumulative and does not exclude the right to equitable relief.

St. 1895, c. 307, exempting from the tax on collateral legacies bequests not exceeding $500, does not apply to legacies to which persons became entitled before it took effect. <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Howe, </em>546. 14. Collateral legacies of future and contingent interests are taxable under St. 1891, c. 425. The tax is to be paid when the contingency occurs and the determination of the value of the future interest is to be postponed' until the happening of the event. It is then to be valued as of the time of the testator\u2019s death. <em>Ibid,.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b711-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>Mass.] INDEX. 691 15. In valuing future and contingent interests for taxation as collateral legacies under St. 1891, c. 425, when the contingency has happened, a preceding life interest to be deducted must be valued as of the time of the death of the testator and is to be determined by the actuaries\u2019 combined experience tables and four per cent compound interest, as required by the last sentence of \u00a7 13 of the act, without regard to the actual length of life in the particular case. <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Howe, </em>546. 16. St. 1891, c. 425, imposing a tax on collateral legacies and successions, provides in \u00a7 4 that all taxes imposed thereby shall be payable by executors, administrators or trustees \u201c at the expiration of two years from the date of their giving bond,\u201d and in \u00a7 18 provides that <em>\u201c </em>The treasurer of the Commonwealth shall within six months after the same shall be due and payable, bring suit in his own name for the recovery of all taxes remaining unpaid.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that the provision in regard to the treasurer bringing suit is directory merely, and does not limit the right of recovery to two years and six months after the giving of bonds by executors, administrators or trustees. <em>Whether </em>the general statute of limitations would be applicable to a suit brought by the treasurer after six years from the time when the tax was due and payable, was not before the court and was not considered. <em>Ibid. </em>17. A testator directed his trustees to pay to his sister quarter yearly during her life such sums as with the rents and income of her own property would give her a net annual income of $10,000, and left remainders which were subject to taxation as collateral legacies under St. 1891, c. 425. The net annual income of the testator\u2019s sister from her own property at the time of the testator\u2019s death was $1,453.20, leaving $8,546.80 to be paid to her by the executors and trustees. For the purpose of deducting the sister\u2019s life interest in valuing the collateral legacies, the Probate Court ruled, that she was to be regarded as entitled to an annuity of $8,546.80 during her life. The treasurer of the Commonwealth objected that the amount that was to be paid to her was not an annuity or life estate that could be appraised by the combined experience tables, as required by \u00a7 13 of the act, because it was of uncertain amount and might fluctuate from year to year. <em>Held, </em>that for aught that appeared the net income from the sister\u2019s own property had remained and would remain substantially the same from year to year and, if that was so, the annuity fairly might be said to be $8,546.80 during her life, or, as the intention of the testator manifestly was that his sister should receive a net income of $10,000 during her life, the annuity might be regarded as one of $10,000 a year, subject to reduction by the amount of the net income if any received from her own property, so that in computing the value of her interest the annuity properly might be reckoned as one of $10,000 a year, and that in any case the treasurer had no ground for complaint. <em>Ibid. On Corporate Franchise. </em>18. A corporation having a capital stock divided into shares cannot relieve itself from liability to the franchise tax imposed by Pub. Sts. c. 13, \u00a7\u00a7 38-40, by omitting to do business, nor by failing to file the certificate that</p>\n<p id=\"b712-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>692 INDEX.

TRUST. \u25a0 <em>Powers of Trustee. </em>1. A testatrix having one son and four daughters devised all her real estate to her son, in trust, to hold, manage and improve the same for twenty years, to distribute the net income equally among all her children, and at the termination of the twenty years to divide the property equally among her children. The will also contained this clause : \u201c And I hereby further authorize and empower my said trustee at any time before the said period of distribution, if he deems it for the best interest of all concerned so to do, to divide the trust property of whatsoever consisting, or the same or any portion thereof to sell at public or private sale and the proceeds to divide equally among my said children and their respective heirs and assigns, and to terminate this trust.\u201d The will, after naming the son as devisee of the residue of the estate in trust, did not mention him again by name as trustee, but gave the powers thereunder to \u201c my trustee,\u201d \u201c my said trustee,\u201d- \u201csuch trustee,\u201d or \u201cthe trustee under the trust.\u201d The</p>\n<p id=\"b713-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>Mass.] INDEX. 693 \u25a0will contained numerous other powers attached to the trust and not personal to the trustee named in the will. The son died nearly ten years before the testatrix, who died without making any change in her will. Trustees under the will, appointed by the Probate Court, asked for instructions as to their power to divide the property before the expiration of the twenty years, alleging that they deemed it for the best interest of all concerned to make the division, the children being all of age and all but one desiring it. <em>Held, </em>that the trustees had the power to make immediate distribution of the property, having, under Pub. Sts. c. 141, \u00a7 6, the same powers, rights, and duties as, if they had been originally appointed. The cases holding, that a power given to the executor of a will cannot be exercised by an administrator <em>de bonis non </em>with the will annexed, have no application to this case. <em>Stanwood </em>v. <em>Stanwood, </em>223. <em>Administration cy pres. </em>2. A testatrix left an estate called Seven Oaks to the Sisters of St. Margaret, a Protestant Episcopal charitable and religious society, to be used for the maintenance of a temporary home for poor and invalid women, only so long as these sisters should choose to occupy and use it for these or similar purposes, or on the termination of such use then to any similar religious or charitable association of sisters of the Protestant Episcopal faith in the United States that will use and occupy the estate for the above named charitable purposes, and, if none such be found, then to the Massachusetts General Hospital for the above named or similar charitable purposes. The Sisters of St. Margaret, other associations of sisters and the Massachusetts General Hospital successively declined to accept the estate for the purposes named in the will. Other charitable and religious corporations, not associations of sisters or of the Protestant Episcopal church offered to accept' the property and administer the trust under the terms of the will. Seven Oaks was upon the seashore, and the establishment of a seashore home was a prominent feature of the plan of the testatrix. If Seven Oaks could be sold and about a third of the proceeds invested in a house and lot at the seashore, the Sisters of St. Margaret were willing to put one of the sisters in charge of such house and to use the income of the remainder of the proceeds in carrying out the wishes of the testatrix so far as they could with this and such other funds as they could obtain. The Massachusetts General Hospital was willing, in case Seven Oaks was sold, to accept the proceeds for the purpose of applying the income in the maintenance of its Convalescent Home at Waverly, where men as well as women are admitted. Upon a bill filed by the trustees under the will for instructions, it was <em>held, </em>that there was a good gift to charity, that it had not failed, and that a sale was necessary, and the following scheme reported by a master was approved by the court, namely, that Seven Oaks be sold and the trustees invest the proceeds and pay the net income therefrom to the Sisters of St. Margaret to be by them devoted to their general charitable work; <em>provided, </em>that the trustees may invest not more than a certain sum named, in the purchase of a house and land on or near the seashore, and hold' it for the sisters, whenever the</p>\n<p id=\"b714-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>694 INDEX. [179 trustees are satisfied, that, with the aid of the income of the remainder of the fund and such other resources as the sisters may have, the sisters are able and willing to establish and maintain there a temporary home for women in accordance with the directions in the will of the testatrix. This scheme was approved by the court on the ground, that, having money to deal with instead of land, the order of preference of beneficiaries established by the will for the land should be followed in dealing with the money. <em>Amory </em>v. <em>Attorney </em>General, 89.

In an action under Pub. Sts. c. 52, \u00a7 18, against a city for injuries caused by the caving in of a sidewalk on which the plaintiff was walking, it appeared, that the earth beneath the sidewalk might have been undermined by an escape of water from a water pipe of the city, that, three or four days before, complaint had been made to the water department, that water came from the street into the cellar adjoining the sidewalk where the accident occurred, and that employees of the water department examined the cellar and saw the water coming in through the foundation wall of the building then took up the pavement in front of the sidewalk and did some work there, and the flow of water stopped. <em>Held, </em>that there was no evidence that the city had reasonable notice of the defect or might have had such notice by the exercise of proper care and diligence, as the appearance of the ground at the point where the water department stopped work might have given no indication that the earth beneath the sidewalk had been washed out. <em>Brummelt </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>26. <em>Undergoing Repairs. </em>2. One, who in the daytime enters a street which he knows is not graded or fit for public travel, does so at his peril.

In this case, however, the evidence was conflicting and would justify a finding that the part of the way on which the plaintiff was driving was open to travel. <em>Butman </em>v. <em>Neioton, </em>1.

On the issue of the soundness of mind of a testatrix who had been a domestic servant, a niece of the testatrix who was a servant in the same house testified as a witness for the contestants to many peculiar actions of the testatrix, and as to her using disrespectful language in the presence of her employer and disobeying his orders. She was asked on cross-examination \u201c Did you ever hear Dr. <em>G. </em>find any fault with your aunt during all the time you were there, and if so, what did he say ? \u201d The question was admitted for the purpose of contradicting the story told by the witness on her direct examination. The witness in answer testified to a number of times when the employer had found fault with the testatrix. <em>Held, </em>that the question was admissible. <em>Hogan </em>v. Roche, 510. 2. When evidence admissible for one purpose is inadmissible for another, upon which it would have a bearing if not excluded by rules of law, it must be assumed that a justice passing upon the facts considers it only upon those issues which it legitimately affects. Thus expressions of opinion as to the sanity of a testator at the time he did certain acts, admitted on cross-examination for the purpose of showing the improbability of the statements made by the same witnesses on their direct examinations, will be assumed to have been taken into account, by the justice who allowed the will, only so far as they tended to contradict premises seeming to lead to a different conclusion, and not as evidence tending in itself to establish sanity. <em>Ibid. </em>3. On the issue of the soundness of mind of a testatrix, a witness for the contestants testified to peculiar actions of the testatrix. It had appeared in evidence that six years before the date of the will, the testatrix made a present of $1,000 to a son of the witness. On cross-examination the witness was asked \u201c Do you think that at that time \u2014 did you at that time think that the testatrix had sufficient mental capacity to give that money to your son? \u201d He answered \u201c I suppose she had.\u201d Another witness, who had testified to peculiar actions of the testatrix, was asked on</p>\n<p id=\"b717-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>Mass.] INDEX. 697 cross-examination about a certain remark made to the witness by the testatrix, and was then asked \u201c Do you think she knew what she was about when she said that ? \u201d and answered \u201c I don\u2019t know,\u201d and then being asked \u201c What is your opinion ? \u201d answered \u201c I think she was all right at that time.\u201d To the further question \u201c Did you think at that time she knew what she was talking about ? \u201d the witness answered <em>\u201c </em>I think she did,\u201d and to the question \u201cDo you think so now?\u201d gave an affirmative answer. <em>Held, </em>that in spite of the rule that a witness, who is not an expert or a subscribing witness to the will is not allowed to give his opinion as to the soundness of mind of a testator, the questions put in this case afforded the contestants no ground for exception ; that the whole object of- the questions was to show how the testatrix appeared to the witnesses at the times in question and thus to show the improbability of the previous statements made by the'witnesses, and that for this purpose the cross-examination was legitimate, although the result might have been reached in a less questionable manner. <em>Hogan </em>v. <em>Roche, </em>510.
