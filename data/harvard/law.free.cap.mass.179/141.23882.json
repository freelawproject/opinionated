The case was recommitted to the master to find and state what sum of money by way of damages, if any, should be assessed against the defendant and in favor of the plaintiffs, as compensation for the defendant\u2019s breach of the restriction, and the master, in a second report, found that there should be assessed against the defendant $168 in favor of the plaintiff McNulty and $224 in favor of the plaintiff Ivarson. The Superior Court by decree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>ordered the defendant to pay the sums named to the plaintiffs respectively, and the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-5\">The material facts found by the master are stated in the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b160-6\"><em>F. M. Davis, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b160-7\"><em>0. Gf. Keyes, </em>for the plaintiff, submitted the case on a brief.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b160-8\">Lathrop, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQJ\">This is a bill in equity by which the plaintiffs seek to enforce against the defendant certain restrictions contained in the deeds of all the parties, they having derived their respective titles from common grantors.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">The master has found that these restrictions were imposed by the grantors in pursuance of a common scheme, which included not only the lots conveyed to the parties to this suit but also other lots in one large tract of land. These restrictions were not to continue later than 1902. All of the parties to this suit bought their lands in 1894.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">One of the restrictions was: \u201c That for the period of eight years from the date hereof, ... no dwelling-house erected or placed on said land shall contain more than two tenements or be constructed for more than two families.\u201d On this point the master found that the defendant\u2019s house was carried up three stories, and contained seventeen rooms, with a flat roof; that the defendant admitted that the construction adopted by him was available for three families, but testified that it was not to be used for more than two until after the eight year limit of the restriction had expired. It seems to us very clear that the defendant\u2019s house was constructed for more than two families, and was in violation of the restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">The point chiefly relied upon by the defendant was that about August, 1899, the grantors had conveyed a number of lots, and had in each deed released all the restrictions; and that at or about this time, the defendant had an interview with the grantors\u2019 attorney, by whom the deeds of these lots and of all others sold previously had been prepared. The master states that the tenor of this interview was in some dispute, but that it substantially appeared that' the defendant then received an assurance from the attorney that, so far as the grantors were concerned, the restrictions would not be insisted upon, and probably also not by the other grantees.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>We are of opinion that the master rightly ruled that, while the grantors could waive their own right to enforce restrictions, they could not derogate from the equitable easement to enforce restrictions, which vested in the plaintiffs at the date of their deeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-3\">The master was of opinion that considering the short time the restrictions were to run, and the other facts in the case, the plaintiffs might be compensated in damages. The case was then recommitted to the master to report the damages sustained by the plaintiffs respectively. A report to this effect was made accordingly, to which no exceptions were taken. The Superior Court entered a final decree for the plaintiffs for the sums so found due them; and the defendant appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">As there is nothing open to the defendant on this branch of the case, and as we have already disposed of the questions which arise on the master\u2019s first report, the entry must be</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\"><em>Decree </em>affirmed, <em>with costs.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
