The plaintiff testified that there were employees of the defendant near the spot when he fell, that he had just got off a smoking car at the rear of a train in which he had come from Lynn, that other passengers from the same train were walking along the platform and that there were people ahead of him, that he stepped on something which he found out afterwards was a banana skin. He saw it after he fell and another nian kicked it off the platform against the wheel of a car, saying \u201c That is what he fell on.\u201d A witness testified that the platform was of some artificial stone and very smooth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-10\">The judge directed the jury to return a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b70-11\"><em>J.
