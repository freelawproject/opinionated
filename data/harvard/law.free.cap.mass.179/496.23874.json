In the year 1900 the city council of Lowell passed an ordinance approved by the mayor, providing, \u201cThat all printed matter for the city of Lowell shall hereafter bear the imprint of the Union Label of the Allied Printing Trades Council of Lowell, Mass.\u201d and \u201c That in calling for bids for city printing hereafter, the chief of the department of supplies shall make stipulation in accordance with \u201d the foregoing requirement. The board of health of Lowell advertised for bids for printing certain blanks and letter heads, and accepted a bid of $24.50 from a bidder who had a right to use the union label, declaring by vote that they did so for that reason, and rejecting a bid of $16.55 from a bidder who had not the right to use the label. On a petition of more than ten taxable inhabitants under St. 1898, c. 490, to enjoin the payment of money by the city under the contract, it was <em>held, </em>that the ordinance was invalid, as an attempt to interfere in the making of contracts for printing, by directing with whom the contracts should be made, and was in direct conflict with the provisions of the amended charter; that, whether the ordinance applied to the board of health or not or whether or not they called for bids in accordance with it, the fair inference was that in awarding the contract that board did not exercise their untrammelled judgment but were controlled by the illegal behest of the ordinance which they supposed to be binding upon them; so that th\u00e9 contract was void and the money of the city was about to be illegally expended, which brought the case within St. 1898, c. 490.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-11\">Petition under Sfc. 1898, c. 490, by more than ten taxable inhabitants of the city of Lowell, the first named being the lowest bidder hereafter mentioned, against that city, its treasurer, its board of health and the Courier-Citizen Company, to enjoin the payment of money by the city to the company named under a contract made with that company by the board of health and alleged to be illegal, filed February 21, 1901.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-12\">In the Superior Court, the case was heard by <em>Sheldon, </em>J., who, at the request of the parties, reported it for the determi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>nation of this court, such decree to be entered as justice and equity might require.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-5\">It appeared by the report, that, a demurrer to the petition having been overruled, the respondents by their answer and by subsequent agreement admitted the truth of the following allegations of fact contained in the petition :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-6\">That the City Council of Lowell passed an ordinance approved by the mayor on December 15, 1900, entitled \u201c An Ordinance providing for the printing of the Union Label on all printing for the City of Lowell,\u201d which ordinance was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-7\">\u201c Section 1.

Knapp, their agent, solicited certain printers in Lowell, including the defendant Courier-Citizen Company and the plaintiff Charles R, Goddard, doing business under the name of The Butterfield Printing Company, to submit bids for the printing of sundry blanks, letter-heads and note-heads, and the Courier-Citizen Company, in response to this solicitation offered to do the printing for the sum of $24.50, and the Butterfield Printing Company, in response to the soliei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>tation offered to do the same printing for the sum of $16.55, which last named offer was the lowest bid received for the printing by the board of health; that the Courier-Citizen Company employs exclusively as compositors and pressmen members of the two unions last named and has the right to use the label above mentioned, while the Butterfield Printing Company does not employ exclusively members of those unions and does not have the right to use the label; and that on February 19, 1901, the board of health awarded the contract to the Courier-Citizen Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-5\">In addition to the allegations of fact admitted as above, the judge reported the following evidence: The petitioners introduced in evidence the record of a meeting of the board of health of the city of Lowell, held February 19, 1901.

This statute works a great change as to the powers of the city council in the matter of making contracts. See <em>Muldoon </em>v. Lowell, 178 Mass. 134, 138. The ordinance of December 15, 1900, is plainly an attempt to interfere in the making of contracts for printing, by directing with whom the contract shall be made. It is in direct conflict with the statute, and is invalid for that'reason alone. It therefore becomes unnecessary to consider the other and broader groupds upon which the petitioners attack it.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">It is argued by the respondents that the ordinance does not apply to the board of health, and that the fact that the board invited bids from union and non-union men alike shows that they did not consider themselves bound by it. The board of health had before it bids from five differ\u00e9nt parties. The lowest bidder could not use the label prescribed by the ordinance. The two next lowest bids were equal in amount, and of these bidders one could use the label and one could not. In this state of things the board passed over the lowest bidder, and of the next two lowest bidders awarded the contract to that one, a company, who could use the label, and the record shows that it was voted to award the contract to that company \u201cas they use the Union Label, prescribed and voted \u201d by the ordinance. They give no other reason for their action, nor does it appear that there was any other reason. The only fair and natural inference is that in thus awarding the contract they felt bound by the ordinance and did not feel at liberty to exercise their own judgment as against it, and that they desired to make this appear on their records; and this is so whether or not the ordinance was applicable to them or whether or not they called for bids in accordance with it. It thus appearing that in awarding this contract they did not exercise their untrammelled judgment but were controlled by an illegal behest which they supposed to be binding upon them, it is clear that the contract ought not to stand. It is not legal because not made as the law requires, and no city official may properly expend money to carry it out. The respondents are about to expend money under it. In the language of St. 1898, c. 490, they are about to expend money in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>a manner other than that in which such city has the legal right to expend money. The case is within the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\"><em>Decree for the </em>petitioners,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
