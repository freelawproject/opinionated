He further testified that the drunken man was in a sleepy condition, and did not disturb anybody until he began to vomit.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">It was in evidence that it was a rule of the defendant that the conductor should immediately remove from the car any person who by reason of intoxication made himself obnoxious to other passengers; and that it became the duty of the conductor in compliance with this rule to remove the intoxicated man at once when he began to vomit.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The defendant requested the judge to rule that there was no evidence which would warrant the jury in finding a verdict for the plaintiff. The judge refused so to rule; and the case is before us on the defendant\u2019s exception to the refusal to give this ruling. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">We need not consider whether the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care in not stopping the car, or retreating to the rear platform when she saw the condition of things inside the car, as we are of opinion that there was no evidence of negligence on the part of the conductor of the car; and that the judge should have so ruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">It is not contended that the conductor was negligent in admitting the man to the car; and it is conceded that it was his duty to remove the man promptly ; but it is urged that before doing so he should have waited until the plaintiff was seated and the aisle was clear. This seems to us to be refining too much. It is the duty of a conductor in such a case as this to act at once, and to remove the obnoxious person; and his act was a lawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>one. <em>Vinton </em>v. <em>Middlesex Railroad, </em>11 Allen, 304. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Old Colony Railroad, </em>148 Mass. 119. In <em>Spade </em>v. <em>Lynn &amp; Boston Railroad, 172 </em>Mass. 488, a similar case, ifc was said : \u201c So far as appears, the conductor was acting rightly in putting the drunken man off the car. As against the plaintiff, he was doing one of the things which she had to contemplate as liable to happen when she got into the car. We all know that, if people are standing in the passage way. of a street car, you cannot remove a man forcibly through the passageway without more or less contact. If the fall upon the plaintiff was the necessary consequence of a lawful and reasonable act, then it was one of the risks which she assumed when she took her passage.\u201d We can see no material difference between that case and the one before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
