The agreement provided that the mortgagee should not in any case be liable to make any of the stipulated payments after foreclosure of the mortgage. The note, mortgage and agreement were all delivered as one transaction about a month after the date of the note. Thereafter advances were made from time to time in accordance with the agreement until the mortgagor made default and the mortgage was foreclosed. <em>Held, </em>that the legal effect of the contract was that the mortgagee should have interest upon the full amount of the principal of the note from the date of the note and so long as he was under a legal obligation to furnish the money, whether it was set apart or not, and that this obligation ceased only upon the foreclosure of the mortgage.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b95-11\">A mortgage note provided that interest thereon should be paid monthly at the rate of one and one half per centum per month. The mortgage stated the condition to be the payment of a certain sum of money, \u201c with interest, as expressed in the note hereby secured,\u201d without naming any rate of interest. It was contended, that the mortgage stated the rate of interest only by reference to a private unrecorded document and thereby failed to comply with the registration laws, and that no rate of interest being named in the mortgage the rate must be six per cent per annum under Pub. Sts. c. 77, \u00a7 3. <em>Held, </em>that the mortgage deed gave notice that some interest was to be paid and the rate and times of payment were stated in the note, and the reference to the note was sufficient to put persons having claims subject to the mortgage upon inquiry.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>If a mortgagee, who holds a surplus from the proceeds of a foreclosure sale, keeps no special deposit of the balance in his hands after satisfying his claims, and there is nothing to show that he has not used the money in his business, he is chargeable with interest upon the surplus from the date of the sale when he received it.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-5\">Bill in equity by eight creditors of Benjamin F.

The agreement was dated September 7,1897, was under seal and signed by the defendant Fallon and the defendant Benjamin F.

Fallon purchased the three prior mortgages by paying $13,000 in accordance with the terms of the agreement, and on various dates from November 6, 1897, to April 27, 1898, made payments to Benjamin F. Kenerson which with the $13,000 already named amounted to $23,000, the total of the cash advanced by Fallon to Kenerson under the mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-7\">At some time after April 27,1898, Fallon, by reason of breach of the conditions of the mortgage, took possession of the premises for the purpose of foreclosing, and on August 24,1898, the premises were sold under the power of sale. On August 24, 1898, the defendant Fallon paid to Rand, Vinton and Wakefield, his attorneys, as expenses of the foreclosure sale, the total sum of $171.90, including the following items :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-8\">\u201c For services as attorney in connection with adjournment and sale and drafting mortgagee\u2019s deed, $60.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-9\">\u201c For services as attorneys in relation to injunction proceedings, these proceedings being upon the original bill herein, and such services being in the matter of obtaining a dissolution of the injunction restraining the defendant Fallon from selling said Norway Street property in the foreclosure proceedings, $50.\u201d Item 39 in Fallon\u2019s account was as follows: \u201c 28 Aug.

He received from Benjamin F.

And the plaintiffs further contended that, inasmuch as the rate of interest was riot stated in the mortgage deed, and was only stated in the mortgage note, Fallon in his account should only be allowed interest at the legal rate of six per cent. I find and rule, however, that Fallon is entitled to interest according to the terms of the mortgage note, that is to say, upon the whole sum of $30,500, from August 16, 1897, and at the rate of one and one half per centum per month until the date of the foreclosure sale. The plaintiffs further contended that Fallon was entitled to interest on his several advances of money only from the date of each advance, or specific setting apart under the contract, to the day of the sale of the premises, but I find and rule that said Fallon is entitled to interest as above mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-9\">\u201c The plaintiffs also contended that Fallon in his account should not be allowed credit \"for the whole sum of $277 paid by him to the auctioneer at the foreclosure sale, and that he should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>be allowed on that account only the sum of $50. It appeared. in evidence, that the ordinary and customary charge of auctioneers in Boston for such services, in the absence of an express agreement, was at the rate of one per cent on the purchase price, and that the charge of $277 was so reckoned as a commission of one per cent, and that Fallon believed, as there was reasonable ground for him to believe, that he was liable to the auctioneer for the sum of $277. It also appeared in evidence that there was reasonable probability that by making search among the auctioneers in Boston he might have found one who would have undertaken to conduct the sale, an express agreement having been made therefor in advance, for an amount not exceeding $50. I find and rule, however, that Fallon was under no obligation. to make such search, and to endeavor to make such express contract, and that he is entitled to credit for the amount actually paid by him to the auctioneer in the sum of $277.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-5\">\u201cThe defendant Fallon contended that the amount of his legal expenses in defending this suit should be deducted from the balance in his hands from the proceeds of the foreclosure sale. I find and rule, however, that the amount of such legal expenses are not proper charges in the stating of the account under the decree referring the case to me.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-6\">\u201c On or about January 22, 1898, the defendants Royal B. and Ellen P. Kenerson, the father and mother of Benjamin F., conveyed to Fallon, by mortgage deed bearing that date, their residence on Appleton Street in Boston, the same then standing in the name of Ellen P. Kenerson, and being then subject to a prior mortgage also for $2,000. Fallon advanced the full sum of $2,000 upon this Appleton Street mortgage, and the proceeds thereof were lent to Benjamin F. Kenerson by his mother and used by him in the construction of the Norway Street houses. This payment of $2,000 by Fallon was separate and apart from the payments made on account of the $30,500 mortgage, and no part of the $2,000 was a part payment on account of moneys due under the Norway Street mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-7\">\u201c The defendant Benjamin F. Kenerson ceased to perform work in the erection of the buildings on Norway Street on or about April 27, 1898, and did practically no work thereon there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>after. On or about June 7,1898, Benjamin F. Kenerson executed a mortgage deed of the premises on Norway Street to his mother, Ellen P., the mortgage being conditioned for the payment of $10,000 in one year at five per cent and this instrument was acknowledged by him and by him recorded on June 8, 1898. No consideration passed between Benjamin F. and Ellen P. at the time of the giving of this mortgage, and the same was given by Benjamin F. with the intention of giving security to his mother as his creditor, Benjamin F. being at that time indebted to various parties in sums beyond his ability to pay, because he did not want other creditors to get ahead of her, and because his creditors were putting attachments on his property, and with the intention on his part of putting her in ahead. Benjamin F. Kenerson was then indebted to his mother for moneys advanced and loaned to him from time to time during some four years before the date of the last named mortgage, in the sum of $7,765.64. No mortgage note was delivered to Ellen P. Kenerson for this $10,000, and the mortgage deed was not delivered to her in person, but having been left at the Registry of Deeds by Benjamin F. Kenerson in person, the mortgage deed remained in the Registry of Deeds until after the taking of evidence under this reference was begun. Ellen P. had previously requested Benjamin F. to give her a mortgage on the Norway Street property, and he told her one day in the summer of 1898 that he had had one recorded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-5\">\u201c The defendant Fallon testified, and I find, that from the date of the foreclosure sale he has kept no special deposit, or money, set apart as the balance of account on this mortgage matter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-6\">\u201c There was evidence to show, and I find, that the commission of one per cent was received by the defendant Fallon out of the first and second payments, as set forth and provided in the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-7\">\u201c There was evidence to show, and I find, that on the day of the foreclosure sale some of the plaintiffs named in the bill had valid liens on the property sold by reason of attachments made subsequent to the delivery of the $30,500 mortgage, and were creditors for substantial sums.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-8\">This last finding was made more definite by the findings of the master\u2019s supplemental report already mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>The following exceptions were taken by the plaintiffs to the master\u2019s report:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-5\">1.

As to the allowance of $50 for counsel fees. The bill when filed contained a prayer for injunction against a sale, and this expense was incurred by.the mortgagee in preventing or removing an injunction. It was a part of the expense of the foreclosure proceedings, was reasonably necessary, and was therefore rightly allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">2. As to the allowance of $277, paid to the auctioneer for services in selling the property. Upon this the master reports that it appeared in evidence that this charge, being at the rate of one per cent on the purchase price, was the ordinary and customary charge of auctioneers in Boston for such services in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>the absence of any express agreement, and that Fallon believed and had reasonable ground to believe that he was liable to the auctioneer for that sum. It further appeared in evidence that there was reasonable probability that by searching among the auctioneers he might have found one who would have undertaken to conduct the sale, an express agreement having been made in advance, for an amount not exceeding $50. The master ruled that Fallon was under no obligation to make such search, and found that he was entitled to be allowed the sum. We think the master was right. The property was of considerable value, and Fallon may well have thought that, since it was desirable to have an experienced and competent man to conduct the sale, he would be much more likely to find such a person in one who charged the regular rates than in one content to undertake the sale at a much lower rate. In any event he paid in good faith no more than the usual price for such services, and it is no more than just that he should be allowed what he thus paid. .</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">8. As to the question of interest. The master allowed interest on the face of the note from its date to the time of the sale, at the rate of eighteen per cent per annum, in accordance with its terms. The plaintiffs contend that interest should not be computed upon the note before September 7, 1897, the time of its delivery, and then only upon the payments made, and from their respective dates, and that no interest should be allowed upon money not lent or set apart by the mortgagee.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The note contains an absolute promise to pay in three months from its date the sum of $30,500, with interest thereon at the rate of one and one half per cent per month ; and it is secured by a mortgage of real estate upon which the mortgagor was about to erect a block of buildings. The consideration for the note is to be found in the contemporaneous written agreement. The note, mortgage and agreement, all form part of one and the same transaction ; and, by reference to the latter, it is seen that the money was to be delivered by Fallon only by instalments. The times and the amounts of the several payments are therein set forth, and the mortgagor could not insist upon receiving the money save in accordance therewith. The note called for interest payable monthly, while it was apparent from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>agreement that more than a month might elapse before the mortgagor could rightfully call for any money. In fact no money seems to have been payable to him until November, 1897. It was not the purpose of the instrument to modify the promise contained in the note, but simply to state the consideration for that promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Bjr the agreement Fallon had bound himself to lend Kenerson certain sums of money up to the full amount named in the note, with the proviso that he should not in any case be liable to make any payment after the foreclosure of the mortgage. It does not appear, upon the facts found by the master, that Fallon was released from his promise before that time, although it is found that at some time subsequent to April 27, 1898, he entered upon the premises for the purpose of foreclosing the mortgage. If the full amount named in the agreement had been advanced in accordance with its terms, then the full consideration for the note would have been paid, and the mortgagor would have been indebted the full amount. It is not suggested that Fallon was not at all times ready to comply with the terms of his agreement. It was clearly the understanding of the parties that the interest was to be payable monthly on the whole sum named in the note, for four such payments are indorsed upon the note. We think that the legal effect of the contract was that Fallon should have interest upon the full amount of the principal of the note, so long as he was under an obligation to furnish the money, whether formally set apart or not. <em>Lewin </em>v. Folsom, -171 Mass. 188. Upon the facts found by the master that obligation seems to have ceased with the foreclosure on August 24, 1898, and it does not appear to have ceased before.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">But it is insisted by the plaintiffs that, inasmuch as the mortgage, neither in itself nor by reference to any recorded instrument, shows what the rate of interest is, it, should not be allowed as against these plaintiffs at a rate greater than six per cent per annum. It is urged that a mortgage note is a private document, to which the public have no rightful access, and that a mortgage deed which states the rate of interest on the debt only by reference to a private, unrecorded document, does not in that respect comply with the registration laws, since the amount of the encumbrance cannot be ascertained from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>record; and that where no rate of interest is mentioned, the rate must be six per cent per annum.

Sts. c. 77, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\">The condition of the mortgage is that there shall be paid a certain sum with interest \u201cas expressed in the note hereby secured.\u201d The mortgage deed gives notice that some interest is to be paid, and that the rate and the times of payment are set out in the note; and this was sufficient to put the plaintiffs upon inquiry; <em>Richards </em>v. Holmes, 18 How. 143 ; and, being put upon inquiry, they must be held to know the facts which in the absence of fraud would be disclosed to them upon such inquiry. See <em>May </em>v. Gates, 137 Mass. 389. This is not a case where the amount expressly named in the mortgage is less than that named in the note, as in <em>Frost </em>v. Beekman, 1 Johns. Ch. 288, and similar cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">The result is that all of the exceptions of the plaintiffs to the report of the master are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">As to the mortgage deed to Ellen P. Kenerson, it seems upon the findings made by the master to have been fraudulent as against these plaintiffs. The master has made no specific finding that it was delivered to the mortgagee. No note was given with it, and it was intended to secure a prior indebtedness to the mortgagee. It cannot affect the plaintiffs\u2019 rights to the surplus.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The master having found that, from the date of the foreclosure sale, Fallon has kept no special deposit of the balance in his hands after satisfying his claims, and there being nothing to show that he has not used it in his business, he should be charged interest upon it from the date of the sale, the time he received it.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">The result is that the surplus proceeds of the sale, amounting to the sum of $390.31, with interest from August 24,1898, is to be decreed as belonging to the plaintiffs, and is to be apportioned among them according to their respective interests as they may appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
