But one having an estate with a power of appointment, under which he may give an absolute interest, or may put limitations on the use and enjoyment of that which otherwise would be such an interest, properly may exercise the power by giving one substantially the whole interest in the property and the whole control of it, in the form of a right of personal use and enjoyment during his life, with a right to appoint who shall have it after his death.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b298-11\">A will giving <em>to </em>the testator\u2019s children life estates with power of testamentary appointment contained this provision: \u201cIt is my will that my daughters and 'son shall have power of disposing of their respective shares of my estate among my lineal heirs, to have and enjoy the same upon such terms and provisions as may be prescribed by my children,\u201d A daughter of the testator, in attempted execution of this power, gave life estates to such of two nieces and a nephew as should survive her, and after their respective deaths the trustee was directed to convey the proportion or share of the trust fund which had been enjoyed for life by the decedent to such person or persons except the husband of one of the nieces as the decedent might by will appoint; and, in default of such appointment, to convey the share to the issue of the decedent. The nephew survived his aunt and died leaving a widow and two children, and by his will appointed his share of the property to his wife for life and after her death to his children in equal shares. <em>Held, </em>that the appointment by the daughter of life estates to ' her two nieces and her nephew was good, but that the attempted gift to her nieces <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>and nephew of'the power to appoint anybody except the husband of one niece was void, because, whether or not it was void for other reasons, it purported to authorize an appointment to others than the lineal heirs of the original testator and thus exceeded the terms of the power under which she attempted to act. Therefore the attempted appointment in the will of the nephew under the invalid authority was as if it had never been made, and his share of the property went to his children under the appointment in his aunt\u2019s will providing that in default of appointment by him it should go to his issue.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-5\">Bill for instructions brought by the trustees under the will of Rosalie G.

These were the only children living at the death of the testatrix and there was no issue of any deceased child.

Russell. After hearing and argument before Allen, J., a final decree was made by him on January 18,1898, by which it was adjudged, among other matters, that the ninth, eleventh and thirteenth articles of the will of Rosalie G. Russell operated as an effectual appointment of the share of the trust estate held under the will of Lydia Smith Russell, the income of which was payable to Rosalie G. Russell, upon the trust declared in those articles during the respective lives of the three children of Geraldine I. Upton ; but that the validity and effect of the remaining provisions of the articles, and of the rest of the will of Rosalie G. Russell relating to the disposition to be made of that share oh the deaths of those children, were not determined. The trustees under the will of Lydia Smith Russell were ordered to pay over and transfer those portions of the trust estate to Mary Rivers, the then trustee under the will of Rosalie G. Russell, in trust for the purposes set forth in the articles named during the respective lives of Mary Rivers, George R. R. Rivers and Rosalie G. Sheffield, and thereafter for such persons as might be found legally entitled thereto.

From all my property and estate to which under either the will of my grandmother Lydia Smith Russell or the will of my aunt Rosalie G. Russell or the will of my mother Geraldine I.

Russell and Geraldine I. Upton, all deceased, I give devise, bequeath, limit and appoint to my children in equal shares in fee simple forever; the issue of any deceased child to take by right of representation.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-8\">The plaintiffs were appointed trustees under the ninth, eleventh and thirteenth articles of the will of Rosalie G. Russell on March 15, 1899, in the place of Mary Rivers, who had resigned the trust, and on the same day were also appointed, in the place of Mary Rivers, trustees under the tenth article of the same will. As trustees under the ninth, eleventh and thirteenth articles they hold, as principal of the trust, personal property exceeding $100,000 in value, and real estate in Milton of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>estimated value of $45,000, all of which represents property transferred under the provisions of the decree above referred to or proceeds of property so transferred. George R. R. Rivers during his lifetime received from time to time one third of the net income arising from the fund.

Russell, which, after appointing the income for life of the property to which she was entitled under the will of her mother to the three children of her sister Geraldine, in equal shares, purports to give the remainder after the death of each of them, \u201c to such uses and for or to such person or persons, not including George C. Sheffield, ... as the decedent may by last will and testament, and notwithstanding any coverture, direct and appoint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-13\">It is a familiar rule of law that a donee of a power of appointment who is given authority to choose and appoint an object of the power, according to his judgment and discretion, cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>delegate the exercise of that discretion to another. An attempt to delegate a power of appointment considered merely as an attempted delegation is of no effect. <em>Ingram </em>v. <em>Ingram, </em>2 Atk. 88. <em>White </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>1 Drew. 298. <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Sadler, </em>L. R. 8 Ch. 419. <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>L. R. 14 Eq. 397. <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Farwell, </em>35 Ch. D. 128. <em>Burnaby </em>v. <em>Baillie, </em>42 Ch. D. 282. <em>Topham </em>v. <em>Duke of Portland, </em>32 L. J. Ch. 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">On the other hand it has been held that one having an estate with a power of appointment under which he may give an absolute interest, or may put limitations on the use and enjoyment of that which otherwise would be such an interest, properly may exercise the power by giving one substantially the whole interest in the property and the whole control of it, in the form of a right of personal use and enjoyment during his life, with a right, by deed or will, to appoint persons who shall have it after his death. It has been held in some of these cases that it makes no difference whether the right of disposition in the object of the power to whom the property is appointed by the donee of the power, is by a deed or will, or by will alone. <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>34 Beav. 500. <em>Slark </em>v. <em>Dakyns, </em>L. R. 10 Ch. 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The creation of such a right is a kind of delegation of the power, but in its nature it is rather a statement of a mode of enjoyment, use, and disposition of that which is virtually an absolute interest. Such an execution of a power by a donee presupposes that the delegated power, if exercised, will give no larger interest than might have been given by the original do\u00f1ee, and will not exceed the limits of the original power.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">It is plain that the appointment in the will of Rosalie G. Russell is good, so far as it gives her two nieces and her nephew life estates, respectively. That which remains of her appointment, when taken in connection with that which immediately precedes it, we think must be deemed a continuation of the exercise of the power of disposition of the share of her mother\u2019s estate which was given to her under her mother\u2019s will, and an attempt to delegate the selection of the beneficiaries. The power to her nephew and nieces to appoint to anybody except George C. Sheffield is void, because it purports to authorize an appointment to others than the objects of the power mentioned in the will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>under which she was acting. She could dispose of the estate only among the lineal heirs of her mother Lydia Smith Russell, and she undertook to authorize her nephew and nieces to appoint to others than those heirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Whether it was void for other reasons, it is unnecessary to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The attempt to create a power of appointment in her nephew and nieges being of no effect, the next question is, whether, notwithstanding the form of appointment which appears in the will of George R. R. Rivers, these words in Rosalie G. Russell\u2019s will are operative, namely: \u201c and in default of such appointment shall convey the said share or proportion to the issue of the decedent in fee and absolutely in equal shares by representation,\u201d etc. We are of opinion that they are. The appointment by Rivers under the invalid authority was as if there had been no appointment by him. She intended this disposition of the property to take effect if there should be no effectual appointment by her nephew and nieces. These words give the estate to the defendants, Robert W. Rivers and Henry F. Rivers, unless there is some good ground of objection to giving them effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">It is truly said in argument that this is a gift to a class, and that the class is to be determined as of the time of the death of Rosalie G. Russell, when her will takes effect. Whether we do or do not assume that the class would open to let in after-born children of George R. R. Rivers is not very material, for no children were born to him after the death of Rosalie G. Russell. If others had been born, even as to them the appointment would not have been too remote under the rule against perpetuities, for their father, George R. R. Rivers, the life tenant under the appointment, was living at the time of the death of Lydia Smith Russell, and the estate would vest in possession in the last of his children at the expiration of a life in being when the will of the original testatrix took effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">That he was not named in the original will is immaterial, for he is definitely referred to as life tenant in the appointment in the will of Rosalie G. Russell, which is to be taken in connection with the will of Lydia Smith Russell, and for this purpose read as if it were written into the former will.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>The appointment to the defendants, Robert W. Rivers and Henry F. Rivers under the will of Rosalie G. Russell, in default of a valid appointment by their father, is good; and the trust estate held for the benefit of George R. R. Rivers during his life, is to be paid over to them in equal shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-3\">\n<em>Decree accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
