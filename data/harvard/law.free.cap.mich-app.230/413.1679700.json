In our first decision, we concluded that plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>Daniel McCaw\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> claim was barred by the fireman\u2019s rule and reversed. <em>McCaw v T &amp; L Operations, Inc, </em>217 Mich App 181; 550 NW2d 852 (1996). The Supreme Court, in lieu of granting leave to appeal, remanded the case for reconsideration in light of its decision in the consolidated cases <em>Gibbons v Caraway </em>and <em>Mariin v Fleur, Inc, </em>455 Mich 314; 565 NW2d 663 (1997). 456 Mich 869 (1997). We again reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">The facts of this case were set out in our previous opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-5\">Plaintiff Daniel McCaw is a police officer with the Waterford Township Police Department. During the evening of August 31, 1991, plaintiff was dispatched to investigate a reported stabbing at a house on Hira Street. When plaintiff arrived at the residence, he saw a man lying on the front lawn and realized that the man had been stabbed. A man, later identified as Michael Williams, came out on the porch. Because of Williams\u2019 behavior, slurred speech, and bloodshot, glassy eyes, plaintiff realized that he was under the influence of alcohol. Williams told plaintiff that he had called the police. When plaintiff attempted to question Williams about the stabbing, Williams became agitated and began to yell at plaintiff. Williams told plaintiff to leave, but plaintiff refused. Williams then informed plaintiff that he was going to leave. Plaintiff stepped in front of Williams to prevent him from departing. Williams began to attack plaintiff. During the ensuing scuffle, Williams struck plaintiff in the face. As a result of this incident, plaintiff suffers from blurred peripheral vision, tinnitus, and an injury to his jaw.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\">At trial, Williams testified that on August 31, 1991, he was nineteen years old. On that day, he began drinking beer around 3:00 P.M. Around 6:00 P.M., Williams and two friends, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Jeff Morgan and Tim Smith, went to the Dixie Bar. At the bar, the three men shared several pitchers of beer and consumed three to five B-52 shots. Williams testified that he was feeling drunk while in the bar. After the men left the bar, Morgan and Smith began to argue. When the men arrived at Williams\u2019 house, Williams went inside and fell asleep or passed out. After Williams awoke, Morgan told him that he had stabbed Smith. Williams then called 911. Williams stated that he was not sober during the altercation with plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-3\">On February 8, 1993, plaintiff filed suit against Williams and the owner and operator of the Dixie Bar, T &amp; L Operations, Inc. (hereafter defendant), to recover for the injuries suffered in the incident. The claim against Williams was based on negligence and alleged that Williams acted in a \u201cwilful, wanton and reckless manner.\u201d The claim against defendant was based on multiple violations of the dram-shop act, MCL 436.22; MSA 18.993. Specifically, plaintiff alleged that defendant served alcohol to Williams when the latter was both underage and visibly intoxicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-4\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-5\">On July 21, 1994, a default was entered against Williams. Williams participated in the subsequent trial only as a witness and is not involved in this appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-6\">Soon after, the case was tried before a jury. After the close of plaintiff\u2019s proofs, defendant moved for a directed verdict on the basis that the fireman\u2019s rule barred plaintiff\u2019s claim and because plaintiff failed to show that the dram-shop violation was a proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s injuries. The trial court denied the motion as it related to the fireman\u2019s rule and allowed plaintiff to recall Williams to establish the element of proximate cause. On August 1, 1994, the jury returned a verdict for plaintiff. Plaintiff was awarded $121,689.89, and plaintiff\u2019s wife was awarded $25,000 for her loss of consortium claim. The trial court later granted plaintiff\u2019s motion for an award of costs and attorney fees and denied defendant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. <em>[McCaw, supra </em>at 183-185.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>The fireman\u2019s rule was adopted by the Supreme Court as a common-law rule in <em>Kreski v Modern Wholesale Electric Supply Co, </em>429 Mich 347; 415 NW2d 178 (1987). The fireman\u2019s rule prevents police officers and fire fighters from recovering for injuries arising out of the risks of their respective professions. <em>Id. </em>at 351. The scope of the rule includes both negligence in causing the incident requiring a safety officer\u2019s presence and those risks inherent in fulfilling the police or fire fighting duties. <em>Id. </em>at 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">The Court next addressed the application of the fireman\u2019s rule in <em>Woods v City of Warren, </em>439 Mich 186, 190; 482 NW2d 696 (1992). In <em>Woods, </em>the Court explained that the rule bars recovery for two types of injury: \u201cthose derived from the negligence causing the safety officer\u2019s presence and those stemming from the normal risks of the safety officer\u2019s profession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 196. The analytical focus must be on whether the injury stems directly from the safety officer\u2019s professional functions. <em>Id. </em>at 193. Nevertheless, the fireman\u2019s rule may not apply in situations where the policy rationales for its adoption are inapplicable. <em>Id. </em>at 194, n 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Gibbons, supra, </em>involved two consolidated cases, <em>Gibbons v Caraway </em>and <em>Mariin v Fleur. </em>In <em>Mariin, </em>an off-duty police officer, dressed in civilian clothes, was socializing in a bar. The officer was injured when another patron in the bar recognized him as the one who had arrested the patron several years previously and attacked him. <em>Gibbons </em>at 319. A majority of the Court held that the fireman\u2019s rule did not bar the officer\u2019s claim because the connection between the injury was too attenuated from the exercise of his police func<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>tion. See <em>id. </em>at 328 (CAVANAGH, J.), 329 (BOYLE, J.), 340-341 (Riley, J.).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-3\">In <em>Gibbons, </em>a police officer directing traffic after an accident had occurred was injured when a third party driving along the road swerved and struck him. <em>Id. </em>at 317-318. The Court failed to produce a majority opinion in this case. However, five justices appear to agree that the fireman\u2019s rule does not bar a claim for damages for injuries caused by the subsequent wrongdoing of a third party unconnected to the situation that brought the officer to the scene, where the wrongdoing resulted from wanton, reckless, or grossly negligent behavior. See <em>id. </em>at 325-326 (Cavanagh, J.), 329-330 (Boyle, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">A majority of the <em>Gibbons </em>Court clearly agrees that the decision in <em>Woods, supra, </em>should be limited. See <em>id. </em>at 323-324 (Cavanagh, J.), 329 (Boyle, J.). However, the Court has not delineated the extent of the limitation. The five justices who agreed that the fireman\u2019s rule did not preclude recovery in <em>Gibbons </em>did not abandon the requirement in <em>Woods </em>that fire fighters and police officers may not recover for the normal, inherent, and foreseeable risks of their respective professions. These justices reconciled the result in <em>Gibbons </em>with <em>Woods </em>by reaching the somewhat counterintuitive conclusion that, for a police officer directing traffic at the scene of an accident, the danger of injury from a negligent or grossly negligent driver is not inherent in the risks of the profession.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>See <em>id. </em>at 325 (Cavanagh, J.); 330 (Boyle, J.). Justice Cavanagh explained this result by quoting language from <em>Kreski </em>stating that the \u201c \u2018fireman\u2019s rule is not a license to act with impunity, without regard for the safety officer\u2019s well-being.\u2019 \u201d See <em>id. </em>at 325 (Cavanagh, J.), quoting <em>Kreski, supra </em>at 372. Justice Boyle concluded that the injury in <em>Gibbons </em>should be compensable because \u201cthere is no direct relationship between the act that caused the injury and the act that occasioned the officer\u2019s presence.\u201d See <em>Gibbons, supra </em>at 329 (Boyle, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">In our opinion, there is an inherent inconsistency in stating both that the fireman\u2019s rule bars recovery for injuries stemming from the normal, inherent, and foreseeable risks of the profession and that the fireman\u2019s rule \u201cis not a license to act with impunity, without regard for the safety officer\u2019s well-being.\u201d* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Kreski, supra </em>at 372. In the context of police officers, it is clear that the normal, inherent, and foreseeable risks of the profession include confronting people who will not only act without regard for their safety, but may deliberately attempt to harm them. As the Supreme Court noted in <em>Kreski, </em>\u201cpolice officers cannot be certain what dangers surround them when investigating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>a burglary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 378. Likewise, police officers cannot predict what they will encounter when responding to a report of a stabbing, as plaintiff did in the present case. <em>Gibbons </em>did not produce a majority rationale for resolving this contradiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Under the facts of the present case, it is clear that the injuries to plaintiff resulted from Williams\u2019 wilful, wanton, reckless, or grossly negligent behavior.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, after considering <em>Gibbons, </em>we find dispositive the fact that Williams was not a third party unconnected to the situation that brought plaintiff to the scene. On the contrary, Williams was present at the scene where a man had been stabbed. It was therefore likely that Williams had either committed the stabbing or possessed important information about it. In fact, Williams had spent the day in the company of both the perpetrator of the stabbing and the victim, and he had summoned plaintiff to the scene by calling 911. Plaintiff was injured when Williams attacked him after he attempted to prevent Williams from leaving the scene. We find this situation distinguishable from that in <em>Gibbons, </em>where the defendant struck the plaintiff with her vehicle as the latter was directing traffic following an unrelated accident. We cannot conclude that Williams\u2019 wrongdoing was unconnected to the situation that brought plaintiff to the scene. It therefore does not appear that <em>Gibbons </em>precludes the application of the fireman\u2019s rule in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">However, our analysis does not end there. We now examine the policy rationales behind the fireman\u2019s rule to see if they are applicable. See <em>Woods, supra </em>at 194, n 8. According to the <em>Kreski </em>Court,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>the foundational policy rationale [is] that the purpose of safety professions is to confront danger and, therefore, the public should not be liable for damages for injuries occurring in the performance of the very function police officers and fire fighters are intended to fulfill. <em>[Kreski, supra </em>at 368.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">In adopting the rule, the Court also cited the facts that police officers and fire fighters are trained to deal with the hazards of their respective professions and that worker\u2019s compensation benefits are available to police officers and fire fighters injured in the course of their employment. See <em>id. </em>at 366, 369. These policy rationales are all applicable in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Our decision is also influenced by an additional policy consideration, mentioned in our previous opinion. Plaintiff\u2019s claim against defendant is based not on injuries directly inflicted on plaintiff by defendant, but rather on violations of the dramshop act. If the fireman\u2019s rule did not apply here, bar owners might hesitate to summon the police for aid in disturbances and instead resort to self-help measures, creating additional risk to the public. See <em>McCaw, supra </em>at 188-189..</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that plaintiff\u2019s claim is barred by the fireman\u2019s rule. We therefore reverse the order granting a judgment consistent with the jury verdict in favor of plaintiff. We also reverse the order awarding plaintiff costs and attorney fees. Our resolution of this issue renders it unnecessary for us to address defendant\u2019s other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b466-10\">Mackenzie, P.J., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b460-7\"> Toni McCaw, Daniel McCaw\u2019s wife, joins him as plaintiff. Because her loss of consortium claim is derivative and dependent on her husband\u2019s claim, and to avoid confusion, we will refer only to Daniel McCaw as plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b463-5\"> Justice Weaver concurred only in the result because of her belief that the fireman\u2019s rule should be limited to premises liability. See <em>id. </em>at 334 (Weaver, J.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b463-6\"> In her opinion in <em>Gibbons, </em>Justice Riley criticized the majority\u2019s conclusion that the danger of injury from a negligent driver for a police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>officer directing traffic at the scene of an accident is not inherent in the risks of the profession as a \u201cfiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 338 (Riley, J.). Justice Riley further stated: \u201cBecause the fireman\u2019s rule was adopted by this Court as a common-law rule, if we decide to rework the doctrine, we should not be reluctant to expressly redefine when the rule applies, rather than attempt to fit these facts into the preexisting rules established by <em>Kreski </em>and <em>Woods.\" Id. </em>at 338, n 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b464-9\"> We recognize that in the interim between the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Kreski </em>and <em>Woods, </em>two panels of this Court held that the fireman\u2019s rule did not preclude an action by an injured police officer against an individual who either intentionally or wilfully and wantonly injured the officer. See <em>McAtee v Guthrie, </em>182 Mich App 215, 220; 451 NW2d 551 (1989); <em>Rozenboom. v Proper, </em>177 Mich App 49, 57; 441 NW2d 11 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b465-7\"> Plaintiff has not alleged that Williams acted intentionally.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b467-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>White, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYu\">(dissenting). I do not address plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the fireman\u2019s rule is generally inapplicable to statutory actions under the dramshop act, MCL 436.22; MSA 18.993, because that question was decided adversely to plaintiffs in this Court\u2019s initial opinion and the Supreme Court\u2019s remand to this Court was solely for the purpose of reconsidering the case in light of <em>Gibbons v Caraway </em>and <em>Mariin v Fleur, Inc, </em>455 Mich 314; 565 NW2d 663 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-3\">In <em>Gibbons, </em>the Supreme Court discussed its previous decisions applying the fireman\u2019s rule and reaffirmed the Court\u2019s recognition in <em>Woods v City of Warren, </em>439 Mich 186; 482 NW2d 696 (1992), that the rule generally applies to injuries derived from the negligence causing the safety officer\u2019s presence and also to those stemming from the normal risks of the profession, but is to be applied \u201cflexibly as circumstances require []\u201d to \u201cflexibly address the different fact patterns as they are presented,\u201d recognizing \u201cindividual exceptions in appropriate situations\u201d when the \u201cfundamental policy rationale is inapplicable.\u201d <em>Gibbons, </em>at 322-323 (citations omitted). Applying these principles to the instant case, I would hold that the policy rationales are inapplicable and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">The dramshop violation was unrelated to the reason plaintiff Daniel McCaw (plaintiff) was on the scene. Plaintiff was not called to the scene by a bar owner seeking assistance in dealing with a disorderly patron, called regarding a disturbance created by an intoxicated person, or called to the scene of an accident involving a drunk driver. Rather, he was called to investigate a stabbing involving two persons other than Williams. Thus, the aspect of the policy rationale that seeks to encourage citizens to call safety officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>for assistance without regard to their own negligence is not implicated, and the prong of the test that focuses on injuries derived from the negligence requiring the officer\u2019s presence is inapplicable because defendant\u2019s \u201cnegligence\u201d (statutory violation) was unrelated to plaintiff\u2019s presence. Additionally, except in the most general sense, being assaulted by Williams was not a normal, inherent, and foreseeable risk. Williams\u2019 intoxication was peripheral to plaintiff\u2019s performance of his duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Further, the aspect of the policy rationale for the fireman\u2019s rule that recognizes that safety officers are trained at taxpayer expense to handle dangerous situations and are compensated at taxpayer expense to deal with hazards created by taxpayer negligence, and therefore shields citizens from damage claims for injuries sustained by officers as a result of carelessness or ordinary negligence encountered as a normal risk of the profession, <em>Gibbons, </em>at 321 (Cavanagh, J.), 331 (Boyle, J), is inapplicable to the instant situation where the risk of injury from the acts of persons served in violation of the dramshop act is specifically addressed by a legislative scheme that requires that the dramshop owner maintain security for liability under the dramshop act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The dramshop owner is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>in the <em>same </em>position as the citizen whose ordinary negligence causes injury to the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-3\">I would affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b468-5\"> I recognize that the same argument might be made regarding automobile .accidents involving officers on the basis of the legislative requirements for security under the no-fault act. However, in such cases a different aspect of the policy favoring application of the fireman\u2019s rule is operative because, as observed by Justice Boyle in <em>Gibbons, </em>the situation that required the officer\u2019s presence often creates the added risk that a third party unrelated to the situation will be distracted or inattentive and negligently cause rqjury to an officer at the scene. <em>Gibbons, </em>at 331 (Boyle, J.). In such cases, the third-party driver may be excused from liability to the officer at the scene in the line of duty where that very situation provides the occasion for the third party\u2019s negligence. The instant case presents a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>different fact pattern. Defendant\u2019s violation of the dramshop act was wholly independent of, preceded, and was in no way caused by the situation that led to plaintiffs presence on the scene in the exercise of his duties as an officer.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
