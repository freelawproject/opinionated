The trial court ruled that the policy issued by Zurich, but not the policy issued by Liberty, provided coverage. Accordingly, the trial court granted summary disposition in favor of plaintiff against Zurich and in favor of Liberty against plaintiff. Zurich appealed, arguing that its policy did not provide coverage. Plaintiff cross appealed, arguing that if the policy issued by Zurich did not provide coverage, then the policy issued by Liberty did provide coverage. In a majority opinion, this Court affirmed the decision of the trial court and declined to review the issue whether Liberty\u2019s policy provided coverage. See <em>Engle v Zurich American Ins Group, </em>216 Mich App 482; 549 NW2d 589 (1996). Zurich then sought leave to appeal. In lieu of granting leave, the Michigan Supreme Court remanded the case to this Court for consideration of whether Liberty\u2019s policy provided coverage. 455 Mich 865 (1997). We now answer that question in the affirmative, affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The facts of this case have been adequately set forth in our previous opinion. Much like any other contract, an insurance policy is an agreement between the parties. When presented with a dispute, a court must determine the parties\u2019 agreement and enforce it. <em>Zurich-American Ins Co v Amerisure Ins Co, </em>215 Mich App 526, 530-531; 547 NW2d 52 (1996). An insurance contract is clear if it fairly admits of but one interpretation. <em>Raska v Farm, Bureau Mut Ins Co, </em>412 Mich 355, 361-362; 314 NW2d 440 (1982). If an insurance contract is clear, it will be enforced as writ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>ten no matter how inartfully worded or clumsily arranged. <em>Id. </em>In this case, because the insurance obligations of Zurich and Liberty are governed by the terms of each of their individual policies, our holding that the policy issued by Zurich affords coverage does not preclude a determination that the policy issued by Liberty affords coverage as well. See <em>Amerisure, supra </em>at 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Zurich argues in its supplemental brief on remand that plaintiff was covered under the policy issued by Liberty as a permissive user. We agree. Liberty\u2019s policy includes a clause extending coverage to permissive users that is identical to the \u201cpermissive user clause\u201d construed by this Court in <em>Amerisure, supra </em>at 531-534. In that case, we held that the owner and driver of a truck tractor leased to a carrier was covered under the carrier\u2019s truck liability insurance as a permissive user when he was involved in an accident while driving his tractor to a facility in Ohio for repair of the heater motor. <em>Id. </em>at 528-529, 531-534. Because the facts of this case are similar in all relevant respects, we conclude that, at the time of the accident, plaintiff was a permissive user entitled to coverage under the permissive user clause contained in Liberty\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">In response to Zurich\u2019s argument, Liberty argues that, although plaintiff may have been a permissive user at the time of the accident, he was specifically excluded from coverage by a separate provision of its policy that was either not included or not addressed in the truck liability insurance policy construed in the <em>Amerisure </em>case. After listing five classes of persons insured under its policy (including permissive users such as plaintiff), Liberty\u2019s policy provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>None of the following is an insured:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-5\">1. Any trucker, or his or her agents or employees, other than you and your employees:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-7\">b. If the trucker is insured for hired autos under an auto liability insurance policy which does not insure on a primary basis the owners of the autos and their agents and employees while the autos are being used exclusively in the trucker\u2019s business and over a route or territory the trucker is authorized to serve by public authority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">liberty argues that this \u201clike insurance clause\u201d excludes plaintiff from coverage because it describes plaintiff and the insurance policy issued to him by Zurich. We disagree with the construction urged by Liberty.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">Exclusionary clauses in insurance contracts axe to be strictly construed against the insurer. <em>Fire Ins Exchange v Diehl, </em>450 Mich 678, 687; 545 NW2d 602 (1996); <em>Amerisure, supra </em>at 533. Liberty\u2019s policy defines \u201ctrucker\u201d as meaning \u201cany person or organization engaged in the business of transporting property by auto for hire.\u201d This definition could arguably refer to plaintiff. However, if we read the word \u201ctrucker\u201d in Liberty\u2019s like insurance clause as applying to plaintiff, the clause would not exclude plaintiff from coverage, because the sort of \u201clike insurance\u201d described therein as triggering an exclusion from coverage under Liberty\u2019s policy would not describe plaintiff\u2019s policy with Zurich. This is so because plaintiff\u2019s policy with Zurich is not the type of policy that, as described in Liberty\u2019s like insurance clause, \u201cdoes not insure on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>primary basis the owners of the autos and their agents and employees while the autos are being used exclusively in the trucker\u2019s [in this case, plaintiff\u2019s] business and over a route or territory the trucker [plaintiff] is authorized to serve by public authority.\u201d Although plaintiff\u2019s policy with Zurich excludes plaintiff from coverage when his truck tractor is used in \u201cthe business of any person or organization to whom the automobile [truck tractor] is rented\u201d (such as the carrier insured by liberty), it does not purport to exclude plaintiff from coverage when his truck tractor is used exclusively in <em>his own </em>business. For liberty\u2019s like insurance clause to have the effect urged by liberty in this appeal, we would have to read the word \u201ctrucker\u201d as referring to <em>plaintiff </em>the first time it is used in part \u201cb\u201d of Liberty\u2019s like insurance clause, and as referring to <em>the carrier insured by Liberty </em>the second and third times it is used in the clause. Considering the rule of strict construction, we cannot accept Liberty\u2019s strained interpretation. Accordingly, we hold that the like insurance clause contained in the policy issued by Liberty does not exclude plaintiff from coverage as a permissive user.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Because plaintiff is entitled to coverage under both insurance policies, we (1) reverse the portion of the trial court\u2019s order granting Liberty\u2019s motion for summary disposition, (2) reverse the portion of the trial court\u2019s order denying plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary disposition with regard to Liberty, (3) affirm the remainder of the trial court\u2019s order, and (4) remand for entry of an order of summaiy disposition in favor of plaintiff against Liberty. In their supplemental briefs on remand, both Zurich and Liberty address issues relating to their respective rights as against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>each other. Because Zurich and Liberty were not in an adversarial posture below, cf. <em>Amerisure, supra </em>at 528, 531, and these issues were not addressed by the trial court, we decline to address them on appeal. See <em>McCready v Hoffius, </em>222 Mich App 210, 218; 564 NW2d 493 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b153-10\"> Zurich does not address Liberty\u2019s like insurance clause in its supplemental brief on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
