Magnuson argues that the district court erroneously imposed a two-level sentencing enhancement for using \u201cmass-marketing\u201d in the commission of his offense and clearly erred in assessing a $20,000 fine. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"A-R\">Magnuson operated an advance fee scheme, placing ads in grocery store tabloid newspapers promising interest-free loans. After collecting \u201capplication fees\u201d and \u201cdeposits\u201d from unwitting victims, Magnuson kept the money for his own use and did not extend a loan to any applicants.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>He objects to the district court\u2019s imposition of a two-level enhancement under former U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1(b)(3) for using \u201cmass-marketing\u201d in the commission of his offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The sentencing guidelines define mass-marketing as a \u201cplan, program, promotion, or campaign that is conducted through solicitation by telephone, mail, the Internet, or other means to induce a large number of persons to (A) purchase goods or services; ... or (C) invest for financial profit.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Magnuson argues that he did not engage in mass-marketing because placing a newspaper advertisement is passive, unlike solicitation by telephone, mail, or the Internet.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">As a preliminary matter, we note that the definition of \u201cmass-marketing\u201d is not limited to the listed mediums\u2014it explicitly contemplates \u201cother means\u201d of mass-marketing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, Magnuson does not dispute that his advertisements reached a \u201clarge number of persons.\u201d The average circulation of one tabloid newspaper in which Magnuson advertised is 335, 900 every six days.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Magnuson\u2019s lone argument is that \u00a7 2F1.1(b)(3) is limited to \u201cactive\u201d rather than \u201cpassive\u201d marketing. This view is derived from Judge Berzoris dissent in the Ninth Circuit\u2019s recent decision in <em>United States v. Pirello.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Judge Berzon argued that the use of the word \u201csolicitation\u201d in the guideline \u201cdenotes more than simply advertising\u201d and \u201csuggests some sort of one-on-one importuning.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-15\">We decline to adopt such a restrictive view. The plain meaning of solicitation is to \u201csolicit orders or trade, as for a business house.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, two of the mediums listed in the commentary note\u2014 mail and the Internet\u2014are themselves passive and often lack the personal entreating required by Judge Berzon. A mass mailing to 300,000 people is no more active than an advertisement in a newspaper. Similarly, in a different context, we have recognized that many Internet websites are passive.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We agree with the majority in <em>Pirello </em>and the Second Circuit that \u00a7 2F1.1(b)(3) merely requires advertising that reaches a \u201clarge number of persons.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The district court did not err by imposing a two-level enhancement under \u00a7 2F1.1(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-16\">Magnuson also argues that the district court clearly erred by imposing a $20,000 fine. District courts are directed to impose a fine in all cases, unless the defendant establishes that he will be unable to pay.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant bears the burden of proving his inability to pay a fine, and may rely upon the PSR to establish his inability to pay.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Because the district court adopted the PSR in this case, the government was required to present evidence showing that Magnuson could, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>fact, pay a fine.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Given that the PSR indicated that Magnuson had a net worth of $100,000, the government met its burden and the district court did not clearly err by imposing a $20,000 fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b363-7\">.
