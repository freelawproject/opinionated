Four prior felony convictions charged against him were found to be true. On May 7, 1957, appellant was sentenced to state prison. Thereafter, on August 22, 1957, he filed in the Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>perior Court of Los Angeles County a document denominated \u201cMotion to Annul, Vacate and Set Aside Judgment.\u201d On August 28, 1957, the court entered its order as follows: \u201cPetition for Writ of Error Coram Nobis is denied.\u201d From such order appellant filed his appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">On January 31, 1958, appellant filed in this court his \u201cMotion for abandonment of appeal for limited purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">In support of such motion appellant asserts \u201cthat his motion to annul, vacate and set aside judgment was not intended to be a petition for a writ of Error Coram Nobis, and that by the trial judge entitling it to be a petition for a writ of Error Coram Nobis, deprives him of that remedy, when in fact, the motion as presented, did not fulfill those requirements as prescribed by statute and law for the filing of the petition for a writ of Error Coram Nobis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">Appellant then states that he \u201cnow wishes to abandon the appeal so that he may file a properly executed petition for a writ of Error Coram Nobis under the requirements of law and rules thereon; or, in the alternative, that an order issue allowing the appeal to stand as an appeal from a denial of a motion to annual, vacate and set aside the judgment rather than an appeal from the denial of a petition for a writ of Error Coram Nobis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">This contention that his application to the court below was mistakenly treated as a petition for writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>appellant is in error because, in this state a motion such as appellant herein made in the superior court to vacate a judgment in a criminal case is a proceeding in the nature of an application for a writ of error <em>coram nobis (People </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>155 Cal.App.2d 149, 151 [317 P.2d 108]). The grounds stated by appellant in his motion to the superior court and from the denial of which he now appeals, makes such motion the equivalent of a proceeding in the nature of a writ of error <em>coram nobis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b741-10\">The motion of appellant to abandon his appeal \u201cfor limited purpose\u201d is therefore denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
