Code, \u00a7 245). The trial court entertained a doubt as to defendant\u2019s sanity and suspended proceedings pending trial of the sanity issue (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1368, 1369). A second jury found defendant sane, and judgment committing him to prison was thereafter pronounced (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1370). Defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The prosecution\u2019s evidence showed that the weapon used was a \u201cpoliceman\u2019s club,\u201d about a foot long. Appellant argues that the evidence is insufficient to support the verdict, in that a club of this sort is not an inherently deadly weapon, and did not become so in fact when used by the 65-year-old appellant upon complainant, a delivery man 27 years old. The testimony shows that the left rear side of complainant\u2019s head was struck with sufficient force to cause a cut which required two sutures. Whether the club was a deadly weapon was at most a mixed question of law and fact, to be determined by the jury upon proper instructions <em>(People </em>v. <em>McCoy, </em>25 Cal.2d 177, 189 [153 P.2d 315]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Valliere, </em>123 Cal. 576 [56 P. 433] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Petters, </em>29 Cal. App.2d 48 [84 P.2d 54] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Raleigh, </em>128 Cal.App. 105 [16 P.2d 752]). Appellant does not question the instructions upon this point, and, under the cases just cited, the evidence is ample to support the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Appellant complains of the testimony of the witness Michel, a pharmacist employed by the same drugstore for which complainant worked. Michel testified that appellant telephoned the store four times in less than two hours after the alleged assault, and made statements about the events of the evening in conflict with each other and with statements made to others. It developed that Michel had made notes of the conversations on the evening they occurred, and had given these notes to the deputy district attorney, who had lost them. The deputy stated that he had made copies of Michel\u2019s notes, and showed them to Michel to refresh his recollection. Appellant objected to this procedure only upon the ground that there was no showing that the witness\u2019 recollection required refreshing, and not on the ground that they were memoranda made by one not the witness, the objection urged here. Thus it could well be argued that the objection, even if otherwise sound, was waived. In any event, we are satisfied that the incident was not prejudicial to appellant. The essence of Michel\u2019s testimony had been given before the use of the memoranda, his testimony dealt with a collateral matter not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>inherently harmful to appellant\u2019s case, and the variety and inconsistency of appellant\u2019s statements were fully shown by other witnesses and in the cross-examination of appellant himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Appellant complains that he was cross-examined extensively as to his education and prior employment, and as to honors awarded him. But he had testified upon these subjects on direct examination.  In view of his general denial of the offense charged, the permissible scope of cross-examination was very broad <em>(People </em>v. Zerillo, 36 Cal.2d 222, 228 [223 P.2d 223]).  The cross-examination as to his education and background was, in the circumstances of this trial, entirely proper <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>46 Cal.2d 818, 832 [299 P.2d 243]).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Appellant charges the prosecutor with \u201cinjecting racism\u201d into the case. We have reviewed the record in detail, and find no basis for this claim of misconduct. The prosecutor\u2019s only references to race were substantially quotations of appellant, and were necessary to identify particular testimony. There is no suggestion of appeal to race prejudice or of any attempt to attribute such prejudice to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Appellant requested no instruction upon self-defense. Now, however, he asserts that the court\u2019s failure to give such instruction upon its own motion constitutes error. Appellant cites no applicable authority for this view. The record contains no evidence even remotely suggesting self-defense. On the contrary, appellant at all times denied striking complainant. There was no reason for any instruction upon defense of self or of habitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">Complaint is made of the instructions in other respects. However, the instructions as a whole- were full and fair, and we find no error in them.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">Kaufman, P. J., and Dooling, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
