Demurrers of defendants Ziv, KTTV, and Daniels were sustained without leave to amend. Plaintiff appeals from a judgment of dismissal, based upon the order sustaining the demurrers. Motions of said defendants to strike certain portions of the complaint were granted. Appellant states that this appeal is not directed to the propriety of granting the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The allegations of the first cause of action (after the motions to strike were granted) are, in substance, as follows: Early in 1953 plaintiff, a California Highway Patrol officer, conceived the idea of dramatizing and Actionizing the experiences of the California Highway Patrol for presentation as a series of radio and television programs. On September 25, 1953, he registered a written expression of his radio and television format, program idea, and working title with the Radio Writers Guild. On February 5, 1954, he registered Ms complete 26-page script of a half-hour teleplay entitled, \u201cRoadblock,\u201d with the Screen Writers Guild. Said script was intended to be a representative script of plaintiff\u2019s projected television series based on the exploits and official files of the California Highway Patrol. Early in 1954 plaintiff conceived the idea of broadening the scope of his series to encompass the activities of similar organizations of other states based on their official files. On April 21, 1954, he registered this development of his format and program idea and a 24-page script of a half hour teleplay entitled, \u201cMountain Patrol,\u201d with the Screen Writers Guild. The written expression of plaintiff\u2019s format, idea, working title, and scripts are referred to thereafter in the complaint as plaintiff\u2019s \u201cproperty.\u201d Plaintiff is the author and owner of said property, which property has not been published. It is impractical, by reason of the nature and bulk of said property, to attach copies thereof to the complaint, and copies will be produced upon order of the court. Plaintiff desired the approval of the California Highway Patrol to use material from its files in the exploitation of Ms property, and he \u201csubmitted through proper departmental channels, and in con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>fidenee, his script entitled \u2018Roadblock.\u2019 \u201d Several months passed without plaintiff receiving any word from the commissioner of the California Highway Patrol. During this period plaintiff discussed the matter of departmental approval with defendant Daniels, who was and is the Los Angeles public information officer of the patrol. \u201cPlaintiff, in discussing his submission with defendant Daniels, and in confiding to him all the details of, and information about plaintiff\u2019s property did so in reliance on the fact that defendant Daniels was an employee in the department who was vested with appropriate authority with respect to the matter involved and who was in the direct channel of communication and command through which plaintiff\u2019s submission must travel. Plaintiff\u2019s sole purpose in making his submission and in discussing the details and scope of his property was to obtain the approval of the department to use its files, and was made for no other purpose. Plaintiff intended at no time to dedicate his property to the public, to abandon his rights therein or to gratuitously give them away. By a letter dated April 2, 1954, plaintiff was informed by Commissioner Caldwell [of the patrol] that he could not be given access to the department\u2019s files as a matter of policy. Some weeks later the script which plaintiff had submitted through departmental channels months earlier was personally handed to plaintiff by defendant Daniels who was then fully familiar with its contents and with that of plaintiff\u2019s other property.\u201d Before and during the period plaintiff discussed the matter with Daniels, he (Daniels) was associated in various ventures with Ziv. Daniels intentionally and wilfully misappropriated plaintiff\u2019s property and used the secret information \u201cthus obtained\u201d for his own benefit and wrongfully divulged said property and secret information to Ziv. Ziv rewarded Daniels by appointing him a technical advisor for the television series entitled, \u201cHighway Patrol,\u201d based on plaintiff\u2019s property, and placed him on its payroll during the filming of the series. Before Ziv publicly announced its intention to produce the television series, \u201cHighway Patrol,\u201d based on plaintiff\u2019s property, plaintiff met with a vice-president of Ziv and with the producer of said series to discuss plaintiff\u2019s rights. In July 1954, notwithstanding that Ziv had been given early notice by plaintiff that its contemplated television series was based on plaintiff\u2019s property, Ziv announced in motion picture trade papers that the first film in the series entitled, \u201cHighway Patrol,\u201d would be made on August 19, 1954. Ziv and Daniels have continued to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>copy and use plaintiff\u2019s, property in the preparation and production of their television series entitled,. \u201cHighway Patrol,\u201d and have refused to pay plaintiff for the right to copy and use his property. Ziv and Daniels have produced at least 39 half-hour television films based upon, copying, using and embodying plaintiff\u2019s property and have distributed said films in the United States, Canada, and in many foreign countries. Commencing October 3, 1955, said films have been shown in Los Angeles over KTTV\u2019s television station. Unless Ziv and Daniels are enjoined from producing and distributing the series \u201cHighway Patrol,\u201d they will continue to profit from copying and using plaintiff\u2019s property. Unless KTTV is enjoined from telecasting said series and from selling advertising in conjunction therewith, the \u201calready materially depleted value of plaintiff\u2019s property will be totally diluted and destroyed.\u201d Plaintiff has not been able to obtain Ziv\u2019s and Daniels\u2019 copies of television series \u201cHighway Patrol\u201d for the purpose of attaching the same to the complaint pursuant to the provisions of section 426, subdivision 3, of the Code of Civil Procedure. By reason of their intentional and oppressive acts as aforesaid, Ziv and Daniels have misappropriated plaintiff\u2019s property and have destroyed its value to plaintiff. Plaintiff has been damaged thereby in the amount of $350,000, which is the reasonable value of the television rights in plaintiff\u2019s property, and plaintiff has been damaged in an additional amount of $100,000, which is the reasonable value of other exploitation rights in plaintiff\u2019s property. All the aforesaid acts of Ziv and Daniels are continuing wrongs, and unless said defendants are enjoined from producing and distributing \u201cHighway Patrol\u201d they will irreparably damage plaintiff\u2019s opportunities to exploit his property. All the aforesaid acts of Ziv and Daniels were intentional and oppressive and were the result of a scheme and conspiracy of said defendants to enrich themselves by appropriating and using plaintiff\u2019s property. By reason of those acts Ziv and Daniels have acquired substantial profits and they should account to plaintiff therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-3\">The second cause of action incorporates, by reference, all the allegations of the first cause of action, except the allegations as to damages. Additional allegations therein are: On January 18, 1954, plaintiff entered into a written agreement with Mr. Corcoran and Mr. G-undlefinger whereby they undertook to represent him in the exploitation of his property. Plaintiff and his representatives expended time, money and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>effort in order to interest others in producing or distributing or sponsoring plaintiff\u2019s property as a television series. As a result of the deliberate and intentional acts \u201cas aforesaid,\u201d Ziv and Daniels misappropriated plaintiff\u2019s property and passed it off as their own, and they copied, used and embodied its elements in the production and distribution of their \u201cHighway Patrol\u201d series. They thereby committed gross acts of unfair competition against plaintiff \u201cin that they turned his own property against him.\u201d Since Ziv\u2019s announcement of its intention to produce the \u201cHighway Patrol\u201d television series, plaintiff and his associates have lost the interest of persons who, before such announcement, had manifested an interest in plaintiff\u2019s property. Plaintiff has been unable to create any new interest in his property. By reason of their gross acts of unfair competition, as aforesaid, Ziv and Daniels usurped and occupied the then undeveloped television area which plaintiff\u2019s property was designed to fill, thereby \u201cdiluting the value of said property.\u201d The value of said property \u201cwill be irreparably damaged\u201d if Ziv and Daniels be permitted to unlawfully exploit plaintiff\u2019s property by using, copying, and embodying its elements in their television series entitled, \u201cHighway Patrol.\u201d On September 21, 1955, some weeks before Ziv\u2019s and Daniels\u2019 \u201cHighway Patrol\u201d series began its first television run in Los Angeles, plaintiff advised KTTV of his property rights. KTTV chose to proceed with the telecasting of Ziv\u2019s and Daniels\u2019 television series, and is now telecasting said series, and KTTV thereby became an active and continuing participant with said defendants Ziv and Daniels in their scheme and conspiracy to misappropriate plaintiff\u2019s property and to use it to his detriment. Defendants Barker Bros, and General Electric Company, as sponsors of said Highway Patrol series, and defendants Roderick Mays and Rod Mays and Company, as advertising agents of said sponsors, are paying KTTV for the right to advertise the wares of said sponsors on the \u201cHighway Patrol\u201d series. No defendant has offered to pay plaintiff for the use of his property. Plaintiff has been damaged in the amount of $350,000, which is the reasonable value of the television rights in plaintiff\u2019s property, and plaintiff has been damaged in the additional amount of $100,000, which is the reasonable value of other exploitation rights in plaintiff\u2019s property. The foregoing acts of unfair competition by Ziv, Daniels and KTTV were intentional and oppressive.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The prayer is for compensatory and punitive damages, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>for an accounting; and to enjoin Ziv and Daniels from producing, distributing and exploiting the Highway Patrol television series; and to enjoin KTTV from telecasting the series; and to enjoin Barker Bros, and General Electric from advertising in conjunction with telecasting the series.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\">Ziv, Daniels and KTTV demurred to the complaint upon the grounds that neither of the alleged causes of action stated facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and that both of the alleged causes of action were uncertain, ambiguous and unintelligible. Said defendants also filed motions to strike certain portions of the complaint, and to require plaintiff to comply with section 426, subdivision 3, of the Code of Civil Procedure, by filing scripts with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Subsequently, plaintiff delivered scripts of \u201cRoadblock\u201d and \u201cMountain Patrol,\u201d and the defendants delivered 19 scripts of \u201cHighway Patrol,\u201d to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">In a memorandum filed by plaintiff with the trial court, plaintiff stated: \u201cPlaintiff does not contend that any of defendants\u2019 scripts copy the mode of expression of any portion of plaintiff\u2019s two \u2018sample scripts.\u2019 Nor does plaintiff contend that in copying plaintiff\u2019s idea for a program series that defendants have copied the arrangement of the words in which the idea is couched. There are no copyright or plagiarism issues involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The motions to strike portions of the complaint were granted in part. The demurrers were sustained without leave to amend, and the action was dismissed. In a memorandum of ruling, with reference to the motions to strike and the demurrers, the trial judge stated: \u201cThe allegations of the complaint are broad enough to charge misappropriation of plaintiff\u2019s scripts \u2018Roadblock\u2019 and \u2018Mountain Patrol\u2019 [citation of references to complaint], which scripts have been tendered to the Court under C.C.P. 426(3) with copies of defendants\u2019 19 scripts allegedly involved, under the caption \u2018 Highway Patrol.\u2019 Examination pursuant to that section produces the conclusion that there is no infringement, in and to plaintiff\u2019s rights, in the sense of plagiarism or literary pirating. In the numerous memoranda filed, plaintiff himself has abandoned such allegations, claiming that the \u2018idea\u2019 of such a series, as alleged in par. VI (a), was property; and was revealed in confidence to defendant Daniels, who thereafter, with the other defendants, proceeded to use it in violation of plaintiff\u2019s rights. Essentially, this involved the presentation in dramatized form of actual cases developed by the Highway Patrol. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>In such a development is seems clear plaintiff conld not have a property right. If, for instance, the Department itself undertook such publicity, could it be enjoined because an employee thereof made the suggestion? The idea of dramatizing the operations of peace officers generally is certainly not unique. Consequently, it seems necessary to hold that no cause of action is purported to be stated except for plagiarism, which upon examination of scripts I reject; and which plaintiff also disclaims (C.C.P. 426(3).) As to the claim of an asserted property right, it appears that plaintiff has none, and if that is so, there cannot be breach of a fiduciary relationship through implementation of the \u2018idea,\u2019 which seems to be completely in the public domain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Appellant contends that the first cause of action states a cause of action \u201cfor the disclosure and use of unpublished ideas and information revealed in confidence. \u2019 \u2019 He states that he has not attempted to plead an action based upon copyrightable material; that there is no copyright infringement or plagiarism herein; that defendants are not charged with copying portions of his script; that only the program idea was taken and such a taking is not actionable under statutory copyright principles; that he could never show, by comparing parallel columns of expression in the scripts, an actionable copying of his work \u201cwhich copyright would protect.\u201d He states that his action is for unauthorized copying and use, in breach of confidence, of his idea for a television program; that the copying he refers to is not the copying of his script but is the copying of his idea which he revealed in confidence; that if, after comparing the scripts, the over-all impression is that the format of defendants\u2019 program is like plaintiff\u2019s format, the plaintiff has stated a cause of action; and that where a plaintiff\u2019s intellectual production is obtained in breach of trust the law punishes the wrongful act of obtaining the idea \u201crather than consciously to protect the \u2018property\u2019 of the plaintiff.\u201d Appellant argues further that a cause of action for breach of confidence is stated by the allegations that his program idea was given to Daniels in confidence, and that Daniels disclosed the idea to Ziv, and that Ziv used the idea with knowledge of appellant\u2019s \u201crights.\u201d It seems to be appellant\u2019s argument that if an idea which is not proteetible is disclosed to a person in confidence, the idea then becomes proteetible.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Section 980 of the Civil Code, as amended in 1947, provides in part: \u201cThe author or proprietor of any composition in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>letters or art has an exclusive ownership in the representation or expression thereof as against all persons except one who originally and independently creates the same or a similar composition. \u201d  In <em>Weitzenkorn </em>v. <em>Lesser, </em>40 Cal.2d 778 [256 P.2d 947], the court said at page 789: \u201cThe 1947 amendment to section 980 has eliminated the protection formerly given to \u2018any product of the mind.\u2019 The statute as it now exists, and as it read at the time this cause of action arose, provides protection only \u2018in the representation or expression\u2019 of a composition. The Legislature has abrogated the rule of proteetibility of an idea and California now accepts the traditional theory of proteetible property under common law copyright.\u201d (See also <em>Desny </em>v. <em>Wilder, </em>46 Cal.2d 715, 732 [299 P.2d 257].)</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">The allegations show that the files which were the basis for plaintiff\u2019s program idea were files of a department of state government; and that plaintiff did not have permission to use the files for his personal commercial purposes or at all. It seems to be his position that if a person expresses, in confidence to an employee of the government, an idea with reference t\u00f3 a commercial use of government files that the person thereby establishes a legal position favorable to himself whereby he can prevent the employee, or others, or the government itself, from using the files in a manner suggested by him, except with his consent. It was not shown that plaintiff had a contract, express, or implied in fact or implied in law, with Daniels or anyone. Plaintiff asserts that his action sounds in tort. There is no allegation that Daniels accepted, in confidence, the disclosure of the idea. Plaintiff had no property right in the idea with respect to use of the government files for commercial purposes. He states that a question of property does not enter into the matter where there is a confidential relationship, but that an exclusive property right might be a prerequisite for legal relief when there is no relationship between the parties. He argues, however, that his idea was a property right. The alleged first cause of action did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Appellant contends that his second cause of action sets forth facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for unfair competition in that it shows \u201cthat defendants have surreptitiously misappropriated plaintiff\u2019s work product, have tortiously interfered with his prospective contractual relations, and have unjustly enriched themselves thereby.\u201d The cases cited above, with reference to the first cause of action, are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>applicable here. Also, the above discussion is applicable here. The alleged second cause of action does not state facts sufficient to state a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The court did not err in sustaining the demurrers without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Shinn, P. J., and Vall\u00e9e, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied March 26, 1958.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
