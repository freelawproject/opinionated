The cause was tried before the court without a jury. In its findings of fact, the trial court found that the alleged contract was nonexistent and that the allegations of fraud were untrue.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-13\">Plaintiff and Alexander Dollar, hereinafter sometimes referred to as the testator, were married in 1945. Alexander Dollar died on June 21, 1952, leaving a will which antedated his marriage to plaintiff. It is undisputed that as to plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>the will was revoked by the subsequent marriage, section 70 of the Probate Code being clearly applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">By the terms of his will dated December 8, 1942, testator left his entire estate to the defendant Mae Weinman, and named her executrix. Testator\u2019s former wife, Ruth, who had died in 1942, was defendant Weinman\u2019s daughter. It appears that the relationship between the testator and his mother-in-law always was a very close one and that a substantial part of his estate had its origin in gifts from Mrs. Weinman to her daughter, Ruth, and was inherited by him upon Ruth\u2019s death. After Alexander Dollar\u2019s death, his will was found in his safety deposit box and was contained in an envelope bearing the inscription in testator\u2019s handwriting: \u201cNot Valid. It is my intention to replace this existing Will with one that will be current and up to date. Alexander Dollar, 5-29-52.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">On July 28, 1952, the will was admitted to probate without contest and Mrs. Weinman was appointed executrix. Plaintiff appeared as a witness at the probate hearing and testified to her wish that the will be admitted. It is undisputed that the testator\u2019s surviving heirs, other than plaintiff, were certain brothers and sisters and a nephew. It is further agreed that had the will been successfully contested and denied probate, distribution of the estate under the laws of succession would have given plaintiff all the community property and one-half of the separate property, with the balance going to the brothers, sisters, and nephew. Defendant Weinman would have taken nothing from the estate under the laws of succession. Although all the heirs were given due notice of the proceedings, no contest was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">At the trial of the instant action, plaintiff testified that she was induced to refrain from contesting the will by certain promises made by defendant Weinman to the effect that if plaintiff would allow the will to be probated without contest Mrs. Weinman would turn over to her all of the distributable estate. According to plaintiff\u2019s testimony, this promise was first made by Mrs. Weinman in the course of a conference with the defendant Mergenthaler at the latter\u2019s law office, prior to the probate hearing and some two weeks after the will was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">Mr. Mergenthaler, the attorney who filed the petition for probate of the will, was joined as a party defendant in the cause of action alleging fraud. It is undisputed that he had been Mrs. Weinman\u2019s attorney for many years. He had acted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>as the attorney in the settlement of the estate of her daughter, Ruth, and of her former husband, William Sampson.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Plaintiff further testified that on July 28, 1952, she went to court with Mr. Mergenthaler and Mrs. Weinman to attend the hearing on the petition for probate of the will, and that immediately before the hearing, while waiting in an antechamber of the courtroom, Mrs. Weinman repeated her promise to turn over the assets of the estate to plaintiff. According to plaintiff, Mr. Mergenthaler was present at the time of this conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">Mr. Mergenthaler\u2019s testimony is substantially at variance with that of plaintiff. He denied that Mrs. Weinman was present at any conference with plaintiff at his office before the probate hearing. He testified that plaintiff came alone to his office to deliver the original will a few days after Mr. Dollar\u2019s death. His version of his conversation with her on that occasion was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-8\">\u201cI told Mrs. Dollar that in my opinion the inscription on the envelope did not revoke the will; where a testator made a will before marriage and then died without making a provision in the will for any after acquired wife, that the will was good except as to the new wife; that as to her, it was invalid. I told her at the time that most of Alex\u2019s property had been given to Ruth Dollar, the daughter of Mrs. Weinman, by Mrs. Weinman, and under Ruth\u2019s will, Alex Dollar received about $42,000 of property from Ruth Dollar\u2019s estate and consequently there was a great amount or I thought there was a 'great amount of separate property in the estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-9\">\u201cI also informed her that Alex Dollar had left a number of brothers and sisters in the east; I think some seven or eight; and that if the will had been revoked by that writing, the brothers and sisters would be entitled to one-half the separate property, and that if she contested the probate of the will and was successful in establishing that writing on the envelope as a revocation of the will, they would be entitled to one-half the separate property; that she would be entitled to all of the community property and the other half of the separate property. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">Mr. Mergenthaler testified that nothing was ever said about plaintiff\u2019s right- to a family allowance and that the only conversation between plaintiff and Mrs. Weinman relating to distribution of the estate which he overheard occurred upon their return to his office immediately after the hearing in the probate court when the will was admitted. He related Mrs. Wein<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>man\u2019s statement on that occasion, as follows: \u201cThey came to my office and Mrs. Weinman said that she regarded Ellen as her daughter; she had entertained Alex Dollar and Mrs. Dollar frequently at her Arrowhead house and she looked on Mrs. Ellen Dollar as her daughter. She stated that\u2014\u2018I don\u2019t care anything about this estate and I intend to give it to Mrs. Dollar.\u2019 \u201d Later on the same day, Mergenthaler wrote plaintiff a letter confirming this conversation and containing the following paragraph :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">\u201cAs Mrs. Weinman informed you today, it is her intention to turn over to you any interest that she might have in Alex\u2019 estate under the will, but not as a creditor. I pointed out there was a possibility there might be a gift tax on any amount of the estate which would pass under an assignment from Mrs. Weinman to you and I thought that if there was such a tax, it should be paid by you and you agreed to this idea.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">As above indicated, the will was admitted to probate and letters testamentary were issued to Mrs. Weinman on July 28, 1952. No contest after probate was filed. Between July of 1952 and October of 1953, such proceedings were taken in the probate matter that by the latter date the estate of Alexander Dollar was ready for distribution. Early in October of 1953, Mr. Mergenthaler drafted a document entitled, \u201cAgreement as to Distribution of Assets.\u201d He testified'that it was his purpose in drafting the agreement to provide for a distribution of assets to plaintiff equal in value to the interest which she would have been entitled to receive under the laws of succession. In drafting the agreement he utilized his personal knowledge of the source of the assets and their character as separate or community property.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Mr. Mergenthaler mailed the agreement to Mrs. Weinman at her home at Lake. Arrowhead. Mrs. Weinman signed it and asked her son-in-law, Paul Pritchett, to take it to plaintiff for her signature. Plaintiff testified that Pritchett told her the agreement was \u201cfor record purposes\u201d and that Mrs-. Weinman would return the assets to her after the estate was settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">Thereafter, Mr. Mergenthaler prepared Mrs. Weinman\u2019s final account and report as executrix, and her petition for distribution. Pursuant to the agreement, a decree of distribution was accordingly entered on November 4, 1953. No appeal was taken from this decree and it became final long before the commencement of this action. Mr. Mergenthaler wrote a letter to plaintiff, dated November 19, 1953, enclosing a copy of the decree of distribution, and a receipt for her distributive share, which he requested her to sign and return. In this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>letter he undertook to explain in some detail the apportionment of the assets, the adjustment of tax payments, etc. A few days later Mergenthaler mailed plaintiff a copy of the final account, report and petition for distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Although plaintiff refused to sign the receipt for distribution, it appears that she received the assets given her by the decree. According to plaintiff\u2019s testimony, she and her husband, John Henry, visited Mrs. Weinman at the latter\u2019s home during December, 1953. On this occasion plaintiff inquired when she would receive the remainder of the estate, whereupon, according to plaintiff, Mrs. Weinman became annoyed and indicated that \u201cshe hadn\u2019t made up her mind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">On February 28, 1955, plaintiff filed her original complaint for declaratory relief, breach of contract, fraud, conspiracy, account, and money damages. The action went to trial on the third amended and supplemental complaint which, according to its prayer, sought money damages for breach of contract and fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">In substance, the complaint alleged that plaintiff agreed not to contest the will of Alexander Dollar, refrained from exercising her right to contest, and gave up her right to a family allowance in reliance upon promises and representations made by Mrs. Weinman, by her attorney, Mergenthaler, and by her son-in-law, Pritchett, to the effect that, after distribution, all assets of the estate would be delivered over to plaintiff. The fraud count alleged additionally that these promises and representations were made falsely and with the intent to deceive.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">Although the third amended complaint is cast in the form of an action at law for damages, plaintiff\u2019s attorney, at the beginning of the trial, characterized the ease as \u201can independent action in equity based upon extrinsic fraud.\u201d Both at the beginning and during the trial, defendant\u2019s counsel demanded that plaintiff elect between the contract and fraud causes of action. Addressing the court at the conclusion of the trial, defendant\u2019s counsel stated his understanding \u201cthat the plaintiffs have elected now to proceed only on the contract,\u201d to which the trial judge responded, \u201cIt is certainly the court\u2019s understanding.\u201d Mr. Youngblood then commented, \u201cThat does not mean, however, Your Honor, that we do not contend there was fraud involved in connection with the contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">The detailed findings of fact found untrue the essential allegations of the complaint with respect to (1) the existence of a contract, (2) plaintiff\u2019s reliance upon the alleged promises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>and representations, (3) the intent of the defendants to, deceive and defraud plaintiff, and (4). resultant' damage to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The essence of plaintiff\u2019s position on this appeal is that she is entitled to recover as a matter of law under the doctrine of promissory estoppel, and that the findings of fact of the trial court, insofar as they negate the essential elements of that doctrine, are without support in the evidence. Although it appears to us, from a review of the record, that appellant\u2019s theory of the case, as now advanced on this appeal, is substantially different from that presented by her in the trial court, we shall deal with her present contentions on their merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The doctrine of promissory estoppel is defined as follows in section 90 of the Restatement of Contracts: <em>\u201cA </em>promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance of a definite and substantial character on the part of the promisee and which does induce such action or forbearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise.\u201d This doctrine is recognized in California and has been applied in a variety of factual situations. <em>(Burlingame </em>v. <em>Rowland, </em>77 Cal. 315 [19 P. 526, 1 L.R.A. 829]; <em>Kinsell </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>18 Cal.App. 683 [124 P. 220] ; <em>Churchill </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>148 Cal. 1 [82 P. 440] ; <em>Carpy </em>v. <em>Dowdell, </em>115 Cal. 677 [47 P. 695] ; <em>Seymour </em>v. <em>Oelrichs, </em>156 Cal. 782 [106 P. 88, 134 Am.St.Rep. 154] ; <em>Wilk </em>v. <em>Vencill, </em>30 Cal.2d 104 [180 P.2d 351] <em>; Hunter </em>v. <em>Sparling, </em>87 Cal.App.2d 711 [197 P.2d 807].)</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">It is settled that the existence of an estoppel is a question of fact, unless but one inference can be drawn from the evidence. <em>(General Motors Acceptance Corp. </em>v. <em>Gandy, </em>200 Cal. 284 [253 P. 137] ; 18 Cal.Jur.2d 413.)  Basie elements of estoppel are reliance and injury. <em>(Estate of Jackson, </em>112 Cal.App.2d 16 [245 P.2d 684]; Pomeroy\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence, 5th ed., vol. III, p. 230, \u00a7 812; 18 Cal.Jur.2d 410, \u00a7 12.)  When, as in the instant case, the findings of fact of the trial court are attacked on the ground that they lack evidentiary support, the power of the appellate court begins and ends with the determination as to whether there is any substantial evidence to sustain the challenged findings <em>(Primm </em>v. <em>Primm, </em>46 Cal.2d 690, 693 [299 P.2d 231]).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">We conclude that the present record contains substantial evidence of facts and circumstances from which the trial court reasonably could infer and find that appellant did not suffer any substantial detriment as a result of re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>lianee upon any promise or representation by the defendant. In the first place, it is to be noted that during the course of the probate proceedings appellant signed an agreement for distribution which gave her property equal in value to that which she would have gotten by way of a successful contest.  Appellant testified that when this agreement was presented to her by defendant Pritchett for her signature she objected that \u201cit wasn\u2019t according to the way I had understood the distribution of the estate to be,\u201d but that she. signed the agreement in reliance upon Pritchett\u2019s assurance that \u201cfor record purposes it had to be that way\u201d and that Mrs. Weinman would return the assets to her after the estate was settled. Pritchett\u2019s version of the conversation was somewhat different. He testified that in response to appellant\u2019s statement that she understood she was to receive all the assets of the estate, he said, \u201cI do not know anything about that. You will have to get that information from Mrs. Weinman.\u201d Appellant\u2019s asserted reluctance to sign the agreement indicated recognition of the apparent inconsistency between the terms of the agreement and the terms of the alleged promise. The terms of the agreement and the fact that appellant signed it afforded the basis for an inference that appellant had not relied upon any inconsistent promises, representations, or understandings.  The trier of the facts is entitled to disbelieve all or any part of a witness\u2019 testimony, even though uncontradicted, if there is any rational ground for doing so. <em>(Hicks </em>v. <em>Reis, 21 </em>Cal.2d 654, 659 [134 P.2d 788]; <em>Blank </em>v. <em>Coffin, </em>20 Cal.2d 457, 461 [126 P.2d 868]; <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Abadjian, </em>30 Cal.2d 49, 53 [179 P.2d 804].) In these circumstances the trier of the facts was not bound to accept appellant\u2019s testimony as to her reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">But even if we could hold as a matter of law that appellant\u2019s reliance was conclusively established by her forbearance to contest the will, there would still remain the question of fact whether this forbearance resulted in any substantial detriment to appellant. Since appellant actually received property equal in value to that which she would have received either as a result of a successful will contest or through assertion of her unquestioned rights under section 70 of the Probate Code, it seems clear that the finding of the trial court that she suffered no detriment is substantially supported. Indeed, it appears that by the procedure followed appellant was saved the substantial costs, expenses, attorneys fees, delays and difficulties which a will contest would have entailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Appellant has argued that she suffered an additional detriment in that she failed to assert in the probate proceedings her right to a family allowance in reliance upon the so-called promise. The evidence does not compel a finding that she did so. The evidence is uncontradieted that there was no discussion of the subject of a family allowance between appellant and Mrs. Weinman or with Attorney Mergenthaler. Appellant\u2019s own testimony goes no further than to indicate that she was uninformed of her right to such an allowance. In short, the record does not establish as a matter of law that there was any such change of position on appellant\u2019s part as would call into play the doctrine which she now seeks to invoke.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Our conclusions, as above indicated, render it unnecessary for us to discuss respondent\u2019s further contentions: (1) that the so-called \u201cpromise\u201d constituted .nothing more than a declaration of intention to make a future gift; and (2) that the decree of distribution in the probate matter is res adjudicata. Appellant has not challenged the judgment insofar as it runs in favor of the defendants Mergenthaler and Pritchett.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">White, P. J., and Fourt, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b379-15\">Assigned by Chairman of Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
