(Bean), asserting that Bean was negligent in failing to advise him that his insurance policy excluded coverage for \u201cwrongful cutting.\u201d Peter Engel, whose tree was cut down, intervened and appeals the Trial Courtis <em>(T. Nadeau, </em>J.) order granting Bean\u2019s motion to dismiss. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-15\">Bean assisted Superior Tree in procuring an insurance policy. Superior Tree informed Bean that its business consisted of cutting trees and limbs on the property of third parties, and requested a policy that would provide \u201cfull coverage.\u201d Bean recommended a. bodily injury and property liability insurance policy issued by Nautilus Insurance Company (Nautilus), and Superior Tree purchased the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-16\">On October 2, 2000, Superior Tree wrongfully felled a tree on Engel\u2019s property. Superior Tree filed a notice of claim with Nautilus for the wrongful cutting. Nautilus denied Superior Tree\u2019s claim because the policy contained a clause excluding coverage for \u201cwrongful cutting.\u201d Engel filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>suit against Superior Tree; in turn, Superior Tree filed suit against Bean, asserting that Bean was negligent in failing to advise Superior Tree of the exclusion in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">In reviewing a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, we assume the truth of all facts alleged by the plaintiff and construe all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to him. <em>Graves v. Estabrook, </em>149 N.H. 202, 203 (2003). If the facts do not constitute a basis for legal relief, we will uphold the granting of the motion to dismiss. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">To recover for negligence, a plaintiff must demonstrate that there exists a duty, that the defendant breached that duty, and that the breach proximately caused injury to the plaintiff. <em>Dupont v. Aavid Thermal Technologies, </em>147 N.H. 706, 709 (2002). Thus, for liability to exist in this case, Engel must first show that Bean had an affirmative duty to provide advice regarding the adequacy of Superior Tree\u2019s particular insurance coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Engel argues that Bean was negligent when it recommended this insurance policy based upon Superior Tree\u2019s request for \u201cfull coverage,\u201d but failed to inform Superior Tree about the exclusion for \u201cwrongful cutting.\u201d Engel asserts that Superior Tree\u2019s request for \u201cfull coverage\u201d coupled with its explanation that the business \u201cinvolves the cutting and removal of trees from the properties of third parties,\u201d created a duty that Bean inform Superior Tree that the insurance policy contained an exclusion for \u201cwrongful cutting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Bean argues that there is no basis for legal relief because, under <em>Sintros v. Hamon, </em>an insurance agent does not have an affirmative duty to inform or to advise an insured regarding the availability or sufficiency of insurance coverage unless a special relationship exists between the agent and the policyholder. <em>See Sintros v. Hamon, </em>148 N.H. 478, 480 (2002). Additionally, Bean contends that Superior Tree\u2019s request for \u201cfull coverage\u201d was too vague and ambiguous to impose a duty upon Bean to procure an insurance policy that included coverage for \u201cwrongful cutting\u201d or to advise Superior Tree that the policy did not include such coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">We held in <em>Sintros </em>that an insurance agent owes clients a duty of reasonable care and diligence, but absent a special relationship, that duty does not include an affirmative, continuing obligation to inform or to advise an insured regarding the availability or sufficiency of insurance coverage. <em>Id. </em>at 482. Engel argues that Bean owed Superior Tree a duty to inform it of the exclusion for \u201cwrongful cutting.\u201d We have previously affirmed by order dated June 9, 2004, however, that the trial court properly ruled without a hearing that Superior Tree did not allege the recognized exception to the rule in <em>Sintros. </em>Because the writ of summons did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>allege a special relationship between Bean and Superior Tree, we affirmed that Bean did not owe Superior Tree any duty beyond that of reasonable care and diligence. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">In <em>Sintros </em>we recognized that because an insurance agent owes an insured a duty of reasonable care, he could- be liable for negligent misrepresentations or a failure to provide agreed-upon coverage. <em>Id. </em>at 483. Engel asserts that Bean negligently failed to provide agreed-upon coverage because Superior Tree requested \u201cfull coverage\u201d and received an inadequate policy. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">We have held that where a specific request is made for a particular type of insurance coverage, an insurance agent owes a duty to the insured to procure such coverage. <em>See Trefethen v. N.H. Ins. Group, </em>138 N.H. 710, 715 (1994) (a specific expectation of liquor liability coverage arose from the insured\u2019s request for coverage on every saleable item in the store coupled with the agent\u2019s knowledge that alcohol was one of those items); <em>Tyler Advertising Co. v. Lamprey, </em>107 N.H. 138, 143-44 (1966) (an insurance agent is not negligent in failing to procure a particular type of coverage where insured did not specifically request such coverage). Superior Tree\u2019s request for \u201cfu\u00edl coverage,\u201d however, was too broad and too vague to constitute a <em>specific request </em>for the particular coverage of \u201cwrongful cutting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">\u201cA request for \u2018full coverage,\u2019 \u2018the best policy,\u2019 or similar expressions does not place an insurance agent under a duty to determine the insured\u2019s full insurance needs, to advise the insured about coverage, or to use his discretion and expertise to determine what coverage the insured should purchase.\u201d <em>Trotter v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>377 S.E.2d 343, 347 (S.C. Ct. App. 1988); <em>cf. Boston Camp. Distrib. Co. v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., </em>282 N.E.2d 374, 376 (Mass. 1972) (insured\u2019s request for \u201cinsurance coverage from A to Z, second to none,\u201d did not make insurance agent liable when policy excluded a particular type of coverage); <em>Banes v. Martin, </em>965 S.W.2d 383, 385 (Mo. Ct. App. 1998) (insurance agent had no duty to advise insured of a particular type of coverage, despite insured\u2019s request for \u201cfull coverage\u201d). Imposing a duty to inform or to advise an insured regarding the sufficiency of insurance coverage based upon the general request for \u201cfull coverage\u201d would violate the policy concerns we expressed in <em>Sintros. See Sintros, </em>148 N.H. at 481. Any potential insured would be able to make one broad request for \u201cfull coverage\u201d and convert agents into risk managers with guarantor status; creating a duty to advise simply based upon the general request for \u201cfull coverage\u201d could afford insureds the opportunity to insure after the loss by merely asserting that they would have purchased the additional coverage had it been offered. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number><em>id. </em>Additionally, holding an insurance agent negligent for failing to advise an insured about every possible detail and exclusion in a policy whenever the general request for \u201cfull coverage\u201d is made would remove any burden from the insured to read and to determine the adequacy of his or her own insurance coverage. <em>See id. </em>at 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">Furthermore, although the factual circumstances surrounding the request for coverage are relevant, <em>see Trefethen, </em>138 N.H. at 715, Bean\u2019s knowledge concerning the basic operations of Superior Tree\u2019s business is insufficient to convert the general request for \u201cfull coverage\u201d into a specific request for particular coverage for \u201cwrongful cutting.\u201d <em>See Godbout v. Lloyd\u2019s Ins. Syndicates, </em>150 N.H. 103 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">An insured must make a <em>specific </em>request for a particular type of insurance coverage in order to impose a duty upon an agent to procure that particular coverage or to inform the insured that such coverage is excluded. We decline to impose a duty on insurance agents to know all an insured\u2019s needs, to procure suitable coverage, and to inform an insured of every facet of the coverage based only upon an insured\u2019s broad, general request for \u201cfull coverage.\u201d <em>Cf. Trefethen, </em>138 N.H. at 715. Because Superior Tree did not allege sufficient facts to demonstrate that Bean had a duty to inform or to advise Superior Tree regarding the exclusion of coverage for \u201cwrongful cutting,\u201d the trial court properly granted Bean\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b457-6\">Broderick, C.J., and Duggan, J., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
