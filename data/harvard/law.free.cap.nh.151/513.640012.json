B&amp;M argues on appeal that the trial court erred: (1) when it ruled that Sprague\u2019s commercial petroleum pipes may constitute \u201csuitable crossings or other facilities\u201d within the meaning of RSA 373:1 (1995); (2) when it implicitly ruled that RSA 373:1 requires a railroad to provide crossings or other facilities to benefit a private business that purchased property on both sides of a railroad line after the line was established; (3) by ruling that RSA 373:1 may create sufficient legal authority for the taking of railroad property; and (4) by failing to rule that any taking of B&amp;M\u2019s property by Sprague requires the payment of just compensation. For its part, Sprague argues on cross-appeal that the trial court erred: (1) in denying its motion for summary judgment and ruling that B&amp;M\u2019s claims regarding the removal of its railroad track by Sprague were governed by the twenty-year statute of limitations for the recovery of real estate under RSA 508:2 (1997); and (2) in ruling that Sprague\u2019s underground pipelines constitute an unreasonable use, and exceeded the scope, of Sprague\u2019s express easement granted in 1873 for a grade crossing. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The record supports the following facts. B&amp;M is a railroad company that owns a strip of real estate, known as the Newington Branch, which extends approximately 3.5 miles from Portsmouth to Newington and consists of railroad track, track bed and associated properties and structures. Sprague markets energy products, including gasoline, natural gas and oil. It owns property and related facilities along the Newington Branch, including petroleum holding tanks and pipelines at the Gosling Road Terminal, the Avery Lane Terminal and the River Road Terminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Between approximately 1950 and 2000, Sprague and its predecessors entered into several license agreements with B&amp;M for the use of B&amp;M\u2019s property for vehicle crossings, underground water and fuel pipes, fuel pipes over pipe bridges and a railroad side track. The agreements provided that they could be terminated at will by either party. Sprague\u2019s Avery Lane Terminal is a commercial fuel and petroleum facility with docks located on the Piscataqua River where Sprague receives gasoline, among other products, that is shipped by barge. The gasoline is unloaded and piped across Sprague\u2019s property to loading racks where it is loaded into trucks and delivered to service stations. Sprague\u2019s pipes run from the docks to the loading racks and pass beneath B&amp;M\u2019s Newington Branch. Sprague owns the property on both sides of the Newington Branch at its Avery Lane Terminal. The Newington Branch separates Sprague\u2019s docks and storage tanks from the Spaulding Turnpike.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">In January 2001, an internal review of B&amp;M properties suggested to B&amp;M management that Sprague had modified, installed, relocated or overburdened certain appurtenances on the Newington Branch in violation of the applicable license agreements. B&amp;M proceeded to terminate the agreements and offered to negotiate new arrangements with Sprague for any licenses it wanted to continue. When no new agreements were negotiated, B&amp;M filed suit seeking an injunction to prevent Sprague from any unlicensed and unauthorized occupation and use of B&amp;M\u2019s property, to require Sprague to remove certain appurtenances, and to require Sprague to replace and restore railroad track it had allegedly removed in violation of a 1973 deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">Sprague counterclaimed, seeking a declaration that RSA 373:1 imposed a duty upon B&amp;M to provide suitable crossings over and under its track for the accommodation of Sprague\u2019s pipelines and other facilities at the Avery Lane Terminal and a declaration that Sprague\u2019s easement for a vehicular grade crossing at Avery Lane also covered Sprague\u2019s seven underground pipes.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Following a four-day bench trial the court ruled, among other things, that the statutory purpose of RSA 373:1 is to aid landowners with land divided by a railroad and that the term \u201cfacilities\u201d may include underground pipes such as those at Avery Lane. The court also ruled that Sprague\u2019s seven underground pipes were not authorized by the grade crossing easement granted in 1873. The court agreed with B&amp;M that Sprague\u2019s removal of the railroad track was in violation of the 1973 deed and ordered Sprague to restore the track or compensate B&amp;M for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The.first issue we address is whether the trial court erred when it held that Sprague\u2019s commercial petroleum pipes may constitute \u201csuitable facilities\u201d within the meaning of RSA 373:1. This statute provides that \u201c[i]t shall be the duty of every railroad to provide ... suitable gates, crossings, cattle passes and other facilities for the accommodation of persons whose lands are divided, or are separated from a highway, by a railroad.\u201d RSA 371:1. B&amp;M argues that the statute delineates three specific \u201cfacilities\u201d that a railroad must provide to persons whose lands are separated from a highway by a rail line \u2014 gates, crossings and cattle passes \u2014 and that Sprague\u2019s underground pipes do not fit within any of those categories. Sprague argues that limiting RSA 373:1 as B&amp;M suggests would render the words \u201cother facilities\u201d meaningless and that the term is \u201ca catchall phrase that is intended to include various types of crossings, such as those that go over or under railroad tracks, which provides the statute with flexibility to change with changing circumstances and times.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">\u2022 \u201cIn matters of statutory interpretation, this court is the final arbiter of the legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>Nilsson v. Bierman, </em>150 N.H. 393, 395 (2003). \u201cWe begin by examining the language of the statute and ascribing the plain and ordinary meanings to the words the legislature used.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">\u201c[I]t is settled that a landowner whose land is cut off from a highway by a railroad has the right to a suitable crossing where a reasonable necessity therefor is demonstrated.\u201d <em>Patterson v. Boston &amp; Maine R.R., </em>102 N.H. 387, 389 (1960) (quotation and citation omitted). \u201c[A] suitable crossing is one reasonably safe and convenient for the purpose at a location to be determined according to the use made of the land, its physical characteristics, and the practicability and comparative expense of the different modes of crossing, whether by a bridge over the road, a crossing at grade, or a pass under it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). \u201cThe standard to be applied in determining the duty of a railroad under RSA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>371:1 is that of the reasonable necessity for a crossing----\u201d <em>Appeal of Meserve, </em>120 N.H. 461, 463 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">The trial court noted that the word \u201cpipe\u201d or \u201cpipeline\u201d is not technically included in the wording of RSA 373:1. Nevertheless, it interpreted \u201cthe broad terms \u2018suitable ... crossings ... and other facilities\u2019 to include pipelines that came into existence after 1852,\u201d when the statute was enacted. The trial court reasoned that \u201cRSA 371:l\u2019s spirit and intent is to allow a landowner access to their [sic] own property and the ... conclusion that the seven underground pipes may constitute a form of \u2018suitable crossings\u2019 and/or \u2018other facilities\u2019 is consistent with this intent.\u201d In reaching this conclusion, the trial court looked to uncontroverted testimony from a representative of the New Hampshire Department of Transportation, Bureau of Rail and Transit, that the term \u201cfacilities\u201d includes underground pipes. The court also relied upon evidence that for the past fifty years, B&amp;M has consistently referred to pipes as \u201cfacilities\u201d in its license agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">We hold that the general term \u201cother facilities\u201d as used in the statute encompasses underground pipes. <em>See Faulkner v. Keene, </em>85 N.H. 147, 158 (1931) (legislative enactments apply alike to persons, subjects and business -within their general purview and scope existent at the time of the enactments and to those coming into existence subsequent to their passage). The language of RSA 373:1 is straightforward and its intent is plain: to accommodate landowners whose property is divided or separated from a highway by a railroad. Here, Sprague\u2019s property is separated from the Spaulding Turnpike by B&amp;M\u2019s railroad, and its underground pipes constitute a suitable crossing that is reasonably necessary for the conduct of its business. We reject B&amp;M\u2019s argument that the provisions of RSA 373:1 do not apply because Sprague bought the property at issue after the railroad was already established. We fail to see a difference whether the property is separated from a highway by a railroad before or after its purchase. In either case, the statute\u2019s requirements apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">B&amp;M argues that the trial court erred by \u201cfailing to find\u201d that RSA 373:1 \u201cdoes not create sufficient legal authority for the taking of railroad property\u201d and \u201cby failing to rule\u201d that \u201cany taking of B&amp;M\u2019s property requires the payment of just compensation, which should be based on fair market value.\u201d Accordingly, B&amp;M argues that RSA 373:1 as applied by the trial court amounts to an unconstitutional taking for which B&amp;M is entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>to just compensation. We hold that this issue was not properly preserved for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">B&amp;M\u2019s complaint before the trial court sought: an injunction to prevent Sprague from any unlicensed and unauthorized occupation and use of B&amp;M\u2019s property; an order requiring Sprague to remove certain appurtenances; an order requiring Sprague to replace and restore railroad track it had allegedly removed in violation of a 1973 deed; and-damages for trespass, unjust enrichment and breach of contract. The complaint did not raise the issue of a taking of private property without just compensation or the constitutionality of RSA 373:1. During the four-day bench trial there was no argument presented concerning the constitutionality of the statute or any evidence submitted as to specific damages regarding valuation or fair market value. In addition, there is nothing in the record to indicate that this issue was raised in a motion for reconsideration following the trial court\u2019s order on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">B&amp;M made general reference to taking issues in four of its fifty-six requests for rulings of law. The court\u2019s order on the merits carefully and thoroughly addressed issues concerning termination of the license agreements, interpretation of the 1873 easement, application of RSA 373:1, operation of the 1973 deed, and damages. At the end of the order, the court stated that \u201c[bjoth parties here have submitted requests for findings of fact and rulings of law. The Court\u2019s findings and rulings are embodied in its narrative discussion above. Therefore, each party\u2019s requests are <em>GRANTED </em>to the extent that they are consistent with this order; otherwise, they are <em>DENIED.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Although B&amp;M\u2019s requests for rulings of law make broad passing reference to the prohibition against taking private property without just compensation, the record before us reveals that B&amp;M made no specific arguments to the trial court on this issue. Passing reference, otherwis\u00e9 ignored, does not preserve an issue on appeal. <em>See In re Estate of Leonard, </em>128 N.H. 407, 409 (1986); <em>N.H. Dep\u2019t of Corrections v. Butland, </em>147 N.H. 676, 679 (2002) (we will not review constitutional issues on appeal that were not presented below).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">Sprague argues that the trial court erred by ruling that its pipes were not a reasonable use of an express easement it was granted in 1873. The relevant portion of the so-called 1873 Rollins deed states that \u201csaid Railroad Company are [sic] to build and maintain a grade crossing near my house.\u201d The trial court concluded that Sprague\u2019s seven underground pipes at the Avery Lane grade crossing were not a reasonable use or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>extension of Sprague\u2019s express easement for the grade crossing granted pursuant to this deed. Sprague contends that its pipes underneath the railroad track are \u201csimply a reasonable and foreseeable extension of the scope of the original easement, in light of the industrial evolution of the surrounding property.\u201d We address this issue separately from the statutory analysis under RSA 373:1 in section II above. Sprague\u2019s statutory rights are independent of its rights under the easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\"> In determining permissible use of an easement, courts are guided by the principle of \u201creasonable use.\u201d <em>Downing House Realty v. Hampe, </em>127 N.H. 92, 96 (1985). An enlargement of use is permissible if \u201cthe change of a use is a normal development from conditions existing at the time of the grant, such as an increased volume of traffic.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Reasonable use is a question of fact for the trial court. <em>Id. </em>\u201cWe will not overturn the factual findings of the trial court... when they are supported by the evidence.\u201d <em>Arcidi v. Town of Rye, </em>150 N.H. 694, 702 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\"> The owner of an easement \u201ccannot materially increase the burden of it upon the servient estate, nor impose a new or additional burden thereon.\u201d <em>Crocker v. Canaan College, </em>110 N.H. 384, 387 (1970). \u201cThe test to determine the right to make a particular alteration is whether the alteration is so substantial as to result in the creation and substitution of a different servitude from that which previously existed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted); <em>see, e.g., Nadeau v. Town of Durham, </em>129 N.H. 663, 668 (1987) (reasonable use did not support expansion of right-of-way from serving two single-family dwellings and two small apartments to one serving fourteen housing units); <em>Delaney v. Gurrieri, </em>122 N.H. 819, 822 (1982) (reasonable use theory did not permit defendants to cut down two trees in easement to lake to allow boat to be hauled by vehicle rather than carried); <em>Crocker v. Canaan College, </em>110 N.H. at 387-88 (expansion of sewage easement to serve 200 college students and staff nine months per year instead of 35-guest inn two months per year properly enjoined).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">In its order, the trial court reasoned that \u201c[w]hen the easement in this case was conveyed and the uses authorized under it set forth, its use was intended to be incidental to residential or agricultural use.\u201d Noting that the area has been converted over time to commercial and industrial uses, the court nonetheless found that \u201cit was neither contemplated nor reasonably foreseeable that Rollins\u2019 successor in title would be an energy corporation, which would attempt to expand the use of the \u2018grade crossing\u2019 to include the installation of seven commercial underground fuel pipes. Such an enlargement of use certainly would work to unreasonably burden B&amp;M\u2019s property given the safety risks and potential liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>We uphold the trial court\u2019s decision. The court\u2019s finding that the easement for a grade crossing granted in 1873 would be unreasonably burdened- if it were extended to encompass seven underground, pipes carrying commercial gasoline is supported by the evidence. The change of use of the grade crossing by Sprague is not \u201ca normal development from conditions existing at the time of the grant.\u201d <em>Downing House Realty, </em>127 N.H. at 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">By deed dated December 18,1973, B&amp;M conveyed a 5.48 acre parcel of land located at the River Road Terminal to Sprague\u2019s predecessor-in-title. The deed provides in part: \u201cExcepting from this conveyance any and all tracks and sections of railroad track and railroad track materials located within the limits of the above-described parcel. Said conveyance is hereby made subject to the reserved right of the grantors, their successors, assigns and licensees, from time to time and at any and all times to use, operate, maintain, remove or retire in place all or any part of the railroad trackage and track materials located northwest of the area marked \u2018END OF TRACK\u2019on plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">In 1997 Sprague upgraded its River Road Terminal and removed about 375 feet of railroad track. B&amp;M sought an order requiring Sprague to replace the track or, in the alternative, compensate B&amp;M for the removal. Sprague filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that B&amp;M\u2019s claim was barred by the three-year statute of limitations for personal actions under RSA 508:4 because the alleged removal of the track occurred more than three years before the filing of the lawsuit. B&amp;M argued that Sprague\u2019s removal of the track is an assertion of ownership rights adverse to B&amp;M\u2019s deeded interest in land and that an action to enforce a right to ownership is governed by the statute of limitations for recovery of real estate, RSA 508:2.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">The Superior Court <em>(Hollman, </em>J.) ruled in favor of B&amp;M. The court\u2019s order states that \u201cB&amp;M has asserted sufficient facts ... to support its argument that Sprague\u2019s removal of B&amp;M\u2019s property is an \u2018assertion of ownership rights adverse to B&amp;M\u2019s interest in the land.\u2019 ... Because an assertion of ownership rights of property is governed by RSA 508:2 and not RSA 508:4, B&amp;M\u2019s claim regarding removal of the property falls within the twenty year statute of limitations time frame provided in that statute.\u201d On appeal, Sprague argues that the court\u2019s decision was erroneous because B&amp;M\u2019s claim is a personal action and thereby time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">\u201cWhen reviewing the denial of a motion for summary judgment, we consider the pleadings and any accompanying affidavits, and all proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>inferences drawn from them, in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Porter v. City of Manchester, </em>151 N.H. 30, 40 (2004). \u201cSummary judgment will be granted when there is no genuine issue of material fact to be decided, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">The 1973 deed clearly exempts from the conveyance all railroad track and track materials. B&amp;M alleged that removal of the track bed by Sprague \u201csignificantly hindered the Railroad\u2019s operations.\u201d We agree with the trial court that Sprague\u2019s removal of B&amp;M\u2019s track was a deliberate exercise of ownership rights adverse to B&amp;M\u2019s deeded interest in the land. Railroad track installed upon the railroad\u2019s land that is integral to the railroad\u2019s successful operation becomes a part of the property. <em>Thompson v. Valley Railroad Co., </em>32 U.S. 68, 74-75 (1889). B&amp;M\u2019s action is one to enforce a right to ownership in real property, and therefore the twenty-year limitations period set forth in RSA 508:2 applies. <em>See Hewes v. Bruno, </em>121 N.H. 32, 34 (1981). Because this evidence discloses no genuine issue of material fact and B&amp;M is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, we affirm the denial of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b569-6\">Nadeau, Dalianis, Duggan and Galway, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
