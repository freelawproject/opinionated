Douglas King, appeals an order of the Hillsborough County Probate Court <em>(Cassavechia, </em>J.) declaring the decedent to be intestate because the petitioner failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the decedent\u2019s will was more likely lost than destroyed. The petitioner also appeals the award of attorney\u2019s fees. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-11\">This case is before us again after remand. <em>See In re Estate of King, </em>149 N.H. 226 (2003) <em>(King </em>I). We recite only a brief history of facts necessary to decide this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-12\">In 1994, the decedent, J. Douglas King (hereafter, Douglas), executed a will that left his estate to the petitioner, his second -wife of fifteen years, with whom he had two minor children. In 1997, Douglas executed a codicil to the will. The codicil made no substantive changes to the will, but merely altered provisions for appointing the executor and trustees, and otherwise reconfirmed the 1994 will.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-13\">Douglas died suddenly and unexpectedly in a motorcycle accident on September 10, 2000. <em>Id. </em>at 228. The original 1994 will, last known to be in Douglas\u2019 possession, was never found. <em>Id. </em>Instead, the petitioner obtained the 1997 original codicil and a copy of the 1994 will and filed them with the probate court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-14\">The respondents, Rebecca King Felmet, Rachel King and Jason King, are Douglas\u2019 three adult children from a previous marriage. <em>Id. </em>They contested the documents filed by the petitioner, arguing that the 1994 will had been revoked. <em>Id. </em>The probate court applied a presumption of revocation, conducted an evidentiary hearing to determine the likely fate of the will and ruled that the petitioner failed to rebut the presumption of revocation. <em>Id. </em>at 228-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>In <em>King </em>7, the petitioner challenged, among other things, the probate court\u2019s application of the presumption of revocation. <em>Id. </em>at 230. We reversed and remanded because the probate court used an incorrect legal standard for the presumption, admitted improper hearsay evidence and did not consider certain testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 232. On remand, we instructed the probate court to: (1) not apply the presumption of revocation because it had vanished; (2) re-evaluate and make specific findings on the credibility of certain testimony; (3) exclude specific hearsay evidence; and (4) determine whether the petitioner established by a preponderance of the evidence that the will was more likely lost than destroyed. <em>Id. </em>at 233-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">In accordance with our instructions, the probate court did not apply the presumption of revocation, reconsidered the evidence and made the following relevant factual findings. Douglas and the petitioner had a \u201cstormy\u201d marriage. Their relationship, although generally loving, was oftentimes \u201crocky and troubled.\u201d On two occasions, divorce was contemplated and legal counsel secured. The relationship between Douglas and the petitioner became so estranged in the last year of his life that, in contemplation of divorce, they began to divide their assets. About two months before Douglas\u2019 death, they reconciled for a brief period. On September 2, 2000, one week before Douglas\u2019 death, they had another \u201cblowout.\u201d After this fight, Douglas wrote a missive to himself lamenting that his \u201clife ha[d] come to an end.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The court then re-evaluated the testimony and made specific findings on the credibility of the testimony of two witnesses, John Zelonis and Donna Stafford, both of whom supported the petitioner\u2019s position that the will was lost and not revoked. With regard to Zelonis\u2019 testimony, the court found that it \u201ccarrie[d] little weight given its internal inconsistencies.\u201d As for Stafford\u2019s testimony, the court found that it was \u201cstrained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">In summary, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">[T]he evidence suggests that the decedent had become dissatisfied with his 1994 estate plan during the last year of his life. The evidence also shows that the relationship between the decedent and his family changed to such an extent during his last year that it is more likely that he revoked the 1994 will. He was clearly engaging people in conversations about how to include his adult children in his estate plan____His relationship with his wife was also clearly in trouble, if not nearing an end. He had even begun to divide their mutual property. He felt that [the petitioner] was unkind and disrespectful to him. He also felt that his younger children were disrespectful towards him. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>expressed sentiments such as feeling belittled by [the petitioner]. and his younger children. Finally, [the petitioner] remembered moving the couple\u2019s important papers____She also recalled that their wills were contained in blue envelopes and had been filed together. However, when she looked for the decedent\u2019s will, she could only find the empty envelope.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Based upon these findings, the probate court ruled that the petitioner failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the will was more likely lost than destroyed. Accordingly, the probate court did not admit the copy of the will to probate and ordered distribution of the estate in accordance with the laws of intestacy. <em>See </em>RSA 561:1 (Supp. 2003). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">\n<em>I. Presumption of revocation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">First, the petitioner argues that the probate court erred because it applied the presumption of revocation which was contrary to our instruction in <em>King I. </em>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">The petitioner\u2019s argument hinges on the probate court\u2019s statement that the petitioner \u201chas failed to rebut the presumption of revocation.\u201d Although this statement read in isolation appears to be contrary to our instruction in <em>King I, </em>a review of the whole order makes it clear that the probate court did not apply the presumption of revocation. The probate court\u2019s order subsequently acknowledged that \u201cthe presumption of revocation \u2018vanished\u2019\u201d and that it was \u201cto determine whether [the petitioner] has proven by a preponderance of the whole of the evidence that the will was more likely lost rather than destroyed.\u201d After reviewing the evidence, the probate court concluded: \u201cIt is simply not likely that the will was lost in light of all of this evidence. It is more likely than not that the decedent destroyed the will____\u201d Based upon a review of the order in its entirety, we conclude that the probate court applied the correct standard on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-13\">\n<em>II. Sufficiency of evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b476-14\">Next, the petitioner argues that the probate court erred in finding that she failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the will was more likely lost than destroyed. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-15\">We will not disturb the probate court\u2019s decree unless it is unsupported by the evidence or plainly erroneous as a matter of law. RSA 567-A:4 (1997); <em>In re Estate of Locke, </em>148 N.H. 754, 755 (2002). We review the record of the proceedings before the probate court to determine if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>findings, as made by the probate judge, could be reasonably made, given the testimony presented. <em>In re Buttrick, </em>134 N.H. 675, 676 (1991). In reviewing this record, we are guided by the rule that \u201cthe trier of fact is in the best position to measure the persuasiveness and credibility of evidence and is not compelled to believe even uncontroverted evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted). Thus, we defer to the trial court\u2019s judgment on such issues as resolving conflicts in the testimony, measuring the credibility of witnesses, and determining the weight to be given evidence. <em>Cook v. Sullivan, </em>149 N.H. 774, 780 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">A review of the record reveals the following evidence, which is sufficient to sustain the probate court\u2019s ruling that it was \u201csimply not likely that the will was lost\u201d and \u201cmore likely than not that the decedent destroyed the will in an effort to promote equality between [sic] his children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">\n<em>A. Evidence will was lost</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">The evidence adduced at trial that the will was lost, and not revoked, is found in the testimony of Zelonis and Stafford. The probate court, after assessing the credibility of these witnesses, gave their testimony little weight. Witness credibility is a finding of fact and will not be overturned unless clearly erroneous or unsupported by the evidence. <em>Red Hill Outing Club v. Hammond, </em>143 N.H. 284, 290 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">In evaluating the credibility of Zelonis, the probate court found that his testimony was not \u201cparticularly helpful\u201d because the only comment Douglas made to Zelonis regarding his estate was \u201can off-handed \u2018joking\u2019 comment.\u201d Zelonis testified that, on August 31,2000, when he was going to have a shoulder operation, Douglas was being \u201ca prankster\u201d and asked \u201cif I had my will put together and if I was leaving him everything.\u201d Zelonis testified that he responded by saying, \u201cWhat difference does that make, I\u2019m not worth anything____But seriously, what about you Doug? What would happen if you died tomorrow.\u201d Zelonis then testified that Douglas said his affairs had been in order for years.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">The probate court also gave Zelonis\u2019 testimony \u201clittle weight given its internal inconsistencies.\u201d One such inconsistency involved Zelonis\u2019 testimony about the relationship between Douglas and the petitioner. First, Zelonis testified that Douglas was planning a second honeymoon with the petitioner. At another point, Zelonis testified to another conversation in which Douglas asked Zelonis to locate a property appraiser to appraise all the properties because he wanted \u201cto make a financial division between [the petitioner] and [himself].\u201d Based upon a review of the record, we hold that the findings of the probate court as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>the credibility and weight of Zelonis\u2019 testimony are not clearly erroneous or unsupported by the evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">In evaluating the credibility of Stafford, the probate court found that her testimony was \u201cstrained.\u201d First, her testimony regarding Douglas\u2019 relationship with his adult children \u201ccontradicted all of the other evidence.\u201d Stafford testified that Douglas referred to his adult children as \u201cdark shadows\u201d and \u201cdark forces\u201d in his life and that he did not have a close relationship with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">In contrast, the petitioner testified that Douglas always had a close relationship with his adult daughters. Douglas\u2019 close friend and Donna Stafford\u2019s husband, Robert Stafford, testified that Douglas was proud of his adult children and that Douglas\u2019 recent bonding with Jason was a \u201chappy experience.\u201d Another close family friend testified that Douglas had a good relationship with his adult children and always spoke positively of them. Finally, all three adult children testified that they had a close, loving relationship with their father.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Second, Stafford testified that Douglas told her \u201cthat he had prepared his will, that he had left everything to [the petitioner]... and he knew that she would take care of all of his children.\u201d The petitioner, on the other hand, testified that Douglas had never discussed providing for his three adult children after his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">Third, Stafford testified that Douglas called her and was joking and laughing about the fight he had with the petitioner on September 2, 2000, the week before his death. Stafford described the conversation as follows: \u201c[The petitioner] had refused to go out to breakfast because he had invited Jason, his son, and that she had thrown the diamond that he had bought her, and he laughed.\u201d In contrast, Douglas\u2019 diary entries following the fight lamented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-9\">[E]motionally and psychologically, I feel at this moment ... heaviness and sadness. In the last [twelve] months I have felt like a dog penned up in a narrow crate, opposed by the vague sense of impending calamity, surrounded by throngs of heartless people, jeering and poking psychological sticks of fear and torment through the slats.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-10\">Emotionally and psychologically speaking, I\u2019ve been repeatedly thrown down, choked, laughed at, clubbed, whipped, slapped at, and scorned. Any achievement or conduct deserving of merit has been rewarded not with kindness but merely the withholding of another blow.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Earlier this morning, my wife and children walked out again. Why? Because I invited my son from [a] previous marriage to have breakfast with us. She returned, once again, her wedding band and diamonds, and once again the children sided with her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\">I feel as though I am unable to write another word, walk another step, or breathe another breath. I feel as though finally my life has come to an end. However, I must be strong for myself, my children, and for those I may be able to assist in the future who have fallen upon the same hopeless times as I.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The diary entry concluded with: \u201cPriorities: Mental, physical and spiritual well-being for: Myself... Children... Laurel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Finally, the probate court also stated that \u201cStafford\u2019s memory may have ... been jaded by her new close relationship with [the petitioner].\u201d Stafford testified that she was \u201ca good friend\u201d of the petitioner. Stafford also acknowledged that she had hugged the petitioner when she arrived at the probate court to testify. Based upon a review of the record, we hold that the findings of the probate court as to the credibility and weight of Stafford\u2019s testimony are not clearly erroneous or unsupported by the evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">\n<em>B. Evidence will was revoked</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">The evidence adduced at trial that the will was revoked included: (1) testimony that the relationship between Douglas and his family changed during the last year of his life; (2) testimony that Douglas became dissatisfied with his 1994 estate plan during the last year of his life because it did not benefit all of his children; and (3) the original will was last in Douglas\u2019 possession and has not been located.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">First, the probate court found that \u201cthe relationship between the decedent and his family changed to such an extent during his last year that it is more likely that he revoked the 1994 will.\u201d The petitioner testified that, during the last year of his life, Douglas thought his younger children were disrespectful of him and, in a letter dated June 12, 2000, he stated that the younger children had \u201csubjected [him] to a humiliating and disdainful disrespect over the last several months.\u201d The petitioner also testified that, during that same time, Douglas thought he was disrespected by the petitioner and in a letter to her dated June 15, 2000, stated that he would \u201cnot allow [himself] to be lowered or berated any more.\u201d Finally, the petitioner testified that, during the last year of Douglas\u2019 life, they had several \u201cblowout[s],\u201d were physically separated on several occasions, were considering a separation as late as the summer of 2000, and undertook to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>divide their assets, live at separate residences and auction off their other property.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">While Douglas\u2019 relationship with the petitioner and their children was deteriorating, his relationship with his adult daughters remained strong. In addition, during the last year of his life, Douglas\u2019 relationship with his son, Jason, was improving and growing closer.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Second, the probate court found that \u201cthe evidence suggests that the decedent had become dissatisfied with his 1994 estate plan during the last year of his life.\u201d Submitted into evidence was a 1997 letter from Attorney Ellen Peterson, the scrivener of the 1997 codicil, to Douglas and the petitioner, outlining various estate planning options that were available. The letter stated that Douglas and the petitioner had expressed their estate planning objectives to include \u201cprovid[ing] for the comfort and well-being of the survivor of [them], while protecting [their] assets with the ultimate goal of benefiting [their] children.\u201d In 1999, the objective of providing for the children was again discussed with Attorney Douglas Hatfield. In a letter to Douglas detailing their discussions, Hatfield stated that one of the potential goals of the estate planning was to \u201cprovide separate trusts for Doug\u2019s family and grandchildren.\u201d According to Hatfield, Douglas considered the 1994 will to be \u201ctemporary\u201d and \u201ca \u2018band-aid\u2019 until he could do something else.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Third, the probate court found that Douglas retained the original 1994 will, which the petitioner has been unable to locate. The petitioner testified that she and Douglas kept their original 1994 wills. The wills were kept in Douglas\u2019 office in their home in Charlotte, North Carolina. When they moved to Marblehead, Massachusetts, the original wills were placed in Douglas\u2019 home office because it was a \u201csafe place\u201d where they \u201cwould not be lost or misplaced.\u201d The petitioner testified that, in the course of many moves, she had moved files of important documents, which included two blue envelopes that she believed contained their original wills. Since Douglas\u2019 death, however, the petitioner has been unable to locate Douglas\u2019 original 1994 will.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">We acknowledge that the facts of this case do not overwhelmingly dictate a particular result. Nevertheless, because a reasonable person could decide as did the probate court based upon the evidence, we defer to the probate court\u2019s findings. <em>Cook, </em>149 N.H. at 780. Accordingly, based upon a review of the record, we hold that the probate court\u2019s finding that the petitioner failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the will was more likely lost than destroyed is not plainly erroneous and could be reasonably made. <em>See </em>RSA 567-A:4.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>\n<em>III. Attorney\u2019s fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Finally, the petitioner argues that the probate court erred in finding that the estate is responsible for the respondents\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">On January 17, 2002, the respondents filed a motion requesting an award of attorney\u2019s fees. The petitioner objected, but later withdrew her objection. On June 6, 2002, the probate court granted the motion for attorney\u2019s fees without objection. The petitioner reimbursed the respondents\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees until March 6, 2003, the date we issued our decision in <em>King I. </em>After that date, the petitioner stopped paying the respondents\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees. On October 1, 2003, the respondents filed a motion to enforce the June 6, 2002 order awarding attorney\u2019s fees. On December 19, 2003, over the petitioner\u2019s objection, the probate court granted the respondents\u2019 motion and conditioned future reimbursement of attorney\u2019s fees on the permission of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">We must first address the timeliness issue raised by the respondents. The respondents argue that the petitioner failed to file a timely notice of appeal for the award of attorney\u2019s fees. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">On December 24, 2003, the petitioner appealed the probate court\u2019s November 24, 2003 order and raised the sufficiency of the evidence issue. This notice of appeal was timely filed within the thirty days allowed by Supreme Court Rule 7. On January 29, 2004, the petitioner filed a motion to add a question to her notice of appeal. The petitioner sought to raise the issue of the award of attorney\u2019s fees, which was the subject of the probate court\u2019s December 19, 2003 order. The motion was timely filed within twenty days prior to the due date of the petitioner\u2019s brief. <em>See </em>SUP. Ct. R. 16(3)(b). Accordingly, we reject the respondents\u2019 argument that the attorney\u2019s fees issue was not timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">The respondents next argue that the issue is not preserved because the petitioner withdrew her initial objection to the motion for attorney\u2019s fees. We agree that the initial award of attorney\u2019s fees is not preserved for appellate review. <em>See Lamontagne Builders v. Bowman Brook Purchase Group, </em>150 N.H. 270, 274 (2003). We conclude, however, that the December 19, 2003 award of attorney\u2019s fees is preserved because the petitioner objected to the respondent\u2019s motion to enforce the award of attorney\u2019s fees. Accordingly, the probate court\u2019s order awarding attorney\u2019s fees accrued since March 6,2003 is preserved for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">Having found that the December 19, 2003 order for attorney\u2019s fees is preserved, we next consider whether the award was proper. \u201cNew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Hampshire has no statute which compels or governs the allowance of [attorney\u2019s] fees in will contests. Attorney\u2019s fees are not allowed as a matter of right, and the general common law rule operates to deny them in the usual circumstance.\u201d 10 C. DEGRANDPRE, New HAMPSHIRE Practice: Probate Law and Procedure \u00a7 44-7, at 511 (3d ed. 2001); <em>see Concord Nat. Bank v. Haverhill, </em>101 N.H. 416, 417-19 (1958). Nevertheless, we have held that \u201c[attorney\u2019s] fees should be allowed only in those cases where the litigation is conducted in good faith for the primary benefit of the trust as a whole in relation to substantial and material issues essential to the proper administration of the trust.\u201d <em>In re Dumaine, </em>135 N.H. 103, 110 (1991) (quotation omitted). However, \u201c[w]here the parties seeking fees take positions to defeat a trust (or will), they are not entitled to an allowance of fees out of the trust property.\u201d DEGRANDPRE, <em>supra </em>at 511-12. Thus, the inquiry is whether the respondents\u2019 primary motive was to benefit the estate as a whole or themselves. <em>See Dumaine, </em>135 N.H. at 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Here, the respondents were seeking to defeat a will offered for probate that excluded them as beneficiaries. If the respondents defeated the will, they would benefit from the estate passing according to the intestacy statute. We thus conclude that the respondents challenged the will for their own benefit and not for that of either the estate or the court. <em>See Murray v. Peabody, </em>106 N.H. 319, 329 (1965). Accordingly, the trial court erred in awarding attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">\n<em>Affirmed in part; reversed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"Afl\">Broderick, C.J., and Nadeau, Dalianis and Galway, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
