Whitney. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-14\">The parties were married in Texas in 1991. In early 1995, they adopted two children, brothers, ages seven and five. The children were deemed \u201chard to place\u201d due to their ages, sibling relationship, and status as members of a minority race. Because Texas determined that the children could not be placed for adoption with suitable adoptive parents without the provision of adoption assistance, <em>see </em>Tex. Fam. Code. Ann. \u00a7 162.801 (2002), Texas provided, and continues to provide, an adoption subsidy, currently $1064.00 per month, which is renewed on a year-to-year basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-15\">The parties moved to New Hampshire where they were divorced in 1997. The petitioner initially had sole physical custody of the children; however, the respondent assumed physical custody in 1999 because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>petitioner had difficulty controlling them. At the time of the divorce, the respondent was managing a successful business, while the petitioner made substantially less income. Nonetheless, the parties agreed that because of the \u201cadoption subsidy,\u201d the respondent would contribute no child support to the petitioner. Later, when the respondent assumed custody of the children, the parties continued to agree that the custodial parent receive no child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">In 2000, the respondent\u2019s business failed and he declared bankruptcy. By then, the petitioner was attending law school. In 2001, the respondent filed a petition to modify child support, and the court ordered the petitioner to pay the statutory minimum of $50.00 per month in child support, subject to review upon her anticipated graduation from law school. When the petitioner graduated from law school, the court ordered her to pay child support in the amount of $185.00 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">In making its order, the court concluded that the \u201cadoption subsidy\u201d would not count as a set-off against the non-custodial parent\u2019s child support obligation, nor suffice as a reason to deviate from the guidelines. The court reasoned that the \u201cpurpose of the subsidy was not to benefit a non-custodial parent, but was to provide a custodial parent with an incentive to provide ongoing care for hard-to-place children and to assist with costs associated with raising adopted children.\u201d Thus, the court included the adoption subsidy as gross income to the respondent when it calculated the petitioner\u2019s support under the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The petitioner appeals, arguing that RSA chapter 458-C mandates that the court grant her a credit for the adoption subsidy, or, alternatively, that the court should deviate from the guidelines. <em>See </em>RSA ch. 458-C (Supp. 2003). She also argues that the specific purpose of the adoption agreements was to provide support for the child, thus relieving her of her child support obligation. Finally, she contests the trial court\u2019s failure to deviate from the guidelines in light of her student loans and the respondent\u2019s alleged underemployment. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">The petitioner argues that the adoption subsidy should be credited toward her child support obligation. She contends that because her child support obligation is approximately $801.00 per month, and the adoption subsidy is $1064.00 per month, she should pay no child support. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">In cases of statutory interpretation, we are the final arbiter of the legislature\u2019s intent as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole. <em>State v. McCarthy, </em>150 N.H. 389, 390 (2003). We ascribe to statutory words and phrases their usual and common meaning, unless the statute itself suggests otherwise. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>Our first task is to determine how to treat adoption subsidies under our Child Support Guidelines. Adoption subsidies are \u201cprovided as part of a joint federal and state plan to promote and subsidize the adoption of children with special needs.\u201d <em>Hamblen v. Hamblen, </em>54 P.3d 371, 373 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2002). The federal plan, passed in 1980 as part of the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act, provides federal reimbursements to States that pay benefits to parents who adopt children with special needs. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 670 <em>et seq. </em>(2000); <em>see Hamblen, </em>54 P.3d at 373. \u201cEvery state now.has an adoption assistance program.\u201d <em>Hamblen, </em>54 P.3d at 373; <em>see also </em>Tex. Fam. Code. Ann. \u00a7 162.301; RSA ch. 170-F (2002); <em>In re Darien S., </em>842 A.2d 1177, 1182 n. 7 (Conn. Ct. App. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">We recognize that a few intermediate appellate courts have determined, under their respective child support guidelines, that adoption subsidies qualify as income to the child. None of these cases, however, were decided under RSA chapter 458-C, the New Hampshire Child Support Guidelines, and each of them involve statutes different from our statute. <em>See In re Marriage of Newberry, </em>805 N.E.2d 640, 643 (Ill. Ct. App. 2004); <em>Strandberg v. Strandberg, </em>664 N.W.2d 887, 889-90 (Minn. Ct. App. 2003); <em>Hamblen, </em>54 P.3d at 374-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">We hold that adoption subsidies qualify as gross income under RSA chapter 458-C and, thus, affirm the master\u2019s ruling below. \u201cGross income\u201d is broadly defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-6\">all income from any source, whether earned or unearned, including ... wages, salary ... social security benefits, trust income ... and payments from other government programs (except public assistance programs, including aid to families with dependent children, aid to the permanently and totally disabled, supplemental security income, food stamps, and general assistance received from a county or town)----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">RSA 458-C:2, IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">While there is no specific provision for adoption subsidies, the legislature does provide for the inclusion of \u201cother government programs\u201d within the definition of gross income, so long as those programs are not \u201cpublic assistance programs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cPublic assistance programs\u201d are not defined, for the purposes of RSA chapter 458-C, but the legislature does provide examples of such programs. In each instance, eligibility for \u201cpublic assistance programs\u201d is determined by a showing of economic need. <em>See </em>RSA 167:4,1 (2002) (persons eligible to receive food stamps if they do not have \u201csufficient income or other resources to provide a reasonable subsistence compatible with decency and health\u201d); RSA 165:l-a, :l-c (2002) (general assistance from a county or town provided to any person \u201cwho is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>poor and unable to support himself\u2019); RSA 167:5,1 (2002) (aid to families with dependent children and aid to the permanently and totally disabled granted upon a showing of need); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382(a)(1), (c)(1) (2000) (Supplemental Security Income provides a minimum income for disabled people based upon need). We infer, based upon the legislature\u2019s intent as expressed in RSA 458-C:3, IV (obligor parent not required to pay child support when such order would put the parent below the self-support reserve) and from the nature of the listed programs, that the legislature\u2019s intent in excluding these and other such public assistance programs from inclusion in the definition of gross income was to assure that obligor parents and their families would not be forced into extreme poverty in order to pay child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">Adoption assistance programs, unlike other public assistance programs, are not based upon adoptive parents\u2019 levels of income; instead, the use of a \u201cmeans test\u201d is \u201cprohibited in the process of selecting a suitable adoptive family, or in negotiating an adoption assistance agreement, including the amount of the adoption assistance payment.\u201d Child Welfare Policy Manual \u00a7 8.2A.2 (September 24, 2001) (citing U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health and Human Services Policy Announcement ACYFCB-PA-01-01 (January 23, 2001)); <em>see </em>45 CFR \u00a7 1356.40(c). The principle of <em>ejusdem generis </em>provides that, where specific words in a statute follow general ones, the general words are construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those enumerated by the specific words. <em>State v. Meaney, </em>134 N.H. 741, 744 (1991). Because the adoption assistance program is not similar in nature to the programs described as \u201cpublic assistance programs\u201d in RSA 458-C:2, IV, we conclude that an adoption subsidy should be included in the calculation of gross income as an \u201cother government program.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Adoption assistance programs qualify as gross income because they provide a financial incentive to people who adopt \u201cspecial needs\u201d children. These increased costs include not only the special needs of the child, but also the circumstances of the adopting parents, such as \u201cthe family\u2019s capacity to incorporate the child into their household in relation to their lifestyle, standard of living and future plans, as well as their overall capacity to meet the immediate and future needs (including education) of the child.\u201d Child Welfare Policy Manual, <em>supra. </em>Forcing a custodial parent to accept the adoption assistance payment as a substitute for the non-custodial parent\u2019s child support would negate the supplementary effect of the adoption subsidy because it would transform the adoption subsidy into the exclusive means of support and disregard the increased costs associated with the care of \u201cspecial needs\u201d children. Similarly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>allowing the petitioner to credit the adoption subsidy against her child support payment would be against the interests of the adopted children because it would diminish the resources deemed necessary for the care and incorporation of these \u201cspecial needs\u201d children.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">The petitioner argues, in the alternative, that the adoption assistance payments should constitute a special circumstance that justifies a downward deviation from the support guidelines. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The master\u2019s determination of an award of child support will not be set aside absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>Wheaton-Dunberger v. Dunberger, </em>137 N.H. 504, 507 (1993); <em>cf. State v. Lambert, </em>147 N.H. 295, 296 (2001) (explaining unsustainable exercise of discretion standard). The master\u2019s discretion to award support differing from the prescribed formulas is limited to situations in which the master finds special circumstances. <em>Wheaton-Dunberger, </em>137 N.H. at 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Adoption assistance payments do not, in and of themselves, justify a deviation from the child support guidelines. The actual amount received under the adoption assistance agreement is an issue decided between the adoptive parents and the State of Texas. We find that the trial court\u2019s decision not to deviate from the guidelines because of the adoption subsidy was a sustainable exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Finally, the petitioner argues that the specific language of two, among the many, adoption assistance agreements demonstrates that the adoption assistance payments are for the same purpose as child support payments and-that her payments would be duplicative.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">While the 1997-1998 adoption subsidy agreement states that the subsidy is for \u201cfood, clothing and shelter\u201d and the 1995-1996 subsidy agreement states that it' is for \u201ccare and support,\u201d neither agreement states that it provides the exclusive resource for the care of the children. Instead, both agreements state, \u201c[T]he assistance is for the purpose of <em>assisting </em>with care and services needed by the child.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Therefore, we disagree with the petitioner\u2019s contention that the adoption assistance agreements were intended to provide the only resource necessary to support the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">The petitioner next challenges the trial court\u2019s failure to deviate from the guidelines because: (1) she is responsible for repaying her student loans; and (2) the respondent was allegedly voluntarily underemployed.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">The petitioner first argues that the court should have deviated from the child support guidelines pursuant to RSA 458-C:5,1(a) and (j) because of her expenses related to paying her student loans. We note that RSA 458-C:5, 1(a) relates to educational expenses concerning the child, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>educational expenses of the parent. The record indicates that she paid no child support at the beginning of law school, and the minimum amount of child support, fifty dollars per month, at the end; thus, she received the benefit of a minimal child support order for three years. We conclude that although the petitioner may have expenses related to her student loans, this was considered by the master. In light of all the relevant circumstances, the decision not to deviate from the guidelines pursuant to RSA 458-C:5,1(j) was a sustainable exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">We do not find the petitioner\u2019s arguments concerning the respondent\u2019s alleged voluntary underemployment persuasive either. RSA 458-C:2, IV(a) states that a court, \u201cin its discretion, may consider as gross income the difference between the amount a parent is earning and the amount a parent has earned in cases where the parent voluntarily becomes unemployed or underemployed.\u201d The petitioner points to evidence that the respondent was not employed full-time, has a college degree, and is licensed to sell real estate, but works only part-time as a substitute teacher.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The respondent presented evidence, however, that he had previously been the owner of a convenience store, but had gone bankrupt. He is currently attempting to pursue a career in real estate, although he has not yet sold a house. The record reflects that the respondent spends a great deal of time caring for the younger of the two adopted children, which affects his ability to spend time earning other income. Based upon the evidence, we cannot say that the court\u2019s decision not to find the respondent voluntarily underemployed was an unsustainable exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Although the petitioner makes additional arguments to deviate from the child support guidelines, we find that those arguments are unpersuasive and warrant no further discussion. <em>See Vogel v. Vogel, </em>137 N.H. 321, 322 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b261-8\">Broderick, C.J., and Nadeau, Duggan and Galway, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
