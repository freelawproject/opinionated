He brings this interlocutory appeal from an order of the Superior Court <em>(Mangones, </em>J.) directing his counsel to provide \u201ctutelage in the law\u201d to render him competent to stand trial. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>Dr. James Adams, chief forensic psychiatrist for the department of corrections, evaluated the defendant and concluded that he was not competent to stand trial. It was determined that he suffered from borderline intellectual functioning, a variety of learning disabilities and defects in expressive language, and illiteracy. Dr. Adams reported that the defendant had deficits in his ability to testify, to undergo cross-examination and to withstand the interpersonal pressures related to the trial process. As the trial court\u2019s order states, the defendant was \u201cvery inarticulate and require[d] considerable effort at times to elicit the information he knows in the face of his communications defects.\u201d In addition, the order states that the defendant was \u201cprone to give up on expressing himself accurately or demanding a clear understanding of what is asked and to in fact give facile answers which are not necessarily accurate or truly responsive.\u201d Although Dr. Adams concluded that the defendant\u2019s borderline intellectual functioning and learning difficulties were likely congenital and that he demonstrated little prospect for fundamental change in his mental state, he testified that \u201cit is likely\u201d that the defendant could be rendered competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The trial court ruled that the defendant was not competent to stand trial but that there was a reasonable probability that his competence could be restored \u201cwith appropriate services of legal counsel.\u201d Consequently, the court ordered the defendant\u2019s attorneys to \u201cprovide duly diligent defense services, within legal and ethical standards, in terms of trial preparation and explanation\u201d and that the defendant be re-evaluated for competency \u201cjust prior to trial.\u201d Defense counsel subsequently spent several weeks attempting to \u201ceducate\u201d the defendant. Concluding that their efforts were unsuccessful, defense counsel moved to dismiss the indictments without prejudice. The trial court then ordered the defendant to undergo a followup competency exam with Dr. Adams. Defense counsel objected, arguing that the competency statute did not authorize referral to Dr. Adams, who was not the \u201ctreating psychiatrist.\u201d The trial court agreed to stay the evaluation pending the outcome of this interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">The defendant argues that the trial court should have dismissed the indictments because it found him incompetent to stand trial but did not order him to undergo psychiatric treatment. The defendant contends that the competency statute, RSA 135:17-a (Supp. 2003), \u201conly permits the court to subject- an incompetent defendant to psychiatric, or related, treatment\u201d and \u201cdoes not authorize any other treatment options - including \u2018legal therapy5 by defense counsel.\u201d The State argues that because not all defendants require psychiatric treatment to be restored to competency, RSA 135:17-a should be construed to permit trial courts to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>order a broad range of competency restoration treatments not limited to psychiatric or mental health treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">RSA 135:17-a, I, provides that if the trial court finds a defendant not competent to stand trial, it must order \u201ctreatment for the restoration of competency\u201d unless it determines the defendant cannot be restored to competency within twelve months. If the court determines that the defendant \u201cis to undergo treatment to restore competency,\u201d the defendant may be \u201ctreated\u201d in the state mental health system or at the secure psychiatric unit under an order for involuntary admission pursuant to RSA chapter 135-C, or the defendant may be placed on bail under court order for an \u201cappropriate course of treatment to restore competency.\u201d RSA 135:17-a, II.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Once the trial court has issued an order \u201ccommitting [a] defendant for treatment,\u201d a further hearing must be held within twelve months to assess the defendant\u2019s competency. RSA 135:17-a, III. Prior to this further hearing, the \u201ctreating psychiatrist\u201d is obligated to conduct a further competency evaluation. <em>Id. </em>Following the hearing, if the trial court determines that the defendant has regained competency, the matter must be docketed for trial. If the defendant remains incompetent, the case must be dismissed without prejudice. RSA 135:17-a, IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">If, however, the incompetent defendant is determined to be dangerous, the trial court must order the defendant to remain in custody and be \u201cevaluated [to determine] the appropriateness of involuntary treatment.\u201d RSA 135:17-a, V. For the purpose of \u201cevaluating appropriateness\u201d and involuntary admission into the \u201cstate mental health services system, the state developmental services delivery system, or the secure psychiatric unit,\u201d the court may order the defendant to submit to examinations by a \u201cphysician, psychiatrist, or psychologist.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, if a person is involuntarily committed, the \u201ctreating physician, psychiatrist, or psychologist\u201d must report to the court if at any time the person regains competency to stand trial before the statute of limitations for the original criminal offense has expired. RSA 135:17-a, VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">This court is \u201cthe final arbiter of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of a statute considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Snedeker v. Snedeker, </em>145 N.H. 19, 20 (2000) (quotations omitted). \u201cAs in all cases involving statutory interpretation, the starting point is the language of the statute. We construe each statute as a whole, and if the statute\u2019s language is clear and unambiguous, we do not look beyond the language of the statute to discern legislative intent.\u201d <em>State v. Whittey, </em>149 N.H. 463, 467 (2003) (citation omitted). \u2018Where statutory language is not specifically defined, we look to the intent of the legislation, which is determined by examining the construction of the statute as a whole.\u201d <em>Appeal of House </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number><em>Legislative Facilities Subcom., </em>141 N.H. 443, 446 (1996) (quotations and ellipsis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">RSA 135:17-a requires that within twelve months of an order committing a defendant for treatment, a further hearing be held to assess the defendant\u2019s competency and that, prior to that second hearing, the \u201ctreating psychiatrist\u201d must conduct a further competency evaluation. Construing the statute as a whole, we hold that RSA 135:17-a plainly contemplates that whatever course of treatment a trial court orders for the restoration of competency be under the supervision of a psychiatrist. The trial court erred, therefore, when it ordered \u201ctutelage in the law\u201d by the defendant\u2019s attorneys as the treatment in this case. Because the failure to appoint a psychiatrist to supervise the defendant\u2019s treatment is reversible error, we need not decide what types of \u201ctreatment\u201d may be ordered under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">In addition, any further competency evaluation of the defendant may not be undertaken by Dr. Adams. The statute dictates that such evaluation be undertaken by the defendant\u2019s \u201ctreating psychiatrist,\u201d a role that Dr. Adams does not fulfill. <em>See </em>RSA 135:17-a, III. Pursuant to this provision, it is presumed that the court ordered treatment under the supervision of a psychiatrist after a finding of incompetency, that the defendant participated in such treatment, and that the treating psychiatrist has conducted a further competency evaluation and provided additional guidance to the court on the success of the treatment. Dr. Adams, who met with the defendant only on the day of his initial competency evaluation, is not his \u201ctreating psychiatrist\u201d within the intent of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b252-8\">Nadeau, Dalianis, Duggan and Galway, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
