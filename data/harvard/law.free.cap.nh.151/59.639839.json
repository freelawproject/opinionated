King, was indicted on four counts of aggravated felonious sexual assault, <em>see </em>RSA 682-A:2, I(1) (Supp. 2003); RSA 632-A:2, II (Supp. 2003). Following a jury trial in the Superior Court (Sullivan, J.), he was convicted on one count. On appeal, the defendant argues that there is insufficient evidence to support a guilty verdict, that the verdicts are inconsistent, and that the court\u2019s failure to release exculpatory evidence violated his State and federal constitutional rights. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The jury could have found the following facts. The defendant was married to Pamela King, the mother of the victim. In February 2002, the victim, the defendant and Pamela were living together in Alstead with other family members. Sometime in February, the victim, who was then under the age of thirteen, was practicing handstands in the living room near the couch. Every time she fell into the couch, the defendant flipped her over, \u201cpushed aside [her] pants,\u201d and touched her \u201cprivates.\u201d The victim asked the defendant to stop, and he complied.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">On another occasion, the defendant was folding clothes in the marital bedroom while the victim was watching. Again, she began practicing handstands, and the defendant put his mouth on her \u201cprivates.\u201d When asked how she knew that he used his mouth, she replied, \u201cBecause it was wet.\u201d The victim testified that another incident occurred in the bedroom and that, \u201cpretty much the same thing happened as before.\u201d She further testified that the defendant licked her \u201cpee pee,\u201d that he took off her pants and would not give them back to her, and that he put his fingers inside her.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">During trial, the State used a picture of a naked girl as a demonstrative aid. When asked to explain the terms \u201cprivates,\u201d \u201cpee pee\u201d and \u201ccrotch,\u201d the victim drew a circle around the genital area and labeled it the \u201ccrotch\u201d and \u201cpee pee.\u201d She also indicated that \u201ccrotch\u201d and \u201cpee pee\u201d are the same and that \u201cprivates\u201d includes that same area of the body, plus the chest. The victim reiterated that the defendant touched and put his mouth on her \u201ccrotch\u201d and \u201cpee pee\u201d under her clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">After the incidents, Mary Russell, the victim\u2019s grandmother, discovered a hand-written note from the victim. The note read: \u201cMom, Joe is Dad! You should never had [sic] merried [sic] him! He is grosse [sic]! Descusting [sic]! I hate him! We need to talk!\u201d While her grandmother was reading the note, the victim grabbed it from her, tore it up, and threw it in the trash. At trial, when asked to explain her statement that, \u201cJoe is Dad,\u201d the victim testified, \u201cBecause my dad did pretty much the same thing to my sister.\u201d Russell further clarified this statement by testifying that the victim\u2019s natural father was convicted of sexually assaulting his other daughter, the victim\u2019s half-sister. Concerning her other statements in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>note, the victim testified that the defendant was \u201cgross and disgusting for what he did\u201d to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The defendant was convicted on one count of aggravated felonious sexual assault. RSA 632-A:2, II. He was found not guilty on all remaining indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">On appeal, the defendant first contends that the evidence was insufficient to support the guilty verdict. He asserts that the victim\u2019s testimony was vague and uncorroborated. Because the lines she drew on the demonstrative aid only indicated the general crotch area, the defendant argues that the evidence lacked the specificity necessary to find that the defendant touched her genitalia. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">In raising a sufficiency of the evidence claim, \u201cthe defendant carries the burden of proving that no rational trier of fact, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Mason, </em>150 N.H. 53, 56 (2003). We examine each evidentiary item in the context of all the evidence, not in isolation. <em>Id. </em>Where the victim\u2019s testimony is sufficient to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case, no corroborating evidence is needed. <em>Id.; </em>RSA 632-A:6, I (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">RSA 632-A:2, II provides: \u201cA person is guilty of aggravated felonious sexual assault without penetration when he intentionally touches whether directly, through clothing, or otherwise, the genitalia of a person under the age of 13 under circumstances that can be reasonably construed as being for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\"><em>State v. Graham, </em>142 N.H. 357 (1997), and <em>State v. Blackstock, </em>147 N.H. 791 (2002), are strikingly similar to this case. In <em>Graham, </em>the defendant appealed his convictions on one count of felonious sexual assault and three counts of aggravated felonious sexual assault. <em>Graham, </em>142 N.H. at 359. The victim testified that the defendant \u201cput[] his \u2018privates\u2019 in her mouth, and toueh[ed] her \u2018privates.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>The State also used a stuffed bunny as a demonstrative aid to support the inference that the victim\u2019s use of the word \u201cprivates\u201d signified her vagina. <em>Id. </em>at 360-61. The defendant argued there was insufficient evidence to uphold his conviction by asserting that the victim\u2019s use of the word \u201cprivates\u201d was not sufficiently specific to establish that he touched her genitalia. <em>Id. </em>at 359-60. We, however, concluded that the term \u201cprivates\u201d was sufficiently clarified through additional testimony as well as the demonstrative evidence, so that the jury could reasonably infer that the word \u201cprivates\u201d referred to the victim\u2019s genitalia. <em>Id. </em>at 360-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">In <em>Blackstock, </em>the defendant appealed his conviction for aggravated felonious sexual assault. <em>Blackstock, </em>147 N.H. at 792. At trial, the victim testified that the defendant was tickling her when his hand went under her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>clothes and touched her twice \u201cbetween her legs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 793 (quotation and brackets omitted). The victim also testified that the defendant touched her \u201cprivate parts\u201d and \u201cprivate area.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 793-94. In arguing that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the conviction, the defendant contended that the phrases \u201cbetween her legs,\u201d \u201cprivate parts,\u201d and \u201cprivate area\u201d were insufficient to establish that he unlawfully touched her genitalia. <em>Id. </em>at 793. We determined that based upon use of the term \u201cprivate parts,\u201d combined with the fact that the victim identified the location of those parts as between her legs, the jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant touched her genitalia as charged in the indictment. <em>Id. </em>at 794-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The defendant here contends that the absence of physical evidence, eyewitnesses, or other corroborating evidence demonstrates that the evidence was insufficient to convict him. He relies heavily upon our decision in <em>State v. O\u2019Neill, </em>134 N.H. 182 (1991), to support his position. In <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>we held that the victim\u2019s use of the term \u201cbum,\u201d in conjunction with the act of pointing at a general area of his body, \u201cdid no more to indicate that he meant his anus, than that he meant his buttocks, and was not sufficient to permit a reasonable inference as to the penetration element of the criminal charge.\u201d <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>134 N.H. at 187. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>however, is readily distinguishable from the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">First, while we noted the paucity of corroborating evidence in <em>O\u2019Neill, id., </em>we underscore that where, as here, the victim\u2019s testimony itself is sufficient to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case, no corroborating evidence is needed. <em>Mason, </em>150 N.H. at 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Second, in <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>the State elicited no additional testimony to demonstrate that the victim\u2019s use of the word \u201cbum\u201d differed from the common definition of the term, which is \u201cbuttocks.\u201d <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>134 N.H. at 187. In this case, however, as in <em>Graham </em>and <em>Blackstock, </em>the meaning of the terms \u201cprivates,\u201d as used by the victim, was clarified through additional testimony. The victim explained that the word \u201cprivates,\u201d \u201ccrotch\u201d and \u201cpee pee\u201d are the same, and indicated that the defendant touched her there and put his fingers inside her.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">Additionally, in <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>the defendant was indicted for a crime requiring proof of penetration as an element of the offense. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>134 N.H. at 186-87. Thus, the State was required to show that the defendant penetrated the anus of the victim. <em>Id. </em>at 187. The defendant, here, was convicted under RSA 632-A:2, II, which does not require proof of penetration, but rather, that an intentional touching occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">Moreover, in both <em>Graham </em>and <em>Blackstock, </em>we noted that use of the word \u201cprivates\u201d to connote genitals accords with the common meaning of the word. <em>See Graham, </em>142 N.H. at 361; <em>Blackstock, </em>147 N.H. at 794. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>see no reason to deviate from this definition here. Even if the meaning of the word \u201cprivates\u201d were ambiguous in this context, the victim testified that the defendant touched her \u201cpee pee.\u201d Under the circumstances, there can be little doubt that the phrase \u201cpee pee\u201d refers to the victim\u2019s genitalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">Finally, in <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>the State did not use any charts or dolls to augment the victim\u2019s testimony. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>134 N.H. at 183. In contrast, here, the State utilized a demonstrative aid as it did in <em>Graham. </em>Despite the defendant\u2019s characterization to the contrary, the victim drew a circle closely encompassing the genital area of a picture of a naked girl, and indicated that this area was the \u201ccrotch\u201d and \u201cpee pee,\u201d and that the \u201cprivates\u201d included this area as well as the chest. Therefore, based upon the victim\u2019s testimony coupled with the demonstration, the jury could fairly infer that the victim\u2019s use of these terms referred to her genitalia. <em>See Graham, </em>142 N.H. at 361. Viewing the victim\u2019s testimony and all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the State, the jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant unlawfully touched the victim\u2019s genitalia. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Next, the defendant contends that because the State\u2019s case was based wholly upon the victim\u2019s testimony, its \u201cdecision to convict and find the witness credible on one count, while acquitting and finding her incredible on the remaining three, is an irrational result.\u201d Thus, he argues the verdicts cannot be reconciled on a rational basis, and are reversibly inconsistent. <em>See State v. Chapin, </em>128 N.H. 355, 357-58 (1986). The State avers that the verdicts are not inconsistent, and alternatively, the mere potential for an inconsistent verdict does not entitle the defendant to relief. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">In <em>State v. Brown, </em>132 N.H. 321 (1989), the defendant argued that the jury\u2019s verdict that he was guilty of being an accomplice to receiving stolen property on one date is inconsistent with its simultaneous verdict that he was not guilty of committing the same offense on two separate dates. <em>Brown, </em>132 N.H. at 328. We noted that, \u201cunder federal and State law, the inconsistency of simultaneous jury verdicts against a single defendant on a multiple-count criminal indictment need not be rationally reconciled, and does not entitle the defendant to relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 328-29. Accordingly, in <em>Brown, </em>we adopted the reasoning of the United States Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Powell, </em>469 U.S. 57, 68-69 (1984), that the better rule is to \u201cinsulate jury verdicts from review.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>132 N.H. at 329. One policy supporting this rationale is clear and well established:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>[T]he jury has substantial latitude in determining the credibility of witnesses. It is the jury which observes the witnesses, judges their credibility and hears their testimony, accepting or rejecting it in whole or in part. In determining witness credibility, the jury may accept some parts and reject other parts of testimony, and adopt one or the other of inconsistent statements by witnesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-5\"><em>Mason, </em>150 N.H. at 56 (quotation omitted). Because the jury observes and evaluates the testimony of the witnesses, it is generally in a better position than this court to determine the facts and to assess the credibility of witnesses. <em>Chapin, </em>128 N.H. at 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Moreover, we have previously concluded that because courts are unable to ascertain which verdict, if any, was rendered erroneously, the mere fact that verdicts appear to be rationally irreconcilable is an insufficient reason to reverse a guilty verdict. <em>Brown, </em>132 N.H. at 330. Even if verdicts are inconsistent, it should not be assumed that the jury error necessarily aids either party. <em>See Powell, </em>469 U.S. at 65. Indeed, \u201c[i]t is just as likely that the jury correctly reached the guilty verdict on one count, and through leniency or mistake arrived at the not guilty verdict on a different count of the same offense.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>132 N.H. at 329. Thus, the defendant is not entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Regardless, in this case, it cannot be said that the verdicts were inconsistent because the jury was free to consider all of the evidence separately in each indictment, and to \u201caccept some parts and reject other parts of testimony, and adopt one or the other of inconsistent statements by witnesses,\u201d including the victim\u2019s testimony. <em>Mason, </em>150 N.H. at 56 (quotation omitted). In addition, the charge of which the defendant was convicted is the only one upon which he gave contradicting testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">Finally, the defendant argues that the trial court violated his due process rights as well as his right to confrontation under Part I, Article 15 of the New Hampshire Constitution and the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution by refusing to release the investigating officer\u2019s personnel files, which may contain potentially exculpatory evidence. The State asserts that the defendant failed to produce a sufficient record on this issue, and, therefore, we should decline to address it. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">In New Hampshire, the moving party has the burden of presenting a sufficient record to allow proper review by this Court. <em>State v. Stearns, </em>130 N.H. 475, 491 (1988). The defendant alleges that the trial court reviewed the officer\u2019s personnel files <em>in camera. </em>The defendant, however, has here failed to produce the personnel files that we need in order to review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>properly the trial judge\u2019s decision not to release them. In the absence of a record upon which we can base our review, we cannot speculate as to the trial judge\u2019s decision. <em>See id. </em>Consequently, we decline to address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b113-4\">Dalianis, Duggan and Galway, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
