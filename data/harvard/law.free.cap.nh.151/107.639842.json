On appeal, the defendant argues that, in light of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Stogner v. California, </em>123 S. Ct. 2446 (2003), the retrospective application of extensions to the statute of limitations to his case violated the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>and Due Process Clauses of both the New Hampshire and United States Constitutions. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-13\">The defendant\u2019s convictions stemmed from eight indictments handed down on January 7, 1992. The indictments alleged that between April 11, 1981, and April 10, 1986, the defendant engaged in various acts of sexual penetration with the victim prior to her thirteenth birthday. <em>State v. Martin, </em>138 N.H. 508, 511 (1994). The defendant appealed, <em>see id., </em>arguing, among other things, that the applicable six-year statute of limitations, RSA 625:8, I (1986), had expired, and that retrospective application of the 1990 amendment to the statute of limitations, RSA 625:8, III(d) (1996) (amended 2000), represented an unconstitutional <em>ex post facto </em>application of the law, <em>see </em>N.H. CONST, pt. I, art. 23; U.S. CONST. art. I, \u00a7 10. We affirmed the convictions because \u201cno statute of limitations applicable to the defendant\u2019s alleged crimes ever expired prior to the enactment of a longer statute\u201d and, thus, there was no violation of the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clauses of the State or Federal Constitutions. <em>Martin, </em>138 N.H. at 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-14\">Subsequently, the defendant filed a motion to vacate his sentence, arguing that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Stogner </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>\u201ccasts significant doubt on the constitutionality of applying the extended statute of limitations to [him].\u201d The Superior Court <em>(McHugh, </em>J.) denied the motion because \u201cthe holding in <em>Stogner </em>does not mandate a reversal of our Supreme Court\u2019s consideration of this issue.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Both Article I, Section 10 of the Federal Constitution and Part I, Article 23 of the New Hampshire Constitution forbid <em>ex post facto </em>penal laws. <em>Petition of Hamel, </em>137 N.H. 488, 494 (1993). We first address the defendant\u2019s arguments under our State Constitution, using federal law only as an aid in our analysis. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The defendant argues, based upon the holding in <em>Stogner, </em>that applying the amended statute of limitations in his case violates the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause because it made the original offense greater than it was when it was committed and altered the quantum of evidence required to convict. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">As we have previously held, \u201cuntil a criminal statute of limitations has run, it is a mere regulation of the remedy.\u201d <em>Martin, </em>138 N.H. at 512 (quotation omitted). Because the statute of limitations is essentially a surrendering by the sovereign of its right to prosecute, the statute of limitations may be changed at the pleasure of the legislature, subject to constitutional qualifications. <em>State v. Hamel, </em>138 N.H. 392, 395 (1994). Where, however, the limitations period has run, \u201cit is a vested defense of right that cannot be taken away by legislative enactment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">In <em>Stogner, </em>the amended statute of limitations revived the defendant\u2019s previously time-barred prosecution. <em>Stogner, </em>123 S. Ct. at 2449. The court held that, by reviving the time-barred prosecution, the amended statute \u201cinflict[ed] punishment[] where the [defendant] was not, by law, liable to any punishment\u201d and, thus, violated the prohibition on <em>ex post facto </em>laws. <em>Id. </em>at 2450-51, 2455 (quotation and emphasis omitted). In reaching this holding, the court distinguished the revival of time-barred prosecutions from the extension of an unexpired statute of limitations and stated that \u201cour holding today does not affect\u201d extensions of unexpired statutes of limitations. <em>Id. </em>at 2453.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">The holding in <em>Stogner, </em>by its own language, does not affect our prior determinations that the extension of an unexpired statute of limitations does not violate the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause. <em>See Martin, </em>138 N.H. at 512; <em>Hamel, </em>138 N.H. at 396. Unlike reviving a time-barred prosecution, the extension of an unexpired statute of limitations does not inflict punishment where the defendant was not, by law, liable to any punishment. As we stated before, the extension of the unexpired statute of limitations did not alter an element of the crime, \u201cdid not change the ultimate facts needed to prove guilt, nor did it punish a previously innocent act.\u201d <em>Hamel, </em>138 N.H. at 395-96. Moreover, our holding today is consistent with the decisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>other courts that have considered the effect of <em>Stogner </em>on an unexpired statute of limitations. <em>See, e.g., People v. Superior Court, </em>10 Cal. Rptr. 3d 893, 894-95 (Ct. App. 2004); <em>Minton v. State, </em>802 N.E.2d 929, 934-35 (Ind. Ct. App. 2004); <em>State v. Steele, </em>802 N.E.2d 1127, 1130 (Ohio Ct. App. 2003); <em>State v. Lyles, </em>858 So. 2d 35, 56 (La. Ct. App. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">Here, because the statute of limitations had not run when it was extended by the legislature, application of the extended statute of limitations to the defendant did not violate the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause of the State Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The defendant also argues that retrospective application of the extended statute of limitations denies his right to due process under both the State and Federal Constitutions. Because this issue was raised and addressed in the defendant\u2019s previous appeal, <em>see Martin, </em>138 N.H. at 512-13, we will not revisit it now.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The Federal Constitution offers the defendant no greater protection than does the State Constitution under these circumstances. <em>See Stogner, </em>123 S. Ct. at 2453; <em>Martin, </em>138 N.H. at 512. Therefore, we reach the same result under the Federal Constitution as we do under the State Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b157-8\">Broderick, Nadeau, Dalianis and Galway, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
