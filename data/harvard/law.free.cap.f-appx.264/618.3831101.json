Her deferred sentence for fraudulently obtaining dangerous drugs did not affect the \u201cconviction\u2019s underlying lawfulness.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Moreover, a deferred sentence does not amount \u201cto a determination that the crime never occurred or that [she] was in fact innocent.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-23\">Morse\u2019s sentence did not violate the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment because her sentence enhancement was not \u201cgrossly disproportionate\u201d to her crime.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>The district court followed the proper procedures outlined in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(b) for enhancing Morse\u2019s sentence. The district court gave Morse \u201cthe opportunity to deny the prior conviction,\u201d and \u201c[t]hat is all [this] statute requires.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Also, the prior conviction used to enhance Morse\u2019s sentence was over twenty-five years old, well past the five-year period for challenging prior convictions under \u00a7 851(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">The warrant to search Morse\u2019s home was supported by probable cause. Under the totality of the circumstances, information from two controlled drug buys made by a reliable and accurate confidential informant, and claims from two individuals that Lucy sold them drugs, created a sufficient basis for probable cause.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Morse did not make a substantial preliminary showing that the affidavit supporting the warrant to search her car deliberately or recklessly included false statements or omitted material statements to entitle her to a <em>Franks </em>hearing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Morse did not show that police lied about the methamphetamine field test, and she did not show that the K-9 sniff test was affected by the presence of her own dogs.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Morse\u2019s conviction for Count VI, which was based on an aiding and abetting theory, was supported by sufficient evidence. Mark Butler\u2019s testimony provided enough information for a rational trier of fact to find the essential elements of aiding and abetting possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-13\">The variance between the date of the indictment and the date the crime occurred is \u201cnot of a character which could have misled the defendant at trial, and there is no danger of double jeopardy.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Therefore, the variance between indictment and proof is immaterial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b645-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
