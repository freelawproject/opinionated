HENRY, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b776-22\">Charles Chambers, a state prisoner proceeding pro se, seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) to appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of his Writ of Habeas Corpus petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. For substantially the same reasons set forth by the district court\u2014namely that Mr. Chambers has failed to exhaust available state court remedies\u2014we deny the application for COA and dismiss the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-23\">7. <em>BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-24\">Mr. Chambers is in the custody of the State of Kansas, having been sentenced to concurrent sentences for possession of methamphetamine with intent to sell (49 months), possession of marijuana (12 months), forgery (19 months), and theft (15 months). On August 16, 2006, Mr. Chambers filed a state habeas petition pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 60-1507. He argues, in a series of numerous filings, that the Kansas Department of Corrections improperly calculated his jail-time credits, based on its misinterpretation of Kansas law. His case was initially transferred to Reno County, but then was transferred back to Sedgwick County. On December 7, 2006, the Sedgwick County District Court granted another change of venue motion, moving the case to Cowley County. The Cowley County court has yet to address the claims on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-25\">On May 8, 2007, Mr. Chambers filed a \u201cMotionary Statement for Sentence Cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>rection Relief,\u201d in federal district court, in which he argued that he was entitled to relief under Federal Rule of Criminal Pro-, cedure 35. In a June 12, 2007 order, the district court noted that the federal criminal rule does not apply to Mr. Chambers\u2019s state sentence, and liberally construed the pro se pleading as seeking habeas corpus relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. The Department of Corrections responded with a motion to dismiss, based on the fact that the claims had yet to be addressed on the merits in state court since the change of venue to Cowley County. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Chambers filed a motion for summary judgment citing cases in which Kansas was found to have improperly applied jail-time credits, to argue that respondents\u2019 defenses were barred by res judicata. On October 4, 2007, the federal district court dismissed Mr. Chambers\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition without prejudice because he had not exhausted his state court remedies or shown that such remedies are \u201c \u2018unavailable\u2019 \u201d or would be \u201c \u2018ineffective under the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d Rec. doc. 15, at 3 (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1)). On October 18, 2007, the district court, construed his notice of appeal as a request for a COA, which it denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">\n<em>II. DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Mr. Chambers must obtain a COA in order to challenge the district court\u2019s dismissal of his habeas petition. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 335-36, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). In order to obtain a COA, Mr. Chambers must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). When a district court denies a habeas petition on procedural grounds, as here, a COA should issue only if reasonable jurists would find it debatable both that \u201cthe petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d and \u201cthe district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">Because Mr. Chambers failed to exhaust his state court remedies, reasonable jurists could not debate the district court\u2019s procedural ruling. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1) provides that habeas relief shall not be granted unless:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-9\">(A) the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-10\">(B) (i) there is an absence of available State corrective process; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-11\">(ii) circumstances exist that render such process ineffective to protect the rights of the applicant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-12\">Absent exceptional circumstances, a federal court will not entertain habeas claims until the petitioner has exhausted available state court remedies. <em>Picard v. Connor, </em>404 U.S. 270, 275, 92 S.Ct. 509, 30 L.Ed.2d 438 (1971). \u201cThe exhaustion requirement is satisfied if the federal issue has been properly presented to the highest state court, either by direct review of the conviction or in a postconviction attack.\u201d <em>Dever v. Kan. State Penitentiary, </em>36 F.3d 1531, 1534 (10th Cir.1994). Mr. Chambers argues that he has exhausted state court remedies because the change of venue to Cowley County was never actually entered. As both Mr. Chambers and the district court note, proceedings in Cowley County have stalled. <em>See </em>Rec. doc. 15, at 3 (noting that the state court proceeding \u201cappears to be presently stalled in the process of changing venue of petitioner\u2019s action to another state district court....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-13\">Though the change of venue was granted December 7, 2006, on June 13, 2007, the Cowley County clerk responded to Mr. Chambers\u2019s inquiry about the status of his case by saying only, \u201cWe have not received anything to date.\u201d Rec. doc. 7, at 4 (\u201cShow Cause Exhibit\u201d). The burden is on Mr. Chambers to show that he exhausted his state court remedies. <em>Hernandez v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number><em>Starbuck, </em>69 F.3d 1089, 1092 (10th Cir.1995). One inquiry to the Cowley County clerk about the status of his mandamus petition is insufficient to demonstrate that state court remedies are either unavailable or ineffective under the circumstances. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2254(b)(1). However, we expect that by now, fourteen months after the change of venue was granted, Cowley County has received notice and we eagerly await that court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">As for Mr. Chambers\u2019s arguments that the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>bars the State\u2019s motion to dismiss, we agree with the district court that no facts or law support the application of that doctrine in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">\n<em>III. CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">For the foregoing reasons, since no reasonable jury could debate whether the district court\u2019s procedural ruling was correct, we DENY the application for COA and DISMISS the matter.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
