On appeal, counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which he moves to withdraw. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-21\">For reversal, counsel raises as a possible argument that the district court mishandled this case. Upon careful review of the record, we conclude that this argument has no merit. In particular, we find that the district court\u2019s unobjected-to refusal to grant safety-valve relief was not error, plain or otherwise, <em>see United States v. Pirani, </em>406 F.3d 543, 550 (8th Cir.2005) (en banc) (describing plain-error review that appellate court uses to correct error not raised at trial), because Mijares admitted that he had refused to provide certain information about his offense that had been requested by the government, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a) (safety-valve relief requirements). Accordingly, the 10-year statutory minimum imposed by the district court was the lowest sentence the court could legally have imposed. <em>See United States v. Gregg, </em>451 F.3d 930, 937 (8th Cir.2006) <em>(\u201cBooker</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>does not relate to statutorily-imposed sentences\u201d); <em>United States v. Chacon, </em>330 F.3d 1065, 1066 (8th Cir.2003) (only authority for district court to depart from statutory minimum sentence is found in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) and (f), which apply only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>when government makes motion for substantial assistance or defendant qualifies for safety-valve relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Having reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we grant counsel leave to withdraw, and we affirm the judgment,</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b569-15\">. The Honorable Richard G.
