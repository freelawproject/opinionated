Lee\u2019s <em>pro se </em>request for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d). We note at the outset that this appeal, No. 07-1461, is closely related to a separate appeal, No. 07-1072, recently resolved by this court. <em>See Lee v. Wakins, </em>256 Fed.Appx. 200 (10th Cir.2007) (denying COA and dismissing Lee\u2019s appeal from district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas corpus petition). In this particular appeal, Lee seeks a COA so he can appeal the district court\u2019s overruling of his objection to his appointed counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A) (providing that no appeal may be taken from a \u201cfinal order in a habeas corpus proceeding in which the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a State court,\u201d unless the petitioner first obtains a COA).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-22\">After the district court denied Lee\u2019s \u00a7 2254 habeas petition (the subject of appeal No. 07-1072), appointed counsel moved to withdraw. Lee filed a pro se <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>objection to counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. The district court granted the motion to withdraw and then overruled Lee\u2019s objection as moot. Lee then filed a notice of appeal from that decision (the subject of the instant appeal No. 07-1461). As noted above, this court recently denied Lee a COA and dismissed his appeal (No. 07-1072) of the district court\u2019s resolution of his \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. <em>Lee v. Wakins, </em>256 Fed.Appx. 200 (10th Cir.2007). Prior to the issuance of this court\u2019s order denying COA in appeal number 07-1072, this court independently granted appointed counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. In light of this court\u2019s independent order granting appointed counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, which superseded the district court\u2019s order allowing withdrawal, and our denial of Lee\u2019s request for a COA in appeal number 07-1072, Lee\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s order overruling his objection to counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is moot. Accordingly, this appeal is hereby DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
