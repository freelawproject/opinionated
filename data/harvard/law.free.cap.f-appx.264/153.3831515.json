Vora appeals the order of the United States Distiict Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania dismissing pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), her \u201cnotice of removal\u201d of criminal citations issued by the Johnstown Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-23\">In August 2007, Vora filed a \u201cpetition for removal\u201d seeking to remove a police complaint charging her with various traffic citations and making false reports to law enforcement authorities. As she has claimed in the past, Vora blames the City of Johnstown Police Department, Officer Kanuch, and other city officials for discriminating against her on account of her religious and ethnic background by subjecting her to malicious prosecution on trumped-up charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-24\">The District Court dismissed the petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), holding that the \u201cNotice of Removal\u201d sought to attack state court proceedings over which the District Court had no jurisdiction and otherwise failed to state a claim. Vora filed a motion to vacate, which the District Court treated as a motion for reconsideration and denied. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-25\">Vora has been granted leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>on appeal. Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>her appeal lacks arguable merit, we will dismiss it pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). <em>See Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">After reviewing Vora\u2019s District Court pleadings and notice of appeal, we conclude that her \u201cpetition for removal\u201d was correctly dismissed. We construe the petition as seeking removal under the civil rights removal statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443, because Vora alleges that the traffic citation and the criminal complaints are part of a larger conspiracy by all city personnel to violate her civil rights. The civil rights removal statute applies only to the removal of state court proceedings. <em>Id.; see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(a). Here, Vora was ordered to appear in a proceeding before a district justice on a traffic citation and various criminal violations. Even if we assume <em>arguendo </em>that the civil rights removal statute applies to the traffic citation and the criminal complaints that Vora seeks to remove, Vora\u2019s rambling, generalized, and unsupported allegations do not meet the specific criteria for \u00a7 1443 removal. <em>See City of Greenwood v. Peacock, </em>384 U.S. 808, 827, 86 S.Ct. 1800, 16 L.Ed.2d 944 (1966); <em>Ronan v. Stone, </em>396 F.2d 502, 503 (1st Cir.1968). Similarly, Vora\u2019s unsupported allegations would not suffice to state a claim under \u00a7 1983, were the \u201cpetition for removal\u201d viewed as a complaint. We discern no abuse of discretion by the District Court in denying Vora\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Having found no legal merit to this cause, we will dismiss the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
