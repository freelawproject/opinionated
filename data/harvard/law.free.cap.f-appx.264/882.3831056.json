The Board found that Calle failed to prove thal he suffered \u201cpast persecution\u201d or a probability of future persecution and Calle failed to prove that he was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d to be tortured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>by or with the \u201cacquiescence\u201d of a government official upon his return to Argentina. We deny Calle\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">Calle entered the United States on August 17, 1999, and remained in the country, without authorization, until 2000. On December 18, 2001, he reentered the United States as a violator of the Visa Waiver Program. In February 2003, he filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention. He sought relief based on his political opinion and his alleged mistreatment by \u201cdelinquents\u201d in Argentina.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">The Immigration Judge held a hearing on Calle\u2019s application. Calle testified that he sought asylum in the United States because he was a homosexual and discriminated against by \u201cpeople on the street.\u201d Calle recounted two incidents in Argentina related to his sexual orientation that occurred about 14 and 11 years before the healing. When Calle was 16 years old, a police officer entered his home under the pretense of using the bathroom and instead had sex with Calle. Calle alleged that he did not want to have sex, but was in fear due to the officer\u2019s position of authority. When Calle was 19 years old, his motorcycle was stolen and he reported the crime to the police. The police allegedly refused assistance and mentioned that, if they discovered the motorcycle, they would sell it and retain part of the proceeds. Calle admitted that he did not suffer any further mistreatment in Argentina.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">Calle, who is HIV positive, expressed concern with the medical treatment available in Argentina after having received free treatment in the United States. He testified that the hospitals in Argentina did not have his medication and that his partner died the year before the hearing due to lack of treatment. Although Calle submitted various documents related to human rights practices in Argentina, he admitted that he did not have any evidence that he would be unable to receive treatment for his condition in Argentina.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-10\">Calle admitted that he was able to leave Argentina when he became 21 years old in 1997, but he chose not to leave despite his alleged mistreatment as a homosexual. When questioned why he did not move to Buenos Aires, a city touted as being \u201cgay friendly,\u201d he stated that he visited the city when he was 17 or 18 years old and feared the \u201cbig city\u201d atmosphere, although he comfortably resided in Miami after he returned to the United States in 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-11\">The Immigration Judge found that Calle\u2019s application for asylum was untimely and denied Calle\u2019s application for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention. Although he found Calle\u2019s allegations credible, the judge ruled that Calle failed to establish that he would be persecuted on the basis of his homosexuality or that he had been or would be tortured by or with the acquiescence of a government official, particularly when the Argentine constitution prohibited such conduct. The judge found that Calle had not established that suitable medical treatment would not be available in Argentina. Relying on documentary evidence, the judge concluded that several parts of Argentina, most notably Buenos Aires, fostered a homosexual lifestyle and Calle could relocate to Buenos Aires and continue his work as a hair stylist. One news report in 2003 stated that several cities were considering civil union laws to extend marital rights to gay couples for inheritance, as well as professional benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-12\">The Board \u201cagree[d] with the Immigration Judge\u2019s conclusion\u201d that Calle \u201chad not met his burden of establishing \u2018past <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>persecution\u2019 or a clear probability of persecution if returned to Argentina.\u201d The Board also \u201caffirm[ed] the Immigration Judge\u2019s determination\u201d that Calle \u201cfailed to demonstrate that he [was] \u2018more likely than not\u2019 to be tortured in Argentina by or with the \u2018acquiescence\u2019 of a government official.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">We review the decision of the Board to determine whether it is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Lorisme v. I.N.S., </em>129 F.3d 1441, 1444-45 (11th Cir.1997)) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cTo reverse [those] fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). We review the legal conclusions of the Board <em>de novo. Id. </em>at 1287 n. 6. When the Board adopts the findings of the Immigration Judge, we review the decision of the Immigration Judge. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">Calle challenges two of the three decisions of the Board. Calle challenges the findings by the Board regarding Calle\u2019s application for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention. Calle does not challenge the finding that his application for asylum was untimely, which we lack jurisdiction to review. <em>Mendoza, 327 </em>F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">Calle\u2019s burden is well-established. To qualify for withholding of removal, an alien must prove that \u201chis life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287 (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A)). The alien must establish that \u201che more-likely-than-not would be persecuted ... upon his return to the country in question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Fahim v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1218 (11th Cir.2002)). An applicant for relief under the Convention must \u201cestablish that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1303 (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2) (2001)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Torture is confined to those acts inflicting \u201csevere pain and suffering, whether physical or mental\u201d committed at the hands, under the direction, or with the acquiescence of \u201ca public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1) (2001). The acts must be \u201cintentionally inflicted\u201d either to extract \u201cinformation or a confession,\u201d to punish, intimidate, or coerce, or \u201cfor any reason based on discrimination of any kind[.]\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b910-10\">Substantial evidence supports the conclusion that Calle was not entitled to withholding of removal. According to Calle, the nonconsensual sex with the police officer and the response to the theft of his motorcycle were isolated incidents, and no evidence suggests that these occurrences were intended as persecutory. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201c[M]ere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d Persecution requires \u201cmore than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). Calle also did not prove that he would be unable to obtain medical treatment for HIV.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-11\">Substantial evidence also supports the finding that Calle will not likely be tor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>tured if removed. Calle did not prove that he would experience any \u201csevere pain or suffering\u201d upon his return to Argentina. The record instead supports the finding that Argentina would support Calle\u2019s lifestyle.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">Calle\u2019s petition for review is DENIED. PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
