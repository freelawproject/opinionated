Maknojia contends the BIA erred in concluding that he was ineligible to seek adjustment of status in his removal proceedings. Specifically, he argues that the narrow exception set forth in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.2(a)(1)(ii) applied and, thus, the IJ had jurisdiction to adjudicate his adjustment application.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Maknojia was not pursuing or attempting to renew his previously filed marriage-based adjustment application but was seeking to have the IJ adjudicate an employment-based adjustment application. That application, however, was not a \u201cpreviously filed application\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1245.2(a)\u2014(1)(ii). Although Maknojia filed the application with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\u201cUSCIS\u201d), he had not departed from the United States since filing the application, he had not returned to the United States pursuant to a grant of advance parole to pursue that application, and that application had not been denied by the USCIS. Therefore, the narrow exception set forth in \u00a7 1245.2(a)(1)(ii) did not apply, and the IJ lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the application. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1245.2(a)(l)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Alternatively, Maknojia requests that his petition for review be held hi abeyance pending the USCIS\u2019s adjudication of his application. He cites no authority for the request. Further, the USCIS\u2019s adjudication of Maknojia\u2019s adjustment application is independent of his removal proceedings. <em>See In re Castro-Padron, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 379, 380 (BIA 1996). Therefore, the request is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-12\">In his brief filed in support of his petition for review, Maknojia does not assert that the IJ erred in denying his motion to continue, nor does he challenge the BIA\u2019s determination that the deletion of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.1(c)(8) mooted his arguments regarding its validity. Therefore, these claims are deemed abandoned. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-13\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b463-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
