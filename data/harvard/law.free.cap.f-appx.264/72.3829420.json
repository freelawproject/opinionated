Nov. 15, 2005), <em>aff'g </em>No. A98 322 862 (Immig. Ct. Hartford, CT May 3, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-14\">When the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See, e.g., Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Yu Sheng Zhang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>362 F.3d 155, 159 (2d Cir.2004). We review the BIA\u2019s decision to affirm an IJ\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Cekic v. INS, </em>435 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir.2006). An abuse of discretion may be found where the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the [agency] has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233-34 (2d Cir.2005)(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-15\">An applicant is limited to one motion to reopen which must be filed within 90 days of the final administrative decision. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(3). Martins\u2019 first motion to reopen requested an extension of the period of his voluntary departure, but the agency does not have the authority to grant such a request. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.26(f). Martins argues that, be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>cause the IJ had no jurisdiction to act upon it, his first motion should not count towards the applicable time and numerical limitations on motions to reopen. However, Martins did not present this argument to the BIA and has thus failed to exhaust it administratively. <em>See Foster v. INS, </em>376 F.3d 75, 78 (2d Cir.2004). Accordingly, we decline to consider this unexhausted issue. <em>See Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 107 (2d Cir.2007). Furthermore, to the extent that Martins\u2019 petition raises ineffective assistance of counsel claims, they, too, are unexhausted. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Martins also argues that the time and numerical limitations on motions to reopen are overly stringent and violate due process, as well as numerous precepts of international law, including the 1951 Refugee Convention, the 1967 Protocol and the United Nations Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status for the 1951 Convention and 1967 Protocol (\u201cthe Handbook\u201d). However, nothing Martins cites bars the imposition of deadlines on the filing of motions to reopen. <em>See Ahmetovic v. INS, </em>62 F.3d 48, 53 (2d Cir.1995) (\u201cThe power of the government\u2019s political departments to expel or exclude aliens is extremely broad, and nothing in the Constitution or the provisions of international law ... is to the contrary.\u201d). Furthermore, the Handbook is not binding on the agency or this Court. <em>See INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, </em>526 U.S. 415, 427, 119 S.Ct. 1439, 143 L.Ed.2d 590 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Martins\u2019 appeal to due process also fails. The Due Process Clause does not preclude the agency from enforcing the time and numerical limitations applicable to motions to reopen. <em>See Ahmetovic, </em>62 F.3d at 53. This Court routinely dismisses due process claims based on the application of time and numerical limitations on motions to reopen unless the petitioner points to evidence in the record suggesting he was denied a meaningful opportunity to be heard. <em>See, e.g., Li Hua Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>453 F.3d 99, 104-05 (2d Cir.2006). Martins has not pointed to any such evidence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Moreover, the IJ did not abuse his discretion, either by denying Martins\u2019 motion or by declining to hold a hearing before deciding the motion. Because Martins\u2019 second motion to reopen was barred by the applicable time and numerical limitations, the IJ could grant the motion only if Martins presented evidence establishing \u201cchanged country conditions arising in the country of nationality\u201d which was undiscovered or unavailable at the time of his hearing. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). But the articles Martins submitted in support of his motion were all dated prior to his November 2004 removal hearing and thus provided no evidence that conditions in Brazil had changed in the time since the IJ denied his initial application for relief. Under these circumstances, where the evidence Martins submitted clearly provided no support for a finding of changed country conditions, the IJ did not abuse his discretion in declining to conduct a hearing prior to denying the motion. <em>Kaur, </em>413 F.3d at 233-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
