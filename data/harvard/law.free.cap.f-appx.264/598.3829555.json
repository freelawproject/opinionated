We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we review de novo a district court\u2019s decision to deny a \u00a7 2254 petition, <em>Sass v. Cal. Bd. of Prison Terms, </em>461 F.3d 1123, 1126 (9th Cir.2006), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-17\">Cornejo contends that the California Board of Prison Terms\u2019 (the \u201cBoard\u201d) decision to deny him parole violated his due process rights. We disagree because there was \u201csome evidence\u201d to support the Board\u2019s denial of parole, including not only the gravity of the commitment offense, but the Board\u2019s finding, based on Cornejo\u2019s demeanor and equivocal statements at the parole hearing, that he had not yet fully grappled with, and accepted responsibility for, the magnitude of the murder he had committed. <em>See Powell v. Gomez, </em>33 F.3d 39, 40 (9th Cir.1994) (noting that \u201cthe appeal court may set aside the factual findings only if they lack \u2018fair support\u2019 in the record\u201d); see <em>also Sass, </em>461 F.3d at 1128 (stating that it is not our task to balance the evidence and determine whether we agree with the ultimate decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-18\">Relying on <em>In re Rodriguez, </em>14 Cal.3d 639, 122 Cal.Rptr. 552, 537 P.2d 384 (Cal.1975), Cornejo also contends that the Board violated his due process rights by failing to set a primary term of imprisonment. We disagree. Under California law, if the Board does not promptly fix a primary term, \u201cthe court will deem it to have been fixed at the maximum\u201d by default. <em>See id. </em>at 654, 122 Cal.Rptr. 552, 537 P.2d 384. In addition, because Cornejo has been deemed unsuitable for parole, the Board did not violate his due process rights by not setting a parole date. <em>See </em>15 CahCode Reg. \u00a7\u00a7 2401, 2402(c); <em>see also Connor v. Estelle, </em>981 F.2d 1032, 1033 (9th Cir.1992) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>Furthermore, Cornejo\u2019s contention that the Board violated his due process rights by allegedly applying then-Governor Davis\u2019 blanket, no-parole policy for murderers fails for the reasons stated by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Thus, Cornejo has failed to demonstrate that the state courts\u2019 decisions were \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding,\u201d or were \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C, \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The parties\u2019 remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b625-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
