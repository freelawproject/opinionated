We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962 (9th Cir.2004), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-23\">The IJ and BIA determined that the documentary evidence was inconsistent with Kartozia\u2019s testimony regarding who was responsible for airing the tape of a political speech and why or how the television station was shut down. Substantial evidence supports these determinations, and the inconsistencies go to the heart of the claim. <em>See id. </em>at 962-64. We therefore uphold the ruling denying Kartozia asylum. <em>See id. </em>at 964.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-24\">Because Kartozia failed to satisfy the lower standard of proof for asylum, it necessarily follows that he failed to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153,1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-25\">In addition, substantial evidence supports the finding that Kartozia failed to prove that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if returned to Geor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>gia. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003). Kartozia therefore is not entitled to CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">The motion to strike extra-record material and references is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b627-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
