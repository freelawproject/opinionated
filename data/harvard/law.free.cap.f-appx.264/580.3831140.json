Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 602-03 (9th Cir.2006). We therefore lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that the evidence would not alter its prior discretionary determination that they failed to establish the requisite hardship. <em>See id. </em>at 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-15\">Female petitioner\u2019s evidence of her Bells Palsy condition and its effect on her qualifying relatives may be a new medical basis for relief, but the BIA considered the evidence submitted and acted within its broad discretion in determining that the evidence was insufficient to warrant reopening. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2002) (the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen shall be reversed if it is \u201carbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b607-16\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part, and DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b607-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
