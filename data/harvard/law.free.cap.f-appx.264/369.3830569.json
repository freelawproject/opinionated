He argues that the district court clearly erred in denying him a minor-role adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. The district court\u2019s finding that Ortega was not a minor participant was plausible in light of the record as a whole and, thus, not clearly erroneous. See <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203-04 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-22\">Ortega also contends that his sentence was unreasonable on various grounds. Ortega did not preserve this issue; thus, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 392 (5th Cir.2007). Ortega identifies no plain error. Thus, Ortega has failed to show that his sentence is unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594-95, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462,168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b395-18\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
