On appeal, Martin argues that the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>court erred in applying the two-point enhancement to his sentence for reckless endangerment, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2, arguing that he was unaware that he was being pursued by law enforcement officers prior to his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">\u25a0 We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, and its interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Cook, </em>181 F.3d 1232, 1233 (11th Cir.1999). A district court may enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence for reckless endangerment \u201c[i]f the defendant recklessly created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person in the course of fleeing from a law enforcement officer.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2. Although we have held that a defendant must actually be fleeing a law enforcement officer in order for this enhancement to apply, <em>United States v. Sawyer, </em>115 F.3d 857, 859 (11th Cir.1997), it has not decided whether the defendant must be aware that the person from whom he is fleeing is an officer, <em>id. </em>at 859 n. 1 (expressly reserving judgment on this issue). Assuming knowledge of the law enforcement officer is required, it \u201ccan be based upon inferences from the surrounding circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Peart, </em>888 F.2d 101, 104 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">The Guidelines define recklessness, under \u00a7 3C1.2, as \u201ca situation in which the defendant was aware of the risk created by his conduct and the risk was of such a nature and degree that to disregard that risk constituted a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would exercise in such a situation.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2A1.5, comment 1, 3C1.2, comment 2. \u201cDriving a car at a high rate of speed in an area where people are likely to be found constitutes reckless disregard for others\u2019 safety.\u201d <em>United States v. Washington, </em>434 F.3d 1265, 1268 (11th Cir.2006). Under \u00a7 3C1.2, the person endangered by the defendant\u2019s reckless conduct may be \u201cany person, except a participant in the offense who willingly participated in the flight.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2, comment 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">Upon review of the presentence investigation report and sentencing transcript, and the briefs of the parties, we 'find no reversible error. The circumstances surrounding his arrest demonstrated that he was aware of the law enforcement officers pursuing him because, according to the testimony of an officer, Martin veered around another officer\u2019s vehicle, which had its blue lights activated, struck a parked vehicle, continued driving at a high rate of speed until he hit a curb and blew a tire, and fled on foot into a female\u2019s nearby apartment. Under these circumstances, the district court did not plainly err in finding that he acted recklessly, and enhancing Martin\u2019s sentence for reckless endangerment.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
