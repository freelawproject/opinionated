He was sentenced to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment. His counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but raising for the court\u2019s consideration (1) whether the district court erred in denying Seabrook\u2019s motion to suppress; and (2) whether the district court erred in granting the Government\u2019s motion for an upward departure pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7\u00a7 5K2.2, 5K2.21, p.s. (2005). Seabrook has filed a pro se supplemental brief asserting that the court erred in allowing the prosecutor to make improper statements during the course of the trial. The Government did not file a reply brief. After reviewing the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-15\">This court reviews the factual findings underlying the denial of a motion to suppress for clear error and the legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>400 F.3d 187, 193 (4th Cir.2005). The evidence is construed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below. <em>United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 547 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-16\">Seabrook first contests the voluntariness of his statements made to law enforcement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>officers on the ground that they were taken by investigators in violation of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). A statement is voluntary if it is \u201cthe product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice by its maker.\u201d <em>Sehneckloth v. Bustamante, </em>412 U.S. 218, 225, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973). An analysis of the voluntariness of a statement is derived from the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 226, 93 S.Ct. 2041. The relevant determination regarding voluntariness is whether government agents have overborne the defendant\u2019s will or left his \u201ccapacity for self-determination critically impaired.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 225, 93 S.Ct. 2041. After reviewing the record, we conclude that the district court did not err in denying Seabrook\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Seabrook also argues on appeal that the district court erred in granting the Government\u2019s motion for upward departure under USSG \u00a7\u00a7 5K2.2, 5K2.21, p.s. Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district court must engage in a multistep process at sentencing. The district court must calculate the appropriate advisory Guidelines range by making any necessary factual findings. <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1142, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). The district court should then afford the parties \u201can opportunity to argue for whatever sentence they deem appropriate.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 u.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Then, the sentencing court should consider the resulting advisory Guideline range in conjunction with the factors set out in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 and Supp. 2007), and determine whether the \u00a7 3553(a) factors support the sentence requested by either party. <em>Id. </em>Considering the factors in \u00a7 3553(a) does not require the sentencing court to \u201crobotically tick through\u201d every subsection of \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 3044, 168 L.Ed.2d 759 (2007). The sentencing court may not presume that the Guidelines range is reasonable, and if it decides to impose a sentence outside the Guidelines range it \u201cmust consider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">The appellate court reviews a sentence for reasonableness, focusing on whether the district court abused its discretion, regardless of whether the sentence imposed is inside or outside the Guidelines range. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468 (4th Cir.2007). This involves two steps: first, examining the sentence for significant procedural errors, and second, evaluating the substance of the sentence. <em>Pauley, </em>511 F.3d at 473-74. \u201cSubstantive reasonableness review entails taking into account the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted). While the appellate court may presume a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable, it may not presume a sentence outside the range to be unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>When reviewing a departure, the appeals court considers \u201cwhether the sentencing court acted reasonably both with respect to its decision to impose such a sentence and with respect to the extent of the divergence from the sentencing range.\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez-Villanueva, </em>473 F.3d 118, 123 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-12\">Here, Seabrook\u2019s Guideline sentence was the minimum term of imprisonment required by statute, i.e., ten years. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2K2.4(b). Seabrook was ultimately sentenced to three times the Guidelines sentence based on the Government\u2019s motion for upward departure. In light of the facts of this case and the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>court\u2019s meaningful articulation of its consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the bases for departure, we find the district court\u2019s decision to depart, and the extent of the departure, reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We further find no merit to the claims raised in Seabrook\u2019s pro se supplemental brief. We therefore affirm Seabrook\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Seabrook, in \u2022writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Seabrook requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Seabrook. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
