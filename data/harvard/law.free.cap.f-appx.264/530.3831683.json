Liu originally claimed that she feared being persecuted by the Chinese government because her parents are Falun Gong members. The BIA affirmed the immigration judge\u2019s denial of her claims, but more than two years later, Liu moved to reopen the proceedings based on \u201cchanged personal circumstances.\u201d Specifically, she claimed that she was pregnant and unmarried, and if she returned to China government authorities would force her to abort her pregnancy or undergo sterilization. The BIA denied the motion as untimely. Liu now argues that she is entitled to further proceedings based on changed conditions in China. Because the BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding that Liu had shown only a change in personal circumstances, rather than a change of conditions in China, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Background</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Liu is a 29-year-old native of the Fujian Province in the People\u2019s Republic of China. She arrived in the United States in the summer of 2003 and applied for asylum based on her parents\u2019 membership in Falun Gong. At her asylum hearing Liu testified that she herself was not a Falun Gong member, but that she had helped her parents distribute materials promoting the group. She said that in June 2003 government officials came to her home, smashed her furniture, and tried to arrest her. Liu said that she escaped to a friend's house, and shortly thereafter came to the United States. The IJ did not believe Liu\u2019s story and denied her claims. The BIA summarily dismissed her appeal in June 2004, and Liu did not seek further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">It is unclear from the record why Liu was not then removed to China, but more than two years later, in October 2006, Liu filed a motion to reopen stating that her \u201cpersonal circumstances [had] changed materially.\u201d Liu, who was unmarried, stated that she was five-months\u2019 pregnant and that accordingly she risked being forced to abort her pregnancy or undergo forced sterilization if she returned to China.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In support of her motion Liu submitted a document that she claims was distributed by her home township\u2019s family planning office. The document is entitled \u201cCombine Our Efforts in Thorough Implementation of Family Planning,\u201d and states, in relevant part, that as of February 2006 \u201c \u2018[r]enewed efforts at detention (arrest)\u2019 should be exerted upon unplanned-birth offenders still at large so far.\u201d It also states that \u201c[a]ll firm measures may be taken everywhere to prevent childbirth out of the wedlock.\u201d According to the document, those measures include \u201cmanual miscarriage\u201d or abortion. Liu argued that this document corroborated her claim that she was entitled to further proceedings \u201con the ground of changed personal circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">The BIA denied Liu\u2019s motion as untimely. It found that her claim did not satisfy the exception to the 90-day deadline because Liu had shown only a change in her personal circumstances, not a change in country conditions. It also stated that the family planning document \u201cdoes not show a material <em>change </em>in coercive enforcement practices since the time of [Liu]\u2019s hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">The BIA may reopen removal proceedings after the 90-day filing deadline has expired only if the applicant submits material evidence of changed country conditions that was not available and could not have been presented at her prior hearing. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); <em>Lin v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 708, 710 (7th Cir.2006). This court reviews the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion only. <em>Gomes v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d 746, 752 (7th Cir.2007). Liu argues that the BIA abused its discretion in deeming her motion untimely because, she says, the family planning document she submitted constitutes material evidence of a change in China\u2019s family planning policy. She argues that the document shows that in February 2006 the government began forcing women who violate the policy to undergo forced abortions or sterilization.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">Nowhere in her motion to reopen or accompanying affidavit did Liu argue that conditions in China had changed. Instead she specifically sought relief based on her \u201cchanged personal circumstances\u201d\u2014namely, her pregnancy. We have held that changed personal circumstances, including the birth of a child in the United States, do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>not justify the relevant statutory exception to the 90-day filing requirement for motions to reopen. <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>498 F.3d 758, 760 (7th Cir.2007); <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>440 F.3d 405, 407 (7th Cir.2005). Perhaps recognizing that barrier, Liu now argues that she is entitled to further proceedings because she submitted evidence of a change in China\u2019s enforcement of its family planning policies. But as the government points out, Liu did not argue to the BIA that conditions in China had changed, and thus she has not exhausted her administrative remedies. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Margos v. Gonzales, </em>443 F.3d 593, 599 (7th Cir.2006). Notably, Liu did not file a reply brief to refute the government\u2019s exhaustion argument or to argue that she somehow preserved the issue. <em>See Margos, </em>443 F.3d at 599.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Normally, Liu\u2019s failure to exhaust her claim of changed country conditions would mean that this court lacks jurisdiction to consider the new argument she presents here. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>see also Margos, </em>443 F.3d at 599; <em>Hamdan v. Gonzales, </em>425 F.3d 1051, 1059 n. 14 (7th Cir.2005). But here the BIA addressed the issue <em>sua sponte, </em>stating that the family planning document \u201cdoes not show a material <em>change </em>in coercive enforcement practices since the time of the respondent\u2019s hearing,\u201d and thus concluding that she did not meet the statutory exception for changed country conditions. Although we have not directly decided whether we retain jurisdiction to review unexhausted claims that the BIA addresses <em>sua sponte, </em>the majority of circuits that have addressed the question have held that jurisdiction exists in this situation. <em>See Sidabutar v. Gonzales, </em>503 F.3d 1116, 1119-22 (10th Cir.2007); <em>Ye v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>446 F.3d 289, 296-97 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Abebe v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 1037, 1041 (9th Cir.2005); <em>cf. Nazarova v. INS, </em>171 F.3d 478, 488-89 (7th Cir.1999) (Manion, J., dissenting) (stating that where the BIA addressed an issue sua sponte \u201cit was exhausted to the extent it could be\u201d); <em>but see Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250-51 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that the court lacks jurisdiction to review an otherwise unexhausted claim that the BIA addresses <em>sua </em>sponte.)</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">We find that the BIA\u2019s decision to address the question of changed country conditions preserves our jurisdiction to review the issue. The purpose of the exhaustion requirement is to give the BIA \u201cthe opportunity to apply its specialized knowledge and experience to the matter,\u201d <em>Padilla v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1209, 1213 (7th Cir.2006), and to afford it the chance \u201cto provide the petitioner the ultimate relief requested in the first instance,\u201d <em>Gonzalez v. O\u2019Connell, </em>355 F.3d 1010, 1017 (7th Cir.2004). As the Tenth Circuit recently held, both of these concerns are satisfied when the BIA decides the merits of an issue <em>sua sponte. See Sidabutar, </em>503 F.3d at 1122 (holding that a \u201csubstantive final decision by the BIA on the issues ... is all that is needed to confer our jurisdiction\u201d). Where, as here, the BIA applied its expertise and exercised its discretion to make a substantive ruling on whether Liu had shown changed country conditions, \u201cit would be bizarre\u2014and decidedly unfair to [Liu]\u2014for us to refuse to review that decision.\u201d <em>See Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>272 F.3d 1176, 1186 (9th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). And it is unclear why we should refuse to consider an issue based on a procedural defect\u2014failure to exhaust\u2014that the BIA was willing to overlook. <em>See Abebe, </em>432 F.3d at 1041. Accordingly, we find that we have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>finding that Liu had not shown changed country conditions in China.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">Turning to the merits, Liu argues that the family planning document she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>submitted along with her motion to reopen is sufficient to show changed country conditions. But the document on which Liu relies describes persistent\u2014rather than new\u2014conditions. <em>See Zhao, </em>440 F.3d at 407. It shows that local officials were advocating \u201c[r]enewed efforts\u201d in enforcing family planning policies, suggesting that such efforts had been made previously. It further states that \u201cwe must never show leniency or softness in \u2018working at family planning,\u2019 nor must we loosen our effort or relax our vigilance to any degree in our thinking; rather, we should consider work at family planning as an ongoing task every year.\u201d Nothing in the document announces a new policy or suggests that the coercive tactics it describes had not been used in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Although some combs have held that evidence of new campaigns of forced sterilization\u2014if consistent with government reports describing recent crackdowns\u2014may justify a motion to reopen, <em>see, e.g., Li v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 1371, 1375 (11th Cir.2007); <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>490 F.3d 180, 183 (2d Cir.2007), Liu has not pointed to any evidence supporting her argument that the family planning document describes a change in conditions. Her \u201cnew\u201d evidence is actually consistent with State Department reports she submitted along with her asylum application. The 2002 Country Report states that in at least one province, \u201crules state that \u2018unplanned pregnancies must be aborted immediately.\u2019 \u201d The 1998 profile of China asylum applications notes that some local officials under pressure to meet population targets used methods including forced abortions and sterilization to enforce family planning policies. Liu argues that the family planning document shows that the centralized government now condones such tactics, but it is a mandate from a local family planning office that makes no mention of other government authorities. It shows only that\u2014consistent with the earlier State Department reports\u2014local officials advocate coercive methods of enforcing family planning laws. Because the document is insufficient to show a change in conditions in China, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying her motion to reopen. <em>See Zhao, </em>440 F.3d at 407. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b558-11\">. Liu gave birth to a son in February 2007.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
