We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-23\">As a threshold matter, we reject as foreclosed the government\u2019s contention that we lack jurisdiction over this appeal because a certificate of appealability is required. <em>See Rosas v. Nielsen, </em>428 F.3d 1229, 1231-32 (9th Cir.2005) (per curiam). We also reject the government\u2019s contention that California prisoners do not have a liberty interest in parole. <em>See Sass v. Cal. Bd. of </em>Prison Terms, 461 F.3d 1123, 1127-28 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-24\">Taylor contends that the Board\u2019s reliance on unchanging facts, such as his commitment offense, without proper consideration of evidence of his rehabilitation, deprives him of his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process. We conclude that there was no due process violation because the Board relied on more than just \u201cunchanging\u201d factors in making its determinations; and that there was \u201csome evidence\u201d with \u201csome indicia of reliability\u201d in the record to support each of the chal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>lenged Board decisions. <em>See Biggs v. Terhune, </em>334 F.3d 910, 915 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Accordingly, the California Superior Court\u2019s determination that the Board did not violate Taylor\u2019s due process rights was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>Superintendent v. Hill, 472 </em>U.S. 445, 454-56, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Taylor\u2019s motion to take judicial notice of his 2007 Psychiatric Evaluation Report and his 2007 Prison Counselor\u2019s Report is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"ArA\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
