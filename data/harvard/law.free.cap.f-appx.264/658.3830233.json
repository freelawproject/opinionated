Johnson (\u201cJohnson\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition challenging his conviction for second degree burglary under California state law. The sole claim before us is whether Johnson\u2019s counsel was ineffective because she did not raise, at the time of trial, any issue regarding Johnson\u2019s competence. Because we agree that the record is devoid of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>indication that Johnson exhibited symptoms of incompetence known or knowable to trial counsel at the time of trial, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">A district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 is reviewed <em>de novo. Rodriguez Benitez v. Garcia, </em>495 F.3d 640, 643 (9th Cir.2007). Habeas petitions brought pursuant to AEDPA, as Johnson\u2019s is, must demonstrate that the state court\u2019s decision was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law under United States Supreme Court precedent, or that the determination was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts. <em>Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>538 U.S. 63, 70-73, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003). A state court decision \u201cbased on a factual determination will not be overturned on factual grounds unless objectively unreasonable in light of the evidence presented at the state court proceeding.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 324, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">To prevail on a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, Johnson \u201cmust show [1] that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient\u2014that is, that it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u2014and [2] that \u2018counsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to deprive [Johnson] of a fair trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Davis v. Woodford, </em>384 F.3d 628, 641 (9th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).) Review of counsel\u2019s performance under the first <em>Strickland </em>prong is \u201c \u2018highly deferential\u2019 and must adopt the counsel\u2019s perspective at the time of the challenged conduct in order to \u2018avoid the distorting effects of hindsight.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jennings v. Woodford, </em>290 F.3d 1006, 1012 (9th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-12\">Johnson argues that his counsel was ineffective based principally on the fact that, several months after his trial but prior to sentencing, the trial court declared Johnson incompetent. The trial court\u2019s determination of incompetence was made in reliance on two reports by a state psychologist. But neither of the psychologist\u2019s reports opined that Johnson was incompetent at the time of trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nor is there any other evidence from the trial record suggesting that Johnson was incompetent at that time. Thus, Johnson\u2019s counsel was under no obligation to investigate or raise his competence and her performance was not deficient for failing to do so. <em>Douglas v. Woodford, </em>316 F.3d 1079, 1085 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201cTrial counsel has a duty to investigate a defendant\u2019s mental state <em>if there is evidence to suggest that the defendant is impaired.\u201d) </em>(emphasis added). If anything, the trial record affirmatively shows that Johnson-who inquired about the racial composition of the jury and the manner of proof for his prior convictions-had a \u201crational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him\u201d at that time. <em>Godinez v. Moran, </em>509 U.S. 389, 396, 113 S.Ct. 2680, 125 L.Ed.2d 321 (1993) (internal citation omitted). The reviewing state court\u2019s decision, which rejected Johnson\u2019s claim for ineffective assistance counsel on this record, was therefore not \u201cobjectively unreasonable.\u201d <em>Miller-El, </em>537 U.S. at 324, 123 S.Ct. 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b684-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
