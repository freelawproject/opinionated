Nov. 20, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">As a preliminary matter, because Babalola did not petition for review of the BIA\u2019s February 2006 decision denying her first motion to reopen, we must limit our review to its November 2006 decision denying her second such motion. <em>Cf. Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 89-90 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam). An abuse of discretion may be found when the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 233-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding that Babalola\u2019s motion to reopen was both untimely and number-barred, and that she did not qualify for equitable tolling of the time and numerical limitations. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) (noting that a party may file only one motion to reopen, which must be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered). While the number bar and 90-day deadline may be equitably tolled to accommodate claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, <em>see Jin Bo Zhao v. INS, </em>452 F.3d 154, 156-57 (2d Cir.2006), the BIA properly found that Babalola failed to comply with the threshold requirements set forth in <em>In re Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637, 639 (B.I.A. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">Specifically, Babalola failed to include with her motion \u201ca statement as to whether [she] filed a complaint with any disciplinary authority regarding counsel\u2019s conduct and, if a complaint was not filed, an explanation for not doing so.\u201d <em>Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 59 (2d Cir.2005) (citing <em>In re Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 639). We have previously noted that \u201can alien who has failed to comply substantially with the <em>Lozada </em>requirements in her motion to reopen before the BIA forfeits her ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\u201d <em>Jian Yun Zheng v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>409 F.3d 43, 47 (2d Cir.2005) (holding that the petitioner was not entitled to claim ineffective assistance because she \u201cdid not comply with the <em>Lozada </em>requirements, and made no effort to explain her lack of compliance\u201d); <em>cf. Esposito v. INS, </em>987 F.2d 108, 111 (2d Cir.1993) (\u201cEsposito did not file a complaint with any disciplinary authority, <em>but provided a reasonable explanation </em>in his affidavit.... We accordingly conclude that Esposito met the <em>Lozada </em>requirements ... and proceed to the merits of his [ineffectiveness] claim.\u201d (emphasis added)). Because Babalola\u2019s motion was untimely and did not qualify for equitable tolling, the BIA\u2019s denial was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-12\">Moreover, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Babalola failed to establish that her motion to reopen to apply for asylum qualified for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>exception to the time and numerical limitations based on \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d in Nigeria. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). The BIA properly noted that, with respect to Babalola\u2019s personal risk of suffering female genital mutilation (\u201cFGM\u201d), there was no evidence in the record that conditions in Nigeria had changed since her May 1999 hearing. Indeed, the most recent country report in the record, the U.S. State Department\u2019s 2005 Report on Human Rights Practices in Nigeria, stated that the incidence of FGM has declined steadily in the past fifteen years. <em>See </em>U.S. Dep\u2019t of State, Nigeria: Country Reports on Human Rights Practices\u20142005 (Mar. 8, 2006), http://www.state.gOv/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2005/61586.htm. In addition, the BIA properly found that the birth of Babalola\u2019s three daughters in the United States did not constitute \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d <em>in Nigeria. See Jian Huan Guan v. BIA, </em>345 F.3d 47, 49 (2d Cir.2003). Accordingly, the BIA\u2019s denial of Babalola\u2019s motion was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. The pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
