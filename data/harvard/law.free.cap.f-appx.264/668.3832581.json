To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion, <em>Singh v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 1050, 1052 (9th Cir.2000), and we grant the petition for review in part, dismiss it in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-12\">The BIA abused its discretion in denying Gutierrez\u2019s motion to reopen because the record does not contain a signed certified mail return receipt to indicate that Gutierrez was properly served with the Order to Show Cause (\u201cOSC\u201d). <em>See Chaidez v. Gonzales, </em>486 F.3d 1079, 1087 (9th Cir.2007) (holding that under former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b(c)(1) the government has the burden of demonstrating by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that an alien or a responsible person at her address signed the certified mail return receipt for her OSC).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-17\">Accordingly, we grant the petition in part and remand for further proceedings. <em>See INS v. Vertura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-17, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam). In light of our disposition, we need not reach Gutierrez\u2019s contention concerning lack of notice of her hearing and asylum interview. On remand, the BIA should, if necessary, address Gutierrez\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-18\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Gutierrez\u2019s contention concerning her pending application for Temporary Protected Status because she did not raise it before the BIA and thereby failed to exhaust her administrative remedies. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (explaining that this court lacks jurisdiction to review contentions not raised before the agency).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-19\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED in part; DISMISSED in part; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b695-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
