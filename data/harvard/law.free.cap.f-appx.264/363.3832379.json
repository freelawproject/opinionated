ELROD, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b390-24\">Plaintiffs-Appellants (collectively \u201cSilver Slipper\u201d) appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of them complaint for lack of admiralty jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333(1). For the reasons discussed below, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-25\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-26\">Silver Slipper owned the President Casino-Broadwater, a casino barge that was permanently moored in the Broadwater Beach Marina in Biloxi, Mississippi. The marina was almost completely surrounded by a land mass occupied by a parking lot, except for an opening about equal to the width of the casino that provided a means <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>of ingress and egress for yachts moored in the marina. The casino was mounted on a steel barge moored to six steel dolphins using heavy \u201cH\u201d beams and received water and electricity from land-based sources. It was three stories tall and contained gaming facilities, restaurants, and other entertainment facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina ripped the casino free of its moorings, carried it several thousand feet across the flood waters and a highway, and crashed it into a hotel owned by Eli Investments, LLC (\u201cEli\u201d). Silver Slipper subsequently filed suit seeking exoneration from or limitation of liability under the Limitation of Liability Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 186 <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Eli answered Silver Slipper\u2019s complaint and filed a counterclaim, seeking recovery of damages from the casino\u2019s collision into its hotel. Eli then filed a motion to dismiss Silver Slipper\u2019s complaint, which the district court granted on the basis that Silver Slipper could not establish admiralty jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333(1). The district court reasoned that because the casino was indefinitely moored in a marina, received electricity and water from land-based sources, and was not practically capable of being transported over water, it was not a \u201cvessel\u201d for purposes of admiralty jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">On appeal, Silver Slipper argues that regardless of whether its casino would have been considered a vessel while moored in the marina, Hurricane Katrina \u201c\u2018resurrected\u2019 [and] breath[ed] new life into her,\u201d thereby demonstrating that the casino was capable of being used for transportation over navigable waters and was therefore a vessel for purposes of admiralty jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s dismissal of Silver Slipper\u2019s claim for lack of admiralty jurisdiction. <em>See, e.g., Musslewhite v. State Bar of Texas, </em>32 F.3d 942, 945 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">The Limitation of Liability Act provides that a vessel owner\u2019s liability for certain claims may be limited to the value of the owner\u2019s interest in the vessel at the termination of the voyage and the freight monies earned by the vessel owner during the voyage. <em>See </em>46 U.S.C. \u00a7 30501 <em>et seq. </em>Silver Slipper may invoke limitation of liability under the Act only if admiralty jurisdiction exists under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331(1). <em>See Guillory v. Outboard Motor Corp., </em>956 F.2d 114, 115 (5th Cir.1992) (\u201cThe Limitation of Liability Act does not confer jurisdiction upon federal courts. That must come from our admiralty jurisdiction . . . . \u201d). For admiralty jurisdiction to attach, Silver Slipper \u201cmust satisfy the conditions both of location and of connection with maritime activity.\u201d <em>Strong v. B.P. Exploration &amp; Prod., Inc., </em>440 F.3d 665, 669 (5th Cir.2006). In applying the location test, we \u201cdetermine whether the tort occurred on navigable water or whether the injury suffered on land was caused by a vessel on navigable water.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b391-14\">The issue in this case is thus whether Silver Slipper\u2019s casino constituted a vessel for purposes of admiralty jurisdiction. Applying well-settled law, we hold that it did not. In <em>Stewart v. Dutra Construction Co., </em>the Supreme Court explained that the term \u201cvessel\u201d as used in 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 3 \u201cincludes every description of water-craft or other artificial contrivance used, or capable of being used, as a means <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>of transportation on water.\u201d 543 U.S. 481, 489, 125 S.Ct. 1118, 160 L.Ed.2d 932 (2005). The Court also emphasized, however, that \u201ca watercraft is not \u2018capable of being used\u2019 for maritime transport in any meaningful sense if it has been permanently moored or otherwise rendered practically incapable of transportation or movement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 494, 125 S.Ct. 1118. Accordingly, we agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that the casino, which was permanently moored in a marina, received electricity and water from land-based sources, and was not practically capable of being transported over water, did not constitute a vessel for purposes of admiralty jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">While it is true, as Silver Slipper contends, that this court has interpreted <em>Stew-aH </em>as signaling \u201ca significant broadening of the set of unconventional watercraft that must be deemed vessels,\u201d <em>Holmes v. Atl. Sounding Co., Inc., </em>437 F.3d 441, 448 (5th Cir.2006), <em>Stewart </em>did not expand the term to include permanently-moored casinos. Such is evident from the fact that <em>Stewart </em>cited <em>Pavone v. Mississippi Riverboat Amusement Corp., </em>52 F.3d 560, 570 (5th Cir.1995), for the proposition that a \u201cfloating casino was no longer a vessel where it \u2018was moored to the shore in a semi-permanent or indefinite manner.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stewart, </em>543 U.S. at 494, 125 S.Ct. 1118.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Moreover, in a subsequent case, we specifically held that, \u201c[e]ven after <em>StewaH, </em>an indefinitely moored floating casino ... is not a \u2018vessel\u2019 for purposes of admiralty jurisdiction.\u201d <em>De La Rosa v. St. Charles Gaming Co., Inc., </em>474 F.3d 185, 188 (5th Cir.2006). Much like Silver Slipper\u2019s casino, the casino at issue in <em>De La Rosa </em>was \u201cmoored to the land by lines tied to steel pilings [and] receive[d] water, telephone lines, sewer lines, cable television and data processing lines from land-based sources,\u201d and \u201c[fits operations [were] entirely gaming-related, and not maritime in nature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 187. Notwithstanding Silver Slipper\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Pavone </em>and <em>De La Rosa </em>by arguing that its casino was \u201cdefinitely in navigation\u201d when it struck the hotel, the unfortunate fact that Hurricane Katrina blew the casino across a highway and into a hotel did not suddenly transform a non-vessel into a practically navigable watercraft.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">Finding no error in the district court\u2019s dismissal of Silver Slipper\u2019s claim for lack of admiralty jurisdiction, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b390-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.S</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b391-7\">. After Silver Slipper filed its complaint, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 186 <em>et seq. </em>was recodified as 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 30501 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
