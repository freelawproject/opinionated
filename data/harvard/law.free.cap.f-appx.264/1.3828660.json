Judges Tacha, McConnell, and Gorsuch are judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 291(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b27-13\">\n<em>JUDGMENT</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"Ae\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b27-14\">This appeal was considered on the record from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, and on the papers filed by appellant, who is proceeding pro se and <em>in forma pauperis. </em>On December 3, 2007, 258 Fed.Appx. 341, appellant was ordered to show cause why the district court\u2019s judgment should not be summarily affirmed. Appellant filed an \u201cAmendment for a Petition for Reconsideration En Banc,\u201d which the clerk treated as a petition for rehearing en banc and dismissed as moot because no judges of this court are available to constitute an en banc court. Upon further review, and liberally construing appellant\u2019s pro se filings, <em>see Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), appellant\u2019s \u201cAmendment\u201d is deemed responsive to the show-cause order. Accordingly, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b27-17\">ORDERED that the order to show cause be discharged. It is</p>\n<p id=\"b27-18\">FURTHER ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s judgment be affirmed. In his Amendment, appellant argues that the district court should not have dismissed this case because no defendant filed a motion to dismiss. However, the district court determined that it lacked jurisdiction to review decisions of this court, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1254, 1291, or the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, <em>see Dist. of Columbia Ct. of App. v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 482, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983). It was proper for the district court to analyze its own jurisdiction sua sponte and dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(h)(3) (\u201cIf the [district] court determines at any time that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, the court must dismiss the action.\u201d). The remainder of appellant\u2019s points are irrelevant or unintelligible. It is</p>\n<p id=\"b27-19\">FURTHER ORDERED that appellant\u2019s \u201cPetition for Rehearing En Banc,\u201d filed January 10, 2008, construed by the court as a motion for reconsideration of the clerk\u2019s December 28, 2007, order dismissing appellant\u2019s Amendment as moot, be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-20\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C. Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
