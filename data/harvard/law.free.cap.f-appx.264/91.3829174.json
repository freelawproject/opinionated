Gordon-Uruakpa denying her applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Yan Ping Ren, </em>No. A 96 395 313 (B.I.A. Feb. 23, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 96 395 313 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City, July 6, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">On appeal to the BIA, Ren\u2019s previous counsel, Henry N. Diaz, argued that the IJ erred in denying Ren\u2019s asylum claim; he said nothing about Ren\u2019s claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief. Ren\u2019s present counsel, Dehai Zhang, argues in the petition for review that the IJ erred in denying Ren\u2019s claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief; he says nothing about Ren\u2019s claim for asylum. We are perplexed as to present counsel\u2019s strategy in arguing only those claims that are now barred by prior counsel\u2019s failure to exhaust them, <em>see Karaj v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 113, 119 (2d Cir.2006), and by waiving the only claim that might otherwise remain viable, <em>see Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005). We are even more perplexed by this counsel\u2019s failure to submit a reply brief on this issue after respondent specifically pointed it out. Whatever his reasons, he has failed to claim, much less demonstrate manifest injustice or any other ground on which we might conceivably review his client\u2019s claims and we therefore have no choice but to dismiss her petition for review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-15\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED. As we have completed our review, petitioner\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b118-11\">. Even if we chose to ignore petitioner's waiver, however, we would deny the petition because the agency's adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Dong Gao v. BIA, </em>482 F.3d 122, 126 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
