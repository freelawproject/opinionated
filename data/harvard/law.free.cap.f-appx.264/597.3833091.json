We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Paudencio-Castaneda contends that the district court erred by making factual findings concerning the date of removal in order to increase his sentence pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. We conclude that there was error, but it was harmless. <em>See United States v. Zepeda-Martinez, </em>470 F.3d 909, 913 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Paudencio-Castaneda also contends that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights by imposing a sentence above the advisory Guidelines range of 6-12 months pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 based on facts that were neither found by a jury nor admitted by him. This contention lacks merit. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 233, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">In addition, Paudencio-Castaneda contends that it was error for the district court to increase his sentence pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) because the indictment did not allege that he was previously removed subsequent to his prior conviction. We conclude there was error, but it was harmless. <em>See United States v. Salazar-Lopez, </em>506 F.3d 748, 751-55 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">The Government\u2019s motion to supplement the record is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b623-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
