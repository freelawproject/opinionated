Concluding that Lombard\u2019s \u00a7 301 claim was time-barred, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Chrome Craft. Because the court permissibly concluded that Lombard\u2019s internal union appeal did not toll the statute of limitations for his claim against Chrome Craft, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Chrome Craft discharged Lombard in August 2003, after Lombard allegedly violated a shop rule in the relevant collective bargaining agreement (CBA). Consistent with the CBA\u2019s grievance procedures, Lombard\u2019s union filed a grievance on his behalf, seeking reinstatement of Lombard\u2019s employment and asking that Lombard be \u201cmade whole in all ways.\u201d At stage four of the five-step grievance process, the union and Chrome Craft mediated the dispute and proposed a settlement to Lombard, offering him severance pay and a change in the nature of his discharge from a termination to a layoff. Lombard rejected the proposed settlement, and on February 24, 2004, the union notified Lombard that his grievance \u201chas been withdrawn at the Fourth Step of mediation\u201d and that \u201cthe Union will not pursue this grievance to Step Five of arbitration.\u201d The union notified Chrome Craft of its decision to withdraw Lombard\u2019s grievance on April 20, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">In accordance with his union\u2019s constitution, Lombard appealed the local union\u2019s decision to withdraw his grievance on March 18, 2004. On January 3, 2005, the national union granted his appeal because the local union\u2019s \u201cdecision to settle [the] grievance ... was not properly investigated in order to make a rational decision.\u201d On January 11, the union\u2019s president \u201cremanded\u201d Lombard\u2019s grievance to the local union \u201cwith instructions to reinstate the grievance at the step in which it was withdrawn.\u201d Two weeks later, the union asked Chrome Craft to reinstate the grievance at \u201cStep 5, Arbitration.\u201d On February 7, Chrome Craft denied the union\u2019s request because \u201cthe Company clearly had just cause for the termination\u201d and because, \u201c[a]s [the union] know[s], Chrome Craft is under no obligation to [reinstate a grievance] under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement between the parties.\u201d The union notified Lombard of Chrome Craft\u2019s denial on February 14. Lombard sought an additional union appeal in April, to which the union responded that \u201cthere is no[] further remedy available\u201d because, \u201c[a]bsent a reinstate[ment] agreement^] the Union is without power to force the Company to reinstate the grievance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">On May 24, 2005, while still pursuing his internal union appeal, Lombard filed a complaint against Chrome Craft and the union in Michigan state court, alleging that Chrome Craft discharged him without good cause in violation of the CBA and that the union breached its duty of fair representation \u201cby withdrawing his grievance and refusing to demand arbitration without a rational basis.\u201d After Chrome Craft and the union removed the action to federal court, they moved for summary judgment. The district court granted the union\u2019s motion because Lombard \u201chas failed to exhaust his internal union remedies.\u201d And it granted the company\u2019s motion because Lombard\u2019s \u201cclaims against it are barred by the applicable statute of limitations,\u201d rejecting Lombard\u2019s argument that his internal union appeal tolled the statute of limitations against Chrome Craft. On appeal, Lombard challenges only the summary-judgment decision in favor of Chrome Craft.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">To decide whether the applicable six-month statute of limitations, <em>see DelCostello v. Int\u2019l Bhd. of Teamsters, </em>462 U.S. 151, 172, 103 S.Ct. 2281, 76 L.Ed.2d 476 (1983), bars Lombard\u2019s claim, we must determine (1) when the cause of action accrued and (2) whether anything tolled the limitations period, <em>see Robinson v. Cent. Brass Mfg. Co., </em>987 F.2d 1235, 1239 (6th Cir.1993). A hybrid \u00a7 301/fair representation claim ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>crues against both the union and the employer when the employee knew or should have known of the acts constituting either the employer\u2019s alleged violation or the union\u2019s alleged breach, whichever occurs later. <em>Id. </em>Lombard does not challenge the district court\u2019s holding that his cause of action accrued on February 24, 2004. And with good reason: that is when the union notified him that his grievance \u201chas been withdrawn\u201d and that it \u201cwill not pursue th[e] grievance to ... arbitration,\u201d giving Lombard everything he needed to know to discover or at least be able to discover through \u201creasonable diligence ... the acts constituting the [union\u2019s] alleged violation,\u201d <em>id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Noble v. Chrysler Motors Corp., </em>32 F.3d 997, 1001 (6th Cir.1994); <em>McCreedy v. Local Union No. 971, UAW, </em>809 F.2d 1232, 1236 (6th Cir.1987); <em>Plunkett v. Smurfit-Stone Container Corp., </em>247 Fed.Appx. 604, 606 (6th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">What matters then is tolling. Did Lombard\u2019s internal union appeal, which began on March 18, 2004, and was still pending when he filed his complaint on May 24, 2005, toll the limitations period? In <em>Robinson v. Central Brass Manufacturing Co., </em>987 F.2d 1235, we addressed \u201cwhether the statute of limitations should be tolled if a discharged employee chose to pursue the [union] appeals process before filing a hybrid \u00a7 301/fair representation claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1240. We said two things of pertinence: \u201cFirst, in order for the statute of limitations to be tolled, the internal union appeal must be able to afford the claimant some relief <em>from the defendant\u201d; </em>and, \u201c[s]econd, ... whether to toll the limitations period is a question within the discretion of the district court ... [that] must be analyzed\u201d on a case-by-case basis. <em>Id. </em>at 1242 (emphasis omitted and added); <em>see also id. </em>at 1240-42 (discussing factors for district courts to consider in exercising their discretion, including whether the internal union appeal would be adequate to reactivate the employee\u2019s grievance or to award him the relief sought under \u00a7 301, whether exhaustion of internal procedures would unreasonably delay the employee\u2019s opportunity to obtain a judicial hearing on the merits of his claim and whether it was difficult for the employee to determine that the internal union remedies were completely futile); <em>Garrish v. UAW, </em>417 F.3d 590, 595 (6th Cir.2005) (applying <em>Robinson </em>and \u201creviewing] a district court\u2019s decision regarding equitable tolling for an abuse of discretion\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\"><em>Robinson </em>held that the claimant\u2019s internal union appeal did not toll the statute of limitations against his former employer because a \u201csuccessful internal union appeal c[ould] not lead to reinstatement of [his] employee [status] or reactivation of [his] grievance.\u201d 987 F.2d at 1243. Put differently, because Robinson\u2019s internal union appeal \u201ccould only provide relief from the Union\u201d and \u201ccould not provide any relief from [Robinson\u2019s former employer]\u201d\u2014 which \u201cwas not a party to th[e] internal appeal, had not sanctioned or acknowledged the internal appeals process, and was not bound by any ensuing judgment\u201d\u2014that appeal did not toll the limitations period against the employer. <em>Id. </em>at 1243-44; <em>cf id. </em>at 1244 (holding that the internal appeals process did toll the statute of limitations with respect to Robinson\u2019s claim against the union because the \u201cinternal appeals process could have provided Robinson with partial relief from the Union\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\"><em>Robinson </em>controls us here. Although \u201c[s]ome employers and unions have, through collective bargaining, agreed to allow the reinstatement of withdrawn grievances where a union tribunal reverses the union\u2019s initial decision,\u201d <em>Clayton v. UAW, </em>451 U.S. 679, 691 n. 18, 101 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>2088, 68 L.Ed.2d 538 (1981) (alteration in original and internal quotation marks omitted), Chrome Craft and its union, like the parties in <em>Robinson, </em>did not enter into any such agreement. Nor should this have been a surprise to anyone. Chrome Craft made the point when it denied the union\u2019s request to reinstate Lombard\u2019s grievance voluntarily. <em>See </em>JA 278 (\u201cAs you know, Chrome Craft is under no obligation to [reinstate Lombard\u2019s grievance] under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement between the parties.\u201d). And the union made the same,point in its letter to Lombard. <em>See </em>D. Ct. Doc. 23, Ex. 20 (\u201cAbsent a reinstate[ment] agreement the Union is without power to force the Company to reinstate the grievance. Accordingly, there is no[] further remedy available.\u201d). Once the union withdrew Lombard\u2019s grievance, \u201cthe internal appeals process could not provide <em>any </em>relief from\u201d Chrome Craft, and that process accordingly did not toll the statute of limitations against the company. <em>Robinson, </em>987 F.2d at 1244.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Lombard responds to <em>Robinson </em>with two related points: (1) his internal union appeal was not futile at the time it began since the union did not withdraw his grievance until after he filed his appeal; and (2) Chrome Craft\u2019s CBA, unlike <em>Robinson\u2019s </em>CBA, does not limit the time when the union could demand arbitration. These distinctions do not release Lombard from the pull of <em>Robinson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">First, we agree with Lombard that his internal appeal became futile with respect to Chrome Craft only after the union notified the company of its decision to withdraw his grievance. But we fail to see how this helps him. Lombard admittedly filed his internal union appeal with the mistaken understanding that the union had already withdrawn his grievance\u2014the union\u2019s February 24 letter, recall, informed Lombard that his grievance \u201chas been withdrawn,\u201d and he thought until sometime in 2006 that the union had in fact withdrawn his grievance on or prior to February 24. That understanding, though incorrect at the time Lombard filed his internal union appeal, became correct on April 20, when the union notified Chrome Craft that Lombard\u2019s grievance \u201cis hereby withdrawn at the mediation step and is closed.\u201d In other words, beginning no later than April 20\u2014over a year before he filed his complaint in this case\u2014Lombard correctly understood that his union had withdrawn his grievance. Even if we assume that the statute of limitations was tolled until April 20, Lombard\u2019s claim remains time-barred by the six-month limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Second, it does not change matters that <em>Robinson\u2019s </em>CBA \u201cmade clear ... that a successful internal union appeal [could] not lead to reinstatement of an employee or reactivation of a grievance,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1243, while Chrome Craft\u2019s CBA is silent on the point. To the extent Lombard was oblivious to the fact that the internal union appeal could not give him relief from his employer, he had ample reason to know about it because \u201ca union member is responsible for knowing the contents of [his] collective bargaining agreement.\u201d <em>Id.; cf. Monroe v. UAW, </em>723 F.2d 22, 26 (6th Cir.1983) (\u201cThe balance of efficiency requires the union member to determine whether the remedy is futile.\u201d). And \u201cthere is no provision in the CBA that could even arguably give the Union the right to reinstate a grievance once it is withdrawn,\u201d as the district court correctly observed, making it \u201cclear to [Lombard] that when the Union [withdrew his grievance], the <em>only </em>private dispute mechanism that could have provided [him] with relief from [Chrome Craft] was exhausted and the limitations period began to run,\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>987 F.2d at 1243; <em>cf. Clayton, </em>451 U.S. at 693, 101 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>2088 (\u201c[W]here an aggrieved employee cannot obtain either the substantive relief he seeks or reactivation of his grievance, national labor policy would not be served by requiring exhaustion of internal remedies. In such cases, exhaustion would be a useless gestee ... [because t]he employee would still be required to pursue judicial means to obtain the relief he seeks under \u00a7 301.\u201d). Moreover, to the extent Lombard \u201cmisunderstood the nature of possible internal remedies and thought that they included reinstatement[,] ... this misunderstanding ... cannot be linked to [Chrome Craft\u2019s] actions, statements, or policies.\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>987 F.2d at 1243. On this record, we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in rejecting Lombard\u2019s argument that his internal union appeal tolled the statute of limitations against Chrome Craft.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">For these reasons, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
