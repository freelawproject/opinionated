Appx. \u00a7 1903(a) (now codified in 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 70503).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">On appeal, Rios first argues that the district court abused its discretion in admitting evidence regarding his contemporaneous drug use and prior drug conviction, under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b), to address his knowledge and intent regarding the instant drug charges. Second, Rios argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for mistrial based on prosecutorial misconduct in the government\u2019s closing arguments. Finally, he argues that the district court violated his constitutional rights by making factual determinations regarding the amount of drugs involved in the instant offenses, for the purposes of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to admit or exclude Rule 404(b) evidence of extrinsic acts for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Matthews, </em>431 F.3d 1296, 1311 (11th Cir.2005). Although evidence of other crimes or bad acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person, it may be admissible for other purposes, such as to prove intent or knowledge. Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). In a criminal case, upon the defendant\u2019s request, the prosecution must provide reasonable notice of the bad acts evidence it intends to use at trial. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">Rule 404(b) evidence is admissible if: (1) it is relevant to an issue other than the defendant\u2019s character; (2) sufficient proof would allow a jury to find that the defendant committed the extrinsic act; and (3) its probative value is not substantially outweighed by its undue prejudice, and it meets the other requirements of Rule 403. <em>Matthews, </em>431 F.3d at 1310-11. Under Rule 403, otherwise relevant evidence may be excluded if \u201cits probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-10\">Because Rule 403 allows the exclusion of otherwise probative evidence, it must only be used sparingly and the district court must strike the balance in favor of admissibility. <em>United States v. Fortenberry, </em>971 F.2d 717, 721 (11th Cir.1992). If the government presents a strong case regarding the defendant\u2019s intent and knowledge, outside of the Rule 404(b) evidence, the court should be more willing to exclude the Rule 404(b) evidence as overly prejudicial. <em>Matthews, </em>431 F.3d at 1312. If the issue of the defendant\u2019s knowledge or intent is determinative, it is less likely that Rule 404(b) evidence showing knowledge or intent would be needlessly cumulative or prejudicial, under Rule 403. <em>United States v. Gaskell, </em>985 F.2d 1056, 1063 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-11\">The district court should consider the following three factors in determining whether the government\u2019s notice of intent to use Rule 404(b) evidence was reasonable: \u201c(1) When the Government, through timely preparation for trial, could have learned of the availability of the [evidence]; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>(2) The extent of prejudice to the opponent of the evidence from a lack of time to prepare; and (3) How significant the evidence is to the prosecution\u2019s case.\u201d <em>United States v. Perez-Tosta, </em>36 F.3d 1552, 1562 (11th Cir.1994). In <em>Perez-Tosta, </em>after considering the above-stated factors, we found that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the government\u2019s notice of intent to use Rule 404(b) evidence, provided immediately before <em>voir dire </em>and six days before presentation of the evidence, was reasonable. <em>Id </em>at 1560, 1562-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Based on our review of the record, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of Rios\u2019s heroin use and possession, which occurred contemporaneously with the instant offenses, and his prior cocaine conviction. The government was required to prove Rios\u2019s knowledge and intent regarding the hashish oil for convictions on the drug charges, and his defense depended on the argument that the government did not prove those elements beyond a reasonable doubt. Even though other evidence might have shown his knowledge and intent, the record does not indicate that evidence of his heroin use and possession and prior cocaine conviction was needlessly cumulative. Also, to the extent that Rios preserved any error regarding the timeliness of the government\u2019s notice of intent to use Rule 404(b) evidence, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that notice was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a requested mistrial based on prosecutorial misconduct for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Knowles, </em>66 F.3d 1146, 1163 (11th Cir.1995). We review a claim of prosecutorial misconduct by assessing \u201c(1) whether the challenged comments were improper, and (2) if so, whether they prejudicially affected the substantial rights of the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Arias-Izquierdo, </em>449 F.3d 1168, 1177 (11th Cir.2006), ce<em>rt. denied, Olivares-Samon v. U.S., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 521, 166 L.Ed.2d 387 (2006). The comments prejudicially affected a defendant\u2019s substantial rights if \u201ca reasonable probability arises that, but for the remarks, the outcome [of the trial] would be different.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>149 F.3d 1298, 1301 (11th Cir.1998) (citations omitted). In assessing the prejudicial impact of comments, we evaluate them in the context of the entire trial and any curative instructions, which may render them harmless. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b891-14\">During closing arguments, the prosecutor is forbidden from making improper suggestions, insinuations, and assertions calculated to mislead or inflame the jury\u2019s passions. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>765 F.2d 1546, 1560 (11th Cir.1985). The government may not rely on the defendant\u2019s bad character for a conviction, unless character is at issue. <em>Id. </em>at 1559. \u201cA prosecutor\u2019s remarks are improper if they attempt to bolster the credibility of a witness based on the government\u2019s reputation or by alluding to evidence not formally before the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Chandler, </em>996 F.2d 1073, 1094 (11th Cir.1993). Disparaging remarks about defense counsel are also improper. <em>United States v. Bourg, </em>598 F.2d 445, 449 (5th Cir.1979).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-15\">A prosecutor acts improperly at closing argument if his argument exceeds the evidence presented. <em>United States v. Bailey, </em>123 F.3d 1381, 1400 (11th Cir.1997). But a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>prosecutor may \u201curge[ ] the jury to draw inferences and conclusions from the evidence produced at trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Johns, </em>734 F.2d 657, 663 (11th Cir.1984). \u201c[A]n attorney\u2019s statements that indicate his opinion or knowledge of the case as theretofore presented before the court and jury are permissible if the attorney makes it clear that the conclusions he is urging are conclusions to be drawn from the evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">The record here demonstrates that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Rios\u2019s motion for a mistrial due to prosecutorial misconduct at closing arguments. First, the record does not reveal any remarks by the prosecutor about the defense counsel or about Rios\u2019s character that prejudiced Rios\u2019s substantial rights. Although the prosecutor referred to Rios\u2019s character at one point, the court sustained Rios\u2019s objection to that statement, and instructed the jury that Rios\u2019s character was not at issue. The prosecutor\u2019s only other references to character were made in telling the jury that Rios\u2019s character was not at issue and the evidence of his drug use and prior conviction should not be used as evidence of his character.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Moreover, the record does not show that Rios\u2019s substantial rights were prejudiced by any improper comments made by the prosecutor regarding inconsistencies in the witness testimony. The prosecutor and the court made clear that the jury was responsible for drawing that conclusion based on the evidence, and the statements by the lawyers were not evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">\u201cWe review constitutional challenges to a sentence <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1321 (11th Cir.2005). In <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Supreme Court held that a district court\u2019s enhancement of a defendant\u2019s sentence based on facts neither found by the jury nor admitted by the defendant violated the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights under a mandatory system of sentencing guidelines. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 232-33, 125 S.Ct. at 749. However, the Sixth Amendment violation would not occur if the district court treated the guidelines as advisory rather than mandatory. <em>Id. </em>at 233, 125 S.Ct. at 749-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">Based on <em>Booker, </em>we have recognized that a district court may enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence based on facts outside of the jury verdict in a non-mandatory guidelines system. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1300 (11th Cir.2005). Therefore, a district court may enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence based on facts- not found by the jury, without violating the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury, if the guidelines are not treated as mandatory. <em>Id. </em>at 1297-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">Because the record makes clear that the district court treated the sentencing guidelines as advisory, rather than mandatory, we conclude that the district court did not violate Rios\u2019s constitutional rights by imposing on him a greater sentence based on its finding that his drug charges involved 31.98 kilograms of hashish oil. For the above-stated reasons, we affirm Rios\u2019s convictions and his 240-month total sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b891-8\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), we adopted as binding precedent all of the decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
