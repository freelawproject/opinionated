On June 29, 2004, at the conclusion of a week-long jury trial, Ramsey was convicted of (1) conspiracy to distribute more than 500 grams of cocaine and more than 50 grams of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846; (2) possession of more than 500 grams of cocaine with the intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B); (3) possession of more than 50 grams of cocaine base with the intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A); (4) possession of more than 500 grams of cocaine with the intent to distribute within 1,000 feet of an elementary school, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 860; and (5) possession of more than 50 grams of cocaine base with the intent to distribute within 1,000 feet of an elementary school, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 860. The District Court sentenced Ramsey to 324 months imprisonment, a term of supervised release of ten years, and a special assessment of $500. For the reasons set forth below, we will affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-20\">In January of 2003, the Philadelphia Police Narcotics Field Unit executed a search warrant for 5466 Morse Street in Philadelphia. Immediately upon entering the residence, the police encountered and arrested Ramsey\u2019s co-defendants, Antuan Dicks and Corey Long. The police found Ramsey in the house\u2019s basement. A complete search of the house resulted in the seizure of a total of 260 grams of cocaine base, 1,194 grams of powder cocaine, two digital scales, an amber pot that had been used to \u201ccook\u201d powder cocaine into cocaine base, and other items of contraband.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>A jury convicted Ramsey of all charges. At the sentencing hearing, Ramsey argued that under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 the guidelines sentencing range was \u201cgreater than necessary to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to deter [appellant] and other individuals and to protect the public.\u201d Additionally, Ramsey advocated for a below-guidelines sentence by arguing that the nature of the offense and his personal characteristics, including the fact that he came from a troubled home, militated in favor of a lower sentence. The District Court rejected Ramsey\u2019s arguments, set his adjusted offense level at 36 and his Criminal History Category at VI, and sentenced Ramsey at the bottom of the resulting guideline range of 324 to 405 months imprisonment. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">In <em>United States v. Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that mandatory application of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines was unconstitutional. 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Under the resulting advisory-guidelines regime, District Courts enjoy significant latitude in imposing criminal sentences. <em>Rita v. United </em>States,-U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Post <em>-Booker, </em>appellate review is limited to reviewing the trial court\u2019s sentence for \u201creasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 327 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-16\">The reasonableness standard of appellate review is akin to abuse of discretion. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 594 (\u201cOur explanation of \u2018reasonableness\u2019 review in the <em>Booker </em>opinion made it pellucidly clear that the familiar abuse-of-discretion standard of review now applies to appellate review of sentencing decisions.\u201d). In conducting a reasonableness review, we must ensure that the sentencing court gave \u201cmeaningful consideration\u201d to the sentencing factors articulated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and \u201creasonably applied them to the circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>Cooper, </em>437 F.3d at 330. It is therefore vital that the District Court \u201cstate adequate reasons for a sentence on the record so that this court can engage in meaningful appellate review.\u201d <em>United States v. King, </em>454 F.3d 187, 196-97 (3d Cir.2006). However, the District Court need not \u201cdiscuss and make findings as to each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors if the record makes clear the court took the factors into account in sentencing.\u201d <em>Cooper, </em>437 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>at 329. The party challenging the sentence has the burden of demonstrating unreasonableness. <em>Id. </em>at 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Here, Ramsey argues that the sentence the District Court imposed is unreasonable because the District Judge \u201cimproperly limited its consideration to only two of the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d At his sentencing hearing, Ramsey advocated for a below-guidelines sentence by arguing that (1) the guideline range was greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals articulated in \u00a7 3553(a)(2); (2) the nature of the offense did not call for a lengthy sentence because that Defendant had not committed a violent crime; and (3) Ramsey\u2019s personal characteristics, including the fact that he came from a troubled home, militated in favor of a lower sentence. Ramsey contends that the District Court focused only on his criminal history, which is covered by \u00a7 3553(a)(1), and the range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines, which is covered by \u00a7 3553(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">At the sentencing hearing, the District Court did focus primarily on the guideline range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines and Ramsey\u2019s lengthy criminal history. However, the Court also addressed\u2014 either explicitly or implicitly\u2014Ramsey\u2019s remaining arguments in favor of a below-guidelines sentence and all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. At Ramsey\u2019s sentencing hearing, the District Court noted that Ramsey\u2019s lengthy criminal history was highly influential in its conclusion that a guideline sentence was necessary to accomplish the statutory purposes set out in \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Similarly, the District Court rejected Ramsey\u2019s contention that the nature of the offense militated in favor of a lower sentence because of Ramsey\u2019s past history of committing violent crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">The District Court did not focus on Ramsey\u2019s personal characteristics and familial history at the time of sentencing. Nonetheless, the record shows that the Court considered Ramsey\u2019s argument that such considerations weighed in favor of a below-guidelines sentence. In response to counsel\u2019s initial arguments, the District Court stated that \u201cI do think that the individual characteristics are of such importance .... \u201d Based upon the record, the sentencing court\u2019s subsequent focus on Ramsey\u2019s criminal history and the nature of the offense appear to have been driven in large measure by the arguments Ramsey and his counsel chose to emphasize.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">To determine whether a sentencing court acted reasonably, we examine the court\u2019s application of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to determine whether it reasonably applied them to the circumstances of the case. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 601-02. \u201cIn doing so, we apply a deferential standard, the trial court being in the best position to determine the appropriate sentence in light of the particular circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>Cooper, </em>437 F.3d at 330. Here, we are satisfied that the District Court gave meaningful consideration to all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and adequately explained its chosen sentence. Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b283-21\">. The District Court exercised jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231.
