Having carefully considered the briefs, the pertinent parts of the record, and the oral argument of counsel, we conclude that, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Deputy Bostic, he lacked even arguable probable cause to arrest Gray.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-18\">Absent probable cause to arrest Gray, Bostic\u2019s handcuffing of her amounted to the use of excessive force. <em>Bashir v. Rockdale County, Ga., </em>445 F.3d 1323, 1332 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cIt follows, then, if an arresting officer does not have the right to make an arrest, he does not have the right to use any degree of force in making that arrest.\u201d); <em>Jackson v. Sauls, </em>206 F.3d 1156, 1171 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201c[I]f a stop or arrest is illegal, then there is no basis for any threat or any use of force .... \u201d); <em>see also Thornton v. City of Macon, </em>132 F.3d 1395, 1400 (11th Cir.1998) (holding that where neither plaintiff \u201cwas suspected of having committed a serious crime, neither posed an immediate threat to anyone, and neither actively resisted arrest .... the officers were not justified in using <em>any </em>force\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-19\">We are also unpersuaded by any of Bostic\u2019s other contentions and conclude that the district court did not err in granting judgment as a matter of law against Bostic.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
