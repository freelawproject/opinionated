We can find no merit in any of those challenges and, accordingly, affirm the conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-14\">First, the district court did not err when it instructed the jury on both the mens rea and public authority theories of defense, because Quintero himself requested that <em>both </em>instructions be given to the jury and both instructions were fairly supported by the evidence. <em>See U.S. v. Middleton, </em>690 F.2d 820, 826 (11th Cir.1982) (\u201cSo long as there is some evidence relevant to the issue or the defense asserted, a trial court must instruct a jury regarding this issue and cannot determine the existence of such a defense as a matter of law.\u201d). The district court was not obliged to grant a mistrial on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-15\">Second, the district court did not abuse its considerable discretion when it gave a modified <em>Allen </em>charge to the jury after the jury said that it had reached an \u201cimpasse\u201d in a clarification note sent to the court following only three hours of deliberation. There is nothing in this record to support Quintero\u2019s claim that the jury did anything other than carefully consider the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>evidence during its additional deliberations. Furthermore, the Government did not, as Quintero contends, eviscerate his defense purportedly by arguing that Quintero admitted to the distribution element of the offense or that his intent to actually distribute cocaine was irrelevant. Instead, the Government argued only that Quintero did not participate in the sale of cocaine at the direction or under the authorization of government agents, did not reasonably believe he was performing an otherwise-criminal act in cooperation with the government agents, and had intended to commit the charged offense for his own gain and on his own initiative. Again, the district court was not obliged to grant a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">Third, the district court committed no error when it denied Quintero\u2019s motion for a mistrial because of the prosecutor\u2019s statement in closing argument that \u201cafter thirty years of lawless behavior in the United States\u201d Quintero should be found guilty. That statement was supported by evidence Quintero himself introduced that he first entered the United States <em>illegally </em>in 1977, had been deported, had returned again illegally and without authorization, was trying to correct his immigration status because he was in the United States illegally and did not want to be deported, and had experience as a drug dealer. However, the district court\u2019s instructions made it abundantly clear that Quintero could not be convicted for any conduct other than that charged in the indictment. Because the evidence against Quintero was very strong, the offending comment was very brief, and any confusion as to the prosecutor\u2019s meaning was promptly corrected by the court, it cannot reasonably be concluded that the jury was influenced by the prosecutor\u2019s very brief comment during closing argument. <em>See U.S. v. Calderon, </em>127 F.3d 1314, 1335 (11th Cir.1997) (holding that prosecutorial misconduct is a basis for reversal \u201conly if, in the context of the entire trial in light of any curative instruction, the misconduct may have prejudiced the substantial rights of the accused\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). Again, the district court was not obliged to grant Quintero a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">Finally, we can discern no clear error of judgment when, in sentencing, the district court imposed a two-level enhancement on Quintero\u2019s sentence for obstruction of justice pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, or because it imposed a sentence above the Sentencing Guidelines range. The district court unambiguously found that Quintero had illegally entered the country after deportation, had participated in a cocaine deal about which he had lied to the jury, and had refused to accept responsibility for his illegal conduct. There was no abuse of discretion here. <em>Kimbrough v. U.S., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 576, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b819-12\">. <em>Allen v.
