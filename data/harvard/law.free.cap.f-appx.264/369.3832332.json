Garza argues that the district court erred in denying: (1) his motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction; (2) his motion to suppress; and (3) his motion for new trial, based on an alleged <em>Brady </em>violation. For the following reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-20\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b396-21\">Defendant-appellant Garza was indicted on one count of forcibly assaulting, resist<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>ing, opposing, impeding, intimidating, and interfering with Joseph A. McGallicher, a law enforcement officer for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (\u201cFWS\u201d), while he was engaged in his official duties, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111. On December 15, 2006, following a two-day trial, a jury found Garza guilty of the offense charged, and he was sentenced to five months confinement in a halfway house, five months home confinement, and a three year term of supervised release, and ordered to pay a $3,000 fine and $100 special assessment fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The events giving rise to Garza\u2019s conviction center on an investigatory traffic stop in Willacy County. On May 24, 2006, Garza was driving south on Willacy County Road 30 (\u201cCR 30\u201d), an unpaved, narrow road with several deep potholes, that runs through the Teniente Tract of the Lower Rio Grande Valley (\u201cEl Teniente Refuge\u201d), a federally owned national wildlife refuge. At the same time, McGallicher was patrolling CR 30 with Charles Rhodes, also an officer for FWS. When the officers, driving north, passed Garza\u2019s truck, they noticed an expired inspection sticker, and turned around to initiate a traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The precise actions of McGallicher and Garza during the traffic stop were disputed at trial. According to McGallicher\u2019s and Rhodes\u2019s testimony, McGallicher walked up to the driver\u2019s side window of Garza\u2019s truck, identified himself, and informed Garza that his inspection sticker was expired. He then requested Garza\u2019s driver\u2019s license and proof of insurance. In response, Garza stated, \u201cYou don\u2019t have authority or jurisdiction to stop me, this is a county road. I will not give you my driver\u2019s license or insurance.\u201d At that point, Garza placed his truck into gear and started to pull away. McGallicher reasserted his jurisdictional authority, ordered Garza to stop, and removed his pepper spray from his holster, warning Garza that if he did not comply, he would be sprayed. In response, Garza stopped the truck and yelled obscenities at the officer. Rhodes testified that he tried to open the passenger side door, but it was locked. While McGallicher was standing at the driver\u2019s side window, Garza began to accelerate the truck again, and McGallicher reached in the driver\u2019s side window, attempting to turn off the ignition. Garza grabbed McGallicher\u2019s arm and shouted, \u201cGet out of my truck.\u201d McGallicher ordered Garza to release him, at which point Garza released McGallicher\u2019s arm for a brief moment and then grabbed his arm a second time. Throughout this exchange, Garza\u2019s truck continued to move forward. McGallicher was unable to free his arm from Garza\u2019s grip and had to sidestep along with the truck, to keep his balance and prevent from being dragged down the road. Rhodes testified that, at that point, he assessed the condition as a deadly force situation and unholstered his service weapon. McGallicher then used his free arm to disperse pepper spray into Garza\u2019s eyes, which caused Garza to let go of McGallicher\u2019s arm. McGallicher was able to pull the keys from the ignition and stop the vehicle. Afterward, McGallicher ordered Garza to exit, but he refused. McGallicher opened the driver\u2019s side door and observed Garza holding his face and shouting obscenities. McGallicher again insisted that Garza exit his truck, and this time, Garza complied and demanded the officers call the Willacy County Sheriff to their location. While waiting for the sheriffs department to respond, Rhodes assisted Garza in washing his eyes out with water. In addition to McGallicher\u2019s and Rhodes\u2019s testimony relaying the aforementioned events, the government produced photographs showing the location where Garza was stopped, the tire marks in the road made by the truck\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>movements, and the distances between those locations.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Nonetheless, Garza testified to a different account of the investigatory stop at trial. According to his testimony, Garza was pulled over by McGallicher and informed of his truck\u2019s expired inspection sticker. McGallicher asked Garza for his driver\u2019s license and proof of insurance, and Garza informed McGallicher that he did not have his driver\u2019s license because he was not carrying his wallet with him. McGallicher made repeated requests for Garza\u2019s license. Garza told McGallicher that the license was at his house, a little over a mile away, and suggested that they both go to the house to retrieve it. McGallicher began to move away from the driver\u2019s door window and toward the rear of the truck. Garza thought that McGallicher was going to follow him home to retrieve his driver\u2019s license, and he turned his face toward the back window of his vehicle to look behind him. At that point, McGallicher pepper sprayed Garza. Thereafter, Garza turned off his truck, exited it, and was subsequently assisted by Rhodes. Garza insists that he neither touched nor dragged McGallicher, and that Rhodes remained in the patrol car during the incident, only exiting after Garza was pepper sprayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Before trial commenced, Garza filed a motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction and a motion to suppress, arguing that because CR 30 did not qualify as a \u201chighway\u201d under Texas law, McGallicher had no jurisdiction to stop Garza and thus was not engaged in official FWS duties. After conducting an evidentiary hearing, the district court denied both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">After his conviction, Garza filed a motion for new trial, submitting that a government report referred to during trial contained exculpatory and impeaching information and was suppressed in violation of <em>Brady. </em>By order and opinion on February 27, 2007, the district court denied Garza\u2019s motion for new trial. Thereafter, Garza filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">\n<em>A. Motion to Dismiss For Want of Jurisdiction and Motion to Suppress</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">We review the district court\u2019s ruling on jurisdiction de novo. <em>Bravo v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 590, 591 (5th Cir.2003). In reviewing a motion to suppress, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. <em>United States v. Bolden, </em>508 F.3d 204 (5th Cir.2007) (citations omitted). Conclusions of law are reviewed de novo and findings of fact for clear error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">Section 111(a)(1), the statute under which Garza was convicted, imposes criminal liability upon one who assaults a federal employee \u201cwhile engaged in or on account of the performance of official duties.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111(a)(1). Congress\u2019s purpose in enacting \u00a7 111(a)(1) was \u201cto protect individual federal officers by providing a federal offense triable in a federal forum to supplement the state statutes for punishment of such attacks.\u201d <em>United States v. Kelley, </em>850 F.2d 212, 214 (5th Cir.1988). Section 111(a)\u2019s protection applies to \u201cany officer or employee of the United States or of any agency in any branch of the United States Government (including any member of the uniformed services),\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114, and, as such, includes FWS officers. The duties of a federal employee are a question of federal law, but whether an assaulted federal employee is \u201cengaged in\u201d official duties when he is assaulted, or whether the assault takes place \u201con account of\u201d these duties, are questions of fact properly submitted to the jury. <em>Kelley, </em>850 F.2d at 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-12\">Garza argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction and his motion to sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>press because McGallicher, as an FWS officer, did not have federal jurisdiction to conduct the investigatory traffic stop for an expired state inspection sticker on CR 30. Garza posits that CR 30 does not qualify as a \u201chighway\u201d as that term is defined in Texas Transportation Code \u00a7 541.302(5) because the road is not publicly maintained by the county, and there are no boundary lines.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, Garza claims that because he never violated the underlying state law, as he was not operating his vehicle on a \u201chighway\u201d without a valid inspection sticker, <em>see </em>Tex. Transp. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 542.001, 548.602, McGallicher\u2019s actions in attempting to enforce said state law could not have been within his scope of duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The National Wildlife Refuge System is regulated under Title 50 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Section 27.31 of that title governs FWS\u2019s control over vehicles traveling within a national wildlife refuge. <em>See </em>50 C.F.R. \u00a7 27.31. In particular, \u00a7 27.31(f) prohibits vehicles traveling on and through public use lands that do not bear valid license plates and are not properly registered and inspected in accordance with applicable state law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the suppression hearing, the government established through the uncontradicted testimony of Louis Jules DuBois, Jr., a land surveyor for FWS, that the subject section of CR 30 running through El Teniente Refuge is property owned by the federal government, and that there are boundary signs within the refuge marking the property as United States Fish and Wildlife property. In addition, Garza admitted to having an expired state inspection sticker. Therefore, McGallicher had federal authority and was acting within the scope of his duties when he stopped Garza\u2019s truck, as Garza was traveling on CR 30 through El Teniente Refuge, property owned by the federal government, without a valid state inspection sticker. <em>See </em>\u00a7 27.31(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">Garza\u2019s argument is based on the mistaken assumption that McGallicher was attempting to enforce a traffic law of the state made applicable to the wildlife refuge area under 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 27.31(a). However, that provision only applies when no other regulation covers the situation,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which is not the case here. Consequently, his jurisdictional argument must fail. Furthermore, as his motion to suppress was predicated on the same jurisdictional theory, we need not reach that issue. The district court properly denied both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">B. <em>Motion for New Trial Based on Brady Violation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">Garza argues that the district court erroneously denied his motion for a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>trial based on the alleged failure of the government to turn over exculpatory and impeaching evidence as required by <em>Brady v. Maryland, 373 </em>U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). While the standard of review for a motion for a new trial is typically abuse of discretion, if the reason for the motion is an alleged <em>Brady </em>violation, then we review the district court\u2019s determination de novo. <em>United States v. Martin, </em>431 F.3d 846, 850 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">\u201cWe review <em>Brady </em>determinations using a three part test under which a defendant must show that: (1) evidence was suppressed; (2) the suppressed evidence was favorable to the defense; and (3) the suppressed evidence was material to either guilt or punishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations and internal quotation omitted); <em>see Stickler v. Greene, </em>527 U.S. 263, 281-82, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999). Favorable evidence includes that which is exculpatory and that which could impeach a prosecution witness. <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 676-77, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985). Evidence is material \u201cif there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Kyles v. Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419, 433, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995) (citation and internal quotation omitted). \u201cA \u2018reasonable probability of a different result\u2019 is shown when the suppression \u2018undermines confidence in the outcome of the trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Graves v. Dretke, </em>442 F.3d 334, 340 (5th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Kyles, </em>514 U.S. at 434, 115 S.Ct. 1555). The materiality test is not a test of the sufficiency of the evidence and harmless error review does not apply. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Kyles, </em>514 U.S. at 435, 115 S.Ct. 1555). The final aspect of materiality to be stressed \u201cis its definition in terms of suppressed evidence considered collectively, not item by item.\u201d <em>Kyles, </em>514 U.S. at 436, 115 S.Ct. 1555.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Garza claims that he was denied due process of law because the government suppressed an investigation report written by MeGallicher, which contained <em>Brady </em>material. The report chronicled the events that form the basis of the indictment and McGallicher\u2019s actions following the incident. Specifically, Garza contends that the following portions of the report contain material, exculpatory and impeaching evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-6\">Charges:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-7\">I called Assistant United States Attorney Terra Bay and informed her of the situation. I asked if I could arrest Garza on Federal Assault on a Federal Officer charges (18 USC 111) and she told me, \u201cno.\u201d She informed me that I could have Willacy County Sheriffs Deputies arrest him for resisting detention or resisting arrest, but that would be up to them. She informed me that if they would not arrest, then I would have to write him tickets for violations and send him home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-8\">Based on AUSA Bay\u2019s advice, I talked to Willacy County Chief Deputy D. Martinez and was informed by him that the County District Attorney would not take the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-9\">On-Going Investigation:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-10\">I contacted Assistant United States Attorney Terra Bay on May 25th and we spoke about the case. During the conversation, AUSA Bay informed me that she did not know that Garza had actually driven his truck approximately 45 feet while holding onto my arm. She informed me she was under the impression that I had stopped him before he began to drive away.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">First, Garza maintains that the Willacy County District Attorney\u2019s denial of prosecution is exculpatory evidence, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>had defense counsel been aware of McGallicher\u2019s report, he would have subpoenaed Willacy County sheriffs department personnel \u201cto confirm that they had declined to prosecute [] Garza.\u201d Second, Garza argues that the report establishes that McGallicher relayed inconsistent narratives of the incident to Bay, the prosecuting attorney, and thus it is exculpatory and impeaching evidence. Garza\u2019s counsel avers that had he been furnished the report prior to the first day of trial, he would have \u201cfiled a motion to disqualify [prosecutor] Bay because of her status as a fact witness who heard prior inconsistent statements\u201d made by McGallicher and \u201cplanned a thorough attack upon McGallicher\u2019s prior inconsistent statements about what happened on May 24, 2006.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">In the district court\u2019s opinion and order denying the motion for new trial, it determined that McGallicher\u2019s report represented discretionary choices whether to bring charges against Garza and did \u201cnot tend to establish [Garza\u2019s] innocence.\u201d Therefore, the district court found that the report was not exculpatory. Also, the district court pointed out that because a close examination of the report and McGallicher\u2019s trial testimony revealed that the two were not incompatible, any alleged inconsistency was neither exculpatory nor impeaching evidence. The district court then proceeded to conclude that McGallicher\u2019s report was also immaterial, and that it had not been suppressed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">Reviewing the district court\u2019s determination de novo, we conclude that even assuming (without deciding) that portions of McGallicher\u2019s report were suppressed and favorable to Garza, the district court\u2019s denial of the motion for new trial was appropriate because the alleged <em>Brady </em>evidence in the report was not material to Gai\u2019za\u2019s guilt. As mentioned above, the report states that Bay initially had a different understanding of the facts of the incident, and that Willacy County authorities declined to prosecute Garza. Even if the report had been used by Garza to develop an alternate strategy for cross-examining McGallicher and had prompted him to question Bay and a Willacy County official,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the absence of the report does not undermine confidence in the jury\u2019s verdict. At best, the report may have called into question what McGallicher initially told Bay. Nevertheless, we are not persuaded that the course of the trial would have been altered had the report been disclosed, considering that: (1) Rhodes presented testimony corroborating McGallicher\u2019s account; (2) photographs of the incident site consistent with both officers\u2019 accounts were presented; (3) additional wildlife refuge personnel testified about encounters they had with Garza in which he behaved aggressively regarding the government\u2019s control of the refuge lands; and (4) close inspection of the report and McGallicher\u2019s testimony reveals the two are likely compatible.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, the fact that Willacy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>County authorities refrained from prosecuting Garza does not undermine the jury\u2019s verdict in light of the fact that Garza was convicted under a federal statute for assaulting a federal officer.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, we are not convinced that there is reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different if the report had been disclosed to Garza prior to trial. <em>See Strickler, </em>527 U.S. at 289, 119 S.Ct. 1986. Because the evidence fails at the materiality prong of the <em>Brady </em>test, the district court\u2019s denial of the motion for new trial was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b396-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th CrR. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b399-6\">. The Texas Transportation Code defines \u201chighway or street\u201d as <em>\"the width between the boundary lines of a publicly maintained way </em>any part of which is open to the public for vehicular travel.\" Tex. Transp. Code Ann. \u00a7 541.302 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b399-7\">. Section 27.31 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-8\">Travel in or use of any motorized or other vehicles ... is prohibited on national wildlife refuges except on designated routes of travel, as indicated by the appropriate traffic control signs or signals ... and subject to the following requirements and limitations:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-13\">(f) The operation of a vehicle which does not bear valid license plates and is not properly certified, registered, or inspected in accordance with applicable State laws is prohibited.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-14\">50 C.F.R. \u00a7 27.31(f).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b399-15\">. Section 27.31(a) provides that <em>\u201cfujnless specifically covered by the general and special regulations set forth in this chapter, </em>the laws and regulations of the State within whose exterior boundaries a national wildlife refuge or portion thereof is located shall govern traffic and the operation and use of vehicles.\" 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 27.31(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b401-6\">. The district court determined that, at best, the report would only give rise to the inference that McGallicher's initial account to Bay was incomplete or misunderstood. And, since the report was disclosed to Garza on the day McGallicher testified at trial, the district court found it had not been suppressed. <em>See Lawrence v. Lensing, </em>42 F.3d 255, 257 (5th Cir.1994) (holding that evidence having impeachment value was not suppressed within the meaning of <em>Brady </em>because it was disclosed by the prosecution at trial).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b401-10\">. Although, the district court determined that evidence of state or federal charging decisions was inadmissible, and Garza does not appeal these evidentiary rulings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b401-11\">. The report states that, based on her initial conversation with McGallicher, Bay \"did not know that Garza had actually driven his truck 45 feet while holding onto [McGallicher\u2019s] arm\" and she understood that \u201c[McGallicher] had stopped [Garza] before he began to drive away.\" As the district court found, this por<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>tion is not inconsistent with McGallicher\u2019s testimony, because at trial he stated that Garza stopped the first time he was ordered, but then drove away a second time. Instead, these statements present an incomplete understanding of the incident from Bay's point of view. Had Garza called Bay to testily as a fact witness, she would have explained, as she did to the district court, that her misunderstanding of McGallicher\u2019s narrative was the result of being distracted while discussing the incident with McGallicher over the telephone and not the result of McGallicher\u2019s misstatements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b402-8\">. We are benefitted by defense counsel\u2019s disclosure as to what his strategy would have been, had he known the information ahead of time. Specifically, he states that he merely would have confirmed that the Willacy County authorities refused prosecution. We are not free to speculate what other unspecified additional evidence consistent with the defense may have been discovered had the information about the refusal to prosecute been disclosed. <em>See Wood v. Bartholomew, </em>516 U.S. 1, 6, 116 S.Ct. 7, 133 L.Ed.2d 1 (determining that \"mere speculation\u201d that disclosure would have spurred defense counsel to additional investigation does not make that evidence material).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
