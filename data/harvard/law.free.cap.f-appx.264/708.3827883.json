Mr. Nanez-Lopez was sentenced to the statutory minimum term of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment followed by five years\u2019 supervised release. His appellate counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California </em>and a motion to withdraw as counsel, having identified no potentially meritorious issues for appeal. 386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Mr. NanezLopez was served with a copy of the motion and brief and no response has been filed. Our jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a), and we dismiss the appeal and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">Prior to sentencing, Mr. Nanez-Lopez filed a sentencing memorandum arguing that he should be afforded a \u201csafety valve\u201d adjustment to the mandatory minimum sentence based on his post-arrest disclosures about his involvement and that of others. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(5); I R. Doc. 18. The \u201csafety valve\u201d adjustment, if applicable, would permit Mr. Nanez-Lopez to be sentenced under the normal guideline range (108 to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment, in his case) regardless of the mandatory minimum. The government, however, objected, arguing that Mr. Nanez-Lopez had not been completely debriefed and had failed to provide all of the information he had about the offense. I R. Doc. 19. The district court continued the sentencing to allow more debriefing. The government again maintained that Mr. Lopez-Nanez had not been truthful. Trial counsel then withdrew her objection to the presentence report, stating that in view of the government\u2019s position, \u201cI can see no way that we could carry the burden of proving a negative, if you will.\u201d III R. Doc. 33 at 3. Mr. Nanez-Lopez filed a pro se notice of appeal after sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-12\">We have reviewed the record and agree with counsel that there is no potentially meritorious issue for appeal. Mr. NanezLopez abandoned any objection with respect to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(5) by withdrawing it before the district court. <em>See United States v. Carrasco-Solazar, </em>494 F.3d 1270, 1272-73 (10th Cir.2007). There is nothing to suggest that this waiver was based on anything other than the difficulty of proof. Mr. Nanez-Lopez argued for a sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, III R. Doc. 33 at 4, and that is what he received.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-13\">DISMISSED. Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b735-15\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
