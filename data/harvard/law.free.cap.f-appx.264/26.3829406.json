McCrudden, on behalf of himself and Managed Accounts Asset Management, seeks review of an order of the CFTC denying their applications for registration. <em>McCrudden v. National Futures Ass\u2019n, </em>No. 05-02, 2006 WL 3848094 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>(CFTC Dec. 28, 2006), <em>aff'g </em>No. 05-REG-001 (Nat\u2019l Futures Ass\u2019n June 10, 2005), http://www.nfa.futures.org/basicnet/Case Document.aspx?seqnum=259. We assume the parties\u2019 and counsel\u2019s familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">The petitioners argue that the evidence does not support the CFTC\u2019s conclusion that McCrudden is subject to disqualification from registration pursuant to 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 12a(3)(M), permitting disqualification for \u201cother good cause.\u201d The CFTC has interpreted \u201cother good cause\u201d to include a person\u2019s \u201cpotential disregard of or inability to comply with the requirements of the [Commodity Exchange] Act or the rules, regulations or order thereunder, or such person\u2019s moral turpitude, or lack of honesty or financial responsibility....\u201d 17 C.F.R. Part 3, Appx. A, 49 Fed. Reg. 8208 (March 5, 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">The petitioners also argue that even if disqualified pursuant to section 12a(3)(M), McCrudden had established that his registration would not pose a substantial risk to the public. <em>See </em>17 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.60(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">We accept findings of the CFTC \u201cas to the facts, if supported by the weight of evidence....\u201d 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 9; <em>see also Haltmier v. CFTC, </em>554 F.2d 556, 560 (2d Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">Upon review of the record and arguments presented, we conclude that the CFTC\u2019s conclusion that conduct attributable to McCrudden demonstrates dishonesty, and a disregard of or inability to comply with Commodity Exchange Act requirements is supported by the weight of the evidence, including evidence that McCrudden failed to report trading losses to his investors and improperly included among assets reported in account statements the value of an estimated litigation award adjusted month-to-month so that trading losses were concealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-12\">The CFTC\u2019s determination that McCrudden has failed to demonstrate that his registration would not pose a substantial risk to the public is also supported by the weight of the evidence. Supporting this conclusion are the CFTC\u2019s findings that no evidence mitigated McCrudden\u2019s original conduct, that McCrudden has not accepted responsibility for his wrongdoing, that the passage of time alone did not demonstrate rehabilitation, and that letters attesting to McCrudden\u2019s good character were insufficient to outweigh his earlier misconduct or to establish his asserted rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the order of the CFTC is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
