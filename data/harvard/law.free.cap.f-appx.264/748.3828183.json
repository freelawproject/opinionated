KELLY, JR., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Derrick R. Parkhurst, a state prisoner proceeding pro se, appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing his complaint under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 as time barred. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">The parties are familiar with the facts. Mr. Parkhurst, an inmate at the Wyoming State Penitentiary, claims that beginning no later than July, 2001, the prison was overcrowded, and as such, the defendants violated his civil rights. His federal court lawsuit was filed on March 9, 2006. The district court dismissed the complaint as time barred under Wyoming\u2019s statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">\u201cWhether a court properly applied a statute of limitations and the date a statute of limitations accrues under undisputed facts are questions of law we review <em>de novo.\u201d Nelson v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>419 F.3d 1117, 1119 (10th Cir.2005). \u201cState statutes of limitations applicable to general personal injury claims supply the limitations periods for \u00a7 1983 claims[.]\u201d <em>Beck v. City of Muskogee Police Dep\u2019t, </em>195 <em>F.3d 553, </em>557 (10th Cir.1999). However, \u201cfederal law governs the time of accrual of \u00a7 1983 claims[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>Wyoming\u2019s state of limitations for personal injury claims is four years, WYO. STAT. ANN. \u00a7 l-3-105(a)(iv)(C) (1977), and the cause of action accrued when Mr. Parkhurst knew or should have known that his constitutional rights had allegedly been violated. <em>Beck, </em>195 F.3d at 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">According to the allegations in Mr. Parkhurst\u2019s complaint, the overcrowding (alleged violation) existed no later than July, 2001. However, he did not file suit until more than four years after July, 2001, and his suit therefore is time barred. We also reject Mr. Parkhurst\u2019s argument that Wyoming\u2019s saving statute applies for the simple reason, among others, that his \u201caction [was not] commenced in due time[.]\u201d WYO. STAT. ANN. \u00a7 1-3-118 (1977). Similarly, he cannot avoid the four-year statute of limitations under the theory of continuing tort. Assuming the continuing violation doctrine applies to \u00a7 1983 claims, the doctrine is triggered \u201cby continual unlawful acts, not by continual ill effects from the original violation.\u201d <em>Bergman v. United States, 751 </em>F.2d 314, 317 (10th Cir.1984) (quotation omitted). Because Mr. Parkhurst alleged the same ill effect from the day the alleged overcrowding first existed, the doctrine does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-12\">We have carefully examined the parties\u2019 briefs, the record, and the district court\u2019s order in light of the governing law. We conclude that the court correctly dismissed the complaint, and we affirm for substantially the same reasons as those in the court\u2019s order dated March 8, 2007. The judgment is AFFIRMED. We GRANT Mr. Parkhurst\u2019s motion to proceed without prepayment of the entire filing fee and remind him of his continuing obligation to make partial payments until the fee has been paid in its entirety.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b775-10\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
