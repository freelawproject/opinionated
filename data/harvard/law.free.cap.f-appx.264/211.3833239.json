For the following reasons, the petition will be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Francois is a 42 year old citizen of Trinidad and Tobago and a lawful permanent resident of the United States. He was admitted to this country in 1976. In 1983, Francois was convicted in the state of New York for first degree robbery, first degree burglary, and third degree larceny. <em>See </em>N.Y. Penal \u00a7 160.15 (McKinney 1983) (pertaining to robbery in the first degree); N.Y. Penal \u00a7 140.30 (McKinney 1983) (pertaining to burglary in the first degree); N.Y. Penal \u00a7 155.35 (McKinney 1983) (pertaining to grand larceny in the third degree). In 2002, Francois was convicted in the state of Connecticut of fourth degree larceny and possession of a shoplifting device.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Conn.Gen.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 53a-125 (West 2002) (pertaining to larceny); Conn.Gen.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 53a-127f (West 2002) (pertaining to possession of a shoplifting device).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">In 2006, Francois was served with a Notice to Appear charging him with being removable as an aggravated felon for committing a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) and a \u201ctheft offense\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G). <em>See also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (providing that an alien convicted of an aggravated felony is removable from the United States). Francois was also charged with removability for the commission of two crimes involving moral turpitude. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii) (providing that aliens convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude, not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct, are removable).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">At his hearing before the IJ, Francois admitted the existence of his New York convictions, but declined to admit the Connecticut convictions because they were subject to a collateral attack. (Administrative Record (\u201cA.R.\u201d) 48, 257.) Francois conceded, though, that he was convicted of an aggravated felony under both the \u201ccrime of violence\u201d and \u201ctheft offense\u201d definitions. (A.R.48-49, 257.) He denied, however, that he was convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude based upon the New York and Connecticut convictions. (A.R.49.)</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">The IJ then addressed Francois\u2019s application for a waiver of removal under former \u00a7 212(c). Citing two BIA decisions, <em>Matter of Blake, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 722 (BIA 2005) and <em>Matter of Brieva, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 766 (BIA 2005), the IJ found Francois ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief. (A.R.98-100.) Accordingly, the IJ ordered Francois removed to Trinidad and Tobago. (A.R.116.) On appeal, the BIA, relying on <em>Brieva, </em>affirmed the IJ\u2019s order of removal. (A.R.2-5.) Francois now petitions this Court for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-13\">In his petition, Francois challenges the legal basis for the BIA\u2019s denial of his application for \u00a7 212(c) relief. Because Francois\u2019s petition raises a question of law, we have jurisdiction to review his petition under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) (providing that we retain the jurisdiction to review \u201cconstitutional claims and questions of law\u201d). <em>See Papageorgiou v. Gonzales, </em>413 F.3d 356, 358 (3d Cir.2005). Where, as here, the BIA issued a separate decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>and did not adopt any portion of the IJ\u2019s decision, we review only the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Chavarria v. Gonzalez, </em>446 F.3d 508, 515 (3d Cir.2006) (citations omitted). The BIA\u2019s legal conclusions are reviewed <em>de novo. See Smriko v. Ashcroft, </em>387 F.3d 279, 282 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Under former \u00a7 212(c) of the INA, the Attorney General possessed the discretion to waive the exclusion of certain lawful permanent residents who sought reentry into the United States. This section was repealed in 1996 when Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), Pub.L. 104-208 (1996). The Supreme Court later held that Congress did not intend for IIRIRA to apply retroactively to lawful permanent residents who pled guilty to crimes prior to its passage. <em>See INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 326, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001). In response to <em>St. Cyr, </em>the Immigration and Naturalization Service (now, the Department of Homeland Security) allows lawful permanent residents with convictions entered before April 1, 1997 to apply for relief under \u00a7 212(c). <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. 1212.3(h)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">On the face of the statute, \u00a7 212(c) only applied to aliens who were returning from a temporary journey overseas and were facing exclusion from admission to the United States under \u00a7 212(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As such, cases initially applying \u00a7 212(c) did not extend its benefits to aliens who never left this country. <em>See Matter of Arias-Uribe, </em>13 I. &amp; N. Dec. 696, 699-700 (BIA 1971); <em>Matter of </em>M\u2014, 5 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 642, 647 (BIA 1954). In <em>Francis v. INS, </em>532 F.2d 268, 272 (2d Cir.1976), the Second Circuit determined that this result \u201ccreate[d] two classes of aliens identical in every respect except for the fact that members of one class have departed and returned to this country at some point after they became deportable.\u201d The Second Circuit held that this disparate treatment was not rationally related to any legitimate purpose and therefore violated the petitioner\u2019s Fifth Amendment equal protection rights. <em>Id. </em>The BIA and our Circuit eventually adopted this holding, <em>see In re Silva, </em>16 I. &amp; N. Dec. 26, 30 (BIA 1976); <em>Katsis v. INS, </em>997 F.2d 1067, 1070 (3d Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">After <em>Francis </em>extended \u00a7 212(c) to aliens who never left the United States, the BIA granted such relief only where the alien\u2019s ground for removability had a comparable ground of inadmissibility under \u00a7 212(a). <em>See Matter of Meza, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 257, 258-59 (BIA 1991); <em>Matter of Wadud, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 182, 184-85 (BIA 1984); <em>Matter of Granados, </em>16 I. &amp; N. Dec. 726, 728 (BIA 1979). However, after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>St. Cyr, </em>the Department of Justice (\u201cDoJ\u201d) promulgated amendments to its regulations intended to govern the application of former \u00a7 212(c). In one of those amendments, the DoJ noted that the discretionary waiver available under \u00a7 212(c) is not available \u201cif the alien is deportable ... or removable ... on a ground which does not have a statutory counterpart in section 212 of the [INA].\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.3(f)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>A spate of decisions from the BIA applying this rule followed. Two of those decisions initially became the touchstone for courts to apply when faced with a statutory counterpart analysis under \u00a7 212(c). In <em>Matter of Blake, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 723, the BIA held that an alien removable for the aggravated felony of \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d was ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief because no comparable grounds for inadmissibility existed under \u00a7 212(a). The petitioner in <em>Blake </em>argued that his conviction was comparable to the ground rendering inadmissible those aliens convicted of crimes involving moral turpitude under \u00a7 212(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I). <em>Id. </em>The BIA disagreed, holding that while \u201cthe coverage of the offenses described [in the removal and inadmissibility provisions] need not be a perfect match in order to be \u2018statutory counterparts\u2019.... Congress [must have] employed similar language to describe substantially equivalent categories of offenses,\u201d <em>id. </em>Because the moral turpitude ground of inadmissibility under \u00a7 212(a) addressed a \u201cmuch broader category of offenses than the aggravated felony sexual abuse of a minor charge,\u201d the BIA held that the grounds were not statutorily equivalent. <em>Id. </em>at 728. In <em>Matter of Brieva, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 770-73, the BIA used the same analysis to hold that the ground of removability for the aggravated felony of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d was not statutorily equivalent to the ground of inadmissibility for committing a crime of moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Francois argues that the rule created by <em>Blake </em>and <em>Brieva, </em>upon which the BIA based its holding, is incorrect. He claims that <em>Blake </em>and <em>Brieva </em>conflict with settled precedent and represent an incorrect statement of law. Francois contends that the BIA must look, instead, to the actual offenses he was convicted of\u2014e.g., burglary and robbery\u2014and not the offenses charged by the Government\u2014e.g., \u201ccrime of violence\u201d and \u201ctheft offense\u201d\u2014in determining whether the ground of removability has a comparable ground of inadmissibility. If the BIA did so, Francois concludes, it would have found the convictions underlying his grounds for removability were also crimes involving moral turpitude, which is a ground of inadmissibility under \u00a7 212(a). Francois further argues that the BIA\u2019s interpretation of <em>Blake </em>and <em>Brieva </em>actually create the same equal protection problem identified in <em>Francis </em>by denying an alien in removal proceedings the same \u00a7 212(c) relief available to an alien in inadmissibility proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">After Francois submitted his brief in this matter, this Circuit squarely addressed his arguments in <em>Caroleo v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 158 (3d Cir.2007). The petitioner in <em>Caroleo </em>was charged as removable for being convicted of a crime of violence. He sought a \u00a7 212(c) waiver because his underlying conviction, attempted murder, was also a crime of moral turpitude. We rejected this request, holding that the aggravated felony of crime of violence had no statutory counterpart in the grounds for inadmissibility under \u00a7 212(a). In doing so, we held that \u201cwhile it is true that the <em>underlying crime </em>of attempted murder can be characterized as a crime involving moral turpitude for the purposes of determining <em>removability ... </em>the statutory counterpart prerequisite for <em>\u00a7 212(c) relief from removal </em>focuses, quite differently, upon the <em>statutory ground for </em>removal\u2014here an aggravated felony \u2018crime of violence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 164-65 (emphasis in original) (internal citations omitted). We held that \u201cthe underlying crime for which [petitioner] was convicted plays no role\u201d in determining a lawful permanent resident\u2019s eligibility for \u00a7 212(c) relief. <em>Id. </em>at 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>In <em>Caroleo, </em>we further rejected the notion that <em>Blake </em>and <em>B\u00f1eva </em>raise any additional equal protection concerns such as those addressed in <em>Francis. </em>We held that whether a petitioner\u2019s underlying criminal conviction would qualify him for inadmissibility under \u00a7 212(a) is irrelevant for equal protection purposes. <em>Id. </em>at 165. What mattered, we held, \u201cwas the statutory ground in the INA under which the removal was sought.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This focus on the statutory ground for removal, instead of the petitioner\u2019s underlying criminal conviction, is intended to combat the \u201carbitrary distinction that violates equal protection\u201d that would inhere where \u201c \u2018the only distinction between the two classes of persons the statute created was that one class of individuals had traveled abroad and returned, and the other had not.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 165 (quoting <em>Komarenko v. INS, </em>35 F.3d 432, 435 (9th Cir.1994)). Furthermore, we stated that, if we were to look at the underlying conviction, \u201c \u2018we would extend discretionary review to every ground for deportation that could constitute the essential elements of a crime involving moral turpitude.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 166 (quoting <em>Komarenko, </em>35 F.3d at 435) (internal citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Francois also raises an additional argument. He contends that the analysis in <em>Blake </em>and <em>Brieva </em>is incorrect because it fails to account for the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d found in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16. This section defines a crime of violence as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-6\">(a) an offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-8\">(b) any other offense that is a felony and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16. Francois argues that the BIA erred in relying on the rule in <em>Bneva </em>because that decision involved \u00a7 16(b), while his crime, he contends, falls under \u00a7 16(a). Additionally, Francois argues that any crime that falls under the definition of \u00a7 16(a) is inherently a crime of moral turpitude and, therefore, his convictions have a statutory counterpart in \u00a7 212(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">This argument must be rejected because it merely reiterates Francois\u2019s contention, which we rejected above, that we must consider the facts underlying his convictions. Francois was convicted of first degree robbery in New York, a charge which he does not dispute constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d That statutory ground has no counterpart in \u00a7 212(a), as we expressly noted in <em>Caroleo. See </em>476 F.3d at 165 (\u201c[T]he aggravated felony \u2018crime of violence\u2019 ground for removal is <em>not </em>a statutory counterpart of INA \u00a7 212(a)\u2019s \u2018crime involving moral turpitude.\u2019\u201d (emphasis in original)). We must therefore deny his request for a waiver of removability under \u00a7 212(c). Accordingly, we will deny Francois\u2019s petition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b238-7\">. It should be noted that, for reasons discussed below, Francois\u2019s counsel disputes whether Francois was actually convicted of these offenses and, if so, whether those convictions were obtained illegally. <em>See infra </em>note 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b239-8\">. At the time of its repeal, \u00a7 212(c) stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ain\">Aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation, and who are returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years, may be admitted in the discretion of the Attorney General without regard to the provisions of subsection (a) [(establishing classes of aliens to be excluded from admission to the United States)]....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (repealed 1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b241-7\">. Francois also challenges the sufficiency of evidence produced by the government to the IJ to prove the 2002 convictions in Connecticut. He also claims that the convictions were obtained improperly because state officials failed to advise him of the immigration consequences of pleading guilty to those offenses. Since we hold that Francois is removable for his New York conviction for first degree robbery, we need not address the issues he raises regarding the Connecticut convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
