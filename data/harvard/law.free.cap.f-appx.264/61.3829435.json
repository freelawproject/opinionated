Kaplan, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b87-25\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b87-26\">Plaintiff appeals from an order of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Conner, <em>J.) </em>granting defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, proceedings below, and specification of issues for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-27\">At the time suit was filed, plaintiff was not entitled to a public education as a property interest protected by the Due Process Clause, <em>see Goss v. Lopez, </em>419 U.S. 565, 574, 95 S.Ct. 729, 42 L.Ed.2d 725 (1975), because her fifth birthday was after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>December 1, 2005. Property interests protected by procedural due process \u201care not created by the Constitution. Rather, they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law\u2014rules or understandings that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits.\u201d <em>Bd. of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972). To determine whether a person has a legitimate claim to a benefit, \u201cwe look to the statutes and regulations governing the distribution of benefits.\u201d <em>Kapps v. Wing, </em>404 F.3d 105, 113 (2d Cir.2005). The pertinent statute provides that school boards are not required \u201cto admit a child who becomes five years of age after the school year has commenced unless his birthday occurs on or before the first of December.\u201d N.Y. Educ. Law \u00a7 3202(1). To the extent that plaintiff continues to press a substantive due process claim, we note that \u201c[t]he Fourteenth Amendment does not protect a public education as a substantive fundamental right.\u201d <em>Handberry v. Thompson, </em>446 F.3d 335, 352 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">New York Education Law \u00a7 3202(1) is consistent with the Equal Protection Clause, which does not require classes of people that are \u201cdifferent in fact or opinion to be treated in law as though they were the same.\u201d <em>Plyler v. Doe, </em>457 U.S. 202, 216, 102 S.Ct. 2382, 72 L.Ed.2d 786 (1982) (quoting <em>Tigner v. Texas, </em>310 U.S. 141, 147, 60 S.Ct. 879, 84 L.Ed. 1124 (1940)) (internal quotation mark omitted). In considering the New York State Legislature\u2019s decision to set December 1 as the cutoff date for kindergarten admission, we are mindful that \u201c[a] legislature must have substantial latitude to establish classifications that roughly approximate the nature of the problem perceived, that accommodate competing concerns both public and private, and that account for limitations on the practical ability of the State to remedy every ill.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, defendants\u2019 refusal to provide plaintiff with public transportation to the private school at which she attended kindergarten did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The Legislature has rationally determined that, although a school district in New York must provide transportation \u201cfor all the children residing within the school district to and from the school they legally attend, who are in need of such transportation because of the remoteness of the school to the child or for the promotion of the best interest of such children,\u201d N.Y. Educ. Law \u00a7 3635(l)(a), it has no obligation to transport a child \u201cwho is younger than the age of entrance into the public schools established by the school district in which that child resides,\u201d N.Y. Comp.Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 8, \u00a7 125.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">We have considered plaintiffs remaining contentions and found them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
