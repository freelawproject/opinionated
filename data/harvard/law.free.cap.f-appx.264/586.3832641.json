Because the BIA \u201creviewed the IJ\u2019s decision and incorporated portions of it as its own, we treat the incorporated parts of the IJ\u2019s decision as the BIA\u2019s.\u201d <em>Molina-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1093 (9th Cir.2002). We review for substantial evidence the BIA\u2019s determination that changed country conditions and the ability to relocate within India rebut the presumption that Kaur has a well-founded fear of persecution, <em>see Marcu v. INS, </em>147 F.3d 1078, 1081-82 (9th Cir.1998), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-14\">The BIA relied on evidence that members of Akali Dal, the political group in which Kaur claims membership, are no longer persecuted. This individualized finding of changed country conditions rebuts Kaur\u2019s specific grounds for her well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Lopez v. Ashcroft, </em>366 F.3d 799, 805 (9th Cir.2004); <em>Molinar-Estrada, </em>293 F.3d at 1096.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-15\">Additional substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Kaur does not have a well-founded fear of future persecution; Kaur testified that she lived elsewhere in India for ten months without incident, and it is therefore reasonable to conclude that internal relocation is a feasible option. <em>See Melkonian v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 1061, 1069 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Ochave v. INS, </em>254 F.3d 859, 867-68 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-16\">In sum, it cannot be said that the evidence presented by Petitioner was \u201cso compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 817, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-17\">Because Kaur did not establish that she was eligible for asylum, she necessarily fails to demonstrate eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-18\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of Kaur\u2019s CAT claim because Kaur was able to relocate within India, and because changed country conditions suggest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>there is a de minimis risk that she will be subjected to torture if returned to India. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(3)(ii), (iv); <em>Hasan v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 1114, 1123 (9th Cir.2004); <em>Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>351 F.3d 435, 443 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">We therefore conclude that the BIA\u2019s determination was supported by substantial evidence and that Kaur\u2019s asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT claims fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b613-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
