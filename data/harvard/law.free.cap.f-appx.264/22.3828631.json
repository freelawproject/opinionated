We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, the proceedings below, and the specification of issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-11\">Under the EAJA, \u201ca court shall award to a prevailing party other than the United States fees and other expenses ... incurred by that party in any civil action ... brought by or against the United States ... unless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A). The Government bears the burden of showing that its position was \u201csubstantially justified,\u201d and to meet that burden, it must show that its action was \u201cjustified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person.\u201d <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 565, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988). \u201cTo be \u2018substantially justified\u2019 means, of course, more than merely undeserving of sanctions for frivolousness; that is assuredly not the standard for Government litigation of which a reasonable person would approve.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 566, 108 S.Ct. 2541. The Government\u2019s position includes both \u201cthe position taken by the United States in the civil aetion[ ] [and] the action or failure to act by the agency upon which the civil action is based.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(2)(D); <em>see also Comm\u2019r, Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv. v. Jean, </em>496 U.S. 154, 159, 110 S.Ct. 2316, 110 L.Ed.2d 134 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-15\">We review the district court\u2019s determination that the Government\u2019s position was substantially justified for abuse of discretion. <em>See, e.g., Pierce, </em>487 U.S. at 562, 108 S.Ct. 2541. A court abuses or exceeds its discretion when its decision rests on an error of law or a clearly erroneous factual findings, <em>see, e.g., Cooter &amp; Gell v. Hartman Corp., </em>496 U.S. 384, 405, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990), or, even if not resulting from such an error, when it \u201ccannot be located within the range of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>permissible decisions,\u201d <em>Zervos v. Verizon N.Y., Inc., 252 </em>F.3d 163, 169 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">Under the former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1155, \u201c[t]he Attorney General may, at any time, for what he deems to be good and sufficient cause, revoke the approval of any petition approved by him under [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 ]1154.\u201d <em>See also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 205.2(a) (\u201cAny Service officer authorized to approve a petition under [\u00a7 1154] may revoke the approval of that petition upon notice to the petitioner on any ground other than those specified in \u00a7 205.1 when the necessity for the revocation comes to the attention of this Service\u201d). Relying on various publications and statements by INS officials, the plaintiffs argue that the INS could revoke its approval of the petition at issue here only upon a showing of \u201cgross error.\u201d We disagree. None of the publications or statements upon which the plaintiffs rely creates legally enforceable rights of the type that would require the INS to find \u201cgross error\u201d before it could revoke the approval of such a petition. <em>Cf. United States v. Ng, </em>699 F.2d 63, 71 (2d Cir.1983) (holding that a Department of Justice internal policy was not legally enforceable). Moreover, even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the INS was obligated to adhere to a \u201cgross error\u201d standard, the district court did not abuse its discretion insofar as it held that the INS was \u201csubstantially justified\u201d in concluding that the \u201cgross error\u201d standard was satisfied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">When this case was before us last, we noted <em>nostra sponte </em>that the third sentence of former \u00a7 1155, which provided, \u201cIn no case, however, shall such revocation have effect unless ... notice of the revocation is communicated ... to the beneficiary of the petition before such beneficiary commences his journey to the United States,\u201d might deprive the INS of the authority to revoke its approval of the visa petition of a beneficiary already in the United States.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We requested supplemental briefing on the issue, which the parties supplied. Subsequently we held that the \u201cplain language\u201d of the third sentence of the former \u00a7 1155 contained \u201cno ambiguity\u201d in imposing an \u201cunequivocal] limit[ation]\u201d on the INS\u2019s authority to revoke its approval of a visa petition when the beneficiary is already in the United States. <em>Firstland Int\u2019l, Inc. v. U.S. Immigration &amp; Naturalization Sen. (\u201cFirstland I\u201d), </em>377 F.3d 127, 131-32 (2d Cir.2004). In so holding, we explicitly considered and rejected the rationales of two cases that the government cited to support the INS\u2019s position, to wit, <em>ANA International, Inc. v. Way, </em>242 F.Supp.2d 906, 916 (D.Or.2002), and <em>In re Vilos, </em>12 I. &amp; N. Dec. 61, 64 (BIA 1967). To the extent that <em>Vilos </em>ruled that the INS had discretion under \u00a7 1155 to revoke its approval of the visa petition of an alien who was already in the United States, we concluded that the decision was \u201carbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.\u201d <em>Firstland I, </em>377 F.3d at 131 (internal quotation marks omitted). <em>ANA International </em>had held that \u00a7 1155 was facially ambiguous and deferred to the BIA\u2019s view in <em>Vilos. See </em>242 F.Supp.2d at 916. The matter of whether a statute is ambiguous is a question of law, <em>see, e.g., Humanoids Group v. Rogan, </em>375 F.3d 301, 306 (4th Cir.2004), and we held in <em>Firstland I </em>that the pertinent language of \u00a7 1155, which stated that \u201c[i]n no case, however, shall revocation have effect unless ... notice of the revocation is communicated ... to the beneficiary of the petition before such beneficiary commences his journey to the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>States,\u201d was \u201cplain,\u201d \u201cunequivoeal[ ],\u201d and held \u201cno ambiguity.\u201d 377 F.3d at 131-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The district court here, in finding that the government\u2019s position in the litigation was substantially justified, stated that <em>ANA International </em>and <em>Vilos </em>supported the government\u2019s position and \u201c[i]t therefore appears that the INS\u2019s argument was quite reasonable.\u201d In <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em>however, the Supreme Court held that even though prior judicial decisions may be, to some extent, relevant, \u201cthe fact that one other court agreed or disagreed with the Government does not establish whether its position was substantially justified.\u201d 487 U.S. at 569, 108 S.Ct. 2541; <em>see also id. </em>at 568, 108 S.Ct. 2541 (noting that views of other courts on the merits \u201ccan be relevant, [but] we do not think they provide a conclusive answer[] in either direction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">The district court\u2019s conclusion in this case that the government\u2019s position was substantially justified because it was consistent \"with <em>ANA International </em>and <em>Vilos </em>thus applied an erroneous legal standard, and hence was an abuse of discretion. Given our conclusions in <em>Firstland I </em>that the <em>ANA International </em>decision was erroneous as a matter of law in finding a \u201cplain\u201d and \u201cunequivocal ]\u201d statute ambiguous and that the <em>Vilos </em>decision was \u201carbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute,\u201d 377 F.3d at 131-32 (internal quotation marks omitted), the district court could not properly find that the government\u2019s position in the litigation was substantially justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Nonetheless, the EAJA provides that an award of attorneys\u2019 fees would be inappropriate if \u201cspecial circumstances make an award unjust.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A). We have held that an award of fees under the EAJA may be unjust \u201cwhere all of the fees were expended on discrete efforts that achieved no appreciable advantage, and where the claim of the prevailing parties rests largely on a result to which the claimant made no contribution.\u201d <em>United States v. 27.09 Acres of Land, </em>43 F.3d 769, 773 (2d Cir. 1994). As noted above, the dispositive issue in <em>Firstland I </em>was one that we raised <em>nostra sponte. </em>In contrast, the claim initially advanced by plaintiffs, to wit, that the INS had no authority to revoke its approval of Firstland\u2019s petition in the absence of \u201cgross error,\u201d was without merit and contributed nothing to the ultimate decision of the appeal or to the decision of the district court on remand. We consider this to be a \u201cspecial circumstance\u201d in that, if fees were awarded to Firstland in the full amount requested, such an award would give Firstland a windfall for useless efforts. Plaintiffs\u2019 only contribution to them ultimate victory in the underlying case was the supplemental brief they submitted at this Court\u2019s request. We conclude that an award of fees for any amount greater than the cost of preparing that supplemental brief would be unjust.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the district court to the extent that it denied plaintiffs\u2019 request for attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses in them entirety, and we remand for a determination by that court of appropriate fees and expenses for preparation of their supplemental brief to this Court in <em>Firstland I, </em>and for an award in the amount determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">We have considered all of plaintiffs-appellants\u2019 other arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b49-13\">.
