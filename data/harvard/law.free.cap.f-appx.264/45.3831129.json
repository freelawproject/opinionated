This Court granted a certificate of appealability on the single issue of Funches\u2019 <em>Batson </em>claim. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Funches argues that the New York Appellate Division unreasonably applied clearly established Supreme Court precedent when it affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling that the prosecution\u2019s race-neutral explanation for its exclusion of a prospective black juror was not pretextual under <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986). <em>See People v. Funches, </em>4 A.D.3d 206, 772 N.Y.S.2d 62 (1st Dep\u2019t 2004); <em>see also Harris v. Kuhlmann, </em>346 F.3d 330, 344 (2d Cir.2003) (explaining that under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, when the state court correctly identifies the governing legal principle, as here, our review is limited to the \u201cunreasonable application\u201d prong of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1)). The Appellate Division concluded that the prosecution\u2019s proffered race-neutral explanation\u2014that the prospective juror\u2019s employment as a fashion stylist for rap artists exposed her to anti-police and anti-establishment sentiment\u2014 was not pretextual or closely linked to race. The Appellate Division further rejected Funches\u2019 assertion that the prosecution treated differently a similarly situated white juror, who was employed as a journalist in the media and entertainment industry, because it held that the argument was both unpreserved and unsupported by the record. We conclude that Funches has failed to rebut by clear and convincing evidence the state court\u2019s factual determination that the prosecution\u2019s explanation was not pretextual, <em>see Bryant v. Speckard, </em>131 F.3d 1076, 1077 (2d Cir.1997) (per curiam), and we further hold that the Appellate Division did not apply federal law in an \u201cobjectively unreasonable\u201d manner, <em>see Garvey v. Duncan, </em>485 F.3d 709, 725 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
