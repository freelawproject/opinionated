ANDERSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">Plaintiff and appellee the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) and an individual, plaintiff and appellee Rebecca Leigh DeHart, brought actions under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e to 2000e-17, and the Equal Pay Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(d), against defendant and appellant Stevens-Henager College, Inc. The EEOC alleged that Stevens-Henager unlawfully paid four employees (DeHart, Jennifer Morris, Jana Miller and Stacy Nelson) less than it paid male employees performing substantially equal work, in violation of the EPA. The EEOC also alleged that Stevens-Henager discharged Morris from her employment on the basis of her sex, in violation of Title VII. In her separate complaint, DeHart alleged that Stevens-Henager paid her less than a male colleague for substantially the same work, and retaliated against her for complaining about the pay disparity, in violation of Title VII and the EPA. The two actions were consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">After discovery was completed, the EEOC and DeHart jointly moved for partial summary judgment on a number of Stevens-Henager\u2019s affirmative defenses, and Stevens-Henager moved for summary judgment on the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 substantive claims. After a hearing, the district court granted the EEOC\u2019s motion in part and denied Stevens-Henager\u2019s motion in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-11\">The case was tried to a jury over a three-day period. On the last day of trial, the district court heard, and denied, Stevens-Henager\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on all of plaintiffs\u2019 claims. The jury subsequently returned a verdict for Stevens-Henager on all claims. StevensHenager thereafter moved for an award of costs and attorney\u2019s fees. The district court denied the motion for attorney\u2019s fees. Stevens-Henager now appeals that denial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-12\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the district court abused its discretion by finding that plaintiffs\u2019 claims were not frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation and therefore denying Stevens-Henager\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees. The relevant statute provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-13\">In any action or proceedings under this subchapter the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the Commission or the United States, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee (including expert fees) as part of the costs, and the Commission and the United States shall be liable for costs the same as a private person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-14\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k). We review a district court\u2019s decision regarding attorney\u2019s fees under the statute for an abuse of discretion. <em>EEOC v. PVNF, LLC, </em>487 F.3d 790, 807 (10th Cir.2007). \u201cA Title VII defendant is not entitled to an award of fees unless the court finds that the plaintiffs \u2018claim was frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless, or that the plaintiff continued to litigate after it clearly became so.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>(quoting <em>Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, </em>434 U.S. 412, 422, 98 S.Ct. 694, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978)) (further quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">In this case, the district court agreed with plaintiffs that Stevens-Henager had failed to meet its burden of showing that plaintiffs\u2019 claims were frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation. The court stated, \u201c[although Stevens-Henager was the prevailing party in this case, the court has no reason to believe that the plaintiffs were motivated by anything other than good faith.\u201d Order at 2. Indeed, the court specifically found \u201c[t]his was a hotly contested ease in which a jury could have reasonably found for either party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to award attorney\u2019s fees to Stevens-Henager. The district court judge presided over the entire case, and was in the best position to evaluate the merits of the respective parties\u2019 positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order denying StevensHenager\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b703-9\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
