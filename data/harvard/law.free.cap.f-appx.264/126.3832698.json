Nov. 29, 2006), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 75 842 328 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City July 28, 2003). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-21\">When the BIA does not adopt the decision of the IJ to any extent, this Court reviews only the decision of the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007). We will vacate and remand for new findings, however, if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Jus</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number><em>tice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005). We review de novo questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">We conclude that the BIA\u2019s finding that Qian failed to establish eligibility for asylum was not in error. In <em>Shi Liang Lin, </em>this Court concluded that the statutory scheme under IIRIRA \u00a7 601(a) \u201cunambiguously dictates that applicants can become candidates for asylum relief only based on persecution that they themselves have suffered or must suffer.\u201d 494 F.3d at 308. Thus, as the Government correctly asserts, Qian was not entitled to asylum based solely on his girlfriend\u2019s forced abortion, regardless of the couple\u2019s marital status.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Moreover, even assuming that Qian\u2019s conduct in arguing with a police officer constituted \u201cother resistance\u201d to a coercive population control program, any claim that he demonstrated past persecution on the basis of such resistance has been waived. <em>See </em>Brief of Petitioner-Appellant at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Because Qian failed to establish that he had been subjected to past persecution, he was not entitled to a presumption that he would be subjected to future persecution in China. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1). In this regard, the record supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Qian did not demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution. The BIA accurately observed that Qian testified that he was \u201cnot too sure\u201d whether he was wanted by the authorities, and that he failed to provide evidence that a warrant had been issued for his arrest. Further, the BIA appropriately noted that, while Qian contended that he feared arrest and sterilization, and that his family members informed him that cadres had been looking for him, his sister and father did not indicate in their letters that the authorities had ever come looking for him. Further, although Qian contends that the Court must consider cumulatively his alleged threatened arrest, the \u201cattack\u201d by the police officer, and his illegal departure, his illegal departure claim is unexhausted. He never sought relief on that basis before the IJ. <em>See Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 121-22, 124 (2d Cir.2007) (holding that issue exhaustion is mandatory, even if not a jurisdictional requirement). Thus, the BIA reasonably found that Qian failed to meet his burden to establish a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B). As such, the BIA\u2019s denial of Qian\u2019s asylum application was not in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">Because Qian was unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out an asylum claim based on his own resistance to a coercive family planning policy, he was necessarily unable to meet the higher standard required to succeed on his claims for withholding of removal and relief under the CAT, insofar as they shared the same factual predicate. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006). And as noted above, to the extent that Qian argues that he is eligible for CAT relief on the basis of his illegal departure from China, that argument is unexhausted. <em>See Lin Zhong, </em>480 F.3d at 121-22, 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
