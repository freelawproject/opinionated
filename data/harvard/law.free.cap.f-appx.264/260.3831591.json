Petitioner argues that she is entitled to relief because the district court denied her the right, protected by the CVRA, to \u201cfull and timely restitution\u201d for injuries caused by the Purdue Frederick Company, Inc. (\u201cPurdue\u201d). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3771(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">Petitioner sought to assert this right in the government\u2019s criminal prosecution of Purdue for its practices in marketing the prescription painkiller OxyContin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In that proceeding, Purdue pleaded guilty to a single felony of misbranding a prescription drug with the intent to defraud or mislead in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 331(a), 333(a)(2). Purdue entered a plea agreement with the government that required it to pay a significant sum of money in fines, penalties, and restitution to various entities affected by its conduct. However, both the government and Purdue asked that the district court limit restitution obligations to those provided for in the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-14\">Petitioner objected to this proposed limitation on Purdue\u2019s restitution obligations as violative of her rights under the CVRA. She contended that she was entitled to restitution under various legal provisions for harm that she suffered as a result of using OxyContin to treat chronic pain. The district court denied her motion, and accepted Purdue\u2019s guilty plea, its plea agreement, and the requested limitation on its restitution obligations. Petitioner now challenges that ruling under the CVRA and requests that we issue a writ of mandamus ordering the district court to reopen Purdue\u2019s sentencing and enforce Petitioner\u2019s right to restitution. After reviewing the record and the submissions of the interested parties, we find no basis upon which to grant the relief that Petitioner requests and, therefore, deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-16\">Before we analyze the substance of the petition, we consider the question of the appropriate standard of review. Normally, petitions for mandamus are subject to an extraordinarily stringent standard in order to prevent them from becoming a substitute for appeal. <em>In re Catawba Indian Tribe of South Carolina, </em>973 F.2d 1133, 1135-36 (4th Cir.1992) (quoting <em>In re Ralston Purina Co., </em>726 F.2d 1002, 1004 (4th Cir.1984)). We have previously re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>quired petitioners to demonstrate an \u201cabuse of discretion [that] amountfs] to a judicial usurpation of power\u201d in order to succeed on a mandamus petition. <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). This standard insignificantly higher than the normal abuse of discretion standard that we apply in other circumstances. <em>See id. </em>at 1137 (\u201c[O]ur inquiry ... is not whether ... the decision amounts to an ordinary abuse of discretion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">However, mandamus petitions filed under the CVRA are not necessarily subject to this stringent standard of review. In creating the CVRA, Congress specifically chose a mandamus petition as the appropriate vehicle for appellate review of an order denying a crime victim\u2019s assertion of a right protected thereunder. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3771(d)(3). Because the use of mandamus in this context results from a deliberate legislative choice and not adroit or devious pleading, it is not clear that a petitioner under the CVRA should be subjected to the same stringent standard of review as traditional petitioners. At least two other circuits have found that CVRA petitioners should not be so constrained and each has applied a normal abuse of discretion standard to CVRA mandamus petitions. <em>See Kenna v. United States Dist. Court for the Cent. Dist. of Calif., </em>435 F.3d 1011, 1017 (9th Cir.2006); <em>In re W.R. Huff Asset Manag. Co., </em>409 F.3d 555, 562 (2d Cir.2005). We need not decide the issue today, however, because Petitioner would not be entitled to relief even under the lower standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">The reason the standard of review is immaterial here is that each of Petitioner\u2019s arguments rest on the premise that she is legally entitled to restitution from Purdue and that the district court erred in denying her such an award. As a threshold matter, then, Petitioner must demonstrate a legal basis for such an entitlement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Otherwise, any error in the district court\u2019s handling of the sentencing proceedings<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or Petitioner\u2019s motion would be harmless because it could not have affected her substantial rights.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Fed. R. Crim P. 52(a). Therefore, we begin our analysis by examining Petitioner\u2019s claim to restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">Petitioner\u2019s argument regarding her entitlement to restitution ultimately devolves to a claim under the Victim and Witness Protection Act (\u201cVWPA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663. In a complex analysis that we need not fully unravel in this opinion, Petitioner contends that, because Purdue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>pleaded guilty to a felony and was sentenced to probation, the district court was required to award her restitution under \u00a7 3663 as a condition of Purdue\u2019s probation. Based on our review of the record, however, we cannot conclude that Petitioner qualifies as a \u201cvictim\u201d under \u00a7 3663, a threshold showing necessary for an award of restitution thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The VWPA empowers a district court to order a defendant to pay various forms of restitution to a victim of his conduct. <em>See \u00a7 </em>3663(b). However, \u00a7 3663 \u201cdoes not authorize a district court to order restitution to all individuals harmed by a defendant\u2019s criminal conduct.\u201d <em>See United States v. Blake, </em>81 F.3d 498, 506-07 (4th Cir.1996). Restitution awards are limited to individuals who qualify as \u201cvictims\u201d under the statute. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">For purposes of \u00a7 3663, \u201cthe term \u2018victim\u2019 means a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of an offense for which restitution may be ordered.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663(a)(2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cFor a person to be considered a victim under \u00a7 3663, the act that harms the individual must be ... conduct underlying an element of the offense of conviction.... \u201d <em>Blake, </em>81 F.3d at 506-07. In other words, the mere fact that an injury is related to a crime is insufficient for restitution; there must be a \u201cdirect and proximate\u201d connection between the two to support an award under \u00a7 3663.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">For example, in <em>Blake, </em>we held that a district court erred in recognizing as victims individuals whose credit cards were stolen by a defendant who ultimately pleaded guilty to unauthorized use of the credit cards. 81 F.3d at 506-07. The defendant was not convicted for any charges related to the actual theft of the cards. <em>Id. </em>at 506. Although the defendant could not have accomplished the crime for which he was convicted without stealing the credit cards, we held that the thefts of the cards could not support restitution under \u00a7 3663 because they did not constitute an element of the offense of conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 506-07. In other words, the connection between the theft of the cards and the ultimate offense of conviction was sufficiently attenuated to preclude the victims of the thefts from qualifying as \u201cvictims\u201d under the express text of \u00a7 3663.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">The holding in <em>Blake </em>is instructive to us here. Although we are not unsympathetic to the hardships that Petitioner has faced due to her OxyContin addiction, we cannot conclude that they were \u201cdirectly and proximately\u201d related to the conduct underlying Purdue\u2019s offense of conviction so as to justify restitution under \u00a7 3663. Purdue pleaded guilty to introducing a misbranded drug into interstate commerce with the intent to defraud or mislead. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 331(a), 333(a)(2). In order to qualify as a victim under \u00a7 3663, Petitioner would have to demonstrate that her injuries flowed \u201cdirectly and proximately\u201d from the conduct underlying one of the elements of this offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">Petitioner does not proffer, in either her affidavit or victim impact statement, any evidence from which we can conclude that she suffered \u201cdirect and proximate\u201d harm from Purdue\u2019s misbranding of OxyContin. She presents no evidence\u2014nor does she allege\u2014that she directly relied on\u2014or was even aware of\u2014any of the false or misleading information about OxyContin disseminated by Purdue. Even assuming that such information fostered common misconceptions of which Petitioner ultimately be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>came aware, the chain of causation between Purdue\u2019s conduct and her addiction is too attenuated to support application of \u00a7 3663.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Because we conclude that Petitioner does not qualify as a \u201cvictim\u201d under \u00a7 3663 and, therefore, is not entitled to restitution, we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in denying her motion under the CVRA to seek such restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Based on the foregoing, Jane Doe\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus is</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">\n<em>DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b287-12\">. The government\u2019s prosecution also focused on three of Purdue\u2019s executives. Although Petitioner did not limit her request for restitution to any specific defendant or subset of defendants below, her petition focuses exclusively on Purdue. We, therefore, have no cause to consider the district court\u2019s order with respect to any of the individual defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b288-5\">. Although the CVRA provides the vehicle for Petitioner to assert her right to restitution, it does not create an independent obligation for a district court to order or a defendant to pay such an award. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3771(a)(6) (protecting the right \"to full and complete restitution <em>as provided for in law\u201d </em>(emphasis added)). Rather, the CVRA merely protects the right to receive restitution that is provided for elsewhere. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b288-7\">. Our review of the record causes some concern due to the absence of discussion of the applicability\u2014or lack thereof\u2014of the conditions set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3563(a)(2) to Purdue\u2019s sentence of probation. It is true that tire district court had the discretion to award, or not award, restitution as a condition of Purdue\u2019s probation. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3563(a)(2). However, the district court does not appear to have made the specific findings required to support the exercise of its discretion in that regard. This is no criticism of the district court; it is unclear whether Petitioner called to its attention the requirements of \u00a7 3563(a)(2), on which her petition relies heavily. Regardless, because of our ultimate conclusion, any error in that regard was harmless</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b288-14\">. Because Petitioner has focused her petition solely on the district court's denial of her request for restitution from Purdue, we have no cause to address any of the other myriad issues raised or address in the sentencing proceedings below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b289-8\">. For purposes of this analysis, we assume that Purdue\u2019s offense is one for which restitution can be awarded under \u00a7 3663.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b290-10\">. We emphasize that our discussion of causation here is limited to the narrow context of interpreting whether Petitioner was \u201cdirectly and proximately harmed\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3663(a)(2). We express no view regarding any issue other than the applicability of \u00a7 3663, including issues of causation in a civil context.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b290-8\">KING, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A2T\">concurring in the denial of mandamus:</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">I agree with my good colleagues that we are obliged to deny Jane Doe\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus. In my view, however, there is no need to resolve the issue of whether Doe has forecast adequate proof of causation to establish that she was a \u201cvictim\u201d of the defendants\u2019 misbranding of OxyContin. Indeed, it is premature and counterproductive to address causation a complicated and contentious issue apparently at the heart of OxyContin-related cases pending across the country in our rush to dispose of Doe\u2019s petition within the oppressive time limits imposed by the Crime Victims\u2019 Rights Act (the \u201cCVRA\u201d). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3771(d)(3) (obliging court of appeals to decide CVRA mandamus petition within seventy-two hours). As the district court observed when it denied the restitution requests of Doe and others, resolution of the issue of causation would require \u201clitigation over many months, if not years, ... before final judgment in this case could be entered.\u201d <em>United States v. Purdue Frederick Co., </em>495 F.Supp.2d 569, 575 (W.D.Va.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-12\">Instead, I would deny Jane Doe\u2019s petition on a comparatively simple and obvious ground: even assuming she qualifies as a \u201cvictim\u201d of the defendants\u2019 crimes, there is no legal basis for her claim to mandatory restitution. As the panel majority has correctly observed, the CVRA itself \u201cdoes not create an independent obligation for a district court to order or a defendant to pay such an award.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 262 n. 2; <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3771(a)(6) (recognizing that crime victims have \u201c[t]he right to full and timely restitution <em>as provided in law\u201d </em>(emphasis added)). Doe has raised, at various points in these proceedings, three other statutes in support of her mandatory restitution claim: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663 (the \u201cVWPA\u201d); the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A (the \u201cMVRA\u201d); and the provision of Title 18 pertaining to conditions of probation, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3563. Unfortunately for Doe, the defendants\u2019 misbranding offenses are not included in the lists of federal crimes for which restitution can be ordered under either the VWPA or the MVRA. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3663(a)(1)(A), 3663A(c)(l)(A). And, although a district court is entitled to order restitution when it imposes a sentence of probation on a felony offense not covered by the VWPA or the MVRA, such an award is discretionary and not mandatory. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3563(a)(2) (providing that sentencing court must require defendant to abide by one of three conditions - with restitution being just one option - unless court finds on record that \u201cextraordinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>circumstances\u201d render each such condition \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Frankly, I would vastly prefer that the CVRA afforded us a fair opportunity to delve into the complex factual and legal underpinnings of Jane Doe\u2019s mandatory restitution claim (which the parties themselves barely had time to develop and discuss in their submissions in these proceedings). Under the circumstances presented, I am simply unable to agree with the panel majority\u2019s decision to reach and rule on the difficult question of causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Nonetheless, I concur in the denial of Jane Doe\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus to the distinguished presiding district judge, because I can see no valid legal basis for her mandatory restitution claim.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
