The motion to reopen follows a December 8, 1997 order affirming Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) William F. Jankun\u2019s order denying petitioner\u2019s request for asylum and withholding of deportation. <em>In re Man Kwan Wong, </em>No. A73 629 351 (B.I.A. Dec. 8, 1997), <em>aff'g </em>No. A73 629 351 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City June 11, 1996). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">Wong contends that the BIA abused its discretion in denying as untimely her motion to reopen, <em>see Abu Hasirah v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>478 F.3d 474, 476-77 (2d Cir.2007) (per curiam), because it erred in refusing to exercise its <em>sua sponte </em>discretion to reopen her proceeding following the approval of her Form I-140, immigrant petition for alien worker. The BIA\u2019s decision was not an abuse of discretion because the motion to reopen was not filed within 90 days of the final administrative decision, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), and none of the regulatory exceptions listed in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3) apply to this case. Additionally, this Court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision not to exercise its <em>sua sponte </em>powers in order to grant relief to petitioner. <em>See Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 518 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam) (holding that \u201ca decision of the BIA whether to reopen a case <em>sua sponte </em>under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) is entirely discretionary and therefore beyond our review\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED. The previously granted stay of deportation is VACATED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
