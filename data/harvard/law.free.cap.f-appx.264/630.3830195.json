Petitioner also contends that the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 is unconstitutional and irrational, because of the distinctions in obtaining relief that arise from NACARA. Petitioner also contends that the BIA erred in streamlining his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-17\">Petitioner\u2019s arguments lack merit. Petitioner\u2019s challenges to NACARA are foreclosed by <em>Jimenez-Angeles v. Ashcroft, </em>291 F.3d 594, 602-03 (9th Cir.2002). Also, the BIA did not violate petitioners\u2019 due process rights by issuing a streamlined decision without an opinion. <em>See Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 849 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-18\">Finally, petitioner contends that he established exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his United States citizen children. This court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-19\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED IN PART; AND DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b657-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
