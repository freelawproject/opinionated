The district court sentenced him, within the advisory guidelines range, to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment, three years\u2019 supervised release, and a $100 special assessment. On appeal Jones argues that (1) this court should abandon its presumption that a within-guidelines sentence is reasonable; (2) his prison sentence is \u201cgreater than necessary\u201d to achieve the purposes of sentencing; (3) the district court did not understand it had discretion to sentence outside the guidelines range; and (4) his prison sentence is unreasonable. All of these arguments are without merit, and we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Recent authority readily disposes of the first two arguments. Jones contends that applying a presumption of reasonableness to a sentence within the guidelines range conflicts with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), but <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 598, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), holds that appellate courts indeed may employ this presumption when reviewing a sentence for reasonableness. <em>See also Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Jones also insists that his prison term is too long to comply with the mandate of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) that a sentence be \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary\u201d to satisfy the purposes of sentencing, but that directive is met if the sentence imposed is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Jung, </em>473 F.3d 837, 844-45 (7th Cir.2007). The role of an appellate court is to review sentences for reasonableness, not to choose among possible sentences. Gall, 128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>United States v. Bustamante, </em>493 F.3d 879, 891 (7th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-13\">Jones\u2019s remaining arguments are specific to the facts of his case. He first contends that the district court did not appreciate its discretion to sentence him outside the guidelines range. However, the record belies this argument. The court explicitly acknowledged its authority to sentence Jones outside the guidelines range if warranted by the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The court stated\u2014correctly\u2014that it was required to consider the guidelines, but it said nothing suggesting a belief they were binding. Jones\u2019s attorney mistakenly conflates the court\u2019s acknowledgment that it was required to calculate the appropriate guidelines range with a belief that it was required to impose a sentence within that range.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-14\">Finally, Jones argues that his sentence is unreasonable. We review the sentence under an abuse of discretion standard, first ensuring the district court committed no significant procedural error and then considering the substantive reasonableness of the sentence under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. The district court correctly calculated the guidelines range. The base offense level for Jones\u2019s conviction is 14, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(6), and a 2-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, dropped the total offense level to 12. The court correctly computed a criminal history category of IV, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4A1.1(b), 4A1.1(c), 4A1.2(c)(1)(B), 4A1.2(k), which yielded a guidelines imprisonment range of 21 to 27 months. The district court then considered the statutory factors in \u00a7 3553(a), including Jones\u2019s criminal history, the need for deterrence, and the need to provide him with educational training and treatment for drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>addiction and mental-health issues. After undertaking these required steps, the court sentenced Jones to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment, the middle of the range. The district court adequately explained the reasons for its decision, including its rejection of Jones\u2019s arguments about his upbringing and the frequency of his crimes. The court\u2019s reasons for imposing its sentence were consistent with the factors in \u00a7 3553(a), and Jones\u2019s sentence is reasonable. <em>United States v. McIlrath, </em>512 F.3d 421, 426-27 (7th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
