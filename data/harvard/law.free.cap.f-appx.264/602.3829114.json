INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Initially, we must determine whether to review the IJ\u2019s or BIA\u2019s decision. \u201cGenerally, if the BIA conducts a de novo review of the record and makes an independent determination about whether relief is appropriate, we review the BIA\u2019s decision. If however, the BIA reviews the IJ\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>de Leon-Barrios v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 391, 393 (9th Cir.1997) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">In the present case, it is unclear whether the BIA conducted an independent review of the record and made its own finding that Liu is not credible, or whether the BIA reviewed the IJ\u2019s credibility finding for an abuse of discretion. We need not resolve this issue, however, because substantial evidence supports both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determinations. <em>Id.; see Cordon-Garcia v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 985, 990 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">The credibility of Liu\u2019s testimony was undercut by his knowing submission of a fraudulent document in support of his asylum claim. <em>See Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741, 745 (9th Cir.2004); <em>cf. Yeimane-Berhe v. Ashcroft, </em>393 F.3d 907, 911 (9th Cir.2004). Although Liu provided inconsistent testimony about when he learned that the document was fraudulent, it is clear that he made the discovery no later than 2003. Liu, however, did not disclose to the IJ that the document was fraudulent until after being confronted about the matter at his January 20, 2005 merits hearing. The fraudulent document goes to issues at the heart of Liu\u2019s asylum application. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003). The corroborating testimony of Liu\u2019s father also was not credible; he never corrected his declaration even though he knew that the warrant was fraudulent.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-12\">Liu\u2019s remaining evidence was not sufficient to compel a reasonable trier of fact to find in Liu\u2019s favor. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 817, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Consequently, Liu failed to demonstrate eligibility for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-13\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b629-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
