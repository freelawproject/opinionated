As the trustees administering the benefit plan (the Trustees, and, the Plan, respectively) did not arbitrarily or capriciously deny Pacconi\u2019s claim, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s entry of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-20\">As we write mainly for the parties, we only briefly recite the facts. After roughly 30 years of coal mine employment, Joseph Pacconi applied for a disability pension from the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) on June 20, 2003. Pacconi had suffered numerous work-related injuries, and claimed entitlement to benefits based on disabling back and neck conditions, bilateral plantar fibrosis, bilateral foot pain, partial tear of the left bicep, right ulnar neuritis, right hand carpal tunnel syndrome, and chronic ankle pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-21\">On September 16, 2004, the Trustees denied Pacconi\u2019s claim, concluding that none of Pacconi\u2019s medical conditions met the criteria for qualification under the Plan. The Trustees subsequently reaffirmed their denial of Pacconi\u2019s claim on two more occasions. In all three of these reviews of Pacconi\u2019s conditions, the examiners denied the claims based on Pacconi\u2019s failure to demonstrate a causal link\u2014that a mining accident caused the injuries in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-22\">Following these denials, Pacconi filed a complaint alleging wrongful denial of disability pension benefits against the Trustees under ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, <em>et seq. </em>The District Court granted the Trustees\u2019 motion for summary judgment, finding, among other things,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that while Pacco<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>ni had numerous ankle sprains, his doctor attributed his ankle condition to \u201cdegenerative arthritic changes, which would render the ankle condition ineligible for consideration under Q&amp;A 252\u201d\u2014the Trustees\u2019 interpretive \u201cquestion and answer\u201d guideline that disqualifies progressive conditions under the Plan. Pacconi appeals this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The main thrust of Pacconi\u2019s appeal is that the District Court impermissibly relied on the Trustees\u2019 post hoc justification for denying his claim. ERISA requires employee benefit plans \u201cprovide adequate notice\u201d to participants denied benefits under a plan, \u201csetting forth the specific reasons for such denial\u201d so to \u201cafford a reasonable opportunity ... for a full and fair review\u201d by the plan administrators. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1133; 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2560.502-1. To enable plan participants to contest denials of their claims, and to enable effective judicial review of the plan administrators\u2019 determinations, \u201ca reviewing court must focus on the evidence available to the plan administrators at the time of their decision and may not admit new evidence or consider <em>post hoc </em>rationales.\u201d <em>Flinders v. Workforce Stabilization Plan, </em>491 F.3d 1180, 1190 (10th Cir.2007) <em>(quoting King v. Hartford Life and Accident Ins. Co., </em>414 F.3d 994, 999 (8th Cir.2005) (refusing to allow claimants to \u201cbe sandbagged by after-the-fact plan interpretations devised for the purposes of litigation\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Pacconi\u2019s contention that the District Court considered a post hoc rationale for the Trustees\u2019 denial of his claims may have some merit. While the Trustees consistently explained that Pacconi was unable to prove that a mine accident caused his injuries, their specific reasons for this finding are more nuanced. In the Trustees\u2019 various letters of denial, the stated reason for disqualifying Pacconi\u2019s ankle condition claim was that \u201cit would not be reasonable to conclude that the event of June 11,1997, caused or contributed to Mr. Pacconi\u2019s right ankle pain status-post ankle reconstruction.\u201d App. 117. The Trustees reached this conclusion by finding that despite sustaining the injury on June 11, 1997, \u201c[tjhere was no evidence that [Pacconi] was treated for this condition until November 1997.\u201d App. 117. Moreover, \u201c[Pacconi] did not miss any time due to this accident\u201d and indeed, even after a ligament reconstruction procedure in 1999, he \u201creturned to regular duty and continued to work until he was laid off in January 2000.\u201d App. 117. The denial of Pacconi\u2019s claim regarding his chronic ankle pain was distinguished from his claims based on degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine, right hand carpal tunnel syndrome, and degenerative joint disease of the cervical spine, where the Trustees found such conditions did not \u201cresult[] from one specific event such as a mining accident.\u201d App. 115-117. Accordingly, while the Trustees disqualified these latter conditions based on the progressive (rather than event-specific) nature of the condition in question, the Trustees disqualified Pacconi\u2019s ankle condition by discounting the June 1997 event itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">Even if we assume, however, that the District Court did impermissibly rely on a post hoc justification, and thus we do not defer to this justification, <em>see Gritzer v. CBS, Inc., </em>275 F.3d 291, 296 (3d Cir.2002), the Trustees still exercised their discretion under the Plan in denying Pacconi\u2019s claims according to their consistently stated rationale: discounting the June 1997 accident. Where an employee benefit plan vests the administrators with discretion to make benefit determinations, we must defer absent arbitrai\u2019y and capricious conduct. <em>See Vitale v. Latrobe Area Hosp., </em>420 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>278, 281-82 (3d Cir.2005) (noting that because of this standard, the administrator\u2019s decision \u201cwill be overturned only if it is \u2018clearly not supported by the evidence in the record\u2019 \u201d); <em>Moats v. United Mine Workers of America Health, and Ret. Funds, </em>981 F.2d 685, 688 (3d Cir.1992) (\u201c[Ujnder the arbitrary and capricious standard, the trustees\u2019 interpretation should be upheld even if the court disagrees with it, so long as the interpretation is rationally related to a valid plan purpose and not contrary to the plain language of the plan.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">As noted above, evidence shows that despite Pacconi\u2019s June 1997 accident, he did not receive medical treatment until November. So too, he did not miss any time due to the accident, and he indeed returned to work after his ankle surgery and continued until the mines shut down. Accordingly, the Trustees\u2019 denial is supported by the record, and we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b242-17\">. Despite the myriad of conditions on which Pacconi based his claim, he limits this appeal to his chronic ankle pain and instability.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
