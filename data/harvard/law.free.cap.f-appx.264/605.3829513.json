Ferdous Ahmmed appeals his sentence, imposed following his conviction for three counts of witness retaliation in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1513(b)(1). He presents two arguments on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">First, Ahmmed argues that the district court erred when it refused to group his three counts of conviction for sentencing purposes under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(b). The three separate acts of witness retaliation that Ahmmed committed, separated by a period of months, were sufficiently distinct that they \u201ccannot be considered to represent essentially one composite harm.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2 cmt. n. 4; <em>of. United States v. Sneezer, </em>983 F.2d 920, 924-25 (9th Cir.1992) (per curiam). We affirm the district court\u2019s decision to not group the three counts of conviction under \u00a7 3D1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">Second, Ahmmed argues that the district court erred when it imposed an eight-level sentencing enhancement for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.2(b)(l) because his motive in committing the witness retaliation was purely retaliatory and not forward-looking. After oral argument in this case, the court decided <em>United States v. Calvert, </em>511 F.3d 1237 (9th Cir.2008), which squarely foreclosed Ahmmed\u2019s argument. It was not error for the district court to impose the eight level enhancement under \u00a7 2J1.2(b)(1). <em>Calven, </em>511 F.3d at 1245.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-12\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b632-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
