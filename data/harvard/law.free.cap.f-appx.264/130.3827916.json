Nelson pretermitting Mjahad\u2019s application for asylum and denying his applications for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Mjahad, </em>No. A 95 959 842 (B.I.A. Mar. 26, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 95 959 842 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Aug. 4, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity \"with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-23\">Where, as here, the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.Sd 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). The Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>dicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). It will vacate and remand for new findings, however, if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed or if the agency applied improper legal standards. <em>Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007). The Court reviews <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Mjahad concedes that this Court does not have jurisdiction to address the IJ\u2019s pretermission of his asylum claim. As such, we need only consider whether substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that Mjahad did not establish that he was persecuted or more likely than not would be persecuted or tortured upon his return to Morocco. Our review of the record leads us to conclude that substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">First, the agency reasonably found that Mjahad did not establish past persecution. Nothing in the record indicates that anything ever happened to Mjahad as a result of his homosexuality when he was in Morocco. Indeed, Mjahad stated that he suffered no past persecution in his brief to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Second, the agency\u2019s determination that Mjahad failed to establish that he would more likely than not be persecuted in the future was supported by the record. Mjahad\u2014who, despite his alleged fears, did not apply for asylum until nearly ten years after arriving in the United States\u2014did not testify that anyone sought to harm him in Morocco. He testified only that he had heard stories of homosexuals being persecuted there. Persecution suffered by individuals similarly situated might be relevant evidence of what could happen to Mjahad upon his return to Morocco. <em>See Poradisova v. Gonzales, </em>420 F.3d 70, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005). But we cannot conclude that the record here would compel any reasonable factfinder to conclude that Mjahad established a clear probability of future persecution where Mjahad never testified that anyone he knew suffered or was threatened with physical harm or even identified any specific event of persecution of a homosexual in Morocco. <em>See Jian Xing Huang v. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir.2005) (claims of a likelihood of harm, unsupported by solid evidence, are insufficient to establish objective fear of future persecution). Moreover, the agency reasonably found that the country conditions evidence failed to establish a likelihood of persecution. The article submitted by Mjahad does not discuss Morocco. And while State Department reports can help establish a likelihood of future persecution, <em>see Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 400 (2d Cir.2006), the country conditions report in this case does not discuss any issues faced by homosexuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">Because nothing in the record compels the conclusion that Mjahad was persecuted or will likely be persecuted upon return to Morocco, the IJ did not err in denying withholding of removal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1208.16(b)(1)(B)(iii), (b)(2). Because Mjahad\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same factual predicate, it too must fail in light of Mjahad\u2019s failure to establish a likelihood that he would be harmed. <em>See Kyaw Zwar Tun v. INS, </em>445 F.3d 554, 566-67 (2d Cir.2006); <em>see also Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
