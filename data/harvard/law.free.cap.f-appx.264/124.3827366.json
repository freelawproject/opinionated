Lamb denying Chen\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Yan Wu Chen, </em>No. A 97 958 262 (B.I.A. May 11, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 97 958 262 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Oct. 28, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-18\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007) (quoting section 1252(B)(4)(b); internal quotation marks omitted). However, we review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-19\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that Chen failed to establish that the harm he allegedly endured and continues to fear was on account of one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>the protected grounds. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42); <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. U.S. I.N.S., </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 <em>&amp; </em>n. 7 (2d Cir.2004). Chen\u2019s assertion that his alleged persecutors are motivated by his defiance of China\u2019s family planning policy is belied by his own testimony that the police sought to arrest him because the \u201cson of the Secretary of the village also liked [his] girlfriend\u201d and that he would be jailed and beaten if returned to China because he called the village secretary a \u201ccorrupted official.\u201d Although Chen asserts that his threat to reveal the village secretary\u2019s alleged embezzlement demonstrates a nexus to political opinion or imputed political opinion, Chen\u2019s threat does not appear to be motivated by anything except his self-interest; indeed, Chen testified that he threatened to reveal the village secretary\u2019s corruption to prevent his son from trying to separate Chen from his girlfriend. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 547-48 (2d Cir.2005). Chen has presented no evidence, direct or circumstantial, that would support the conclusion that his alleged persecutors imputed any political opinion to him or that the alleged persecution he fears involves anything other than a personal dispute with the son of the village secretary. Because substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that Chen failed to establish a nexus to a protected ground, the agency properly denied asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(i); <em>Yueqing Zhang, </em>426 F.3d at 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Substantial evidence also supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Chen failed to establish that he would more likely than not be tortured upon his return to China based on his illegal departure. In support of his CAT claim, Chen submitted general background evidence indicating that illegal emigrants are detained and that some Chinese prisoners may be tortured. However, \u201ca risk that any individual detainee in China may be subjected to repressive conditions in prison\u201d is insufficient to compel a finding that a specific alien would more likely than not be tortured if imprisoned on return to China. <em>Mu Xiang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>432 F.3d 156, 159-61 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Our review having been completed, the petition for a stay of removal is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
