It is</p>\n<p id=\"b30-23\">ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the petition for review be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-24\">The Florida Municipal Power Agency is a public body that, among other things, buys power transmission service from Florida Power &amp; Light Co. (FPL or Florida Power) on behalf, of its member cities. Since 1993, it has pressed various challenges to a transmission tariff filed by FPL. The history of those challenges is recounted in <em>Florida Municipal Power Agency v. FERC (FMPA), </em>411 F.3d 287 (D.C.Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-25\">The Federal Power Act requires that regulated power transmission rates be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>\u201cjust and reasonable.\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 824d-824e. Invoking this requirement, the FMPA eventually asked the Commission to create an exception to FPL\u2019s tariff on the ground that the tariff enabled FPL to charge the FMPA \u201cfor network transmission integration service to serve load where [Florida Power] cannot provide the service because of physical transmission limitations.\u201d <em>FMPA, </em>411 F.3d at 290 (alteration in original). When the Commission denied the FMPA\u2019s request, the FMPA petitioned for review. We held the Commission \u201cerred in failing to consider the appropriateness\u201d of the requested exception. <em>Id. </em>at 292. We then remanded the case to the Commission to consider the \u201cdiscrete issue\u201d of \u201cwhy network customers should be charged by the transmission provider for network service that the provider is physically constrained from offering and, relatedly, why physical impossibility should not be recognized as an exception to the general rule against permitting partial load ratio pricing for network customers.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">On remand, the Commission again denied the requested exception for \u201cphysical impossibility.\u201d <em>Fla. Mun. Power Agency v. Fla. Power &amp; Light Co., </em>113 F.E.R.C. P61,290 (Dec. 20, 2005) (Order on Remand). It then denied the FMPA\u2019s petition for rehearing. <em>Fla. Mun. Power Agency v. Fla. Power &amp; Light Co., </em>116 F.E.R.C. P61,012 (July 6, 2006) (Order Denying Reh\u2019g). The FMPA petitioned for review of these two orders on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">The FMPA advances two arguments. First, it contends the Commission \u201crefused] to do what this Court said it must do\u201d on remand, namely, consider whether an exception to FPL\u2019s tariff for \u201cphysical impossibility\u201d is appropriate. Petitioner focuses upon the Commission\u2019s statement in the Order on Remand that it \u201cdisagree[d] with FMPA\u2019s position that [it was] bound to consider its alternative proposal.\u201d Order on Remand, 113 F.E.R.C. at 62,171. Whatever the Commission meant by that statement, it did not mean that it would not comply with our instruction; the Commission devoted the balance of its Order on Remand to explaining why the FMPA\u2019s proposed exception is not appropriate. We did not require the Commission to reach any particular decision on remand with respect to the FMPA\u2019s proposal; we required only that the Commission consider that proposal and explain its decision. It is clear the Commission has done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">Second, petitioner contends the Commission\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious. <em>See FMPA, </em>411 F.3d at 291; 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). On remand, the Commission offered several reasons for denying the FMPA\u2019s request, foremost among them that the proposed exception \u201cwould be virtually impossible for [FPL] to administer and for the Commission to oversee to ensure that there would be no undue discrimination.\u201d Order on Remand, 113 F.E.R.C. at 62,172. We find no reason to doubt the Commission\u2019s judgment on this score. <em>See Transmission Access Policy Study Group v. FERC, </em>225 F.3d 667, 714 (D.C.Cir.2000) (\u201cIt is not enough for petitioners to convince us of the reasonableness of them views.... [Petitioners must demonstrate that FERC\u2019s policy judgments are arbitrary or capricious, a heavy burden indeed.\u201d); <em>N. States Power Co. (Minn.) v. FERC, </em>30 F.3d 177, 180 (D.C.Cir.1994) (\u201cour review of whether a particular rate design is \u2018just and reasonable\u2019 is highly deferential\u201d) (quoting 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824d(a)). We hold the Commission\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s request for an exception for \u201cphysical impossibility\u201d was not arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C. Cm. R. 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
