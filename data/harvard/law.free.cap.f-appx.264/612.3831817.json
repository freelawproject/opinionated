Absent exigency or consent, a warrantless search of a home violates the Fourth Amendment, and evidence recovered in such a search must be suppressed. <em>See United States v. Shaibu, </em>920 F.2d 1423, 1425 (9th Cir.1990). The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>found that Martin had consented to the police entry into his home. We review this factual determination for clear error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Martin\u2019s statement to the police officer that \u201cwe\u201d need to go into the house to recover the rifle that Martin had fired was sufficient to ground an inference of consent. Further, the totality of the circumstances does not indicate that Martin\u2019s agreement was coerced. Therefore, the district court did not clearly err in finding consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">We AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b638-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
