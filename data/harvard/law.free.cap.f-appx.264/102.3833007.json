Feb. 20, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 97 329 696 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City, July 5, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">When the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See, e.g., Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Yu Sheng Zhang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>362 F.3d 155, 159 (2d Cir.2004). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">The agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence: (1) Jiang testified at her individual hearing that she learned, prior to leaving China, that the authorities wanted to arrest her for being a Falun Gong supporter, but omitted this fact at her airport or credible fear interviews; (2) she testified that her parents were arrested for being Falun Gong practitioners, but that is inconsistent with her statement at her airport interview that she is \u201cnot sure\u201d if her parents are involved with Falun Gong; (3) Jiang claimed that authorities wanted to arrest her, but her father\u2019s letter does not indicate that they have come to the family\u2019s house looking for her; and (4) the documents Jiang submitted failed to rehabilitate her testimony. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 341 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Zhou Yun Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">These findings are plainly central to Jiang\u2019s claims for relief, because they call into question her assertion that the authorities want to arrest her for being a Falun Gong supporter. <em>See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 308-09 (2d Cir.2003). Jiang was given the opportunity to explain these inconsistencies and omissions, but the IJ reasonably rejected her explanations. <em>Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005) (holding that the agency need not credit an applicant\u2019s explanations for inconsistent testimony unless those explanations would compel a reasonable fact-finder to do so).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">Jiang argues that the IJ made errors in arriving at the adverse credibility finding. For example, Jiang attacks the adverse inference drawn from the fact her parents have not retrieved the Falun Gong materials she allegedly buried. We need not decide whether this was error, or whether Jiang has correctly identified any errors, because remand would be futile. Based on the properly-made findings, it can be \u201cconfidently predict[ed]\u201d that the IJ would reach the same decision on any remand. <em>Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
