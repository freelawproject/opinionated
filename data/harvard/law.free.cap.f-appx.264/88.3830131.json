Jankun, denying Huang\u2019s applications for asylum and withholding of deportation. <em>In re Huang, </em>No. A 73 186 489 (B.I.A. May 16, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 73 186 489 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Nov. 28, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>This Court reviews the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See, e.g., Dong Gao v. BIA, </em>482 F.3d 122,126 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">We conclude that the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence. The IJ found, and the BIA agreed, that there were numerous material inconsistencies in Huang\u2019s testimony and between that testimony and his documentary evidence. The IJ accurately found that the discrepancies and omissions regarding the date of Huang\u2019s marriage, whether and when he had wed, whether he had broken his hand during an altercation with family planning officials, his whereabouts during his son\u2019s birth, and whether a fine levied against him had been paid (and by whom) were all material to Huang\u2019s claim. Viewed cumulatively, they provided ample support for the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 402 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201cEven where an IJ relies on discrepancies or lacunae that, if taken separately, concern matters collateral or ancillary to the claim, ... the cumulative effect may nevertheless be deemed consequential by the fact-finder.\u201d) (internal citations omitted). Moreover, the IJ did not have to credit Huang\u2019s efforts to explain the discrepancies. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Huang further challenges the agency\u2019s finding that the marriage certificate he submitted deserved little weight because the photograph was deemed a composite in a forensics report. We have observed, however, that the weight afforded to an applicant\u2019s evidence in immigration proceedings \u201clies largely within the discretion of the IJ.\u201d <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 342 (2d Cir.2006). Huang failed to rebut the forensics report and his contentions that \u201cthere are different methods utilized in taking peoples photos\u201d does not alter the IJ\u2019s discretion to discount the certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-13\">Furthermore, as the agency found, even if Huang were deemed credible, he failed to meet his burden of establishing past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. First, the IJ reasonably rejected Huang\u2019s explanation for why, after so many years, the authorities would still be interested in him, particularly where his wife has had no difficulties with the authorities other than being asked to report for physical examinations. Second, the agency reasonably found that, if the authorities are still looking for Huang on account of his physical altercation with family planning officials in 1992, sanctions for criminal violations do not constitute persecution. <em>See Saleh v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>962 F.2d 234, 239 (2d Cir.1992) (persecution does not encompass punishment for violation of a generally applicable criminal law). Finally, Huang\u2019s wife\u2019s alleged abortion does not constitute persecution of Huang himself. <em>See Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dept, of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 308 (2d Cir.2007) <em>(en banc </em>).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-14\">Because the only evidence of a threat to Huang\u2019s life or freedom depended upon his credibility, the adverse credibility determi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>nation in this case necessarily precludes success on his claim for withholding of deportation. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006). This Court lacks jurisdiction to review Huang\u2019s argument that he is entitled to relief under the Convention Against Torture because that claim was not exhausted at the administrative level. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>see generally Gill v. INS, </em>420 F.3d 82, 86 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b115-7\">. We note that both in his brief to the BIA and this Court, Huang failed to address most of the cited inconsistencies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b115-10\">. Judge Sotomayor continues to disagree with the majority opinion in <em>Shi Liang Lin </em>to the extent it applies beyond unmarried partners, <em>see Shi Liang Lin, </em>494 F.3d at 327 (Sotomayor, J., concurring), but she is bound by court precedent, <em>see United States v. Wilkerson, </em>361 F.3d 717, 732 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
