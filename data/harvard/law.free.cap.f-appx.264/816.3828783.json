After careful review, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Where, as here, the BIA issues its own decision, our review is limited only to that decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). In its opinion, the BIA did not adopt any of the IJ\u2019s decision, so we will review only the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">We review an agency\u2019s statutory interpretation of its laws and regulations <em>de novo. Antipova v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 1259, 1261 (11th Cir.2004) (quotations omitted). In reviewing the BIA\u2019s fact findings, we \u201cconsider only whether there is substantial evidence for the findings ..., not whether there is substantial evidence for some other finding that could have been ... made.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1029 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc) (quotation omitted). Under this highly deferential standard of review, we may not reweigh the evidence from scratch. <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006). Rather, we view the record evidence in the light most favorable to the BIA\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision. <em>Id. </em>Under the substantial evidence test, the denial of asylum may be reversed only if the evidence would <em>compel </em>a reasonable factfinder to find that the requisite fear of persecution exists. <em>I.N.S. v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>see also </em>INA \u00a7 242(b)(4)(B) (\u201cadministrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General or Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is defined in the INA as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsJ\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution <em>on account of </em>race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-12\">The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. To establish asylum eligibility, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>such future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>see Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. In order to be eligible for asylum, the asylum applicant must\u2014in addition to demonstrating past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution\u2014establish that such persecution is \u201con account of\u2019 one of the enumerated statutory grounds. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(i) (\u201cTo establish that the applicant is a refugee ... the applicant must establish that race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion was or will be at least one central reason for persecuting the applicant\u201d); <em>Mazariegos v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2001) (stating that the asylum applicant must provide evidence that \u201che was mistreated because of his political opinion, or one of the other grounds, rather than for some other reason.\u201d) (internal quotations omitted). \u201cDemonstrating such a connection requires the alien to present specific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution on account of [a statutory factor].\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287 (internal quotations and citation omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">For purposes of establishing the requisite nexus, it is well-settled that one of the five protected grounds need not be the only motivation for alleged prosecution. <em>Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1232 (11th Cir.2007) (explaining mixed-motive theory of proving nexus). However, under the REAL ID Act, which applies to Samarskaya\u2019s case, the applicant must demonstrate that one of those enumerated grounds \u201cwas or will be at least one central reason for persecuting\u201d him or her. INA \u00a7 208(b)(1)(B)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(i) (as amended by the REAL ID Act \u00a7 101(a)(3)) (effective May 11, 2005, \u201cfor applications for asylum, withholding, or other relief from removal made on or after\u201d that effective date).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">If the alien establishes past persecution, it is presumed that her life or freedom would be threatened upon a return to that country unless the government shows by a preponderance that the country\u2019s conditions have changed such that the applicant\u2019s life or freedom would no longer be threatened upon her removal or that the alien could relocate within the country and it would be reasonable to expect her to do so. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b). An alien who has not shown past persecution may still be entitled to asylum if she can demonstrate a future threat in her country to her life or freedom on a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2). To establish a well-founded fear, \u201can applicant must demonstrate that his or her fear of persecution is subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">Here, the facts do not compel us to conclude, contrary to the BIA\u2019s decision, that Samarskaya met her burden to establish a nexus between her religion and the two incidents on which she relied to show past persecution. First, she said that skinheads attacked her, and, in the course of the attack, called her a \u201cwhore\u201d and a \u201cprostitute,\u201d which she understood to mean that the skinheads thought she had \u201csold out\u201d her country and religion. Second, Samarskaya claimed she was fired from her job due to her religion. Her former employer gave her three months\u2019 notice of its intent to fire her, citing its need to reduce staff, with no indication that the termination was related in any way to her religion. As the BIA put it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmL\">The respondent\u2019s claim is too speculative. In order to find that the respondent established a requisite nexus, we must assume that her employer fired her not because they were downsizing, but because they discovered her reli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>gious beliefs and wanted to punish her on account of them. We would also have to assume that the motive of the men who attacked [her] was connected to her religion. We will not rely on a chain of assumptions to find that the respondent has met her burden of proof. The respondent has not submitted any evidence establishing that she was harmed on account of a protected ground ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">On this record, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the BIA\u2019s conclusion, and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision, the evidence presented in this case does not compel a conclusion contrary to the finding of the BIA on the nexus element of Samarskaya\u2019s asylum claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AXk\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b843-7\">. Samarskaya also sought withholding of removal under the INA and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). In her appeal to the BIA, she did not challenge the IJ's denial of withholding of removal. Accordingly, she has not exhausted that claim and we lack jurisdiction to review it. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250-51 (11th Cir.2006). In any event, the burden of proof for an alien seeking withholding of removal under the INA, or under the CAT, is higher than the burden for establishing asylum. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1303. Where, as here, an alien is unable to meet the less stringent standard for asylum, her claims for withholding or CAT relief necessarily also fail. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b845-15\">. To the extent Samarskaya suggests the BIA should have applied a mixed-motive analysis to her asylum claim, and did not, our conclusion would be the same, even under a mixed-motive theory, since Samarskaya has not shown that her religion was one central reason for her mistreatment. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(i).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
