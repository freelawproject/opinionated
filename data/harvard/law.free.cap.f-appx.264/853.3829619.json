On appeal, Lopez first argues that the district court erred by finding that his sentence warranted a two-level enhancement because he was a mid-level supervisor, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(c). Second, Lopez argues that the statutory minimum sentence provisions of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) are unconstitutional under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the U.S. Constitution and violate his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. Based on our review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we vacate and remand for resentencing as to the first issue and affirm as to the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-15\">I. Aggravating-Role Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b880-16\">We review a district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in an offense for clear error. <em>United States v. Jiminez, </em>224 F.3d 1243, 1250-51 (11th Cir.2000). \u201c[T]he ultimate determination of role in the offense is also a fundamentally factual determination entitled to due deference.\u2019\u2019 <em>United States v. Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 938 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en </em>banc). \u201cThe government bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant had an aggravating role in the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Yeager, </em>331 F.3d 1216, 1226 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cThe findings of fact of the sentencing court may be based on evidence heard during trial, facts admitted by a defendant\u2019s plea of guilty, undisputed statements in the presentence report, or evidence presented at the sentencing hearing.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>884 F.2d 1355, 1356 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-17\">Section 3B1.1(c) of the Sentencing Guidelines provides, \u201cIf the defendant was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in any criminal activity [that involved fewer than 5 participants and was not otherwise extensive], increase by 2 levels.\u201d The commentary elaborates, \u201cTo qualify for an adjustment under this section, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>defendant must have been the organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of one or more other participants.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.2). A \u201cparticipant\u201d is \u201ca person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the offense, but need not have been convicted.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.l). An undercover law enforcement officer is not a participant. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n. 1). \u201c \u2018[Participation\u2019 under the aggravating and mitigating role guidelines implies criminal liability and intent, that the individual be an actual member of the plan or conspiracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Costales, </em>5 F.3d 480, 484 (11th Cir.1993). We have held that \u201ca mere buyer/seller relationship is inadequate to link individuals to a conspiracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Revel, </em>971 F.2d 656, 660 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">In order to warrant an enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(e), a defendant must have \u201ccontrol over another participant in the criminal activity.\u201d <em>United States v. Harness, </em>180 F.3d 1232, 1235 (11th Cir.1999). The \u201cassertion of control or influence over only one individual is enough to support a \u00a7 3B1.1(c) enhancement.\u201d <em>Jiminez, </em>224 F.3d at 1251. A district court errs if there is no evidence or findings of fact that would support the conclusion that a defendant organized, led, managed, or supervised one or more participants who engaged in the criminal activities. <em>See Harness, </em>180 F.3d at 1235.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">Here, we conclude from the record that the district court clearly erred by finding that Lopez warranted an aggravating-role enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) because there is no evidence to support the finding that Lopez controlled another participant in the criminal offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">II. Constitutionality of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a statute is constitutional. <em>United States v. Reynolds, </em>215 F.3d 1210, 1212 (11th Cir.2000). Section 841(b)(1) of Title 21 provides, in part, that \u201cany person who violates subsection (a) of this section involving ... 5 kilograms or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of ... cocaine ... shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment which may not be less than 10 years or more than life ...\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(ii)(II).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-11\">We have upheld the constitutionality of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)\u2019s mandatory minimum sentencing provisions against due process, equal protection, and Eighth Amendment challenges. <em>See United States v. Holmes, </em>838 F.2d 1175, 1177-78 (11th Cir.1988) (holding that \u00a7 841(b)(1)\u2019s mandatory minimum provisions were rationally related to the objectives of protecting public health and welfare); <em>United States v. Willis, </em>956 F.2d 248, 251 (11th Cir.1992) (holding that the mandatory life sentence provisions of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1) do not violate Eighth Amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-12\">Because we previously have held that the mandatory minimum sentence provisions in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1) are constitutional, Lopez\u2019s argument that they are unconstitutional fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-13\">In conclusion, because no evidence supports the finding that Lopez controlled another participant in the criminal offense, we vacate Lopez\u2019s sentence and remand this case for resentencing. Because we have held that the mandatory minimum sentence provisions in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1) are constitutional, we affirm as to the second issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-14\">VACATED AND REMANDED in part, AFFIRMED in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
