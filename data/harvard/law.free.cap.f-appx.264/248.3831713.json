The District Court dismissed her suit on sovereign immunity grounds. We will affirm for the reasons set forth in its opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-23\">The FTCA waives the sovereign immunity of the federal government for tort claims arising from the negligence of its employees action within the scope of their employment. However, \u201can initial presentation of the claim to the appropriate federal agency and a final denial by that agency\u201d are non-waivable jurisdictional prerequisites for suits brought under the FTCA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675(a); <em>Bialowas v. United States, </em>443 F.2d 1047, 1049 (3d Cir.1971). In order to properly present such a claim, a plaintiff must provide the agency with written notification of the incident involved \u201caccompanied by a claim for money damages in a sum certain,\u201d known as the \u201csum requirement.\u201d 39 C.F.R. \u00a7 912.5(a); <em>Bialowas, </em>443 F.2d at 1049. The purpose of the \u201csum requirement\u201d is to \u201cenable a determination by the head of the federal agency as to whether the claim falls within the jurisdictional limits of his exclusive authority to process, settle or to properly adjudicate the claim ... [and] to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>set up uniform procedures in the exercise of settlement authority.\u201d <em>Bialowas, </em>448 F.2d at 1050. Thus, a plaintiff must state a \u201cspecific sum\u201d or \u201cinformation ... from which a specific amount could be computed.\u201d <em>Bialowas, </em>443 F.2d at 1049; <em>see also Hawa Abdi Jama v. INS, </em>22 F.Supp.2d 353, 367 (D.N.J.1998). If a plaintiff fails to do so, then a district court is deprived of jurisdiction over the FTCA claim. <em>Bialowas, </em>443 F.2d at 1049; <em>Tucker v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>676 F.2d 954, 959 (3d Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">On September 27, 2004, Bruno, through counsel, submitted a letter to the United States Postal Service giving notice that she had suffered injuries as a result of the negligence of its employees. That letter failed to state, however, a specific sum or \u201cinformation ... from which a specific amount could be computed.\u201d <em>Bialowas, </em>443 F.2d at 1049. This deficiency was not cured prior to the filing of this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The order of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
