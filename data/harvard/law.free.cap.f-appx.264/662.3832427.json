We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Dominguez contends that the district court erred in applying a four-level upward adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) because the pre-sentence report was insufficient to establish that he \u201cpossessed\u201d a firearm in connection with another felony offense and that the district court should have applied a clear and convincing evidentiary standard in determining whether the adjustment applied. We disagree. We conclude that the relevant statements in the pre-sentence report bore a sufficient indicia of reliability, <em>see United States v. Marin-Cuevas, </em>147 F.8d 889, 895 (9th Cir.1998), and the district court did not err in applying a preponderance of the evidence standard. <em>See United States v. Riley, </em>335 F.3d 919, 925-26 (9th Cir.2003). Accordingly, we conclude there was sufficient evidence to demonstrate that Dominguez \u201cpossessed\u201d a firearm in connection with felonious conduct. <em>See United States v. Polanco, </em>93 F.3d 555, 566-67 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Dominguez further contends that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to consider all of the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We disagree. The district court properly analyzed the \u00a7 3553 factors, and we conclude that Dominguez\u2019s sentence is not unreasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597-98, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b688-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
