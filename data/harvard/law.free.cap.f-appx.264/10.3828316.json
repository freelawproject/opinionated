It is</p>\n<p id=\"b37-16\">ORDERED that the appeal is hereby dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-17\">The United States Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) issued five-year nationwide pollutant discharge permits in 2002 (2002 NWPs) pursuant to section 404(e) of the Clean Water Act (CWA), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344(e). The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) challenged the 2002 permits in district court, arguing that the Corps failed to consider whether the selected acreage limitations would cause only \u201cminimal adverse environmental effects\u201d as required by 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344(e)(1). On November 24, 2003, the district court granted summary judgment to the Corps, concluding that issuance of the 2002 permits did not constitute \u201cfinal agency action.\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Home Builders v. U.S. Army Corp. of Eng\u2019rs, </em>297 F.Supp.2d 74, 78 (D.D.C.2003). This Court reversed in part, holding that the Corps\u2019 issuance of NWPs constitutes final agency action subject to judicial review. <em>Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Home Builders v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, </em>417 F.3d 1272, 1278-84 (D.C.Cir.2005). On remand, the district court again granted summary judgment to the Corps, concluding that the inclusion of various acreage limitations in the 2002 NWPs was neither arbitrary nor capricious. <em>Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Home Builders v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, </em>453 F.Supp.2d 116 (D.D.C.2006). Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>NAHB timely appealed on November 22, 2006, the 2002 NWPs expired on March 18, 2007. The Corps subsequently issued 2007 NWPs, which by statute expire no later than March 18, 2012. <em>See </em>72 Fed.Reg. 11,092 (Mar. 12, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">While acknowledging that the 2002 NWPs have expired, NAHB argues that its claim is not moot pursuant to the \u201c \u2018capable of repetition, yet evading review\u2019 \u201d exception to the mootness doctrine. <em>Fund for Animals, Inc. v. Hogan, </em>428 F.3d 1059, 1064 (D.C.Cir.2005) (quoting <em>S. Pac. Terminal. Co. v. ICC, </em>219 U.S. 498, 515, 31 S.Ct. 279, 55 L.Ed. 310 (1911)). \u201cThe exception applies where \u2018(1) the challenged action is in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration; and (2) there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subject to the same action again.\u2019 \u201d <em>FEC v. Wis. Right to Life, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2652, 2662, 168 L.Ed.2d 329 (2007) (quoting <em>Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 17, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998)). \u201cThe burden is on the petitioner to show that these requirements are met.\u201d <em>S. Co. Servs., Inc. v. FERC, </em>416 F.3d 39, 43 (D.C.Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">Notwithstanding this Court\u2019s \u201cgeneral rule\u201d that \u201ctwo years is enough time for a dispute to be litigated,\u201d <em>Fund For Animals, </em>428 F.3d at 1064, NAHB contends that the NWPs\u2014which, as noted, have a maximum lifespan of five years, <em>see </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344(e)(2)\u2014have \u201cproven to be too short in duration to be fully litigated before they expire.\u201d Reply Br. at 4. NAHB first points out that the 2002 NWPs\u2019 expiration before this Court could render judgment is evidence that the 2007 NWPs are likely to evade review. Now that we have resolved threshold jurisdictional issues regarding challenges to NWPs, <em>see Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Home Builders, </em>417 F.3d at 1278-84, however, NAHB\u2019s challenge to the 2007 NWPs will most likely proceed expeditiously. NAHB also cites four NAHB challenges that were pending in this Circuit between four and one-half and ten years before final disposition. <em>See </em>Reply Br. at 8. But NAHB\u2019s examples do not suggest that the 2007 NWPs are likely to \u201cevade review.\u201d Two of the cited cases did not involve CWA permits, <em>see Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Home Builders v. Norton, </em>415 F.3d 8 (D.C.Cir.2005) (challenge to Department of Interior survey protocols relating to quino checkerspot butterfly); <em>Spirit of the Sage Council v. Kempthorne, </em>511 F.Supp.2d 31 (D.D.C.2007) (challenge to two Fish and Wildlife Service rules under Endangered Species Act); one case involved a rule rather than an NWP itself, <em>see Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Home Builders v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, </em>C.A. No. 01-0274, 2007 WL 259944 (D.D.C. Jan. 30, 2007) (challenge to rule regarding use of \u201cmechanized earth-moving equipment\u201d resulting in discharge of \u201cdredged or fill material\u201d subject to permit requirements); and the final case was resolved in less than five years, <em>see Nat\u2019l Min. Ass\u2019n v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, </em>145 F.3d 1399 (D.C.Cir.1998) (challenge to incidental fallback accompanying dredging as subject to CWA permit provisions). In fact, challenges to NWPs have been litigated on the merits before the NWPs expire. <em>See, e.g., Ohio Valley Envtl. Coal. v. Bulen, </em>429 F.3d 493 (4th Cir.2005) (appeal of facial challenge to NWP decided within 3.5 years); <em>Shelton v. Marsh, </em>902 F.2d 1201 (6th Cir.1990) (appeal of challenge to NWP decided in less than two years). Accordingly, NAHB has failed to demonstrate that the 2007 NWPs are likely to evade review.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-11\">Nor has NAHB shown that its challenge to the 2002 NWPs is capable of repetition. NAHB asserts that the \u201c2007 NWPs suffer from the same defects as the 2002 NWPs,\u201d Reply Br. at 10, because, in each instance, the Corps failed to consider whether the selected acreage limitations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>would cause only \u201cminimal adverse environmental effects.\u201d This assertion, however, does not raise a facial challenge to any Corps rule. Instead, NAHB\u2019s disagreement is with the Corps\u2019 application of the statutory requirement under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344(e)(1). But the application of the statutory environmental effects test necessarily varies from one permit period to the next, depending upon the circumstances the Corps considers. NAHB\u2019s challenge will require review of a different record from the one on which the 2002 NWPs were issued\u2014a record containing new explanations, analyses and assessments, <em>compare </em>67 Fed.Reg.2020 (Jan. 15, 2002) (issuance of 2002 NWPs) <em>with </em>72 Fed.Reg. 11,092 (Mar. 12, 2007) (issuance of 2007 NWPs); <em>see Montgomery Envtl. Coal. v. Costle, </em>646 F.2d 568, 584 (D.C.Cir.1980) (\u201cquestion of sufficiency of the evidence\u201d moot because challenged permit expired and new permit will involve \u201centirely new factual record\u201d). For example, the one-tenth\u2014acre preconstruction notification threshold required for the 2002 NWPs was altered for the 2007 NWPs\u2014issuance of the 2007 NWPs instead requires preconstruction notification for all activities regardless of acreage. <em>See </em>72 Fed.Reg. at 11,095.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we dismiss NAHB\u2019s petition as moot. Our dismissal does not, however, preclude NAHB from seeking review of the 2007 (or subsequent) NWPs.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
