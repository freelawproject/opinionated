We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-24\">Placencia-Medina asserts that Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.1 and the Due Process clause of the United States Constitution required the district court to engage in a voluntariness-type colloquy before accepting his admission to violating the terms of his supervised release. He is incorrect. This Court has emphasized that \u201c[proceedings to revoke supervised release, probation or parole need not comply with the procedural protections constitutionally guaranteed for criminal prosecutions.\u201d <em>United States v. Soto-Olivas, </em>44 F.3d 788, 792 (9th Cir.1995). In particular, we have held that admissions made at probation revocation proceedings are not the equivalent of a guilty pleas, which must be voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. <em>See United States v. Segal, </em>549 F.2d 1293, 1296-1301 (9th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-25\">Placencia-Medina also contends that the district court erred by employing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>wrong statutory scheme for the revocation sentence. He specifically contends that the district court impermissibly considered \u201cjust punishment\u201d as a basis for imposing the supervised release revocation sentence. However, a review of the record discloses that the district court appropriately imposed the sentence based upon the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), including Placencia-Medina\u2019s history and characteristics and his \u201cbreach of trust.\u201d <em>See United, States v. Simtob, </em>485 F.3d 1058, 1062 (9th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Miqbel, </em>444 F.3d 1173, 1181-82 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Finally, Placeneia-Medina contends that his 12-month sentence, imposed consecutive to the sentence for the underlying offense, was unreasonable and that the district court failed to adequately state the reasons for its sentence. We conclude that the district court considered the appropriate sentencing factors, imposed a sentence that was not unreasonable, and adequately explained its reasons for the sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a), 3583(e); <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2469,168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>Miqbel, </em>444 F.3d at 1182.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b619-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
