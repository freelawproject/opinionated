R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b693-10\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-11\">Alfredo Soto, a native and citizen of Mexico, petitions for review of the order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) that adopted and affirmed the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) denial of his application for asylum and withholding of removal. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>see Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962 (9th Cir.2004), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-12\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination based upon Soto\u2019s demeanor while testifying. The IJ identified Soto\u2019s hesitation and evasiveness with sufficient particularity to support the demeanor finding. <em>See Arulampalam v. Ashcroft, </em>353 F.3d 679, 686 (9th Cir.2003). The demeanor finding also augmented the IJ\u2019s findings on inconsistencies between Soto\u2019s testimony and asylum application regarding the threats he received. <em>See Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1151 (9th Cir.1999) (affirming an adverse credibility finding where demeanor, inconsistent testimony, and implausible explanations all supported the IJ\u2019s credibility determination). Further, the IJ properly concluded that evasive and inconsistent testimony about subsequent detentions at the border undermined his overall credibility. <em>See Kaur v. Gonzales, </em>418 F.3d 1061, 1067 (9th Cir.2005). Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Soto failed to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See Li, </em>378 F.3d at 963.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-17\">Because Soto failed to meet his burden for asylum, he necessarily did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Alvarez-Santos v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1255 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-18\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b693-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
