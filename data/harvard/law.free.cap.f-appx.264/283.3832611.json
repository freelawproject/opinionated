Based on our review of the record, we find that this claim lacks merit. In his Notice of Appeal before the Board, Fongoh simply stated that \u201cthe record of proceedings will not support the findings of the Immigration Judge that resulted in the denial of [his] application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under Article III of the Convention Against Torture.\u201d He failed to elaborate or otherwise explain how the immigration judge\u2019s findings were inadequate or unsupported by the record. We therefore agree with the Board that this general assertion of error, coupled with his failure to raise these claims in his brief before the Board, was insufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>preserve the asylum and withholding claims for review on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Turning to Fongoh\u2019s remaining claim, we find that substantial evidence supports the finding that he failed to meet the standard for relief under the Convention Against Torture. To obtain such relief, an applicant must establish that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2007). We find that Fongoh failed to make the requisite showing before the immigration court. We further find that the immigration judge properly analyzed Fongoh\u2019s claim as required by our decision in <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">We therefore deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
