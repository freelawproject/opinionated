Watts was convicted on one count of possession of child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B). He was sentenced to 102 months of imprisonment. Watts\u2019s sole issue raised on appeal is the prosecutor\u2019s alleged misconduct during her closing and rebuttal arguments. For the reasons set forth below, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-12\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AIs\">A. Factual background</p>\n<p id=\"b520-13\">In March of 2006, the eMachine-brand computer used by the Somerset Elite Training Center gymnasium (Somerset Elite) began to experience technical problems. At the time, Watts was a co-owner of Somerset Elite. The computer was taken by Barbara Lawson, an employee of Somerset Elite, to Mike Velez, a computer repairman. During his repair work, the title of a file caught Velez\u2019s eye. He said that the title contained references to a \u201c[s]even-year-old girl being raped, something of that sort.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-14\">After discovering that initial file, Velez \u201clooked deeper\u201d into the computer and \u201cstarted to pull up some of the video files.\u201d He watched part of a video involving child pornography, and then called Lawson. The two of them began to search the computer more thoroughly. A further investigation of the computer by Velez revealed a number of online chatroom conversations with various young gilds.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-15\">The next day, Velez showed Aislynn Frei, the other co-owner of Somerset Elite, and Randy Goff, a local police officer, a short segment of the video file that he had initially discovered. Velez also told Officer Goff about the chatroom transcripts he found under Watts\u2019s user name. With Frei\u2019s consent, Goff took the computer with him after viewing the video. Frei also consented to Goffs request to examine a home-built computer that had previously been used by Somerset Elite. Goff then contacted Special Agent Donnie Kidd of the FBI for further assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>Agent Kidd prepared a search warrant for the two computers. Based on the information from Officer Goff regarding the chatroom transcripts, Kidd went to Somerset Elite in order to speak with Watts. Kidd did not have an arrest warrant and made no attempt to take Watts into custody. He referred to the interaction with Watts as an \u201cinterview\u201d rather than an interrogation. Watts cooperated with Kidd and answered his questions -without any legal compulsion to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">According to Kidd\u2019s testimony at trial, Watts confessed during the interview to using both of the seized computers to search for and download child pornography. During the conversation, Watts told Kidd that he would \u201ccome in late at night, sometimes after midnight, would be drinking, would get on the computer and would surf the Internet, again looking for porn to include adult and child pornography.\u201d He used a file-sharing program called Lime-Wire to locate pornography by typing in words such as \u201cyoung\u201d and \u201cvideo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Watts told Kidd that he thought he had deleted all of the pornographic files from the home-built computer, but said there were probably 12 or 13 pornographic video files remaining on the eMachine computer that he did not have time to erase. He further explained that \u201cthere should be one, if not two, short video clips containing child pornography.\u201d Watts provided Kidd with the file path that could be used to locate the saved files on the hard drive. According to Kidd\u2019s testimony, Watts also provided Kidd with the username and password that Watts had used to access the computer. Watts told Kidd that this so-called \u201cowner\u201d account was his own personal account that was not used by the other Somerset Elite employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Kidd also asked Watts about the online chatroom files that Velez had discovered. Watts admitted that he used the computer to chat with students at Somerset Elite. He provided Kidd with two specific screen names that Watts had used\u2014\u201cDonflipflop\u201d and \u201cSuccess is trying one more time and you fall\u201d\u2014and told Kidd of a third screen name that he could not remember exactly but referred to his dog dying.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">Both of the computers were sent to the Electronic Crimes Section of the Kentucky State Police, where they were forensically examined by Detective Christopher Frazier. According to his trial testimony, Frazier\u2019s forensic examination confirmed much of the information that Watts had reportedly told Kidd. The home-built computer contained over 100 images of child pornography. These files were found in the \u201cunallocated space\u201d of the computer, meaning space that was not otherwise being used.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">Frazier found one video file containing child pornography on the eMachine computer. He also found 11 other pornographic videos that contained words in their titles that might have suggested that they contained child pornography, but that in fact featured adult pornography. Frazier further testified that (1) the files were found in the exact folder that Watts had specified to Kidd, (2) the files could be accessed only through the owner account with the user name and password that Watts had provided, and (3) the files had been downloaded using LimeWire.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">With respect to the online chats that Velez initially discovered, Frazier\u2019s examination of the eMachine computer revealed over 5,100 pages of chatroom transcripts. The chatroom logs were filed under the user name \u201cDonflipflop\u201d and also featured the screen name (the name seen by people who are chatting with the user) of \u201cSuccess is trying one more time and you fall.\u201d According to Frazier, the people chatting with \u201cSuccess is trying one more time and you fall\u201d frequently addressed the screen name as \u201cDonnie.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>The content of the chatroom transcripts was not at issue during the trial, but the connection between the chatroom conversations and the downloading of the pornographic files was disputed. Specifically, at approximately 12:04 a.m. on February 16, 2006, someone using the screen name \u201cSuccess is trying one more time and you fall\u201d was engaged in a chat. Not long thereafter, someone was accessing pornographic video files in the LimeWire folder that was identified by Watts and confirmed by Frazier\u2019s investigation. The videos were opened at 12:48 a.m., 1:09 a.m., and 2:40 a.m. Watts\u2019s own computer expert testified that a number of the pornographic files that were found on the eMachine computer were downloaded in the same general period of time when someone was engaged in online chats using the screen names \u201cSuccess is trying one more time and you fall\u201d and \u201cFour legs got run over sniff sniff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">During her closing argument, the prosecutor made repeated references to the conversation between Watts and Agent Kidd, which she described as a confession. She paraphrased what Watts allegedly said to Kidd and presented those statements as direct quotes. Watts now appeals on the basis of those statements, which he alleges are misrepresentations of the evidence that confused the jury and prejudiced him. He also asserts that the prosecutor made improper statements infringing upon his right not to testify and commenting on his honesty. The specific objected-to statements will be addressed in detail in the analysis below.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">B. Procedural background</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Watts was indicted in June of 2006 and tried five months later. The trial lasted one and a half days, resulting in a jury verdict of guilty. During the trial, Agent Kidd testified regarding Watts\u2019s statements to him. Defense counsel made no objections to the testimony, and Watts did not take the stand on his own behalf. Judgment against Watts was entered in March of 2007. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AqI\">A. Prosecutorial misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">We evaluate claims of prosecutorial misconduct using a two-step inquiry. \u201cFirst, the [cjourt must determine if the government\u2019s statements were improper.\u201d <em>United States v. Abboud, </em>438 F.3d 554, 584 (6th Cir.2006). If we determine that the statements were in fact improper, then we \u201cmust decide whether the statements were flagrant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The \u201cflagrancy inquiry\u201d involves four factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-10\">(1) whether the remarks tended to mislead the jury or to prejudice the accused!,] including whether the trial judge gave an appropriate cautionary instruction to the jury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-11\">(2) whether they were isolated or extensive;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-12\">(3) whether they were deliberately or accidentally placed before the jury; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-13\">(4) the strength of the evidence against the accused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-14\"><em>Id. </em>(citation and original brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-15\">If we determine that the statements were not flagrant, then \u201cthe [c]ourt will reverse only if (1) the proof against the defendant was not overwhelming, (2) opposing counsel objected to the conduct, and (3) the court failed to give a curative instruction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We review such claims de novo where the defendant makes a timely objection. <em>United States v. Beverly, </em>369 F.3d 516, 543 (6th Cir.2004). Otherwise, we examine the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>dant\u2019s claims under the plain-error standard of review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">\u201c[PJrosecutorial misconduct may be so exceptionally flagrant that it constitutes plain error, and is grounds for reversal even if the defendant did not object to it.\u201d <em>United States v. Carter, </em>236 F.3d 777, 783 (6th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). Plain-error review requires the court to determine whether (1) there was an error, (2) the error was \u201cobvious or clear,\u201d (3) the error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights, and (4) the error \u201cseriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Gardiner, </em>463 F.3d 445, 459 (6th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Watts asserts that he objected to a statement made by the prosecutor during her rebuttal closing argument and that he is therefore entitled to a de novo review of his prosecutorial-misconduct claims. In response, the government contends that the objection made by Watts during the trial was not to any of the statements that are now alleged to be improper. Moreover, Watts did not seek a curative instruction at the close of the argument. We find that the government\u2019s analysis of the record is correct. Watts\u2019s sole objection during the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal argument was in reference to a statement that is not before us on appeal. We will therefore review Watts\u2019s claims of prosecutorial misconduct under the plain-error standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">B. The propriety of the prosecutor\u2019s comments</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">Watts argues that the prosecutor made three different types of improper comments: (1) during her closing and rebuttal closing arguments, she \u201cmisstated evidence and attributed additional statements and confessions to the defendant that were not in evidence,\u201d (2) during her closing and rebuttal closing arguments, she \u201cmade comments infringing on the defendant\u2019s right not [to] testify,\u201d and (3) during her rebuttal closing argument, she \u201ccommented on the honesty of the defendant throwing the weight of the office of the prosecutor behind the honesty of the defendant by commending him for his honest confession.\u201d In response, the government asserts that none of the prosecutor\u2019s statements were improper and that Watts is accordingly not entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">\n<em>1. Misstatements of the evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">The alleged misstatements that Watts points to all arise out of attempts by the prosecutor to convey the information that Watts purportedly provided to Agent Kidd during their unrecorded conversation. Watts claims that these statements by the prosecutor represent either inaccurate or completely fabricated accounts of Kidd\u2019s testimony. Specifically, Watts objected to the following statement by the prosecutor of what Watts purportedly told Agent Kidd:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-12\">Yeah, I downloaded child pornography. In fact, I downloaded child pornography on both computers. I looked at normal pornography, I looked at child pornography. I searched for child pornography. In fact, I knew it was on there. In fact, I knew there were several videos on there, at least a couple of which I knew contained child pornography.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-13\">What Watts takes issue with are the prosecutor\u2019s contentions that Watts actively \u201csearched\u201d for child pornography and that there were \u201cat least a couple\u201d of videos containing child pornography stored on the computer. A review of Kidd\u2019s testimony, however, supports the propriety of the prosecutor\u2019s statement. Kidd testified about the two different computers used by Watts in chronological order. With re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>spect to the first\u2014the home-built computer\u2014Kidd testified that Watts</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtG\">acknowledged to me that he did in fact use that computer to surf the Internet and to access pornographic Websites and to download both adult and child pornography. He told me he would delete these images, he would look at them a couple times and then delete them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Watts allegedly told Kidd that he \u201cthought he had erased all of the pornographic images from the specific computer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">According to Kidd, Watts then told him that with the second, eMachine computer</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATT\">he would actually come in late at night, sometimes after midnight, would be drinking, would get on the computer and would surf the Internet, again looking for porn to include adult and child pornography.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">He would go to the LimeWire program and type in words such as \u201cyoung\u201d and \u201cvideo,\u201d just to see what was out there and what would pop up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-7\">And images of child pornography would come up. He would download those, along with the adult pornography. Again, he would look at those a couple of times, and then he would delete those off the computer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-8\">In this instance, with the eMachine, however, he told me there would be in fact probably be 12 to 13 short video clips that he did not have time to erase. And there should be one, if not two short video clips containing child pornography, and that would be saved under\u2014I think the path he gave me was computer, programs, LimeWire, and then was saved under magnet and root in the subfiles.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">The prosecutor asked whether this meant that Watts actually told Kidd \u201chow you would get to the images on the computer?\u201d Kidd responded: \u201cCorrect, he told me what was on there and where it would be found.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">Although Watts correctly points out that Kidd never explicitly said that Watts \u201csearched\u201d for child pornography and that Kidd actually said that there would be \u201cone, if not two\u201d videos, rather than \u201cat least a couple,\u201d we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s statements were not improper. When she used the word \u201csearched\u201d and stated that there were \u201cat least a couple\u201d of videos, the prosecutor was \u201cmerely paraphrasing the meaning of the conversation\u201d between Kidd and Watts. <em>See United States v. Stover, </em>474 F.3d 904, 915 (6th Cir.2007) (concluding that the prosecutor\u2019s statement was not improper where it was presented as a quotation, even though it was not actually said during the conversation at issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-12\">In <em>Stover, </em>this court held that the prosecutor\u2019s paraphrasing was not improper because, \u201c[ajlthough it is not the only conceivable meaning [of the conversation], it is a meaning that is supported by the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Both of the statements objected to by Watts in the instant case represent meanings that are strongly supported by Kidd\u2019s testimony. Kidd did not use the word \u201csearched,\u201d but he did say that Watts confessed to using the home-built computer to \u201csurf the Internet and to access pornographic Websites and to download both adult and child pornography,\u201d and on the eMachine computer Watts would \u201cget on the computer and would surf the Internet, again looking for porn to include adult and child pornography. He would go to the LimeWire program and type in words such as \u2018young\u2019 and \u2018video,\u2019 just to see what was out there and what would pop up.\u201d A highly supportable meaning of these statements is that Watts was <em>searching </em>for child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>Moreover, the difference between \u201cat least a couple\u201d of videos (what the prosecutor said) and \u201cone, if not two\u201d videos (Kidd\u2019s testimony) is negligible in the overall context of the trial. Although \u201cat least a couple\u201d could lead one to believe that there were more than two videos to be found on Watts\u2019s computer, it does not so overstate Kidd\u2019s testimony (that Watt\u2019s told him there would be \u201cone, if not two\u201d videos) as to be unsupported by the evidence. <em>See Stover, </em>474 F.3d at 915. We thus conclude that neither of these statements was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Watts also takes issue with the following six statements made by the prosecutor during closing argument: (1) \u201cYeah, I downloaded child pornography. In fact, I downloaded child pornography on both computers,\u201d (2) \u201cYeah, when I looked at pornography, including child pornography, I used LimeWire,\u201d (3) \u201cWhen I downloaded child pornography or any pornography, I would save it using the file path,\u201d (4) \u201cI searched for child pornography. I was just curious. I wanted to know what was out there. I typed words such as \u2018young,\u2019 such as \u2018video,\u2019 \u201d (5) \u201cI didn\u2019t just look at child pornography using the eMachine computer.... I looked at it on the previous one, too,\u201d and (6) \u201cYeah, I used it to look at child pornography. I think I deleted it, but I\u2019m not sure. You may still find it on there, but I believe I deleted it.\u201d According to Watts, \u201c[i]f one were to listen to the prosecutor\u2019s version of what the defendant said, every phrase the defendant stated would begin with \u2018Yeah, when I look at child pornography.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">As with the \u201csearched\u201d and the \u201cat least a couple\u201d statements addressed earlier, the prosecutor in each of these six objeeted-to statements was paraphrasing the testimony of Agent Kidd. Each of the six statements, moreover, is supported by the evidence presented in Kidd\u2019s testimony. According to that testimony, Watts told Kidd that (1) he downloaded child pornography on both computers, (2) he used LimeWire to find the pornography, (3) he used a specific file path to save the pornographic files he found, (4) he would type in the words \u201cyoung\u201d and \u201cvideo\u201d in order to \u201csee what was out there,\u201d (5) he used both of the computers to look at pornography, and (6) he deleted some of the files, but thought there might still be some on the eMachine computer. Although she occasionally prefaced her statements with an introductory comment similar to \u201cwhen I looked at child pornography,\u201d all of the prosecutor\u2019s statements presented \u201cmeaning[s] that [are] supported by the evidence.\u201d <em>See Stover, </em>474 F.3d at 915. We therefore conclude that none of the prosecutor\u2019s alleged misstatements regarding Watts\u2019s confession to Kidd were improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">\n<em>2. Statements regarding Watts\u2019s right not to testify</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">Watts also asserts that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct when she allegedly made two statements regarding his right not to testify. Specifically, during her initial closing argument, the prosecutor said: \u201cLadies and gentlemen, every other witness that came up here says they absolutely didn\u2019t download child pornography. You know what the defendant said? Yeah, I downloaded child pornography.\u201d Then, during her rebuttal argument, the prosecutor said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-10\">Ladies and gentlemen, you heard me ask every single one of those other people who came up there whether they were the ones that were downloading child pornography on the computer. And you heard their responses: \u201cAbsolutely not. Absolutely not.\u201d That is not what the defendant said. He said \u201cAbsolutely, yes, I did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFZ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Watts now argues that these two statements, which compared the content of his conversation with Agent Kidd to the trial testimony of the witnesses, \u201ccould mislead a jury ... as to when and if [the] defendant testified, or if they, the jury, were not privy to some testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Viewing these two comments \u201cwithin the context of the trial as a whole,\u201d Watts\u2019s argument is meritless. <em>See United States v. Beverly, </em>369 F.3d 516, 543-44 (6th Cir.2004) (examining the context surrounding allegations of prosecutorial misconduct in rejecting the defendant\u2019s claims). Throughout her closing and rebuttal arguments, the prosecutor made repeated reference to what Watts told Agent Kidd. The closing argument as a whole makes clear that the statements that Watts now objects to were the prosecutor\u2019s attempt to paraphrase Kidd\u2019s testimony, which in turn represented the only evidence of what Watts had said regarding the crime in question. Moreover, in light of the fact that the trial lasted only one and a half days, it is implausible that the jury was somehow misled about whether there was some other testimony that the jury did not get to hear.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The Fifth Amendment provides in relevant part that no person \u201cshall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. V. The typical claim of prosecutorial misconduct with respect to a defendant\u2019s right not to testify arises when the prosecutor uses that silence as substantive evidence against the defendant. <em>See Girts v. Yanai, </em>501 F.3d 743, 756, 758 (6th Cir.2007) (finding misconduct sufficient for reversal where the prosecutor made three statements that \u201cattached a negative connotation to the exercise of the Fifth Amendment right to remain silent\u201d). In <em>Girls, </em>this court concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s statements \u201cwere improper, misleading and highly prejudicial because they implied that [the defendant] was obligated to testify and to speak to the police.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 756. No such implication arises from the prosecutor\u2019s statements in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">In paraphrasing what Watts actually told Agent Kidd, the prosecutor did not \u201cattachf ] a negative \u2022 connotation to\u201d Watts\u2019s Fifth Amendment right. <em>See id. </em>Instead, the statements made by the prosecutor were supported by the evidence of Kidd\u2019s testimony and represent not silence, but rather admissions on the part of Watts. We conclude that Watts\u2019s challenge to the statements that allegedly implicate his right not to testify is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">\n<em>3. Statements regarding Watts\u2019s honesty</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">Watts further alleges that the prosecutor improperly vouched for his honesty during her rebuttal closing argument. Specifically, he objects to the prosecutor\u2019s statement that when Watts spoke with Agent Kidd, \u201c[h]e was being very cooperative, and he was telling the truth. I have to commend him for at least telling the truth to Special Agent Kidd when he came to ask the questions.\u201d The government replies by pointing out that the prosecutor\u2019s statement was in direct response to Watts\u2019s closing argument, wherein his trial counsel said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-10\">People, why would anybody confess to a federal felony to a cop when they walked in. \u201cHey FBI. I\u2019m going to ask you some questions.\u201d \u201cOh, yeah, I did it.\u201d It\u2019s ludicrous to believe that the gentleman confessed to anything. I told you in [my] opening statement that I believe the government, specifically Special Agent Kidd, he drew some conclusions early on to some very specific questions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AV3\">According to the government, the prosecutor\u2019s statement was not improper vouch<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>ing, but was a permissible response to the attempt to attack Agent Kidd\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">\u201cImproper vouching occurs when a prosecutor supports the credibility of a witness by indicating a personal belief in the witness\u2019s credibility!;,] thereby placing the prestige of the office of the United State Attorney behind that witness.\u201d <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>473 F.3d 660, 670 (6th Cir.2007) (alteration in original) (citation omitted). The full context of the prosecutor\u2019s statement is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-6\">Why would someone confess to a federal crime? It makes no sense, says Mr. Benge. Why in the world would anybody say, \u201cYeah I was looking at child pornography on the computer\u201d when the FBI comes and asks if you know anything about anything improper that might be on the computer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\">Why in the world would you do that, he says? The reason that you do that is because you\u2019re guilty of doing that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-8\">Now, you or I can\u2019t sit there and say what was going through his head. He was being cooperative, and he was telling the truth. I have to commend him for at least telling the truth to Special Agent Kidd when he came to ask the questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-9\">Why would you confess? You would confess because that\u2019s what you did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">A review of the prosecutor\u2019s statement indicates that she was responding to Watts\u2019s direct attack on the credibility of Kidd\u2019s testimony and the sufficiency of Kidd\u2019s investigation. The statement was not \u201cfounded upon an implication that the prosecutor personally believed [Watts] or knew of evidence not before the jury that demonstrated [his] truthfulness.\u201d <em>See Jackson, </em>473 F.3d at 672. Rather, the statement was founded on the fact that Watts, through his closing argument, had placed Agent Kidd\u2019s testimony and the accompanying veracity of Watts\u2019s confession at issue. Moreover, we are not aware of any authority prohibiting the prosecutor from vouching for the credibility of what is purportedly the <em>defendant\u2019s own testimony, </em>as opposed to that of a witness for the prosecution. We conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s statement regarding the truthfulness of Watts\u2019s confession to Kidd was not improper vouching.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-12\">C. Flagrancy of the prosecutor\u2019s statements</p>\n<p id=\"b527-13\">Even if we were inclined to find one or more of the preceding statements by the prosecutor improper, none were so flagrant as to warrant a new trial. Although \u201ca pattern of improper statements may require reversal where no individual statement by itself is sufficiently prejudicial,\u201d such is not the case here. <em>See United States v. Stover, </em>474 F.3d 904, 917 (6th Cir.2007). Watts argues that the prosecutor\u2019s statements misled the jury and prejudiced him\u2014the first flagrancy factor\u2014because the jury twice asked for a copy of what Watts said (i.e., a transcript of Kidd\u2019s testimony) during its deliberations. These requests were denied, in part because Watts\u2019s attorney objected to creating a transcript of Kidd\u2019s testimony for review by the jury. Moreover, as the district court noted, \u201cthis jury has not hesitated to ask me questions, that they might ask me again if they are really stuck and can\u2019t get past whatever seems to be bothering them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-14\">The district court then instructed the jury that \u201c[a] transcript of Agent Kidd\u2019s testimony is not readily available. You should rely on your memory of the evidence presented in the court.\u201d No further questions from the jury were presented to the court, indicating that \u201cwhatever seem[ed] to be bothering them\u201d did not stand in the way of reaching a unanimous guilty verdict. The jury\u2019s requests also indicate that it was not misled into believing that Watts had testified, the argument that Watts now raises in objecting to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>comments he claims infringed upon his Fifth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">With respect to the second and third flagrancy factors\u2014the extensiveness of the statements and whether they were deliberately placed in front of the jury\u2014the government concedes that the prosecutor\u2019s alleged misrepresentations of Watts\u2019s confession constituted \u201cseveral deliberate statements.\u201d The government asserts, however, that the comments allegedly infringing on Watts\u2019s refusal to testify and expressing an opinion as to his truthfulness were brief and isolated, and that the prosecutor\u2019s statement that \u201cevery other witness that came up here says they absolutely didn\u2019t download child pornography\u201d was accidental in nature. Contrary to the government\u2019s contentions, we believe that the prosecutor\u2019s statements were more than brief and isolated and that they were deliberately put in front of the jury. But this conclusion alone is insufficient to support a finding of flagrancy that would warrant reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Watts\u2019s only argument challenging the strength of the evidence against him\u2014the fourth flagrancy factor\u2014is based on the prosecutor\u2019s statement during her rebuttal argument that \u201c[b]y all accounts, there were a lot of people who had access to that computer. And we might not be here today if the defendant himself hadn\u2019t told us who the person was that was responsible.\u201d This statement was made in response to Watts\u2019s theory of the case and closing argument to the effect that someone else with access to the computer downloaded the child pornography, and that Agent Kidd lied about Watts\u2019s confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">According to Watts, \u201c[wjithout a confession from the defendant, there was only circumstantial evidence of who committed this crime.\u201d The flaw in Watts\u2019s argument is that even if the prosecutor\u2019s statements about the alleged confession were excluded, the confession itself had already been admitted into evidence through the testimony of Agent Kidd. Furthermore, the judge instructed the jury that the evidence did not include the statements of the attorneys and that the jurors alone must weigh the credibility of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">Based on Watts\u2019s confession and the strength of the corroborative evidence introduced by the government\u2019s expert witness, \u201cit is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have returned a verdict of guilty\u201d even in the absence of the prosecutor\u2019s statements. <em>See United States v. Roberts, </em>986 F.2d 1026, 1032 (6th Cir.1993) (rejecting a claim of prosecutorial misconduct where the prosecutor improperly appealed to the community conscience during his closing argument because the evidence against the defendant was overwhelming). This is not a case where \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s actions \u2018so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hill v. Brigano, </em>199 F.3d 833, 847 (6th Cir.1999) (quoting <em>Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, </em>416 U.S. 637, 643, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">We therefore conclude that the statements made by the prosecutor were not so flagrant as to warrant reversal, even if we were to assume for the sake of argument that they were improper. The remote possibility of either prejudice to Watts or jury confusion, combined with the strength of the evidence against him, significantly outweigh the argument that the prosecutor\u2019s statements were extensive and deliberate.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">For all the reasons set forth above, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
