When World Life attempted to liquidate these assets to pay outstanding medical reinsurance claims, the stocks were found to be worthless.\u201d <em>United States v. Miller, </em>417 F.3d 358, 360 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-18\">On January 22, 1998, the District Court sentenced Miller to seven months of incarceration. Miller appealed, challenging his conviction. The United States filed a cross-appeal challenging the sentence. We affirmed the convictions and vacated for resentencing. On February 3, 2003, the District Court held a resentencing hearing. The District Court found that Miller and his co-defendants caused a total fraud loss of approximately $3.2 million, and ordered restitution in that amount. The District Court enhanced Miller\u2019s offense level and sentenced Miller to 51 months of incarceration and two years of supervised release. This Court affirmed. Miller appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which vacated the judgment of this Court and remanded in light of its opinion in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We, in turn, vacated Miller\u2019s sentence and remanded to the District Court for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker. Miller, </em>417 F.3d at 362 (citing <em>United States v. Davis, </em>397 F.3d 173, 183 (3d Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-19\">District Judge S\u00e1nchez conducted the resentencing hearing because the original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>sentencing judge, Judge Newcomer, was then deceased. Judge Sanchez ultimately imposed the same sentence of imprisonment as Judge Newcomer had imposed, but he increased the term of supervised release from two to three years. Miller timely appealed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Miller raises four arguments on appeal. First, he argues that the application of Booker's remedial opinion to his case violates 18 U.S.C. 3742(g).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As we understand his argument, Miller argues that the remedial portion of <em>Booker </em>does not apply to him because his case was <em>pre-Booker </em>and because the <em>mandatory </em>guidelines were the ones that \u201cwere in effect on the date of the previous sentencing.\u201d 18 U.S.C. 3742(g). Therefore, he argues, the <em>mandatory </em>guidelines must apply to him and factors not determined by the jury may not be used to increase his sentence above the applicable guidelines level. We reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The Supreme Court severed and excised the portion of the law which dictated that the guidelines were mandatory\u201418 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(b)(1)\u2014from the rest of the statute in <em>Booker. </em>On its face, \u00a7 3742 refers only to <em>which </em>guidelines apply and not <em>how </em>they are to be applied. Further, <em>Booker </em>itself said that: \u201cwe must apply today\u2019s holdings\u2014both the Sixth Amendment holding <em>and our remedial interpretation </em>of the Sentencing Act\u2014to all cases on direct review.\u201d <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 268, 125 S.Ct. 738 (emphasis added). Indeed, Miller\u2019s case was remanded for resentencing in light of <em>Booker. </em>Finally, any objection Miller has to judicial fact-finding has been rejected by this Court in <em>U.S. v. Grier, </em>475 F.3d 556 (3d Cir.2007) (en banc), which held that a preponderance of the evidence burden of proof applies in determining facts relevant to defendant\u2019s sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">Second, Miller argues that the District Court improperly increased his supervised release term from two to three years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We find this argument is also without merit. The resentencing judge had discretion to impose a period of supervised release up to and including three years. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(b)(2). After reviewing the record, we are satisfied that the factors of \u00a7 3553(a) properly informed the District Court\u2019s decision to increase the period of supervised release, and that the Court did not abuse its discretion in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">Miller also asserts that when a defendant receives a harsher sentence on resentencing, the presumption of vindictiveness applies. However, the Supreme Court has limited application of the presumption to circumstances in which there is a \u201creasonable likelihood\u201d that the increase in sentence is the product of actual vindictiveness. <em>Alabama v. Smith, </em>490 U.S. 794, 799, 109 S.Ct. 2201, 104 L.Ed.2d 865 (1989). Where there is no such reasonable likelihood, the burden remains upon the defendant to prove actual vindictiveness. <em>Id. </em>at 799-800, 109 S.Ct. 2201. The record before us reveals nothing to suggest there is a likelihood that Judge Sanchez was \u201cvindictive\u201d in his resentencing of Miller. Further, Miller has not put <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>forth any facts from which we could infer a likelihood of vindictiveness, much less actual vindictiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Third, Miller contends that the District Court incorrectly imposed a sentence for full restitution without making the requisite factual findings required under the Victim Witness Protection Act. The District Court ordered full restitution after the first resentencing hearing in February 2003. The sentence from which Miller now appeals was only remanded for consideration in light of <em>Booker. </em>During the pendency of his appeal to this Court, we decided <em>United States v. Leahy, </em>438 F.3d 328 (3d Cir.2006). In <em>Leahy, </em>this Court determined that <em>Booker </em>does not apply to orders of restitution. Therefore, restitution was outside the scope of the remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Finally, Miller argues that he was entitled to a <em>de novo </em>resentencing hearing because the original presiding judge was not available. After reviewing the record, we are satisfied that the hearing conducted by the District Court afforded Miller a fair resentencing. Judge S\u00e1nchez carefully reviewed all of Judge Newcomer\u2019s factual findings and conclusions of law, considered both the original and supplemental presentence reports, and afforded the defense an opportunity to present evidence and additional testimony regarding medical and financial issues affecting Miller and his family. To require anything more than what the District Court actually did would be mere formalism. Therefore, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b277-7\">.
