White, Louisiana state prisoner # 130194, appeals following an adverse jury verdict on his claim that his lack of opportunity for exercise while he was confined to the administrative segregation unit of the Avoyelles Correctional Center violated the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. Finding no reversible error, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-26\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-27\">Liberally construed, White\u2019s brief raises three issues for our review. White first contends that the district court erred by granting judgment as a matter of law on his claim that his lack of opportunity for exercise violated the Fourteenth Amendment. Because the record reflects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>no insufficiency in the process afforded White, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment as a matter of law on his procedural due process claim. To the extent White\u2019s evidence at trial raised substantive due process concerns, the district court properly treated it as supporting a claim under only the Eighth Amendment. <em>See Austin v. Johnson, </em>328 F.3d 204, 210 n. 10 (5th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Graham v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 395, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989)) (\u201cBecause the Eighth Amendment, as \u2018an explicit textual source of constitutional protection,\u2019 defines the limits of government action, it controls over \u2018the more generalized notion of substantive due process.\u2019 \u201d). And because the record contains no evidence that White was treated differently than similarly-situated prisoners in administrative segregation, his equal protection claim must fail. <em>See Martin v. Scott, </em>156 F.3d 578, 580 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">White also argues that the jury\u2019s verdict on his Eighth Amendment claim was against the weight of the evidence. His failure to move for a new trial or for judgment as a matter of law after the jury returned its verdict, however, precludes appellate review of the sufficiency of the evidence. <em>See Unitherm Food Sys., Inc. v. Swift-Eckrich, Inc., </em>546 U.S. 394, 400-02, 126 S.Ct. 980, 163 L.Ed.2d 974 (2006). We therefore need not, and cannot, consider whether the evidence supported the jury\u2019s finding that the conditions of White\u2019s confinement did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Finally, White asserts that the district court erred in refusing to admit into evidence a report prepared for an unrelated case concerning the Avoyelles Correctional Center. We review the district court\u2019s evidentiary ruling for abuse of discretion. <em>See Smith v. Isuzu Motors Ltd., </em>137 F.3d 859, 861 (5th Cir.1998). We cannot say, based on the record before us, that the district court abused its discretion in excluding the report as irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b428-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
