Staff knew the information was false and provided it in retaliation for his having exercised his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-15\">The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. Dare opposed this motion and also filed a motion to amend the complaint. The Magistrate Judge submitted a Report and Recommendation, recommending that the motion be granted to the extent of the civil rights and FTCA counts, that the complaint be dismissed as frivolous to the extent of the retaliation count, and that the motion to amend be denied as futile. In an order entered on June 21, 2007, the District Court, after engaging in de novo review of the parties\u2019 submissions, granted the defendants\u2019 motion, dismissed the retaliation count under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2) and 1915A, and denied Dare\u2019s motion to amend his complaint. Thereafter, Dare sought and obtained additional time to file Objections, but instead of doing so, he filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-16\">Our Clerk advised the parties that we might act summarily to dispose of this appeal, <em>see </em>Third Cir. LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6, and asked for responses to the question of the Court\u2019s jurisdiction in view of the extension to file Objections granted by the District Court. The appellees responded by moving for summary affirmance. Dare responded by opposing summary dismissal, and by submitting a motion for appointment of counsel on appeal. He also, in separate submissions, asked the Court to assume jurisdiction over the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-17\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We will summarily affirm the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>order of the District Court granting the defendants\u2019 motion, dismissing the retaliation claim as frivolous, and denying Dare\u2019s motion to amend, because it clearly appears that no substantial question is presented by this appeal. 3rd Cir. LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6. The District Court held that <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), barred both the <em>Bivens </em>and FTCA counts because Dare had failed to show that the duration of his sentence had ever been invalidated. We agree. <em>Heck </em>holds that a prisoner\u2019s civil rights suit for damages or equitable relief is barred unless he can demonstrate that his conviction or sentence has been invalidated. 512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364. <em>Heck\u2019s </em>favorable termination rule applies \u201cno matter the target of the prisoner\u2019s suit (state conduct leading to conviction or internal prison proceedings)\u2014if success in that action would necessarily demonstrate the invalidity of confinement or its duration.\u201d <em>Wilkinson v. Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 81-82, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005). <em>See also Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 646-47, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\"><em>Heck </em>applies to Bivens-type actions, <em>see, e.g., Tavarez v. Reno, </em>54 F.3d 109, 110 (2d Cir.1995), and we agree with the District Court that <em>Heck </em>bars this action whether brought under <em>Bivens </em>or the FTCA. <em>Heck </em>applies to Dare\u2019s particular FTCA action, because a judgment that his prison term had negligently been miscalculated would raise the same problems that led the Supreme Court to hold in <em>Heck </em>that no constitutional civil rights cause of action had accrued. <em>Cf. Erlin v. United States, </em>364 F.3d 1127, 1133 (9th Cir.2004) (action under FTCA for negligently calculating prisoner\u2019s release date, or otherwise wrongfully imprisoning the prisoner, does not accrue until prisoner has established, in direct or collateral attack on his imprisonment, that he is entitled to release from custody). Dare\u2019s habeas corpus case challenging the use of the juvenile conviction, which he filed prior to bringing this action for damages, was unsuccessful. <em>See Dare v. U.S. Parole Commission, </em>212 Fed.Appx. 144 (3d Cir.2007).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The duration of his confinement has never been declared invalid, and he, therefore, has not satisfied <em>Heck\u2019s </em>favorable termination rule.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Finally, the retaliation count is frivolous because Dare did not identify any constitutionally protected conduct that was a substantial or motivating factor in the decision not to release him sooner, <em>see Rauser v. Horn, </em>241 F.3d 330, 333-34 (3d Cir.2001). In addition, the District Court properly exercised its discretion to deny the motion to amend the complaint because any amendment would have been futile, <em>see Foman v. Davis, </em>371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962), in view of the fact that the duration of Dare\u2019s sentence has never been declared invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">We will summarily affirm the order of the District Court in all respects. Dare\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel on appeal is denied as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b210-11\">. <em>See Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2671 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b210-18\">. Dare was serving a 45-year term of imprisonment for second degree murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b210-19\">. Dare submitted a \"Docketing Statement\u201d and \"Jurisdiction Memorandum,\u201d in which he indicated that he would elect to stand on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>his notice of appeal. Accordingly, we find that the order is appealable now. <em>Remick v. Manfredy, </em>238 F.3d 248, 254 (3d Cir.2001) (citing <em>Borelli v. City of Reading, </em>532 F.2d 950, 951-52 (3d Cir.1976) (per curiam)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b211-6\">. Dare filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, claiming that use of his juvenile conviction for Carnal Knowledge to deny him parole was arbitrary and capricious, because the conviction had been dismissed. The U.S. Parole Commission filed a response, clarifying that Dare had received a suspended sentence for the Carnal Knowledge conviction and a term of probation, and that, even if the conviction had been expunged (which was not clear), the Commission could properly use the fact of the conviction in setting conditions for Dare\u2019s release. The District Court held, and we agreed on appeal, that the Commission could deny parole pending approval of a suitable release plan. An expungement, if it occurred, would not affect the nonpublic record maintained by the Department of Justice, and the Commission had the authority to use information concerning dismissed charges. The Commission\u2019s decision to require Dare to reside in a Community Corrections Center upon his release on parole was not arbitrary and capricious in view of Dare\u2019s poor parole history, and Dare's own history of escape was the reason why the one CCC potentially willing to accept him would not. <em>Id. </em>at 145-46.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b211-10\">. Dare apparently was released on parole during the pendency of this litigation. Because he properly could, and previously did, avail himself of the habeas corpus remedy, <em>Heck </em>applies to him even though he has since been released. <em>See Gilles v. Davis, </em>427 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>197, 209-10 (3d Cir.2005) <em>(Heck </em>applies to habeas eligible plaintiff). <em>Cf. Powers v. Hamilton County Public Defender Comm'n, </em>501 F.3d 592, 601-03 (6th Cir.2007) (former prisoner asserting civil rights claim may avoid <em>Heck </em>if he is precluded from seeking habeas redress, but is not entitled to such an exception if he could have sought and obtained habeas review while still in prison but failed to do so).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
