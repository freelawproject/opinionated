The district court denied his \u00a7 2255 motion as untimely, because it was filed more than a year after his conviction became final. For the reasons explained below, we deny Mr. Clayton\u2019s request for a COA, and dismiss the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Mr. Clayton pleaded guilty to one count of distribution of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). The plea agreement included a waiver of both direct appeal and collateral attack. The district court sentenced Mr. Clayton to 151 months\u2019 imprisonment, which was the bottom of the applicable sentencing guideline range. Mr. Clayton appealed to this court, alleging a violation of <em>Booker. </em>We rejected his appeal, because it was \u201cwithin the scope of an enforceable waiver.\u201d <em>United States v. Clayton, </em>416 F.3d 1236, 1239 (10th Cir.2005). We issued the mandate on September 12, 2005. Mr. Clayton sought a writ of certiorari from the United States Supreme Court, which the Court denied on January 6, 2006. Mr. Clayton filed his \u00a7 2255 motion on January 29, 2007, which the district court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">The district court construed Mr. Clayton\u2019s \u201cnotice of appeal\u201d as an application for a COA, which it denied. A COA may issue only \u201cif the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). \u201cA petitioner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that jurists of reason could disagree with the district court\u2019s resolution of his constitutional claims or that jurists could conclude the issues presented are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 327, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). When a district court has dismissed a habeas petition on procedural grounds, a certificate will only issue when \u201cjurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). We construe Mr. Clayton\u2019s pro se petition and appellate filings liberally. <em>See Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972); <em>Cummings v. Evans, </em>161 F.3d 610, 613 (10th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">Mr. Clayton filed his \u00a7 2255 motion on January 29, 2007, which he concedes exceeded the governing one-year limitation period under \u00a7 2255 \u00b6 6(1). However, Mr. Clayton argues that he is entitled to equitable tolling because he diligently pursued assistance in filing his \u00a7 2255 motion. We agree with the district court that Mr. Clayton\u2019s \u201cvague and conclusory allegation that he could not find any reliable assistance for eleven months is insufficient to support equitable tolling.\u201d Rec. doc. 86, at 4-5. He has failed to demonstrate that his \u201cfailure to timely file was caused by extraordinary circumstances beyond his control.\u201d <em>Marsh v. Soares, </em>223 F.3d 1217, 1220 (10th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b734-10\">Because jurists of reason would not find the district court\u2019s conclusions debatable, we DENY Mr. Clayton\u2019s request for a COA, and DISMISS the matter.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
