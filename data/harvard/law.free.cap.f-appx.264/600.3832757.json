We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962 (9th Cir.2004), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-23\">The BIA concluded that significant inconsistencies undermined the veracity of Singh\u2019s claim and that the record was not sufficient to sustain Singh\u2019s burden of proof. Because these conclusions are based on cogent and factually supported reasons, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Singh did not sustain his burden of proof regarding his withholding of removal claim. <em>See id. </em>at 964; <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4); <em>Sidhu v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1085, 1092 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Singh\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same testimony that the BIA found not credible and because he points to no other evidence that the BIA should have considered in making its CAT determination. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>848 F.3d 1153, 1157 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b626-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
