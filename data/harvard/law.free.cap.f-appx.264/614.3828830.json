We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-17\">Rodriguez-Mejia contends that the district court erred by increasing his sentence pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) because he did not admit, and a jury did not find beyond a reasonable doubt, the temporal relationship between the prior removal and prior conviction. We disagree. Because Rodriguez-Mejia admitted to the date of his prior removal in his Rule 11 hearing, there was no error. <em>Sec United States v. Salazar-Lopez, </em>506 F.3d 748, 751-55 (9th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Martinez-Rodriguez, </em>472 F.3d 1087, 1094 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-22\">Rodriguez-Mejia further contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), is limited to challenges to the indictment where the defendant admits the prior conviction during a guilty plea. This argument is foreclosed. <em>See Salazar-Lopez, </em>506 F.3d at 751 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-23\">Finally, Rodriguez-Mejia contends that in light of subsequent Supreme Court decisions, <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is not binding precedent and has been overruled. This contention is foreclosed. <em>See Salazar-Lopez, </em>506 F.3d at 751 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b640-32\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
