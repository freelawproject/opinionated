Elstein denying petitioner\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Shan Chan Zhang, </em>No. A77 296 961 (B.I.A. May 10, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A77 296 961 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City, Sep. 19, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-21\">When the BIA does hot expressly \u201cadopt\u201d the IJ\u2019s decision, but its brief opinion closely tracks the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we may consider both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions for the sake of completeness if doing so does not affect the Court\u2019s ultimate conclusion. <em>Jigme Wangchuck v. DHS, </em>448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir.2006). We review the IJ\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, overturning them only if any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir. 2007) (quoting section 1252(B)(4)(b); internal quotation marks omitted). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Zhang argues that the agency impermissibly found that his testimony was vague. We conclude, however, that Zhang has failed to show that \u201cany reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Jin Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 104, 114 (2d Cir.2005). Because vague testimony about Falun Gong materials he sent to his father is the only evidence in the record that officials in China know that Zhang practices Falun Gong in the United States, we find that Zhang has failed to meet the objective component of a well-founded fear where his claim that Chinese officials know that he practices Falun Gong in the United States lacks \u201csolid support\u201d in the record. <em>See Jian Xing Huang v. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir.2005); <em>see also Jin Chen, </em>426 F.3d at 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">We also conclude that the BIA did not err in relying on Zhang\u2019s failure to corroborate his Falun Gong claim in denying relief. Here, Zhang was not otherwise credible and the IJ did not base the denial of Zhang\u2019s asylum claim solely on lack of corroboration. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 341 (2d Cir.2006)(finding that the requirement that the agency must determine whether corroborating evidence is reasonably available applies only when the agency cites inadequate corroboration as a basis for denying relief to an applicant who is otherwise credible). The IJ\u2019s denial was based instead on a finding that Zhang\u2019s largely uncorroborated, non-credible testimony was insufficient to establish eligibility for the relief he requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Moreover, contrary to Zhang\u2019s argument, his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s forced abortion does not constitute past persecution. We have held that \u201cthe statutory scheme unambiguously dictates that applicants can become candidates for asylum relief only based on persecution that they themselves have suffered or must suffer.\u201d <em>Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 309 (2d Cir.2007)(en <em>banc). </em>Nor did the agency err in finding that Zhang did not suffer past persecution because of his \u201cother resistance to a coercive population control program.\u201d <em>See id., </em>494 F.3d at 313; <em>Matter of S-L-L-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1, 10 (BIA 2006) (en banc). Although Zhang\u2019s opposition could be considered \u201cresistance\u201d to the family planning policy, Zhang has not shown that his resistance led to actions against him that amounted to persecution. <em>See S-L-L-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">We conclude further that Zhang has not shown that \u201cany reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude,\u201d contrary to the agency, that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution in China based his demand for an apology and compensation from the family planning office. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). Indeed, although Zhang testified that family planning officials \u201cwould never let go of the activities [he] did before,\u201d he did not present any evidence that indicates he has an objectively reasonable well-founded fear of persecution on account of China\u2019s family planning policy. <em>See, e.g., Matter of </em>J-W-S- 24 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 185, 194 (BIA 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">Because Zhang was unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out an asylum claim, he was necessarily unable to meet the higher standard required to succeed on a claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006). Because Zhang failed to challenge the denial of his CAT claim in his brief to this Court, we deem that claim waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Our review having been completed, the pending motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>for a stay of removal is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
