Apr. 13, 2007). In an earlier order, dated March 29, 2002, the BIA had summarily dismissed petitioner\u2019s appeal from a decision of an immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denying petitioner\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal, and granting his application for voluntary departure. Petitioner did not seek review of that order. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">As a threshold matter, we note that our review is limited to the BIA\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen his removal proceedings. Petitioner did not petition for review of the March 29, 2002 summary dismissal of his appeal; instead, he filed a motion to reopen his proceedings in November 2006, alleging changed country conditions. This Court is, therefore, \u201cprecluded from passing on the merits of the underlying exclusion proceedings,\u201d and must confine its review to the denial of petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen these proceedings. <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 90 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">When the BIA denies a motion to reopen, this Court reviews the BIA\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) <em>(per </em>curiam). An abuse of discretion may be found where the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Zhao, </em>265 F.3d at 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Here, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Bhuiyan\u2019s motion as untimely. The BIA correctly noted in its April 13, 2007 order that the final order in these proceedings was entered in March 2002, and Bhuiyan did not file his motion to reopen until November 2006, well beyond the 90-day filing deadline. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(c)(i); 8 C.F.R \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">Moreover, the BIA properly found that Bhuiyan did not establish that he qualified for an exception to the time limitation for motions to reopen based on changed country conditions. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). The BIA accurately noted that Bhuiyan had indeed presented evidence that the human rights record of the Bangladeshi government \u201cremain[ed] poor and that there [was] continued strife.\u201d The documents that Bhuiyan submitted with his motion to reopen state that the Bangladeshi government \u201ccontinued to commit numerous serious [human rights] abuses,\u201d \u201c[violence often resulting in deaths was a pervasive element in the country\u2019s politics,\u201d and supporters of different political parties \u201cfrequently clashed with each other and with police during rallies and demonstrations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">At most, however, Bhuiyan\u2019s evidence establishes a <em>continued </em>level of unrest in Bangladesh\u2014in spite of any change in ruling parties\u2014not <em>changed </em>country conditions. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii). Indeed, Bhuiyan acknowledged that country conditions in Bangladesh were already poor by asserting in his motion to reopen that \u201cserious human rights abuses <em>continued </em>unabated\u201d (emphasis added.) Under these circumstances, the BIA appropriately determined that Bhuiyan failed to demonstrate meaningfully changed conditions in Bangladesh excusing the untimely filing of his motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-12\">To the extent that Bhuiyan challenges the BIA\u2019s refusal to exercise its <em>sua sponte </em>authority to reopen proceedings based on his labor certification or his wife\u2019s pending asylum application, that argument is be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>yond our review because the decision of the BIA to reopen a case <em>sua spoute </em>under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) is entirely discretionary. <em>See Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 518 (2d Cir.2006) <em>(per </em>curiam). As such, the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Bhuiyan\u2019s motion did not meet an exception to the 90-day filing deadline under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii) was not an abuse of discretion. <em>Kaur, </em>413 F.3d at 233-34. Accordingly, any argument that the BIA violated Bhuiyan\u2019s due process rights or abused its discretion when it failed to reopen his removal proceedings is without merit. <em>See Li Hua Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>453 F.3d 99, 104-05 (2d Cir.2006) (citing <em>Capric v. Ashcroft, </em>355 F.3d 1075, 1087 (7th Cir.2004) (\u201cDue process requires that an applicant receive a full and fair hearing which provides a meaningful opportunity to be heard.\u201d)). To the extent Bhuiyan argues that upon his return from Canada he should have been deemed an arriving alien applying for admission, we decline to consider this argument as it was not raised before the BIA. <em>See Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 118-23 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, Bhuiyan\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
