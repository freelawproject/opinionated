Miller appealed, claiming that his sentence violated <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). This court agreed and vacated Miller\u2019s sentence for resentencing consistent with those opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">On remand, the district court conducted a resentencing hearing and determined that Miller\u2019s total offense level remained at 36, which included a three-level enhancement for assaulting a police officer under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(USSG) \u00a7 3A1.2(b) (2002).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> With a criminal history category IV, Miller\u2019s resulting guideline range remained at 262-327 months imprisonment. After Miller\u2019s attorney argued for a sentence below his original 262-month sentence, the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-7\">I agree it is a lengthy prison sentence. I considered that. I just don\u2019t see any circumstances that warrant a different sentence than the sentence I imposed then. I gave him ten years concurrent, which is pretty generous. And even though it is a long sentence, although he has a long sentence, it could have been a lot longer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-8\">So, pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, it is the judgment of the court that [Miller] is hereby committed to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons to be imprisoned for a term of 262 months; 120 months of which is to run concurrently with the undischarged term of imprisonment that you are now serving under the provisions of 5G1.3C.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-12\">Miller noted a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-13\">Miller first argues that the district court clearly erred in finding that he committed an aggravated assault on a law enforcement officer warranting an enhancement under USSG \u00a7 3A1.2(b). We review the district court\u2019s factual finding on this issue for clear error. <em>United States v. Harrison, </em>272 F.3d 220, 223 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-14\">At the time of Miller\u2019s original sentencing, USSG \u00a7 3A1.2(b) provided for a three-level enhancement if \u201cduring the course of the offense or immediate flight therefrom, the defendant ..., knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that a person was a law enforcement or corrections officer, assaulted such officer in a manner creating a substantial risk of serious bodily injury.\u201d Application Note 4(A) further provided that this section \u201capplies in circumstances tantamount to aggravated assault ... against a law enforcement officer.\u201d The evidence established that, at the time of his arrest, Miller threw a juice bottle (which he had just purchased from a convenience store) at one of the arresting officers and hit him in the head. Regardless of the extent of the officer\u2019s <em>actual </em>injury, we find that the district court did not clearly err in finding that the enhancement applied because there was a substantial <em>risk </em>of serious injury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>Next, Miller argues that the sentence imposed is unreasonable because, inter alia, the district court failed to consider the requisite factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2007). We find insufficient evidence in the record to show Miller is in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s sentence for reasonableness. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546-47. \u201cConsistent with the remedial scheme set forth in <em>Booker, </em>a district court shall first calculate (after making the appropriate findings of fact) the range prescribed by the guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546. Next, the district court must consider this range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and \u00a7 3553(a) and impose a sentence. <em>Id. </em>The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546\u201447 (citations omitted). \u201c[A] sentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006) (citations omitted); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding application of rebuttable presumption of reasonableness to within-guidelines sentence). \u201c[A] defendant can only rebut the presumption by demonstrating that the sentence is unreasonable when measured against the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 3044, 168 L.Ed.2d 759 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">A <em>post-Booker </em>sentence may be unreasonable for procedural or substantive reasons. \u201cA sentence may be procedurally unreasonable, for example, if the district court provides an inadequate statement of reasons or fails to make a necessary factual finding.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 434 (4th Cir.) (citations omitted), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1142, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). While a district court must consider the various factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a) and explain its sentence, it need not \u201crobotically tick through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s every subsection\u201d or \u201cexplicitly discuss every \u00a7 3553(a) factor on the record.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>445 F.3d at 345. \u201cThis is particularly the case when the district court imposes a sentence within the applicable Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-15\">However, \u201ca district court\u2019s explanation should provide some indication (1) that the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors with respect to the particular defendant; and (2) that it has also considered the potentially meritorious arguments raised by both parties about sentencing.\u201d <em>Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d at 380 (citations omitted). \u201c[I]n determining whether there has been an adequate explanation, [the court does] not evaluate a court\u2019s sentencing statements in a vacuum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 381. Rather, \u201c[t]he context surrounding a district court\u2019s explanation may imbue it with enough content for [the court] to evaluate both whether the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and whether it did so properly.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-16\">On the record before us, we are unable to discern whether the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or whether it did so properly. Accordingly, we vacate Miller\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing in order to allow the district court to articulate its reasons in imposing sentence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b325-9\">. The \u201cofficial victim\u201d enhancement was amended, effective November 1, 2004, providing now for a six-level, versus a three-level, enhancement. <em>See </em>USSG App. C, Amend. 663; USSG \u00a7 3A1.2(c) (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b325-10\">. Indeed, while the evidence of the injuries suffered by the officer who Miller assaulted is somewhat sparse\u2014no doubt at least in part because he had died prior to Miller\u2019s sentencing\u2014another officer testified in a related proceeding that the victim officer was left with a scar that remained visible long after the incident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b326-10\">. We note that the district court sentenced Miller prior to our decisions in <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Montes-Pineda, </em>and thus did not have the benefit of the guidance provided by those cases. We further note that the district court is free on remand to impose the same sentence or a different one; nothing in this opinion should be read to suggest that we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>formed any view regarding the appropriate outcome of Miller\u2019s resentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
