Lewis appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s judgment denying his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition (Case No. 05-56604), and from the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for relief from judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) (Case No. 06-55929). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision to deny a \u00a7 2254 petition. <em>See Sass v. Cal. Bd. of Prison Terms, </em>461 F.3d 1123, 1126 (9th Cir.2006). We review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s decision to deny a Rule 60(b) motion. <em>See Thompson v. Calderon, </em>151 F.3d 918, 920-21 (9th Cir.1998) (en banc). We affirm both the denial of the \u00a7 2254 petition and the denial of the Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-13\">In Case No. 05-56604, Lewis contends that the California Board of Prison Terms\u2019 (the \u201cBoard\u201d) decision finding him unsuitable for parole violated his due process rights because the Board relied upon inaccurate facts regarding the nature of the commitment offense, for which Lewis contends he was wrongly convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-14\">We conclude that in light of the Board\u2019s reliance upon Lewis\u2019 failure to adequately pursue vocational training and self-help programs, his prior criminal history, and his prison disciplinary record, some evidence supports the Board\u2019s unsuitability finding such that Lewis\u2019 due process rights were not violated. <em>See Sass, </em>461 F.3d at 1128-29. Accordingly, the state court\u2019s decision rejecting Lewis\u2019 challenge to the Board\u2019s action was not contrary to, and did not involve an unreasonable application of, clearly established law, as determined by the Supreme Court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>Superintendent v. Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 454-56, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-15\">Although Lewis also contends that the Board improperly promulgated 15 Cal. Code of Regs. \u00a7 2402, such a claim of error in the application of state law is not cognizable in federal habeas proceedings. <em>See Langford v. Day, </em>110 F.3d 1380, 1389 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-16\">To the extent that Lewis seeks to directly challenge his state court conviction, he has waived such a challenge by failing to raise it in his \u00a7 2254 petition. <em>See Belgarde v. Montana, </em>123 F.3d 1210, 1216 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-17\">In Case No. 06-55929, Lewis contends that the district court abused its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>discretion in denying his Rule 60(b) motion. We reject the government\u2019s contentions that Lewis was required to obtain a certificate of appealability prior to appealing from the district court\u2019s denial of his Rule 60(b) motion, <em>see Rosas v. Nielsen, </em>428 F.3d 1229, 1232 (9th Cir.2005) (per curiam), and that he has waived the contention that he raises on appeal. However, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Lewis\u2019 Rule 60(b) motion, because the alleged fraud and newly discovered evidence at issue would not have changed the outcome of the denial of Lewis\u2019 \u00a7 2254 petition. <em>See Coastal Transfer Co. v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., </em>833 F.2d 208, 211 (9th Cir.1987); <em>De Saracho v. Custom Food Machinery, Inc., </em>206 F.3d 874, 880 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b674-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
