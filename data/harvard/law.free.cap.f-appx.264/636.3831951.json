The applications of Tardio\u2019s husband Agus Susanto, and her children Deany Susanto and Deary Susanto, are derivative of Tardio\u2019s application. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(3). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny the petition for review in part, grant in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">The record does not compel the conclusion that Tardio\u2019s untimely filing of her asylum application should be excused. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.4(a); <em>Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 650 (9th Cir.2007) (per curiam). Accordingly, we deny the petition as to Tardio\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">Because the IJ denied withholding of removal without determining whether the harm Tard\u00edo experienced amounted to past persecution, we grant the petition as to the withholding of removal claim, and remand for further proceedings. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-18, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam); <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 1100, 1111-13 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-13\">The IJ\u2019s denial of CAT relief, however, is supported by substantial evidence because Tard\u00edo did not establish that is more likely than not that she would be tortured if returned to Indonesia. <em>See Singh, </em>439 F.3d at 1113.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-14\">Tardio\u2019s contention that the BIA violated her due process rights by summarily affirming the IJ\u2019s decision is foreclosed. <em>See Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 849-52 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-15\">While Tard\u00edo contends that the IJ violated her due process rights by failing to consider the issue of whether she was entitled to asylum based upon a pattern and practice of persecution, Tard\u00edo cannot demonstrate prejudice because the IJ denied her asylum claim as time-barred. <em>See Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-16\">We deny Deany Susanto\u2019s motion to have his case reopened before the IJ so that he can file for adjustment of status, because any motion to reopen should be filed with the BIA, not with this Court. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-17\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part, GRANTED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b663-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
