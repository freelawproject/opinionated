(\u201cKing\u2019s\u201d). Defendants King\u2019s; Rosepark, LLC; and Eric Fedewa (collectively \u201cDefendants\u201d) removed the case to federal court and moved to dismiss or to stay based on the arbitration clause contained in the condominium\u2019s sales agreement. The district court denied the motion, concluding that the arbitration clause failed for want of consideration and for unconscionability, and Defendants now appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-16\">Defendants first contend that the district court erred by considering the validity of the arbitration clause rather than by leaving this question to the arbitrator. Defendants\u2019 argument is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, </em>546 U.S. 440, 126 S.Ct. 1204, 163 L.Ed.2d 1038 (2006). There, the Court held that challenges to the validity of a contract as a whole must be considered in the first instance by an arbitrator, while challenges to an arbitration clause or agreement can be considered by the courts. <em>Id. </em>at 449, 126 S.Ct. 1204. Although Howard\u2019s complaint challenges the validity of the sales agreement as a whole, her response to Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss/stay asserts that the arbitration clause is invalid for reasons distinct from those raised in the complaint. The issue before the district court, therefore, was the validity of the arbitration clause, and under <em>Buckeye </em>the court was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>empowered to determine this issue in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Defendants next argue that the district court erred by concluding that the arbitration clause failed for want of consideration and for uneonscionability. Again, case law forecloses Defendants\u2019 position. We summarized the applicable Maryland law in <em>Hill v. Peoplesoft USA, Inc., </em>412 F.3d 540, 543 (4th Cir.2005), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">Because this case involves the question of whether the Arbitration Agreement was a valid contract, we turn to Maryland law.... Under Maryland law, to be binding and enforceable, an arbitration agreement must be a valid contract. <em>Cheek v. United Healthcare of Mid-Atlantic, Inc., </em>378 Md. 139, 835 A.2d 656, 661 (2003) . . . . [T]o be binding and enforceable, a contract must be supported by consideration. <em>Id. </em>at 661. A \u201cpromise becomes consideration for another promise only when it constitutes a binding obligation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Unlike a binding obligation, an \u201c \u2018illusory promise\u2019 appears to be a promise, but it does not actually bind or obligate the promisor to anything.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 662. Because an illusory promise is not binding on the promisor, an illusory promise cannot constitute consideration. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">In <em>Hill, </em>we found that both parties had promised to arbitrate all of their disputes except for a few enumerated exceptions. We therefore concluded that the arbitration agreement was supported by mutual consideration in the form of binding mutual promises to arbitrate. In contrast, in <em>Cheek, </em>the Maryland Court of Appeals examined an arbitration agreement in which both parties promised to arbitrate their disputes but in which one party reserved the right to modify or revoke the agreement at any time. The <em>Cheek </em>court held that the right to modify or revoke the arbitration agreement rendered the party\u2019s promise to arbitrate illusory; and because there was no valid promise, the arbitration agreement failed for want of consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">We believe the arbitration clause in this case similarly fails. In the sales agreement, Howard agreed to arbitrate her disputes against Defendants and to waive any right to proceed in a court of law. Defendants, on the other hand, made no corresponding promise. Rather, they reserved the right to seek specific performance of the agreement in any court of competent jurisdiction and/or to sue Howard for damages. Defendants\u2019 \u201cpromise\u201d is not merely illusory, it is nonexistent. Under <em>Cheek, </em>the arbitration clause clearly fails for want of mutual consideration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-12\">Accordingly, we affirm the denial of Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss/stay. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b372-11\">. The district court's order is immediately appealable under 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 16.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b373-9\">. We do not reach the question of whether the arbitration clause is unconscionable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
