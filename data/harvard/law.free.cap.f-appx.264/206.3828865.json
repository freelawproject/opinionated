For the reasons that follow, we will deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-19\">Lizardo is incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution in Edgefield, South Carolina. In his mandamus petition, Lizardo alleges that he filed a \u00a7 2255 motion in the District Court on August 16, 2002, to which the District Court has not responded. Lizardo asks us to order the District Court to act on his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-21\">By order entered January 25, 2008, the District Court denied Lizardo\u2019s motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Because the District Court has ruled on Lizardo\u2019s motion, we will deny his mandamus petition as moot. In light of our disposition, Lizardo\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is also denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
