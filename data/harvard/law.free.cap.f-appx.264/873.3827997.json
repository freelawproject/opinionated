Grandy, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Tampa, FL, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b900-17\">Before CARNES, BARKETT and WILSON, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b900-18\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b900-19\">Rafael Jose Portillo-Marquez appeals (1) the decision of the district court denying him a minor-role reduction, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b), and (2) the court\u2019s low-end guideline-range sentence as substantively unreasonable. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-20\">Portillo-Marquez agreed to serve aboard a freighter that he knew was being used to smuggle cocaine. The crew consisted of eight other members. The Coast Guard discovered more than 10,000 kilograms of cocaine hidden on the vessel. Portillo-Marquez pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine while on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, in violation of 46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 70503(a), 70506(a), (b) and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(1)(B)(ii), and one count of possessing with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine while on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, in violation of 46 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 70503(a), 70506(a), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(1)(B)(ii). His total offense level was reduced by five levels, after which his Guidelines range was calculated as 135-168 months\u2019 imprisonment. After noting that it had consulted the advisory Guidelines range and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court sentenced Portillo-Marquez to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment on both counts, to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">Portillo-Marquez first argues that he should have been granted a two-level reduction as a minor participant because (1) there was no evidence suggesting that he knew the amount of drugs involved, (2) the relevant conduct that was attributed to him was far greater than the role he actually played in the offense, and (3) he was less culpable than other participants.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">\u201c[A] district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense is a finding of fact to be reviewed only for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999). Further explaining this standard, we have stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARRs\">[A] trial court\u2019s choice between \u2018two permissible views of the evidence\u2019 is the very essence of the clear error standard of review.... So long as the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision is supported by the record <em>and </em>does not involve a misapplication of a rule of law, we believe that it will be rare for an appellate court to conclude that the sentencing court\u2019s determination is clearly erroneous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b901-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 945 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">Section 3B1.2 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides for a two-level decrease if the defendant was a minor participant in any criminal activity. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. A defendant is a minor participant if he is less culpable than most other participants, but his role cannot be described as minimal. <em>Id. </em>cmt. n. 5. \u201cThe defendant bears the burden of proving his minor role by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>291 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">In determining a defendant\u2019s mitigating role in the offense, the district court first \u201cmust measure the defendant\u2019s role against the relevant conduct for which [he] was held accountable at sentencing,\u201d and second, \u201cmay also measure the defendant\u2019s role against other participants, to the extent that they are discernable, in that relevant conduct.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 945. Where a drug courier\u2019s relevant conduct is limited to his own criminal act, a district court may legitimately conclude that the courier played an important or essential role in that crime. <em>See id. </em>at 942-43. Furthermore, \u201cwhere the relevant conduct attributed to a defendant is identical to [his] actual conduct, [he] cannot prove that [he] is entitled to a minor role adjustment simply by pointing to some broader criminal scheme in which [he] was a minor participant but for which [he] was not held accountable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 941. Further, \u201cthe amount of drugs imported is a material consideration in assessing a defendant\u2019s role in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 943. As to the second prong, \u201cthe district court must determine that the defendant was less culpable than <em>most other participants </em>in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944. Moreover, relative culpability is not necessarily dispositive, as none of the participants may have played a minor or minimal role. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b901-12\">The district court did not clearly err in denying Portillo-Marquez\u2019s request for a minor-role reduction to his offense level because he is being held accountable only for the amount of drugs that are attributable to him personally, and none of the evidence suggests that he played a smaller role in the offense than any of his co-conspirators, except the ship\u2019s captain. Accordingly, we affirm as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">Portillo-Marquez next argues that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court only considered the amount of drugs involved in the offense, as calculated through the Guideline range, and did not consider any of the other \u00a7 3558(a) factors. Moreover, he argues that the amount of cocaine is not related to his culpability because he was only a member of the freighter\u2019s crew.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">We review a final sentence imposed by a district court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Agbai, </em>497 F.3d 1226, 1229 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam). In our reasonableness review, moreover, we apply an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). When reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence, we must consider the factors outlined in \u00a7 3553(a) and the district court\u2019s reasons for imposing the particular sentence. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>435 F.3d 1350, 1354-55 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">While the district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it is not required to discuss each factor. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). Rather, \u201can acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient under <em>Booker.\u201d Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">Although we do not presume reasonable a sentence that is within the guidelines range, <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>491 F.3d 1306, 1313 (11th Cir.2007), we have held that the use of the guidelines remains central to the sentencing process, <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 787. Accordingly, \u201cwhen the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 788. We have recognized that \u201cthere is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose\u201d and the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors lies with the party challenging the sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b902-11\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it imposed on Portillo-Marquez a 135-month sentence because the record shows the district court did consider the sentencing factors of \u00a7 3553(a), as it elicited input from Portillo-Marquez on those factors and it acknowledged taking them into consideration. Portillo-Marquez\u2019s sentence at the low end of the advisory Guidelines range was reasonable. Accordingly, we affirm as to this issue as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
