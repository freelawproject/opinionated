Mar. 30, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 and counsel\u2019s familiarity with the facts and procedural history of this case and the scope of the issues presented by this petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-17\">The BIA has \u201c \u2018broad discretion\u2019 to grant or deny\u201d motions to reopen. <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992) (quoting <em>INS v. Rios-Pineda, </em>471 U.S. 444, 449, 105 S.Ct. 2098, 85 L.Ed.2d 452 (1985)). Because this was Jackson\u2019s second motion to reopen, and it was filed more than 90 days (indeed, more than nine years) after a final order of deportation, the BIA correctly concluded that Jackson\u2019s motion was time- and number-barred. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Jackson \u201coffered no explanation whatsoever, much less one the BIA was bound to accept, for its late filing.\u201d <em>Zhao v. INS, </em>452 F.3d 154, 157 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam). Clearly, then, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Jackson\u2019s motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-18\">The time and numerical bars on motions to reopen do not prevent the BIA from reopening removal proceedings <em>sua sponte </em>pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). Such decisions, however, are entirely discretionary and we lack jurisdiction to review them. <em>Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 518 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-19\">Jackson\u2019s claim to derivative citizenship is wholly without merit for the reasons given in the BIA\u2019s decision. We therefore need not decide whether we would be obligated to grant relief to a petitioner with a valid claim of citizenship whose underlying motion to reopen was time- and number-barred. <em>Cf. Ng Fung Ho v. White, </em>259 U.S. 276, 284, 42 S.Ct. 492, 66 L.Ed. 938 (1922) (noting that alienage is a jurisdictional prerequisite to removal); <em>Iasu v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number><em>Smith, </em>511 F.3d 881, 893 (9th Cir.2007) (suggesting \u201ca court of appeals could still review the jurisdictional issue\u201d of alienage on review of the BIA\u2019s denial of an untimely motion to reopen).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review of the order of the Board of Immigration Appeals is hereby DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
