On September 13, 2005, a friend drove Hopkins to the Center and went inside to retrieve Hopkins\u2019 personal belongings while Hopkins waited in the vehicle. Dauphin County Probation Officers saw Hopkins and approached the'vehicle to arrest him on the outstanding warrant. As Probation Officer Joseph Shockley attempted to arrest him, Hopkins \u201cproduced a .22 caliber handgun and fired one shot at Shockley.\u201d PSR at \u00b6 4. The bullet grazed Shockley\u2019s back, but he was not injured. The officers arrested Hopkins and took him to Dauphin County Prison, where Hopkins was found in possession of 8.6 grams of crack cocaine during a routine search.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-16\">Hopkins was charged in a two-count indictment with possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(]), and with being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). On August 10, 2006, Hopkins pled guilty to Count I, possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of cocaine base. The government agreed to recommend a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility and agreed to move to dismiss Count II following sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-17\">The Probation Office calculated Hopkins\u2019 United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) range according to the November 1, 2005 Sentencing Guidelines Manual. The Probation Office determined Hopkins\u2019 range to be 188 to 235 months imprisonment based upon a total offense level of 31 and a criminal history category of VI. Because Hopkins had 21 criminal history points, he would have had a category VI criminal history even if he was not deemed a \u201ccareer offender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c), an offense involving at least five grams but less than twenty grams of crack cocaine results in a base offense level of twenty-six. Because Hopkins possessed a dangerous weapon, a two-level increase was required pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1). The Probation Office added six levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2(c)(1) because Hopkins assaulted a law enforcement officer during the course of the offense, resulting in an adjusted offense level of 34. After subtracting three levels for acceptance of responsibility, Hopkins\u2019 total offense level was 31. The Probation Office also conducted an alternative calculation based upon the determination that Hopkins was a career offender. Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, the base offense level for him was 34. The Probation Office then subtracted three levels for acceptance of responsibility, resulting in a total offense level of 31. Thus, whether the victim enhancement is applied under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2 or whether the career offender adjustment is applied under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, the total offense level is the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The District Court denied Hopkins\u2019 objections and adopted the factual findings and U.S.S.G. calculations set forth in the PS\u00edt. The Court sentenced Hopkins to 188 months imprisonment and a four-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">On appeal, Hopkins argues (1) that the career offender enhancement does not apply because his escape conviction relied upon as a predicate offense was a nonviolent \u201cwalkaway\u201d misdemeanor escape, and (2) that the official victim enhancement should not apply because the offense of conviction was the drug charge, not the firearms charge, and there are no \u201cvictims\u201d of drug crimes for purposes of the U.S.S.G.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-13\">Hopkins is a career offender if he: (1) was at least eighteen years old when the instant offense occurred; (2) the instant offense of conviction is a violent felony or a controlled substance offense; and (3) he \u201chas at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4B1.1(a) (2005). The first two requirements are met here and are not at issue. In addition, Hopkins does not contest he has one prior qualifying predicate offense for misdemeanor simple assault. The only issue is whether Hopkins\u2019 conviction for second degree misdemeanor escape pursuant to 18 Pa. Cons.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 5121 qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-14\">A \u201c \u2018crime of violence\u2019 means any offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that ... has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another .... \u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4B1.2 (2005). A \u201cprior felony conviction\u201d is any \u201cadult federal or state conviction for an offense punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, regardless of whether such offense is specifically designated as a felony and regardless of the actual sentence imposed.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4B1.2 cmt. n. 1 (2005). Under Pennsylvania law, a misdemeanor in the second degree is punishable by two years imprisonment. 18 Pa. Cons.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 106(b)(7). It follows that even though <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Hopkins\u2019 offense was classified as a second degree \u201cmisdemeanor,\u201d it carried a term of imprisonment of more than one year and therefore qualifies as a \u201cprior felony conviction\u201d under the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">\u201cWhether a particular crime constitutes a crime of violence is a question of law....\u201d <em>United States v. Luster, </em>305 F.3d 199, 200 (3d Cir.2002) (citation omitted). Pursuant to 18 Pa. Cons.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 5121(a), \u201c[a] person commits an offense [of escape] if he unlawfully removes himself from official detention or fails to return to official detention following temporary leave.... \u201d We have held that, as a matter of law, the crime of escape, even a \u201cwalkaway\u201d escape, is a crime of violence because it is a continuing crime in which \u201cviolence could erupt at any time.\u201d <em>Luster, </em>305 F.3d at 202 (citation and quotation omitted). A sentencing court is not required to look to the underlying conduct or whether the defendant actually used any violence; the crime of escape by its very nature \u201cpresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although Hopkins argues that a categorical approach in characterizing escape as a crime of violence is incorrect, we are bound by our precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Because the District Court correctly applied the career offender enhancement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, it correctly determined Hopkins\u2019 base offense level to be 34, less three points for acceptance of responsibility, resulting in a total offense level of 31. Accordingly, there is no need to consider the six-level official victim enhancement because even if the Court incorrectly analyzed the official victim enhancement, Hopkins\u2019 sentence would have been the same. <em>See </em>PSR <em>\u00b6\u00b6 </em>9-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">We note, in any event, that Hopkins was committing the offense of possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine when he assaulted Officer Shockley by firing his handgun, grazing Shockley\u2019s back. The official victim enhancement Guideline does not limit the enhancement to the offense of conviction. Rather, it explicitly provides that the enhancement is meant to apply in the course of another offense, as, in this case, the possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine offense. The applicability of the official victim enhancement is not foreclosed because there is typically no \u201cvictim\u201d in a possession with intent to distribute charge. In this particular case, Hopkins fired a handgun at the officer attempting to arrest him and caused a substantial risk of bodily harm. That is relevant conduct that occurred \u201cin the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility\u201d for the offense of conviction. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 lB1.3(a) (2005). Thus, the District Court correctly applied the official victim enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">For the above stated reasons, we will affirm the judgment of conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b201-7\">. We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). We review the District Court\u2019s interpretation and application of a particular U.S.S.G. provision de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Zats, </em>298 F.3d 182, 185 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
