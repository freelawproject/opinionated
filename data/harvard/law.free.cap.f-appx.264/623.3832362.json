We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253. We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal of a petition for habeas corpus as untimely, <em>see Bryant v. Schriro, </em>499 F.3d 1056, 1059 (9th Cir.2007), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-24\">The trial court dismissed Jones\u2019s Arizona Rule of Criminal Procedure 32 petition on October 18, 2002. Arizona law entitled Jones to file a petition for review in the state court of appeals within thirty days. Ariz. R. Crim. P. 32.9(c). Because Jones did not file a timely petition for review, his conviction became final on November 18, 2002. <em>See Summers v. Schriro, </em>481 F.3d 710, 711 (9th Cir.2007) (\u201cBecause a Rule 32 of-right proceeding is a form of direct review, AEDPA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations does not begin to run until the conclusion of the Rule 32 of-right proceeding and review of that proceeding, or until the expiration of the time for seeking such proceeding or review.\u201d). Accordingly, Jones had until November 19, 2003, to file a section 2254 petition. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A); <em>Thorson v. Palmer, </em>479 F.3d 643, 645 (9th Cir.2007). Jones did not file his section 2254 petition until after November 19, 2003. Consequently, absent tolling, Jones\u2019s federal habeas petition was untimely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-25\">Jones contends that he is entitled to tolling under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). Jones has not demonstrated, however, that a petition for review of the dismissal of an of-right Rule 32 proceeding implicates section 2244(d)(2). Moreover, even assuming that Jones\u2019s petition for review constituted an \u201capplication for State post-conviction or other collateral review,\u201d <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>\u00a7 2244(d)(2), the petition was rejected as untimely by the state court of appeals. Therefore, it was not \u201cproperly filed\u201d and did not toll the limitations period. <em>See Allen v. Siebert, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2, 4, 169 L.Ed.2d 329 (2007); <em>Pace v. DiGuglielmo, </em>544 U.S. 408, 417, 125 S.Ct. 1807, 161 L.Ed.2d 669 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Jones further contends that he is entitled to equitable tolling. We disagree because the record reflects that Jones did not pursue his rights diligently. <em>See Pace, </em>544 U.S. at 418-19, 125 S.Ct. 1807; <em>Bryant, </em>499 F.3d at 1061.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b649-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
