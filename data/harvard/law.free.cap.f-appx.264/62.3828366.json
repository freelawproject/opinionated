Henry conceded removability and seeks review of the BIA\u2019s discretionary denial of her applications for cancellation of removal under Section 240A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b, and for a waiver of inadmissibility under INA \u00a7 212(h), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h). Because we conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review her claims, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>dismiss the petition. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">When, as here, the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements and revises the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented and revised by the BIA. <em>See Ming Xia Chen v. BIA, </em>435 F.3d 141, 144 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">In general, we lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s denial of an application for cancellation of removal. <em>See Barco-Sandoval v. Gonzales, </em>496 F.3d 132, 135 (2d Cir.2007) (\u201c[T]he BIA\u2019s discretionary determinations concerning whether to grant cancellation of removal constitute \u2018judgment[s] regarding the granting of relief under ... section 1229b\u2019 within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) and therefore the review of such determinations falls outside our jurisdiction.\u201d) (internal citations omitted). Similarly, we lack jurisdiction to review \u201cany judgement regarding the granting of relief under section 1182(h).\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i). However, with respect to both types of application, we retain jurisdiction to review \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>see Noble v. Keisler, </em>505 F.3d 73, 77 (2d Cir.2007). Accordingly, Henry frames her claims as raising constitutional questions and other questions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">To determine whether we retain jurisdiction under section 1252(a)(2)(D) to review challenges to the agency\u2019s exercise of discretion, we must \u201cstudy the arguments asserted ... to determine, regardless of the rhetoric employed in the petition, whether it merely quarrels over the ... justification for the discretionary choices, in which case [we] ... lack jurisdiction, or whether it instead raises a \u2018constitutional claim\u2019 or \u2018question of law,\u2019 \u201d in which case we retain jurisdiction to review those particular issues. <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 329 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">Henry first argues that the agency committed legal error by failing to determine whether her removal would create an \u201cextreme hardship\u201d for her family. Although \u201cextreme hardship\u201d is a statutory prerequisite to section 212(h) relief, Henry does not argue that the BIA erred by failing to determine her statutory eligibility for section 212(h) relief. <em>See INS v. Bagamasbad, </em>429 U.S. 24, 25, 97 S.Ct. 200, 50 L.Ed.2d 190 (1976) (per curiam) (\u201c[A]bsent an express statutory requirement\u201d to the contrary, the agency need not rule on issues of statutory eligibility prior to determining whether to grant a discretionary form of relief). Henry\u2019s complaint, rather, is that under BIA precedent, extreme hardship, \u201conce established ... is [a] favorable discretionary factor to be considered.\u201d <em>In re Mendez-Moralez, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 296, 301 (BIA 1996). Thus, Henry argues that the agency was required to determine whether her removal would create an extreme hardship to her family in order to weigh all the relevant equities. The agency, however, expressly considered the hardship her family would suffer. <em>See, e.g., In re Jenny Lee Henry, </em>No. A38 619 316, at 17 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Dec. 9, 2005) (\u201cThere is strong evidence that the Respondent and her family, including her five minor U.S. citizen children and her mother, would suffer hardship if removal occurs.\u201d). Henry\u2019s complaint, therefore, is that the agency did not give her hardship enough weight in balancing the equities. This is a claim over which we lack jurisdiction. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 332 (noting that we lack jurisdiction to review a challenge to \u201cthe balancing of factors in which discretion was exercised\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>Second, Henry argues that the agency placed too much weight on her recent arrests in determining that she was not rehabilitated. Henry does not contend that the agency, as a matter of law, is precluded from considering her arrests. Rather, Henry contends that the agency erred by giving her arrests \u201csubstantial weight.\u201d <em>See In re Arreguin, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 38, 42 (BIA 1995) (noting the Board\u2019s hesitance \u201cto give substantial weight to an arrest report, absent a conviction or corroborating evidence of the allegations\u201d). Because this argument asks us to review the amount of weight that the BIA placed on the arrests, we lack jurisdiction to review the merits of the argument. Henry contends also that the IJ erred by assuming that her arrests might lead to imprisonment and abandonment of her children. We need not decide whether the alleged error would amount to an error of law because the BIA specifically disavowed this interpretation of the IJ\u2019s holding. Thus, in balancing the equities, the BIA\u2014 whose decision we review\u2014clearly did not rely on this alleged error. <em>See Noble, </em>505 F.3d at 78 (\u201cThe discretionary portion of an IJ\u2019s decision is ... reviewed by the BIA as though it were deciding the issue in the first instance.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Finally, Henry argues that the BIA erred by placing weight on her refusal to accept guilt for some of her past convictions in determining that she was not rehabilitated. In support of the proposition that the agency may not so rely, Henry cites a decision from the Seventh Circuit, which, reviewing for abuse of discretion, held that a refusal to acknowledge guilt regarding convictions cannot alone negate a finding of rehabilitation. <em>See Guillen-Garcia v. INS, </em>999 F.2d 199, 204-05 (7th Cir.1993). Because the BIA did not rely solely on Henry\u2019s refusal to accept responsibility for her past crimes, <em>Guillen-Garcia </em>is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b90-7\">. <em>Bastanipour v. INS, </em>980 F.2d 1129 (7th Cir. 1992), is not to the contrary. In <em>Bastanipour, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>the BIA\u2019s decision was reviewable for abuse of discretion, \"the Board gave no reasons for its discretionary determination,\u201d and the BIA \"assumed that [the petitioner] lacked a well-founded fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1131. Here, review is precluded by a jurisdictional bar, and the agency explicitly discussed, and accounted for, the hardship to her family. Henry\u2019s quarrel, therefore, is with the agency\u2019s balancing of the equities, which we lack jurisdiction to review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
