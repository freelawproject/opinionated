Because \u201cthe BIA reviewed] the IJ\u2019s decision de novo, our review is limited to the BIA\u2019s decision, except to the extent that the IJ\u2019s opinion is expressly adopted.\u201d <em>Shah v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1062, 1067 (9th Cir.2000). We review de novo Dhillon\u2019s allegation of a due process violation, <em>Hartooni v. INS, </em>21 F.3d 336, 339 (9th Cir.1994), which we find to be without merit. We review for substantial evidence the BIA\u2019s determination that changed country conditions and the ability to relocate within India rebut the presumption that Dhillon has a well-founded fear of persecution, <em>see Marcu v. INS, </em>147 F.3d 1078, 1081-82 (9th Cir.1998), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Dhillon claims his due process rights were violated because various transcription and interpretation errors resulted in lost testimony. Dhillon\u2019s due process claim fails, however, because the outcome of his hearing was not prejudiced by these errors. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000); <em>Hartooni, </em>21 F.3d at 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Dhillon does not have a well-founded fear of future persecution. That evidence indicates that internal relocation is a feasible option. <em>See Melkonian v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 1061, 1069 (9th Cir.2003); <em>cf. </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(3)(ii); <em>Singh v. Moschorak, </em>53 F.3d 1031, 1034 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">Additionally, the BIA correctly concluded that Dhillon\u2019s alleged fear of future persecution was undercut because DhilIon\u2019s similarly situated uncle has not been persecuted. <em>See Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 816 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-12\">In sum, it cannot be said that the evidence presented by Dhillon was \u201cso compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 817, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-13\">Because Dhillon did not establish that he was eligible for asylum, he necessarily fails to demonstrate eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-15\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of Dhillon\u2019s CAT claim. The BIA reasonably concluded that the abuse Dhillon allegedly suffered did not amount to torture, <em>see Prasad v. INS, </em>47 F.3d 336, 339-40 (9th Cir.1995), and that Dhillon\u2019s ability to relocate within India suggests there is a de minimis risk that he will be subjected to torture if returned to India, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(3)(ii), (iv); <em>Hasan v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 1114, 1123 (9th Cir.2004) ; <em>Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>351 F.3d 435, 443 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-17\">We therefore conclude that the BIA\u2019s determination was supported by substantial evidence and that Dhillon\u2019s asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT claims fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-18\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b608-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
