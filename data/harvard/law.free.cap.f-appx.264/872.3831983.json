The district court held that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>record was devoid of any evidence to support Flores\u2019 claims, finding that the evidence clearly showed that Flores was paid all overtime compensation to which he was or may have been entitled. In support of its ruling, the district court found the following facts, based upon the pleadings, discovery of record\u2014including Flores\u2019 own deposition\u2014and documentaiy evidence submitted by defendants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-5\">1) Flores began working for defendant on or about March 2005.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-6\">2) Flores did not work in excess of forty hours during any week in 2005 because he only worked certain events and on weekends.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-7\">3) In 2006, during the weeks of June 3rd, June 17th, and June 24th, Flores worked in excess of forty hours.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-8\">4) As of July 1, 2006, Flores was entitled to overtime compensation in the amount of approximately $120.00 for the three weeks in June 2006 that he worked in excess of forty hours.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-9\">5) On or about July 1, 2006, Flores was paid all overtime compensation due and owing for the three weeks in June 2006. Defendant paid Flores by check, which was endorsed and cashed by Flores.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b899-10\">Our review of the record reveals that none of these findings is clearly erroneous, and the judgment as to Flores\u2019 overtime claim is due to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-11\">As to Daniel Hardy\u2019s claim, the district court denied his Motion to Amend Final Judgment and Reopen Case because, although he attempted to opt into this action by filing a Notice of Consent to Join prior to the entry of judgment against Flores, the district court never accepted him as an opt-in plaintiff, and Hardy had never filed a separate complaint alleging any claims. None of his alleged claims was ever mentioned in any documents filed by Flores, even in Flores\u2019 Third Amended Complaint that was filed after Hardy filed his Notice of Consent to join. Any claim Hardy may have had, therefore, was never properly before the court and the district court properly denied his motion to reopen the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-13\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b899-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
