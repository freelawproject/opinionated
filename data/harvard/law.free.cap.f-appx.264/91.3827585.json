We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-18\">The events Barile alleges in his civil rights complaint occurred on December 21, 1996; but he did not file his \u00a7 1983 action until August 12, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-20\">We review the district court\u2019s dismissal <em>de novo, </em>\u201cconstruing the complaint liberally, accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true, and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.\u201d <em>Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., </em>282 F.3d 147, 152 (2d Cir.2002). In Connecticut, a plaintiff must bring his \u00a7 1983 claim within three years of the date his claim accrues. <em>See Lounsbury v. Jeffries, </em>25 F.3d 131, 134 (2d Cir.1994) (holding that Conn. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 52-577 governs \u00a7 1983\u2019s statute of limitations in Connecticut); <em>see also </em>Conn. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 52-577 (setting three-year limitations period for tort actions). Barile thus had until December 21, 1999 to file his complaint. His failure to do so until 2004 is fatal to his action.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-21\">We have considered the appellant\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
