Morace denying petitioner\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Xiong Zheng, </em>No. A96 336 586 (B.I.A. Apr. 4, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A96 336 586 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Sept. 6, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-24\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number><em>v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir. 2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS., </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t. of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc); <em>see also Gjolaj v. BCIS, </em>468 F.3d 140, 143 (2d Cir.2006). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS., </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.2004). We review de novo questions of law, including what quantum of evidence will suffice to discharge an applicant\u2019s burden of proof. <em>See, e.g., Secaidar-Rosales v. INS., </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003); <em>Islami v. Gonzales, </em>412 F.3d 391, 396 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">We find that the record supports the agency\u2019s determination that Zheng failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground. In addition to showing past persecution or a well-founded fear, asylum eligibility requires that the persecution alleged be on account of the applicant\u2019s race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or particular social group. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">In his application and during his testimony, Zheng described events in which he suffered harsh treatment at the hands of his girlfriend\u2019s family when they discovered that he had impregnated her. However, Zheng failed to describe how any of this treatment was directed at him on account of his political beliefs or an alleged opposition to the coercive family planning policy. The IJ properly found that Zheng had described the acts of an angry father seeking to punish Zheng \u201cfor impregnating his teenage daughter.\u201d <em>See Matter of Y-G-, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 794 799-800 (BIA 1994) (\u201cAliens fearing retribution over purely personal matters will not be granted asylum on that basis.\u201d). Because Zheng did not establish that he was mistreated on account of his political beliefs, he was not entitled to the presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>See Secaida-Rosales v. INS., </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003). In addition, Zheng did not claim that he participated in any form of resistance to China\u2019s family planning policy other than impregnating his girlfriend, and therefore his \u201cother resistance\u201d claim fails under <em>Shi Liang Lin, </em>494 F.3d at 312 (\u201c[I]t is clear that the fact that an individual\u2019s spouse has been forced to have an abortion or undergo involuntary sterilization does not, on its own, constitute resistance to coercive family planning policies.\u201d). <em>See also Ru-Jian Zhang v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 531, 532 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">Because Zheng has not challenged the denial of his application for CAT relief before this Court, we deem that claim abandoned. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005). Zheng also failed to challenge the IJ\u2019s denial of his application for withholding of removal in his appeal to the BIA. Thus, as a statutory matter, we are without jurisdiction to consider any challenge to the denial of that relief and dismiss the petition for review to that extent. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED in part and DISMISSED in part. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DIS<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>MISSED as moot. Any pending request DENIED in accordance Procedure 34(a)(2), for oral argument in this petition is with Federal Rule of Appellate and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
