Chuck Conner has been appointed to serve as the Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture, and is substituted as appellee pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 43(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b568-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Keith and Dorothy Barthel, whose Nebraska hay meadow has been prone to flooding previously exacerbated by federal limitations on the dredging of a drainage waterway, appeal from the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> order denying them motion for a show cause order, or for a writ of mandamus. The motion cited Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 70 (judgment for specific acts), and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 (action to compel federal officer to perform his duty), and was based on defendant\u2019s purported failure to obey this court\u2019s mandate in <em>Barthel v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Agric., </em>181 F.3d 934 (8th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Following careful review, we agree with the district court that the Barthels, who did not appeal the final administrative decision that followed this court\u2019s earlier remand, have not shown that they were excused from exhausting their administrative remedies, and we therefore find no abuse of discretion in the denial of mandamus relief. <em>See In re MidAmerican Energy Co., </em>286 F.3d 483, 486 (8th Cir.2002) (per curiam) (discretionary power to issue writ of mandamus is extraordinary remedy reserved for extraordinary situations); <em>Taylor v. Barnhart, </em>399 F.3d 891, 894 (8th Cir.2005) (mandamus is not available to parties who have failed to exhaust available administrative remedies). The Barthels were also not entitled to relief under Rule 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B. The Barthels\u2019 motion to supplement the record is denied, and appellee\u2019s motion to strike is denied as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b568-8\">. The Honorable Lyle E.
