Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979), to show that he enticed or induced the 13-year-old girl as the statute requires. We held in <em>United States v. Dhingra, </em>371 F.3d 557, 568 (9th Cir.2004), that it was a \u201cmisstatement of law\u201d to instruct the jury that the defendant in such a case must be acquitted if the sexual conduct was the victim\u2019s idea. The basis for our holding was that \u201c[t]he victim\u2019s willingness to engage in sexual activity is irrelevant, in much the same way that a minor\u2019s consent to sexual activity does not mitigate the offense of statutory rape or child molestation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 567. Schlake\u2019s e-mails asking about a \u201cway we could hook up alone,\u201d and subsequently extolling the victim\u2019s sexual attractiveness and describing in great detail the sexual pleasures he proposed to give her sufficed to satisfy the statutory language at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b), \u201cpersuades, induces, entices.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-20\">Schlake\u2019s double jeopardy argument is meritless because he was not put twice in jeopardy \u201cfor the same offense.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. V. Committing the same crime on two separate occasions is not \u201cthe same offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-21\">\u25a0 The district court did not err in imposing a two-level adjustment for misrepresentation of age. As Schlake admitted, in the case involving the FBI agent pretending to be a 15-year-old girl, \u201che had represented his age as 22 on the internet in order to make himself more attractive to younger, juvenile girls.\u201d Although he did not misrepresent his age in his e-mails to the real 13-year-old girl he had sexual intercourse and other activities with (as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>opposed to the FBI agent in the other crime), he admitted that he portrayed himself in his profile as someone a decade younger than he was for the express purpose of making himself more attractive to younger females and he sent the 13-year-old a photocopy of his college identification card, suggesting that he was the age of most college undergraduates.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b594-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
