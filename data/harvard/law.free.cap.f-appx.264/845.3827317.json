Based on a review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error, and AFFIRM Klopf s sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-19\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b872-20\">Our prior opinion has detailed the relevant facts in this case. <em>See U.S. v. Klopf, </em>423 F.3d 1228, 1232-35 (11th Cir.2005). While Klopfs case was on direct appeal, the Supreme Court decided <em>U.S. v. Booker, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). In light of that decision, we vacated the district court\u2019s original sentencing order and remanded the case to allow the court to \u201creconsider the sentence as a complete sentencing package post-<em>Booker.\u201d Klopf, </em>423 F.3d at 1246. The district court re-sentenced Klopf on 3 October 2006, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">Klopf argues that the district court should not have applied <em>Booker </em>to his case and that the district court erred by enhancing his offense level by 20-points.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">A. Application of <em>Booker</em></p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">Klopf contends that the remedial majority opinion in <em>Booker, </em>which held the sentencing guidelines advisory, is unconstitutional and deprives the district court of authority to impose extra-verdict enhancements. Klopf also claims that the <em>Booker </em>remedy is unconstitutional as retroactively applied to him because he relied upon <em>Apprendi</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>when he \u201chandpicked the laws he violated based on the punishment he faced if later arrested and convicted of the crimes.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-9\">We may not overrule <em>Booker </em>because it is binding Supreme Court precedent. <em>Barbour v. Haley, </em>471 <em>F.3d 1222, 1228 </em>(11th Cir.2006). Klopf notes that he is preserving the issue to argue to the Supreme Court, and he has preserved the issue. Klopfs argument that the district court did not have jurisdiction to impose extra-verdict enhancements also fails because we have held that district courts do have such authority. <em>United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1322-24 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-12\">The retroactive application of an unforeseeable judicial enlargement of a criminal statute violates the Due Process Clause because it is similar to an <em>ex post facto </em>law. <em>Bouie v. City of Columbia, </em>378 U.S. 347, 353, 84 S.Ct. 1697, 1702, 12 L.Ed.2d 894 (1964); <em>see United States v. Duncan, </em>400 F.3d 1297, 1306-07 (11th Cir.2005). However, we have held that the retroactive application of <em>Booker </em>is permissible because: (1) the U.S. Code specified the statutory maximum sentence; (2) our precedent recognized that the statutory maximum was the maximum specified in the U.S. Code; and (3) the Guidelines informed the defendant that the sentencing judge could engage in factfinding and could impose a sentence up to the statutory maximum. <em>Duncan, </em>400 F.3d at 1307-08. The retroactive application of the <em>Booker </em>decision to Klopf does not act as an <em>ex post facto </em>law. Indeed, we were required to apply <em>Booker </em>\u201cto all cases on direct review.\u201d <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 268, 125 S.Ct. at 769. We disagree with Klopfs claims that he was prejudiced by his reliance on <em>Apprendi </em>both when he decided to commit his crimes and when he decided to proceed to trial, because <em>Apprendi </em>explicitly stated that it did not address the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 497 n. 21, 120 S.Ct. at 2366 n. 21; <em>Duncan, </em>400 F.3d at 1308 (\u201c[B]efore Blakely<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was decided, every federal court of appeals had held that <em>Apprendi </em>did not apply to guideline calculations made within the statutory maximum.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-13\">B. The District Court\u2019s Guidelines Calculations</p>\n<p id=\"b873-14\">We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, and its application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Ndiaye, </em>434 F.3d 1270, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>1280 (11th Cir.2006). We will only recognize clear error if \u201cwe are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1177 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). \u201cThe Government has the burden of proving the applicability of guidelines that enhance a defendant\u2019s offense level. Similarly, when a defendant challenges a factual basis of his sentence, the government has the burden of establishing the disputed fact by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Ndiaye, </em>434 F.3d at 1300 (citation omitted). The district court may base the defendant\u2019s sentence on \u201cevidence heard during trial, facts admitted by a defendant\u2019s plea of guilty, undisputed statements in the presentence report, or evidence presented at the sentencing hearing.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Saunders, </em>318 F.3d 1257, 1271 n. 22 (11th Cir.2003) (citation omitted). Klopf believes that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence for: (1) the monetary loss of the offense; (2) the sophisticated means used in the offense; (3) the possession of five or more unlawfully produced means of identification; (4) obstruction of justice; and (5) his aggravating role in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">1. Monetary Loss Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">Klopf argues that the district court erred by increasing his offense level by 10 levels for the intended monetary loss of the offense. Under the applicable guideline, a defendant\u2019s offense level is to be increased by 10 points if there was a loss of more than $120,000. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(F) (2003). In addition, when resolving disputed factors, the sentencing court may consider any information that \u201chas sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 6A1.3. When dealing with an offense where the offense level is determined largely on the basis of the total amount of loss, relevant conduct includes, among other things, any acts and omissions that \u201cwere part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(2); <em>see </em>\u00a7 3D1.2(d). We have stated that we will evaluate the \u201csimilarity, regularity, and temporal proximity between the offense of conviction and the uncharged conduct\u201d when determining whether the uncharged conduct is relevant conduct under \u00a7 1B1.3. <em>United States v. Maxwell, </em>34 F.3d 1006, 1011 (11th Cir.1994) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">A significant amount of evidence at Klopf s original sentencing hearing indicated that he was responsible for over $160,000 in total loss. Therefore, the district court did not clearly err in finding that over $120,000 in loss resulted from the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">2. Use of Sophisticated Means Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b874-9\">Klopf asserts that his offense level at sentencing should not have been enhanced for the sophisticated means. Under the Guidelines, the defendant\u2019s offense level is to be increased by two levels if the offense involved sophisticated means. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(8)(C). Sophisticated means involves \u201cespecially complex or especially intricate offense conduct pertaining to the execution or concealment of an offense.\u201d <em>Id., </em>cmt. n. 7(B). As an example, the Guidelines mention \u201c[e]onduet such as hiding assets or transactions ... through the use of fictitious entities [or] corporate shells ... ordinarily indicates sophisticated means.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b874-10\">The district court did not err by finding that Klopf used sophisticated means to commit the offense. There was evidence that Klopf (1) obtained supporting documents for the false IJD.s, including Social Security cards, voter registration cards, and utility bills; (2) had another individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>create approximately 30 sets of false LD.s; (3) obtained background reports and ran credit checks as a part of his identity theft offenses; and (4) had the fraudulent credit cards mailed to sham businesses and paid the minimum payments in order to keep the victims from discovering that any fraudulent credit cards had been issued. Therefore, the district court did not err in finding that Klopf used sophisticated means to commit his offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">3. Possession of Five or More Unlawfully Produced Means of Identification Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">Klopf urges that the enhancement for possession of five or more unlawfully produced means of identification constituted double counting because the facts underlying the enhancement were also the basis for the underlying conviction. We review allegations of impermissible double counting under the Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Dudley, </em>463 F.3d 1221, 1226 (11th Cir.2006). Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(a), a defendant who is convicted of, among other things, violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(2) shall have a base offense level of 6 if the offense of conviction does not have a statutory maximum sentence of over 20 years. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. A. Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(9)(C)(ii), a defendant\u2019s offense level is to be increased by 2 levels if the offense involved \u201cthe possession of 5 or more means of identification that unlawfully were produced from, or obtained by the use of, another means of identification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">\u201cImpermissible double counting occurs only when one part of the Guidelines is applied to increase a defendant\u2019s punishment on account of a kind of harm that has already been fully accounted for by application of another part of the Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Bracciale, </em>374 F.3d 998, 1009 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted). Furthermore, we have held that the Sentencing Commission may increase a defendant\u2019s offense level based on a specific offense characteristic that is an element of the offense the defendant was convicted of committing. <em>United States v. Naves, </em>252 F.3d 1166, 1168-69 (11th Cir.2001) (affirming the application a two-level increase to the offense level based on the offense involving a carjacking to a defendant who was convicted of carjacking).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-10\">Because there is nothing in \u00a7 2Bl.l(a) to indicate that the base offense level of six accounts for \u201cthe possession of 5 or more means of identification that unlawfully were produced from, or obtained by the use of, another means of identification,\u201d it does not constitute double counting for the offense level to be increased on such grounds. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(a) and (b)(9)(C)(ii); <em>Naves, </em>252 F.3d at 1168-69. Accordingly, the district court did not err by applying the \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(9)(C)(ii) enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-11\">4. Obstruction of Justice Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b875-12\">Klopf asserts that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence 2 levels for obstruction of justice. Under the Guidelines,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-13\">If (A) the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the course of the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction, and (B) the obstructive conduct related to (i) the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction and any relevant conduct; or (ii) a closely related offense, increase the offense level by 2 levels.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b875-14\"><em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3G1.1. </em>One example of the type of conduct to which this enhancement applies is \u201cdestroying or concealing or directing or procuring another person to destroy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>or conceal evidence that is material to an official investigation or judicial proceeding. ...\u201d <em>Id., </em>cmt. n. 4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">The district court did not clearly err in finding that Klopf attempted to have his parents and a family friend remove evidence from his apartment. Klopfs parents pled guilty to obstruction of justice and Klopf does not dispute that his mother attempted to enter the apartment through the window. Such a finding shows that the application of the guidelines enhancement for obstruction of justice was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">5. Aggravating Role Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">Klopf maintains that he should not have received the aggravating-role enhancement because he was the sole defendant charged and convicted of these crimes and there were no other participants in the crimes. We review a district court\u2019s upward adjustment due to the defendant\u2019s status as a leader or organizer under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 for clear error. <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>287 F.3d 1053, 1055 (11th Cir.2002). Under the Guidelines, the defendant\u2019s offense level should be increased by four levels \u201c[i]f the defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). \u201cA \u2018participant\u2019 is a person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the offense, but need not have been convicted.\u201d <em>Id., </em>cmt. n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">The district court did not clearly err when it found that Klopf was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity involving five or more participants or was otherwise extensive because there was evidence showing that there were five other participants. Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in applying the \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">Klopf appeals his 150 month total sentence by insisting that the district court should not have retroactively applied <em>Booker </em>to his case and that the district court erred by enhancing his offense level by 20-points. As we have explained, the district court did not err in applying <em>Booker </em>to Klopf, and it did not err in enhancing his sentence. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b873-10\">. <em>Apprendi v.
