Lopez argues that the district court failed to properly weigh the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and failed adequately to explain its sentencing decision when it ordered his revocation sentence to run consecutively to a 128-month sentence imposed for a 2006 federal conviction on a cocaine charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-20\">The Sentencing Guidelines recommend that a term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation of supervised release \u201cshall be ordered to be served consecutively to any sentence of imprisonment that the defendant is serving.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B 1.3(f) (p.s.). Section 3584(a), Title 18, provides that \u201c[mjultiple terms of imprisonment imposed at different times run consecutively unless the court orders that the terms are to run concurrently.\u201d Thus, under \u00a7 3584(a), a court may run multiple terms of imprisonment either consecutively or concurrently. We have held that \u00a7 3584(a) applies to sentences imposed upon revocation of supervised release as well as to initial terms of imprisonment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number><em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>250 F.3d 923, 928 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">\u201cAfter finding that a defendant has violated a condition of supervised release, the district court must consider the factors contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in determining the sentence to be imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 929; <em>see </em>\u00a7 3584(b) (\u00a7 3553(a) factors must be considered \u201cin determining whether the terms imposed are to be ordered to run concurrently or consecutively\u201d). \u201cImplicit consideration of the \u00a7 3553 factors is sufficient.\u201d <em>Gonzalez, </em>250 F.3d at 930 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Neither at Lopez\u2019s sentencing hearing nor in its revocation order did the district court gave an explanation of why it ordered Lopez\u2019s entire revocation sentence to be run consecutively to an earlier federal sentence from Tennessee. But even if we accord full review to Lopez\u2019s arguments, some of which were not addressed to the district court, we find the sentence procedurally and substantively sound. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Because the district court sentenced Lopez to a sentence within the recommended guideline range, we infer that it considered all the factors required for a fair sentence. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 708 (5th Cir.2006). Lopez made no objections at sentencing, nor does he object to the district court\u2019s calculation of the advisory guidelines range. His only comment at sentencing was a request that the revocation sentence run partially concurrently with his Tennessee sentence. Immediately following that request, the district court imposed a sentence that was entirely consecutive. Given the simplicity of the sentencing issue and the fact that the district court heard it and then responded by sentencing in accordance with \u00a7 7B1.3(f), we have sufficient indication that the district court \u201cconsidered the parties\u2019 arguments and ha[d] a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Further, our review of the sentence is for abuse of discretion only. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. The guidelines sentence is entitled to a presumption of correctness, and Lopez has failed to rebut that presumption. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 555 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d 371, 376 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 163, 169 L.Ed.2d 112 (2007)</p>\n<p id=\"b441-13\">Accordingly, the sentence imposed by the district court is AlFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b440-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
