Boggs was convicted of murder in the first degree and received a sentence of life imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Boggs appeals an order denying his petition for writ of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We issued a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>certificate of appealability on a single issue: whether Boggs\u2019 counsel was ineffective for failing to appeal a properly preserved claim under <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">At the close of jury selection, Boggs raised a <em>Batson </em>objection based on the peremptory strikes of three African-American venirepersons. The trial court addressed each objection and concluded the Commonwealth did not violate <em>Batson. </em>On direct appeal in state court, Boggs\u2019 counsel did not raise the <em>Batson </em>claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In his PCRA petition, Boggs sought relief for ineffective assistance based on a failure to appeal the <em>Batson </em>issue. The PCRA court rejected Boggs\u2019 claim, concluding: \u201c[t]he Commonwealth set forth neutral based explanations which were supported by the <em>voir dire </em>of [the jurors].\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Boggs, </em>No. 505-97, 2003 WL 25598165 (Pa. Commw. Ct. June 13, 2003). The Superior Court summarily affirmed. <em>Commonwealth v. Boggs, </em>No. 2170 EDA 2003, 2004 WL 2334751 (Pa.Super.Ct. July 13, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">Boggs seeks federal habeas relief, asserting his counsel\u2019s failure to appeal the <em>Batson </em>claim denied his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. Boggs\u2019 petition is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Relief will only be granted if the state court decision challenged \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 405-407, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-12\">We evaluate Boggs\u2019 claim under the ineffectiveness standard articulated in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). <em>Smith v. Robbins, </em>528 U.S. 259, 285, 120 S.Ct. 746, 145 L.Ed.2d 756 (2000). Under <em>Strickland, </em>a defendant must establish that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that it prejudiced the defense. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Counsel\u2019s performance is deficient when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>the \u201crepresentation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Accordingly, Boggs must show that his counsel \u201cunreasonably failed to ... file a merits brief raising [a nonfrivolous <em>Batson </em>claim].\u201d <em>Smith, </em>528 U.S. at 285, 120 S.Ct. 746. To establish prejudice, \u201c[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Boggs must show \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for his counsel\u2019s failure ..., he would have prevailed on his appeal.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>528 U.S. at 285, 120 S.Ct. 746.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">In her Report and Recommendation, the Magistrate Judge concluded that because the underlying <em>Batson </em>claim lacked merit, counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise it on appeal. <em>Boggs v. Diguglielmo, </em>No. 04-5882 (E.D.Pa. Aug. 25, 2005) (Report and Recommendation). Although Boggs objected to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s findings on other matters, he did not object to the conclusion that his underlying <em>Batson </em>claim lacked merit. In <em>Nara v. Frank, </em>488 F.3d 187 (3d Cir.2007), we articulated the general rule: \u201c[p]lain error review is appropriate where a party fails to timely object to a magistrate judge\u2019s [Report and Recommendation] in habeas corpus cases.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 196. But in <em>Leyva v. Williams, </em>504 F.3d 357 (3d Cir.2007), we conducted a plenary review despite a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s failure to object to a magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation. We noted that there was no indication that the <em>pro se </em>litigant \u201cwas ever warned that his failure to object to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s report would result in the forfeiture of his rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 364. We concluded that \u201c[w]ithout such a warning ... it would be inequitable to deny a <em>pro se </em>litigant <em>de novo </em>appellate review.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">As noted, Boggs filed his habeas petition <em>pro se. </em>Furthermore, the Report and Recommendation did not include language warning of the consequences for failing to object. But unlike the petitioner in <em>Leyva, </em>Boggs filed an eight-page objection to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation. Boggs challenged the Magistrate Judge\u2019s holdings on three of his ineffective assistance claims-\u2014failure to investigate, interview and call key witnesses to testify at trial, prejudicing the jury during voir dire, and failure to object when the prosecutor presented a mistaken fact to the jury. But he did not object to the finding that his underlying <em>Batson </em>claim lacked merit. Based upon Boggs\u2019 actions, we find <em>Leyva </em>distinguishable and should apply the general plain error rule articulated in <em>Nara. </em>Boggs cannot establish plain error. Nevertheless, we would affirm even under a <em>de novo </em>standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">As noted, in order to prevail, Boggs must establish that the state court\u2019s determination was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>formance and prejudice prongs. Because we conclude that Boggs\u2019 underlying <em>Batson </em>claim lacks merit, we need not address <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>performance prong. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (\u201cIf it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice ... that course should be followed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">In <em>Batson, </em>the Supreme Court articulated a three-step burden shifting process by which a trial court should evaluate an objection to race-based juror exclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-6\">First, a defendant must make a prima facie showing that a peremptory challenge has been exercised on the basis of race. Second, if that showing has been made, the prosecution must offer a race-neutral basis for striking the juror in question. Third, in light of the parties\u2019 submissions, the trial court must determine whether the defendant has shown purposeful discrimination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-7\"><em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 328-29, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003) (citing <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 96-98, 106 S.Ct. 1712).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">Responding to Boggs\u2019 <em>Batson </em>objection, the trial court proceeded directly to <em>Bat-son\u2019s </em>second step and asked the prosecutor to answer the objection. The prosecutor then provided race-neutral reasons for the peremptory strikes of the three African-American venirepersons.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See Purkett v. Elem, </em>514 U.S. 765, 768, 115 S.Ct. 1769, 131 L.Ed.2d 834 (1995) (\u201cAt this second step of the inquiry, the issue is the facial validity of the prosecutor\u2019s explanation. Unless a discriminatory intent is inherent in the prosecutor\u2019s explanation, the reason offered will be deemed race neutral.\u201d) (quoting <em>Hernandez v. New York, </em>500 U.S. 352, 360, 111 S.Ct. 1859, 114 L.Ed.2d 395 (1991) (plurality opinion)). Accordingly, the prosecutor satisfied <em>Batson\u2019s </em>second prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">Once the prosecutor offers a race-neutral basis for his exercise of peremptory challenges, \u201cthe persuasiveness of the justification becomes relevant.\u201d <em>Purkett, </em>514 U.S. at 768, 115 S.Ct. 1769. At the third step, \u201cthe trial court determines whether the opponent of the strike has carried his burden of proving purposeful discrimination.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Hardcastle v. Horn, </em>368 F.3d 246, 259 (3d Cir.2004) (explaining that a court conducting a <em>Batson </em>inquiry must \u201caddress and evaluate all evidence introduced by each side ... that tends to show that race was or was not the real reason and determine whether the defendant has met his burden of persuasion\u201d) (quoting <em>Riley v. Taylor, </em>277 F.3d 261, 286 (3d Cir.2001) (en banc)). Based on the prosecutor\u2019s explanations, oral argument by counsel, observations of the <em>voir dire </em>and review of the record, the trial court concluded that the Commonwealth did not violate Batson.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As noted, the PCRA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>court concluded Boggs failed to meet his burden of proving purposeful discrimination because the prosecutor\u2019s race-neutral explanations were supported by the record.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We agree. Accordingly, because Boggs is unable to satisfy the prejudice prong of <em>Strickland, </em>his ineffective assistance of counsel claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">We will affirm the denial of the petition for writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b192-10\">. Boggs appealed the judgment of sentence to the Superior Court of Pennsylvania, which affirmed. <em>See Commonwealth v. Boggs, </em>No. 1390 Philadelphia 1998, 736 A.2d 678 (Pa.Super.Ct. Jan. 14, 1999). The Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied <em>allocatur. See Commonwealth v. Boggs, </em>559 Pa. 712, 740 A.2d 1143 (1999). Boggs sought relief under the Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 9541-9546. The Court of Common Pleas dismissed his petition. <em>See Commonwealth v. Boggs, </em>No. 505-97, 2003 WL 25598165 (Pa. Commw. Ct. June 13, 2003). The Superior Court affirmed, <em>see Commonwealth v. Boggs, </em>No. 2170 EDA 2003, 859 A.2d 826 (Pa.Super.Ct. July 13, 2004), and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied Boggs <em>nun pro tunc </em>allowance for appeal. <em>See Commonwealth v.

On direct appeal, counsel raised two issues: (1) that a Commonwealth witness improperly commented on the credibility of two defense witnesses, and (2) that the trial court erred in failing to grant Boggs' motion to suppress his statements made at the police station. Neither claim prevailed. <em>Commonwealth v. Boggs, </em>No. 1390 Philadelphia 1998, 736 A.2d 678 (Pa.Super.Ct. Jan. 14, 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-14\">During the PCRA hearing, counsel explained the reason why he did not also raise the <em>Batson </em>claim on direct appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-15\">I did not believe that I had a valid <em>Batson </em>claim that I could raise on appeal in the appellate courts that would be successful____ So although I made that objection at trial, and many times I will make objections at trial to protect the record, when I review the record for appellate purposes or to brief something, there are many times I may not present an issue to the appellate court even though it\u2019s raised at trial, and I didn\u2019t believe I had a strong <em>Batson </em>issue at all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-17\">Transcript of January 2, 2003 PCRA Flearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b194-6\">. \"Under the plain error standard, we should only reverse the District Court\u2019s decision if it made a plain error which affects \u2018substantial rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nara, </em>488 F.3d at 197 (quoting <em>United States v.

In response to the <em>Batson </em>objection, the prosecutor stated that (1) the first juror was struck because he was reluctant to apply the death penalty, he had a brother who was a juvenile advocate, he had a financial hardship, and he was concerned about police bias in the treatment of African-Americans; (2) the second juror was struck because her son was in prison for a similar incident and because she stated that she would not impose the death penalty in a case where drugs were involved; (3) the third juror was struck because of her demeanor, personality, and perceived hostility toward the prosecutor, as well as her assistance to drug users through her church.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b195-14\">. The trial court concluded the Commonwealth properly struck the first juror because he had a philosophical \u201cproblem\u201d with capital punishment. Next, it found the Commonwealth had valid reasons for striking the second juror because she would not impose a death penalty in a case where drugs were involved and because she had a son in a similar position as the defendant. Finally, after noting the third juror\u2019s demeanor during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number><em>voir dire, </em>the trial court expressed concern over her ability to follow jury instructions and found the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion to be a \"legitimate concern.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b196-16\">. Boggs also contends that the third step in a <em>Batson </em>analysis requires the trial court to conduct a comparison analysis between seated jurors and those struck. As an appellate court, we have used a comparative analysis at <em>Batson\u2019s </em>third step. <em>See e.g., Holloway v. Horn, </em>355 F.3d 707, 724 (3d Cir.2004); <em>Riley v.
