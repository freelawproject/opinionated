May 25, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">The BIA issued a separate opinion dismissing Zhu\u2019s appeal after we ordered his proceedings remanded to the BIA upon the parties\u2019 joint stipulation to do so. Therefore, the BIA\u2019s \u201copinion becomes the basis for judicial review of the decision of which the alien is complaining.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005); <em>see also Ming Xia Chen v. BIA, </em>435 F.3d 141, 144 (2d Cir.2006). The Court reviews <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou, Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 <em>&amp; </em>n. 7 (2d Cir.2004) <em>overruled in part cm other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that substantial evidence does not support the BIA\u2019s denial of Zhu\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims. In <em>Shi Liang Lin, </em>494 F.3d at 309, we rejected the BIA\u2019s holding in <em>Matter of C-Y-Z-, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 915 (BIA 1997) that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(B) created <em>per se </em>asylum eligibility for the spouse of a person forced to undergo a forced abortion or forced sterilization. <em>Shi Liang Lin, </em>494 F.3d at 309. Accordingly, Zhu\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claim, to the extent it is based on his girlfriend\u2019s forced abortion, \u201cis doomed.\u201d <em>See Shu Wen Sun v. BIA, </em>510 F.3d 377, 381-82 (2d Cir.2007); <em>Gui Yin Liu v. INS, </em>508 F.3d 716, 722-23 (2d Cir.2007)</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">We find that the BIA erred because it failed to consider the impact of his past experiences in the aggregate when analyzing whether Zhu suffered persecution in China when he \u201cresisted\u201d China\u2019s coercive population control program. <em>See Shi Liang Lin, </em>494 F.3d at 313; <em>Matter of S-L-L-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1, 10 (BIA 2006) (en banc). The BIA found that Zhu\u2019s \u201ctestimony indicates that he \u2018resisted\u2019 the coercive population control policy through his expression of opposition to the policy.\u201d The BIA concluded that Zhu\u2019s \u201ctestimony regarding his head injury and the subsequent destruction of his home does not describe mistreatment that rises to the level of persecution envisioned by the Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">We find that the BIA erred by considering \u201ceach of the incidents separately without determining how they affected the significance of other incidents.\u201d <em>Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 290 (2d Cir.2007). In particular, the BIA analyzed Zhu\u2019s head injury and concluded that his testimony \u201cdoes not indicate that it was serious or caused any lasting physical or mental difficulties.\u201d The BIA then found that the destruction of Zhu\u2019s home does not amount to persecution because he \u201cprovided no detail as to the nature or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>extent of the destruction.\u201d The BIA, however, never took the cumulative effect of Zhu\u2019s experience into account in determining whether he suffered past persecution. <em>See Poradisova v. Gonzales, </em>420 F.3d 70, 80 (2d Cir.2005). As a result of the BIA\u2019s practice of dividing Zhu\u2019s harm \u201cinto isolated incidents and disposing of each on different grounds, without explaining the cumulative significance\u2014if any\u2014of each of these harms,\u201d we have been deprived of the opportunity to review meaningfully any aggregate analysis the BIA may have conducted. <em>Manzur, </em>494 F.3d at 290. Accordingly, we will vacate the BIA\u2019s finding as to past persecution and remand for new findings. <em>See Cao He Lin, </em>428 F.3d at 406; <em>Tian-Yong Chen, </em>359 F.3d at 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Furthermore, the BIA also erred in its individual analysis of the alleged destruction of Zhu\u2019s home. Specifically, the BIA found that Zhu \u201chas provided no detail as to the nature or extent of the destruction.\u201d Zhu testified that his house was \u201ctotally destroyed\u201d and that his house was \u201ccompletely] destroyed.\u201d It is unclear why the BIA did not find this testimony detailed enough to paint a picture \u201cas to the nature or extent of destruction.\u201d Consequently, we find that a \u201creasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude\u201d that the BIA\u2019s finding is in error. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">To the extent Zhu claims that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution in China based on his resistance to a coercive population control program, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that he failed to establish a reasonable and objective fear of persecution. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). Indeed, Zhu\u2019s alleged mistreatment occurred over eight years ago. Despite Zhu\u2019s assertion that he would be imprisoned and tortured if he returned to China, he has not provided any evidence that Chinese authorities continue to investigate his whereabouts. Moreover, the BIA correctly noted that affidavits from Zhu\u2019s aunt and girlfriend did not indicate that Chinese family planning officials were looking for him in 2002. Finally, Zhu did not provide updated affidavits after this Court remanded his proceedings. Hence, Zhu failed to present \u201creliable, specific, objective evidence\u201d to support his allegation that he possesses an objectively reasonable fear of individualized persecution if he returns to China. <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169,178 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">Although the BIA\u2019s finding that Zhu does not have an objective fear of persecution is supported by substantial evidence, Zhu may be entitled to a presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution if the BIA determines on remand, based on the correct legal standard and all relevant evidence, that he suffered past persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1). Assuming the agency finds on remand that Zhu demonstrated past persecution, the government may be able to rebut the presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution if it establishes a fundamental change in circumstances in China. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">Finally, because Zhu failed to challenge the denial of his CAT claim in his brief to this Court, we deem that claim waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005). For the foregoing reasons, we find that the BIA erred in considering Zhu\u2019s claim of past persecution. Accordingly, remand would not be futile in this case because it cannot be confidently predicted that the BIA would reach the same decision after a proper finding as to past persecution. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 335 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED in part, and DE<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>NIED in part. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b102-6\"><em>. </em>Although the IJ made an adverse credibility determination in its May 2002 decision, the BIA did not make any such finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
