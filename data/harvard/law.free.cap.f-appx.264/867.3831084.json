We DISMISS in part and DENY in part the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Lugo and her daughter are both natives and citizens of Venezuela. They entered the United States as tourists on 8 June 2008. In July 2004, the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) served them with Notices to Appear (\u201cNTAs\u201d), charging them as removable pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B), as aliens who have remained in the United States for a time longer than permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">Lugo then filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal. In her application, Lugo stated that she had provided services as a volunteer to the Orlando Venezuelan Society since 2002. Lugo claimed political asylum based on her political opinion and her membership in a particular social group. She alleged past mistreatment and fear of mistreatment if returned to Venezuela due to her political activities against President Chavez. Lugo stated that she had been assaulted by two men who took her purse, watch, and chain and warned her to stop opposing President Chavez. She explained that she feared imprisonment and torture if returned to Venezuela because, despite the warning, she had continued to collect signatures to recall President Chavez. Lugo stated that she had joined the opposition party Prim-era Justicia in December 2001. She attached an affidavit stating that, as a result of her participation in the recall referendum, she had been threatened, and that she fears persecution and loss of her life if she returns to Venezuela. Lugo also included the police report of the assault, verification of her membership in Primera Justicia and participation in the Venezuelan Society of Orlando, and articles describing conditions in Venezuela.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-11\">Lugo appeared before an immigration judge, conceded removability, and requested relief in the form of asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT protection. She supplemented her application by providing the State Department\u2019s Venezuela Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 2004, which essentially supported her description of life in Venezuela. The report described the history of the attempts to recall President Chavez from power. It noted that the government\u2019s human rights record was poor. The report stated that witnesses to governmental abuses and those who had signed petitions for the recall referendum were harassed and threatened. The report also noted that the government and its supporters disrupted numerous opposition rallies and marches with military weapons, firearms, tear gas, and billy clubs.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-12\">Lugo\u2019s supplement also included: (1) the police report she filed complaining of the 31 May 2003 assault, when her attackers warned her to stop opposing President Chavez; (2) her affidavit describing the assault and stating the she left Venezuela fearing for her life and that of her daughter; (3) several statements by people supporting her application and its allegations; and (4) numerous news clippings and articles on conditions in Venezuela and the characteristics of President Chavez\u2019s regime.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>At her asylum hearing, Lugo testified to the following. Her family and her daughter\u2019s father remain in Venezuela. Although her family is from Espousuya, she had always lived in the area of Caracas and did not know about living in other areas. The Venezuelan company she partly owns still operates and provides her with income. Lugo joined Primero Justicia when President Chavez failed to maintain democracy in Venezuela. As a result of President Chavez\u2019s undermining of democracy, some of her family\u2019s land was taken, but later returned. Pro-Chavez groups, called \u201cBolivarian Circles,\u201d persecute President Chavez\u2019s opponents and have no respect for Venezuelans. Alt at 64.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the United States, Lugo worked with the Orlando Society of Venezuelans because it facilitated the gathering of signatures to recall President Chavez in Orlando, Florida. Lugo offered a list, called a \u201cTa[s]kondez,\u201d that contained information about people that voted against President Chavez in the referendum, however, her name was not on that list. <em>Id. </em>at 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Lugo testified that she was attacked in Venezuela on 31 May 2003 at a subway station near the Savana Grande shopping district. While window shopping, she felt a poke in her right side and was pushed from the view of the window. Then, two armed men took her watch and bracelet and opened her purse to take her wallet. One of the men said, \u201cStop working against the Government of Comandante Chavez. This is a warning. The next time will be worse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68. People came to her assistance, and the men fled. However, based on this comment, Lugo became scared because the assault was related to her political work. She filed a complaint with the municipality of Chapao and then \u201cgot on the first plane that [she] could\u201d to come to the United States. <em>Id. </em>at 69. Because of this incident, she fears for her life and that of her daughter should they be returned to Venezuela.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">On cross-examination, Lugo testified that the attackers\u2019 use of President Chavez\u2019s name made the mugging political. She conceded that her physical injuries were minor and did not require medical attention. Lugo explained that she collected recall signatures in February 2003, which wei\u2019e submitted to the government and made public before May 2003. However, before the attack, she had \u201cnever had any fear\u201d of being in Venezuela. <em>Id. </em>at 80. Lugo also testified that at the time of the assault that Venezuela was caught up in the passion of the upcoming election and had low civility. Lugo conceded to the IJ that her attackers may not have known of her involvement in collecting the signatures to recall President Chavez.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">The IJ denied Lugo\u2019s requests for relief. In his oral decision, the IJ found that Lugo was credible, but that the May attack was not enough to establish persecution. The IJ noted that Lugo\u2019s testimony lacked detail as to her activities in support of Primero Justicia and that she did not hold a high-level or high-profile position in the party. The IJ also noted that Lugo had left Venezuela, as she had previously, without hindrance and that her extensive family remained in Venezuela without significant political harassment. The IJ summarized the assault at the subway station in May, but emphasized that, standing alone, it did not amount to past persecution. The IJ found Lugo\u2019s belief that she would be persecuted for her political activities if she returned to be \u201chighly speculative, at best.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 40. Finally, the IJ noted that Lugo did not know what would happen if she were to return to a city other than Caracas in Venezuela. Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>the IJ found Lugo to be statutorily ineligible for relief, he chose not to address whether a discretionary grant of relief was warranted. Because Lugo had failed to establish eligibility for asylum, the IJ also found that she had failed to meet the higher burden required for withholding of removal. Further, the IJ found that Lugo\u2019s one instance of an assault in Venezuela did not qualify her for CAT relief, because she was not held under the custody of the government nor was it more likely than not that she would be in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">Lugo appealed the IJ\u2019s decision regarding political asylum and withholding of removal to the BIA. However, in her counseled brief, Lugo only challenged the IJ\u2019s denial of her application for political asylum. The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion. Lugo filed a timely petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">When considering a petition to review a BIA final order, we review legal issues <em>de novo. D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). The BIA\u2019s factual findings are reviewed under the substantial evidence test. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283 (11th Cir.2001). Under this test, we \u201caffirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1284 (quotation omitted). We review only the BIA\u2019s decision except to the extent the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion or reasoning. <em>Id. </em>at 1284. In this case, the BIA expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s decision by affirming without opinion; therefore, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. Finally, we liberally construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">An alien, who is present in the United States, may apply for asylum. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General or Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-8\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail ... herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of ... political opinion....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The alien carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. \u201cUncorroborated but credible testimony from the applicant may be sufficient alone to sustain the burden of proof for asylum or withholding of removal.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 818-19; <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-10\">\u201cTo establish asylum based on past persecution, the applicant must prove (1) that she was persecuted, and (2) that the persecution was on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006). While the INA does not define persecution, we have held that \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-11\">A well-founded fear of future persecution may be established by showing: (1) past persecution (in that it creates a presumption that such fear is well-founded); (2) a reasonable possibility of future persecution that cannot be avoided by relocating within the subject country; or (3) a pat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>tern or practice in the subject country of persecuting members of a statutorily defined group of which the alien is a part. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1), (2); <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1230-31. The well-founded fear inquiry \u201chas both an objective and subjective component\u201d\u2014that is, the applicant must show that her fear is \u201csubjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. \u201cThe subjective component is generally satisfied by the applicant\u2019s credible testimony that he or she genuinely fears persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he objective prong can be fulfilled either by establishing past persecution or that he or she has a \u2018good reason to fear future persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). General civil strife does not create eligibility for relief from removal, even if the applicant\u2019s life is clearly threatened, unless the applicant proves the relationship between her fear of harm and a statutorily enumerated ground. <em>See Perlera-Escobar v. Executive Office for Immigration, </em>894 F.2d 1292, 1296-97 (11th Cir.1990) (per curiam). Moreover, when a petitioner\u2019s family remains in the country of origination without persecution, the petitioner\u2019s fear of future persecution may be undermined. <em>See Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1259 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">The Attorney General may not remove an alien if that alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened on account of political opinion. INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). The applicant must show that it is \u201cmore likely than not [that] she will be persecuted or tortured upon being returned to her country.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232 (quotation omitted). \u201cWhere an applicant is unable to meet the well-founded fear standard for asylum, [s]he is generally precluded from qualifying for either asylum or withholding of [removal].\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">The record does not compel a conclusion that the IJ erroneously found that Lugo had not been subjected to past persecution. As past persecution, Lugo cited one incident of a mugging during which two men stole personal items and warned her to stop opposing President Chavez. She conceded to the IJ that the attackers may not have known of her political activities. Lugo\u2019s single incident does not constitute the \u201cmore than a few, isolated incidents\u201d of intimidation that might show persecution, and is much less severe than the numerous incidents related in Silva\u2014 phone calls, threats, gunshots, and a kidnaping without injury\u2014which neither compelled a conclusion that they were related to political opinion nor rose to the level of persecution. <em>See Silva, </em>448 F.3d at 1237-39. Accordingly, although frightening, Lugo\u2019s incident does not compel a finding of past persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">Likewise, the record does not compel a conclusion that the IJ erroneously found that Lugo did not objectively and reasonably fear future persecution. Lugo relied on the same mugging incident to provide the basis of her fear of future persecution. This single incident does not compel the conclusion the Lugo will be singled out for future persecution on account of her political opinion. <em>See Silva, </em>448 F.3d at 1239. Additionally, her name did not appear on the list she submitted of President Chavez\u2019s opponents, so there is no evidence that she would be singled out for harassment or persecution in the future. Further, we see no error in the IJ\u2019s reasoning that Lugo\u2019s family\u2019s continued residence in Venezuela undermine the reasonableness of her fear of persecution upon her return. <em>See Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1259. Thus, although Lugo subjectively fears future persecution, the evidence does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>not compel a finding of an objective, reasonable possibility of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">Therefore, substantial evidence supports the determination that Lugo was not entitled to asylum because the evidence did not compel a finding of past-persecution or well-founded fear of future persecution on account of Lugo\u2019s political opinion. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283-84. Because she did not meet the burden required for asylum, Lugo was fails to meet the higher standard for withholding of removal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">Lugo, on behalf of herself and her daughter, petitions for review of the BIA\u2019s affirmance of the IJ\u2019s denial of them claims for asylum and withholding of removal. Because Lugo based her asylum application upon the single isolated incident, the record does not compel a conclusion that the IJ erroneously found that Lugo had not been subjected to past persecution and did not objectively and reasonably fear future persecution. Because she did not establish that she was qualified for asylum, Lugo was unable to meet the higher standard for withholding of removal. Accordingly, we DENY Lugo\u2019s petition as to those claims. Because we lack jurisdiction to review Lugo\u2019s claims related to CAT relief and presentation of witnesses, we DISMISS her petition as to those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">DENIED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b893-29\">.
