After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">In 2002, Timothy J. Elmes claimed to be a resident of the Virgin Islands and ceased filing his U.S. tax returns. On March 22, 2006, IRS Agent Jim Keelan issued summonses to the South Florida custodians of American Express and Northern Trust Bank requesting bank account and credit card statements, correspondence, and billing address information to determine whether Elmes was a resident of the United States during the years 2002 through 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">Elmes petitioned to quash the summonses, and the Government thereafter moved to dismiss his petition and to enforce the summonses. Along with that motion, the Government included an affidavit signed by Agent Keelan declaring that the summonses complied with the four factors laid out by the Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Powell, </em>379 U.S. 48, 57-58, 85 S.Ct. 248, 13 L.Ed.2d 112 (1964). On January 26, 2007, 2007 WL 1299160, the district court denied Elmes\u2019 petition and ordered the enforcement of both summonses. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-12\">\u201cAn order enforcing an IRS summons will not be reversed unless clearly erroneous.\u201d Un<em>ited States v. Medlin, </em>986 F.2d 463, 466 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-13\">Pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7602, \u201cthe Secretary of the Treasury, or the IRS as his designee, may examine any books, papers, records, or other data which may be relevant or material to ... ascertaining the correctness of any return and may issue summonses to those in possession, custody, or care thereof to appear and produce them to the IRS.\u201d <em>La Mura v. United States, </em>765 F.2d 974, 979 (11th Cir.1985) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The \u201cIRS\u2019 power to investigate\u201d under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7602 is \u201cbroad and expansive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThis authority, however, is not unbounded. The subject of an IRS investigation may petition to quash a third-party summons pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7609(b),\u201d and a \u201cnow-familiar scheme of shifting burdens, designed to ensure only the basic propriety of the investigation, applies to such petitions.\u201d <em>Mollison v. United States, </em>481 F.3d 119, 122 (2d Cir.2007) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-14\">First, the Government must establish a prima facie case for enforcement of the summons by satisfying each of the four factors laid out by the Supreme Court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number><em>Powell. Medlin, </em>986 F.2d at 466. Specifically, the Government must demonstrate \u201c[1] that the investigation will be conducted pursuant to a legitimate purpose, [2] that the inquiry may be relevant to the purpose, [3] that the information sought is not already within the IRS\u2019 possession, [and 4] that the administrative steps required by the Code have been followed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In addition, the Government must show that no \u201cJustice Department referral is in effect with respect to such person.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7602(d)(1). \u201cThe IRS may satisfy its minimal burden merely by presenting the sworn affidavit of the agent who issued the summons attesting to these facts.\u201d <em>Medlin, </em>986 F.2d at 466 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThereafter, the burden shifts to the party contesting the summons to disprove one of the four elements of the government\u2019s prima facie showing or convince the court that enforcement of the summons would constitute an abuse of the. court\u2019s process.\u201d <em>La Mura, </em>765 F.2d at 979-80. \u201cThe taxpayer\u2019s burden is a heavy one, which he must meet by disproving the actual existence of a valid civil tax determination or collection purpose by the IRS.\u201d <em>Mollison, </em>481 F.3d at 123 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">Here, Agent Keelan\u2019s affidavit establishes the requisite elements for enforcement of the summonses. First, Keelan stated that he was conducting an investigation to determine Elmes\u2019 tax liabilities for the years 2002 through 2004, a purpose expressly authorized by Section 7602. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7602(a) (\u201cFor the purpose of ... determining the liability of any person for any internal revenue tax[.]\u201d). Second, Keelan declared that he expected the records requested by the summonses to reveal information necessary to a determination of Elmes\u2019 tax liability by providing insight into Elmes\u2019 residency. Third, Keelan confirmed that, as of the date of the investigation, the IRS was not already in possession of the summoned information. Fourth, Keelan described how the summonses complied with the Code\u2019s procedures. Lastly, Keelan declared that no \u201cJustice Depai-tment referral was in effect\u201d with respect to Elmes. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7602(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">The burden therefore shifts to Elmes either \u201cto disprove one of the four elements of the government\u2019s prima facie showing or convince the court that enforcement of the summons would constitute an abuse of the court\u2019s process.\u201d <em>La Mura, </em>765 F.2d at 979-80. Elmes does not dispute the Government\u2019s assertion that no referral to the Department of Justice has been made, nor does he argue that enforcement of the summonses would constitute an abuse of the court\u2019s process. Instead, he alleges that he is a bona fide resident of the Virgin Islands, and that, for reasons flowing from this status, the Government has failed to satisfy three of the four <em>Powell </em>factors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">Elmes contends, first, that the Government\u2019s investigation was not conducted for a legitimate purpose. Specifically, Elmes argues that, because he is a bona fide resident of the Virgin Islands, the United States has no authority either to tax him or to investigate the possibility of taxing him. But a motion to enforce a summons does not require us to determine whether Elmes is or is not a resident of the Virgin Islands. The question we must address, rather, is whether an investigation into Elmes\u2019 residency\u2014and, therefore, his tax-ability-\u2014-is a legitimate purpose of the summons power. The plain language of Sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>tion 7602 indicates that it is. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7602(a). Moreover, even assuming that Elmes is a resident of the Virgin Islands, the IRS would still have the authority to investigate his tax liabilities because the IRS is allowed to tax residents of the Virgin Islands to the extent they have not paid their Virgin Islands taxes in full. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 982(c)(4); <em>see also Mollison, </em>481 F.3d at 123. Accordingly, Elmes has not met his \u201cheavy\u201d burden of refuting the Government\u2019s prima facie showing that the summonses were issued for a \u201clegitimate purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Elmes next argues that the information sought was irrelevant to the Government\u2019s investigation. The Internal Revenue Code authorizes the Government to examine \u201cany books, papers, records, or other data which may be relevant or material\u201d to its inquiry. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7602(a)(1). \u201cThe government\u2019s burden of showing relevance in this context is slight. If the information sought by an IRS summons might throw light upon the correctness of the taxpayer\u2019s return, then it is deemed to be relevant.\u201d <em>La Mura, </em>765 F.2d at 981 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">We agree with the Government that the bank records and financial statements it seeks from American Express and Northern Trust Bank \u201cmight throw light upon\u201d the question of Elmes\u2019 residency and, therefore, his tax liabilities. For example, Elmes\u2019 financial records may demonstrate that he conducts all, or a great majority of, his banking in Florida, rather than in the Virgin Islands. Similarly, his credit card statements may highlight the restaurants he frequents, the dry cleaners he uses, and a host of other transactions relevant to where he actually resides. Accordingly, Elmes has not met his \u201cheavy\u201d burden of refuting the Government\u2019s prima facie showing that the summonses were relevant to a determination of his residency.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">Lastly, Elmes cites four <em>cases\u2014United States v. Stuart, </em>489 U.S. 353, 109 S.Ct. 1183, 103 L.Ed.2d 388 (1989), <em>Barquero v. United States, </em>18 F.3d 1311 (5th Cir.1994), <em>Mazurek v. United States, </em>271 F.3d 226 (5th Cir.2001), and <em>Lidas Inc. v. United States, </em>238 F.3d 1076 (9th Cir.2001)\u2014for the proposition that the IRS must comply with the procedures set forth in the Tax Implementation Agreement (\u201cTLA\u201d) between the United States and the Virgin Islands before issuing a summons regarding a resident of the Virgin Islands.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But these cases all involve summonses to American institutions issued by the IRS at the request of foreign treaty partners and pursuant to foreign investigations. It is certainly the case, as Elmes suggests, that when the taxing authorities of Canada, Mexico, France, or the Virgin Islands seek financial information from an American entity\u2014as was the case in <em>Stuart, Barquero, Mazurek </em>and <em>Lidas, </em>respectively\u2014they should submit their requests to the IRS, as provided in the various tax agreements and treaties between those countries and the United States. But where, as here, the IRS summons an American bank pursuant to its own investigation, the Government need only follow the Code\u2019s procedures. <em>See Mollison, </em>481 F.3d at 125 (quoting <em>Powell, </em>379 U.S. at 58, 85 S.Ct. 248) (\u201c[A] literal reading of <em>Powell </em>requires compliance with only the Code\u2019s procedures, \u2018in particular, that the Secretary or his delegate, after investigation, has determined the further investigation to be necessary and has notified the taxpayer in writing to that effect.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>Elmes concedes that he received proper notice, and the Government has said it needs the summoned information for the purpose of determining Elmes\u2019 tax liabilities. <em>See Powell, </em>379 U.S. at 53-54, 85 S.Ct. 248 (\u201cIf, in order to determine the existence or nonexistence of fraud in the taxpayer\u2019s returns, information in the taxpayer\u2019s records is needed which is not already in the Commissioner\u2019s possession, we think the examination is not \u2018unnecessary\u2019 within the meaning of \u00a7 7605(b).\u201d). Therefore, Elmes has failed to demonstrate that the summonses were proeedurally improper.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b803-8\">.
