Proceeding <em>pro se, </em>he filed a complaint in the district court against several officers of the Tallahassee, Florida police department, seeking damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 on the ground that the manner in which they obtained evidence from his residence infringed his constitutional rights. The district court dismissed his complaint <em>sua sponte </em>pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), concluding that the complaint was barred by the holding of <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). He now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-22\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) dismissal using the same standards that govern dismissals under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <em>Mitchell v. Farcass, </em>112 F.3d 1483, 1490 (11th Cir.1997). \u201cA complaint is subject to dismissal for failure to state a claim if the allegations, taken as true, show the plaintiff is not entitled to relief.\u201d <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>549 U.S. 199, 127 S.Ct. 910, 920, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-23\"><em>Heck </em>instructs that a state prisoner may not bring a claim for damages under \u00a7 1983 if a \u201cjudgment in [the prisoner\u2019s] favor ... would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction.\u201d <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 487, 114 S.Ct. at 2372. The most obvious example of an action barred by <em>Heck </em>is one in which the plaintiff actually \u201cseek[s] damages directly attributable to [his] conviction or confinement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 487 n. 6, 114 S.Ct. at 2373. But even where the plaintiff does not seek such damages, his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>suit may be barred if, for example, he must negate \u201can element of the offense of which he has been convicted\u201d in order to prevail. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">The <em>Heck </em>holding, however, does not necessarily bar a claim, such as the one presented here, that the evidence the police obtained evidence was the result of an illegal search and seizure. <em>See id. </em>at 487 n. 7, 114 S.Ct. at 2373 (explaining that, because of the doctrines of independent source, inevitable discovery, and harmless error, not all unreasonable searches result in invalid conviction). To prevail, however, the plaintiff must prove that the search caused him \u201cactual, compensable injury ... [other than] the \u2018injur/ of being convicted and imprisoned.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citation omitted). In determining whether the claim necessarily invalidates the underlying conviction, the district court must \u201clook both to the claims raised under \u00a7 1983 and to the specific offenses for which the \u00a7 1983 claimant was convicted.\u201d <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1161 n. 2 (11th Cir.2003). Where the circumstances surrounding the conviction are unknown from the record, it is impossible for the district court to determine whether the \u00a7 1983 claim necessarily implies the invalidity of the conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 1161.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">That is the situation here. The record does not tell us whether appellant\u2019s constitutional claim necessarily implies the invalidity of his conviction. At this juncture, therefore, we cannot say that <em>Heck </em>bars appellant\u2019s claim. The court\u2019s judgment is therefore vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
