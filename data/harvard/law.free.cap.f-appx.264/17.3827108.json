Jackson, following arbitration, has been reinstated to his former position with MBCC, awarded back pay and benefits for the time that he was off the payroll, and reimbursed for medical expenses incurred. He continued to pursue the present claims in an effort to obtain damages and attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-19\">\u201cWe review de novo a district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment. Like the district court we take the facts of record in the light most favorable to the nonmovant ... and draw all reasonable inferences in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>his favor. Summary judgment is appropriate only when the record \u2018show[s] that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 Fed. R. Civ.P. 56(c).\u201d <em>Cash v. Cycle Craft Co., </em>508 F.3d 680, 682 (1st Cir.2007). In opposing defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and in support of his cross-motion for summary judgment, Jackson relied largely upon the arbitrator\u2019s findings in the Arbitration Opinion and Award. \u201cAlthough the arbitrator\u2019s factual findings are not dispositive, they may be entitled to great weight.\u201d <em>Wojcik v. Massachusetts State Lottery Comm\u2019n, </em>300 F.3d 92, 105 (1st Cir.2002) (citing <em>McDonald v. City of W. Branch, </em>466 U.S. 284, 292 n. 13, 104 S. Ct. 1799, 80 L.Ed.2d 302 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">I. <em>Procedural Due Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">At the pre-termination stage, due process requires that \u201c[t]he tenured public employee [receive] oral or written notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the employer\u2019s evidence, and an opportunity to present his side of the story.\u201d <em>Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. 532, 546, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985). Jackson argues on appeal that the district court erred in entering summary judgment in favor of defendants on his due process claim because his pre-termination hearing was not held before an \u201cimpartial\u201d hearing officer, and because he did not receive the requisite pre-termination notice that the charges against him might result in his dismissal. Neither argument has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">A. <em>Impartial Hearing Officer</em></p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">\u201cWe have held that there is no requirement that the hearing officer be impartial; indeed, the terminating employer may preside.... But that impartiality is not demanded does not itself determine whether bias can be so severe as to interfere with due process at the hearing itself.\u201d <em>Chmielinski v. Massachusetts, </em>513 F.3d 309, 318 (1st Cir.2008). To demonstrate such a due process violation, however, the plaintiff would have to show that the alleged bias \u201cdeprived him of the opportunity to put his facts before the decisionmaker, or that there was an [ ] error of primary facts in the grounds used for termination that could be explained only by bias.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b45-12\">As the district court found, and the record supports, Jackson \u201chad the opportunity to present testimony and cross-examine witnesses\u201d at his pre-termination hearing. And the record does not reveal erroneous factual findings at the pre-termination stage that could be explained only by bias. Although the arbitrator concluded that there was not just cause to dismiss Jackson, she did not find that the charges were without any factual basis. Instead, the arbitrator\u2019s conclusion of no \u201cjust cause\u201d was largely based on her finding that MBCC had not put Jackson on notice in the years leading up to his dismissal that the underlying conduct charged was inappropriate and, if continued, could result in dismissal. Moreover, as in <em>Chmielinski, </em>the post-termination procedures (arbitration) provided an adequate means for Jackson to complain about the decision-maker\u2019s alleged bias. <em>See id. </em>at 318 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-13\">B. <em>Pre-Termination Notice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b45-14\">Appellant argues that he did not receive the notice required by the due process clause, relying upon this court\u2019s decision in <em>Cotnoir v. Univ. of Me. Sys., </em>35 F.3d 6 (1st Cir.1994). <em>Cotnoir </em>held that under <em>Loudermill, </em>pre-termination notice must include \u201cnotice of the charges alleged against [the employee] <em>and </em>any proposed action the official intends to take, based on those charges.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>The record, viewed in the light most favorable to Jackson, establishes that he received the requisite notice. Jackson was dismissed on August 8, 2002, after a three-day evidentiary hearing. In the spring prior to his dismissal, he received two letters notifying him of the charges against him and the possibility that he would be dismissed. The complaint itself states that \u201c[i]n the spring of 2002, Dr. Norman apprised Dr. Jackson of his intention to terminate his employment.\u201d And the Arbitration Opinion and Award found that \u201c[b]y letter dated June 28, 2002, President Norman notified Dr. Jackson that he was recommending Dr. Jackson\u2019s dismissal based on the following charges [followed by a listing of the charges].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">To the extent that Jackson relies upon the arbitrator\u2019s findings to establish that the requisite notice was not provided, that reliance is misplaced. The arbitrator found that the notice of what was expected of Jackson as a Professor in the years leading up to his dismissal was inadequate, weakening MBCC\u2019s argument that there was just cause for dismissal. The element of notice required to establish \u201cjust cause\u201d for termination is an entirely separate standard from the requirement of pre-termination notice under the due process clause. The arbitrator was not presented with the question, and did not decide, whether Jackson received the requisite notice under the due process clause that he might face termination for the charged conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">II. <em>Equal Protection \u201cClass of One\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">An equal protection \u201cclass of one\u201d claim \u201cis cognizable when\u2014and only when\u2014a \u2018plaintiff alleges that she has been intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated and that there is no rational basis for the difference in treatment.\u2019 At the summary judgment stage, of course, this allegation must be backed by competent evidence.\u201d <em>CordiAllen v. Conlon, </em>494 F.3d 245, 250 (1st Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Village of Willowbrook v. Olech, </em>528 U.S. 562, 564, 120 S.Ct. 1073, 145 L.Ed.2d 1060 (2000) (per curiam)). In an attempt to carry that burden, Jackson has identified three incidents of complaints against MBCC professors that allegedly were not treated in the same manner as the student complaint against him. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Jackson, the record does not support a finding that there was the requisite degree of similarity between Jackson\u2019s circumstances and those of the other MBCC instructors to whom he seeks to compare himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">Appellant also appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of 1) his motion for default judgment and 2) his motion for disqualification of defendants\u2019 counsel, the Massachusetts Attorney General\u2019s Office. Neither claim has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">In their motion to allow a late filing of their answer, nunc pro tunc, defendants claimed that there was \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d under Rule 6(b) because \u201cdue to the absence of a pertinent entry in the office\u2019s case management system, undersigned counsel missed the deadline to file an answer and filed it upon discovering the error.\u201d \u201cThe district court is afforded great leeway in granting or refusing enlargements ... and its decisions are reviewable only for abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>Maldonado-Denis v. Castillo-Rodriguez, </em>23 F.3d 576, 583-84 (1st Cir.1994). \u201cThe Supreme Court has held that the term \u2018excusable neglect\u2019 should be interpreted flexibly. <em>See Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. Brunswick Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>507 U.S. 380, 389, 113 S.Ct. 1489, 123 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993).\u201d <em>Benitez-Garcia v. Gonzalez-Vega, </em>468 F.3d 1, 6 n. 8 (1st Cir.2006). And this court has said that \u201c \u2018[a] default judgment is itself a dras<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>tic sanction that should be employed only in an extreme situation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Coyante v. P.R. Ports Auth., </em>105 F.3d 17, 23 (1st Cir.1997). For the reasons stated in defendants\u2019 motion to allow a late filing and opposition to the motion for default judgment, the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that this was not such a situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Appellant\u2019s claim that the district court erred in denying his motion to disqualify the Massachusetts Attorney General\u2019s Office from representing the defendants is frivolous. In his opposition to appellees\u2019 motion for summary disposition, Jackson accepts that the Attorney General\u2019s Office has authority to represent the defendants. He maintains that \u201cthe issue here is whether the statutory procedures were followed.\u201d The procedures which Jackson claims were violated are contained in M.G.L. ch. 12 \u00a7 3E, which applies to actions against \u201can officer or employee of any agency within the executive office of health and human services or the department of education.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3E. As the appellees have pointed out, and appellant has not disputed, the MBCC is not an agency within either of the named departments. Therefore, the statutory procedure that Jackson claims was not followed does not apply to the Attorney General\u2019s representation of these defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Appellees\u2019 motion for summary disposition is <em>granted </em>and the district court\u2019s judgment granting their motion for summary judgment is <em>affirmed. See </em>1st Cir. R. 27.0(c).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
