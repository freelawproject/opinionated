June 1, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A97 957 793 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City May 11, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">As an initial matter, contrary to the government\u2019s argument, we have jurisdiction to review Gao\u2019s challenge to the IJ\u2019s adverse-credibility determination. While we \u201cmay review a final order of removal only if ... the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1), we do not limit a petitioner \u201cto the exact contours of his argument below\u201d in determining whether he exhausted the issue where, as here, the issue raised before us is a \u201cspecific, subsidiary legal argumente ]\u201d or \u201can extension of [an] argument ... raised directly before the BIA.\u201d <em>Steevenez v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 114, 117 (2d Cir. 2007) (quoting <em>Gill v. INS, </em>420 F.3d 82, 86 (2d Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Here, Gao argued to the BIA that the IJ\u2019s adverse-credibility decision was not supported by substantial evidence and specifically challenged the IJ\u2019s findings with respect to the implausibility of and material omissions in Gao\u2019s testimony. Moreover, the BIA reviewed the IJ\u2019s adverse-credibility finding and explicitly adopted and affirmed that determination. As such, we may review Gao\u2019s challenge to the IJ\u2019s adverse-credibility finding, but we deem waived any specific challenge to the IJ\u2019s reasoning not raised in his brief to this Court. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 542 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse-credibility determinations, under the substantial-evidence standard. <em>See Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004), overruled in part on other grounds by <em>Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dept of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">Here, we find that substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse-credibility determination. Gao\u2019s omission from his asylum application, credible-fear interview, and direct testimony of the significant fact that his father was arrested and detained for three months for helping Gao evade arrest from family-planning officials was material to his claim and substantial evidence to support the IJ\u2019s adverse-credibility finding. <em>See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 308 (2d Cir.2003). Indeed, Gao actually indicated in his asylum application that none of his family members had ever been arrested. Gao\u2019s explanation that he was in a \u201cbad mood\u201d when he filled out that application is not an explanation that any reasonable fact finder would be compelled to accept, nor do we find anything ambiguous or confusing about the question on the application. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">Moreover, in his counseled brief before this Court, Gao does not challenge the IJ\u2019s finding that it was implausible that he was able to escape the arrest attempts of five government officials, or the IJ\u2019s finding that he failed to submit sufficient evidence corroborating his claims. Accordingly, we deem any such arguments waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang, </em>426 F.3d at 542 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">Ultimately, the IJ\u2019s adverse-credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Zhou Yun Zhang, </em>386 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>at 73-74. Accordingly, the agency\u2019s denial of asylum and withholding of removal was proper. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006) (noting that a withholding claim necessarily fails if the applicant is unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out an asylum claim). Moreover, as Gao failed to present any argument addressing the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief, we deem any such argument waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang, </em>426 F.3d at 542 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Chief Judge Jacobs declines to review (for lack of unexhaustion) some of Gao\u2019s other challenges to the adverse credibility finding; in other respects, Chief Judge Jacobs concurs in the outcome.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
