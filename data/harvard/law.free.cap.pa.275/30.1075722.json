The part of the will to which appellant refers states: \u201cProvided further and I do hereby direct that in ease my daughter Theodosia Miller should die without issue and my estate shall become distributable to collateral heirs as aforesaid, then I direct that one-half of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>my whole estate, real, personal and mixed shall go to and be divided among my heirs and the other one-half of my said estate, is to go to and be distributed among the lawful heirs of my wife Catharine Miller as herein specified.\u201d When this language is read with all that goes before, and the plural words of the testator, \u2014 \u201call the heirs of myself and wife\u201d \u2014 are kept in mind, it is clear that he did not intend to give his estate to only one heir, his daughter Theodosia, and have it pass down from her. On the contrary, the will itself shows testator anticipated that his wife would survive him; that his daughter would survive her mother; and that the heirs specified were to take after the death of the daughter. Finally, the parts of the will which we have quoted, as well as other provisions, indicate that, while testator contemplated a possible marriage, and issue, for his daughter, yet he considered them improbable; apparently, what he looked forward to, and intended to provide for, was just the situation which has arisen.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">We see no error in the answer given by the court below to the question here presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">The decree is affirmed; costs to be paid out of the fund for distribution.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
