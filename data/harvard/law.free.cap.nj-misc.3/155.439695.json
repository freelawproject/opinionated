Kidder, on a lease entered into between the plaintiff and Mr. Kidder, for certain rooms <em>in nil office </em>building in New York City. The case was tried originally before the court and jury, and the judge directed a verdict for the plaintiff. On appeal the Court of Errors and Appeals reversed the judgment, declaring that it was not only wrong, but that \u201cin fact there should have been a direction the other way if moved for/\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Upon the return of the case for retrial, defendant moved to strike out the complaint, which, motion was granted, and that action is the subject-matter of this appeal. We think that, in view of the language of the Court of Errors and Appeals, the .action of the trial judge Avas correct. The conclusion is that, under'the lease, the defendant's estate ivas not liable. The case is one practically of <em>stare decisis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">We do not think that the complaint as it stands, which alleges liability upon the lease, would have justified a recovery upon any theory suggested in the briefs of counsel for the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The judgment will therefore he affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
