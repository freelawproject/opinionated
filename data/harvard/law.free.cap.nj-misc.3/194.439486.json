This case was argued with Edison Fixture Co., Inc., <em>v. </em>Copoulos, No. 475, of the present term, but it differs from that in a material matter. Here, the evidence permitted of the inference by the trial judge, sitting without a jury, that the-plaintiff deceived the defendant as to the fact that he was signing a contract, by the false representation that he was signing, as a matter of form, a paper having no obligatory force.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">This testimony furnishes a basis for the jndment in favor of the defendant, which will be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
