K. S.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Upon defendant's default in the payment of certain installments, this suit was brought to recover the balance of the purchase price.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">The defendant filed no* notice of recoupment, or counterclaim, or other pleading whatsoever. Upon the proofs submitted at the trial the judge rendered judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">We are unable to perceive airy theory upon which the judgment can be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">No denial was made of the plaintiff's proofs of the execution of the contract, the delivery of the fixtures- and the default in payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">There was no proof that there was any fraud in the execution of the contract, or that the defendant was deceived by the plaintiff as to- its contents or terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">The defendant, however, sought to interpose as a <em>complete defense </em>to the action certain alleged misrepresentations made by the plaintiff's salesman at the time of the execution of the contract, which will mow be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-12\">The first alleged oral misrepresentation was \u2019to the effect that the fixtures installed would cost less to operate than those theretofore used by the defendant. To this we deem it to be sufficient answer to point out that an examination of the writing itself shows that, by the express terms thereof, the plaintiff company was not bound by th\u00e1t representation if made.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-13\">Th\u00e9 defendant next sought to set up as a. <em>complete defense </em>to the action that the salesman, at the time the contract was executed, made an oral representation that the company (as stated in respondent's brief) \u201cwas going to install a service office in the city of Camden, and that it would take care of all repairs, adjustments and everything of that nature, with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>out any cost or expense to the defendant, and that it failed to do so. To that there are two <em>answers </em>\u2014 first, by the terms of the contract the plaintiff company was not bound by such a representation, if made; <em>secondly, </em>the provision of the contract is that the company \u201cagrees to exchange <em>bulbs and globes </em>during the life of the contract, <em>provided, burned,-out bulbs and globes are relumed and payments made regu</em>larlyand there is no proof that any burned-out bulbs or globes \u00ab'ere returned. On the contrary, the proof is to&gt; the effect that they were not returned, and that the defendant continued to use the <em>fixtures </em>without making the payments required by the contract. Moreover, if there had been proof of a partial failure of consideration bjr reason of the non-exchange of <em>bulbs and globes, </em>that would not have justified the judgment for the defendant, because, as we have pointed out, there was no counter-claim or notice of recoupment of damages filed by the defendant, and no proof of the amount of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">ft may well be that the contract made was an unwise one for the defendant to make. But with that this court cannot concern itself. Our duty is to give effect to' legal rights of parties arising under contracts that they have seen fit to enter into1.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Me are unable to find any evidence justifying the judgment for the defendant, and it will he reversed, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
