His Colorado license states that the license was granted by registration of his medical diploma <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>from, the Rush Medical College. It was not by examination, and for this reason the New Jersey state board of medical examiners refused him a- license to practice in New Jersey on March 26th, 1924. As a justification of such refusal the board invokes the statute of New Jersey <em>(Pamph. L. </em>1921, <em>pp. </em>702, 705, \u00a7 4, <em>ch. </em>221), which provides \u201cthat he <em>(i. e., </em>the applicant) has been examined and licensed by the examining and licensing board of another state of the United States, or by the national board of medical examiners, &amp;c.\u201d The act further provides the board <em>(i. e., </em>the medical board) <em>\u201cmay, </em>in the discretion .of the said board of medical examiners of this state, grant a license to practice medicine and surgery.\u201d It is quite clear there is a discretion- rested in the board to grant or withhold a license under the statute, hence.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">The application for a writ of <em>mandamus </em>is therefore denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
