Plaintiff had a verdict and judgment for damages, which we are asked to reverse on these grounds:</p>\n<p id=\"b425-12\">1. Refusal to nonsuit (a) because no negligence of defendant appeared; (b) because of contributory negligence of plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-13\">2. Refusal to direct a verdict for defendant on the same grounds,</p>\n<p id=\"b425-14\">3. Refusal to order a mistrial because one of the witnesses, not responsively to any question, interjected something about photographs taken for an insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-15\">How a trial judge, under the circumstances of this case, could properly nonsuit or direct for the defendant on questions either of negligence or contributory negligence, is quite beyond our comprehension.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-16\">As to the casual mention of insurance, it is sufficient to cite <em>Bashaw </em>v. <em>Eichenberger, </em>2 <em>N. J. Adv. R. </em>1124.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-17\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
