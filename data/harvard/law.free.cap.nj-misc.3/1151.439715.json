Slat., p. </em>1928), and were adjudged to be disorderly persons pursuant to that section of that act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1152\">*1152</page-number>The defendants below\" bring up for review such conviction, and the sentence imposed thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-4\">Upon examination we perceive that this case is substantially similar to that of Rothman <em>v. </em>State, of this term and this day decided. The questions raised are the same. We think that the decision of that case controls this, and therefore the proceedings of the court below will be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
