Erom the facts agreed upon it appears that, on November Both, 1924, the relator applied to the building inspector of the village of South Orange for a permit for the erection of the row of stores. The application was made in writing and the required fees tendered. The building inspector refused the permit on the ground that the zoning ordinance of the village of South Orange, passed March 20th, 1922, the erection of retail stores upon the lot owned by the relator was forbidden.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-5\">The question thus presented has been decided adversely to the defendant in a number of cases, of which the leading case is <em>Ignaciunas </em>v. <em>Risley, </em>98 <em>N. J. L. </em>712; <em>affirmed, </em>2 <em>N. J. Adv. R. </em>852.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-6\">The ordinance in question further provides as follows: \u201cIn residence \u2018A\u2019 and residence \u2018O\u2019 districts no part of a building shall be higher above the curb level than the distance it sets back from the street line of the street on which it faces, and the front yard set-back distance to the main front wall shall not be less than twenty-five feet, except that on a corner lot the set-back distance from one street line may be reduced to not less than fifteen feet.\u201d The relator\u2019s property is included in this inhibition. The provision is, in our opinion, illegal. It is not a valid exercise of the police power. It is the taking of private property for public purposes without just compensation being made to the owner. It falls within the doctrine laid down in the case of <em>Passaic </em>v. <em>Paterson Bill Posting Co., </em>72 <em>N. J. L. </em>285; see, also, <em>St. Louis </em>v. <em>Hill (Mo.), </em>21 <em>L. R. A. </em>226.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-7\">As this court said in the case of Eaton <em>v. </em>Village of South Orange, decided October 1st,' 1925, \u201cthe fact that there is \u2018considerable traffic \u2014 automobile and otherwise \u2014 at the intersection of the streets on which the property in question fronts,\u2019 does not justify the restrictions in question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1078\">*1078</page-number>A peremptory writ of <em>mandamus </em>is awarded. In case an appeal is desired, an application will be entertained for an order for the moulding of the pleadings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
