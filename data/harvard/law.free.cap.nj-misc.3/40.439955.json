Notice of appeal to the Warren County Court of Common Pleas was served and a bond furnished. The appeal was noticed for trial on September 26th, 1922, before the Warren County Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>The writ <em>of certiorari </em>was allowed October 5th, 1922. The prosecutors write down twenty-seven reasons for setting aside the convictions, but we think the case is controlled by what this court said in the case of <em>Furman </em>v. <em>Motley, </em>67 <em>N. J. L. </em>174. The prosecutors were entitled to have the judgments of the mayor reviewed, either by appeal or by <em>cerliorari </em>as they should select, but not by both methods. Having selected the remedy by appeal, their right to review by <em>certiorari </em>no longer exists, <em>State </em>v. <em>McCarty, 2 N. J. Adv. R. </em>8; <em>State </em>v. <em>Court of Common Pleas, No. </em>249, <em>May term, </em>1924. Moreover, the prosecutors having failed to file a brief, it will be presumed that the further prosecution of the <em>certioraries </em>are abandoned. Points not argued will not be considered; they will be presumed to have been abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">The <em>certioraries </em>are dismissed and the judgment of conviction in each case is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
