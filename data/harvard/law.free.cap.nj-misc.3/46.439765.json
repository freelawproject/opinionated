The relator, Dr. John O. Clayton, was appointed as such by the sheriff of the county on November 1st, 1923. The question involved is, who has the right to make such appointment? It is conceded there is no statute giving the sheriff expressly such power, and we have been unable to' find any. The sheriff has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>uo such power unless it is conferred by authority of the legislature. We think he has no' such power. A writ of <em>mandamus </em>will therefore be denied, with costs, and it is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
