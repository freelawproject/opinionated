The charge or complaint is not adequately set forth therein. The only reference thereto is this: \u201cCharge \u2014 Violation of section 5 of a city ordinance.\u201d As to what city ordinance has been violated we are left entirely in the dark so far as anything in the conviction is concerned. With respect to the finding and action of the court there appears this only: \u201cRound guilty and fined $10 each.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-7\">In this posture of affairs the proceedings, conviction and sentence must be set aside, and it is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
