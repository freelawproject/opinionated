A hoard of adjustment exists in the city of Newark in pursuance of the terms of <em>Pamph. L. </em>1924, <em>ch. </em>146, and relator had not appealed to that board from the ruling or refusal of the superintendent of buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-12\">We conclude that relator must exhaust the remedies through such agencies as the legislature has set up for that purpose before applying for the allowance of the discretionary writ of this court. <em>Florenzie </em>v. <em>East Orange, </em>88 <em>N. J. L. </em>438.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-13\">The rule to show cause is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
