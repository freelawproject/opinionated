JOHN HOMAN ET AL., PROSECUTORS, v. THE BOARD OF EDUCATION OF CAMDEN, DEFENDANT.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b317-4\">Submitted January term, 1925</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AcM8\">Decided March <em>3, </em>1925.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b317-7\">Before Justices Kalisch, Black and Campbell.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b317-8\">For the prosecutors, <em>Grover G. liichman </em>and <em>William J.

Slat, of N. </em>J., <em>p. </em>4141, \u00a7 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-15\">This provision limits the power of the board. <em>Schwitzer </em>v. <em>Board of </em>Education, 19 <em>N. J. L. </em>342.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-16\">What constitutes responsibility within the meaning of the statute is fully discussed and illustrated in the cases of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number><em>Paterson Contracting Co. </em>v. <em>City of Hackensack, </em>1 <em>N. J. Adv. R. </em>1449; <em>Peluso </em>v. <em>Hoboken, </em>98 <em>N. J. L. </em>706; <em>Harrington's Sons' Co. </em>v. <em>Jersey City, </em>78 <em>Id. </em>610.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Under these cases, it is, not shown in the record that the prosecutors were not \u201cresponsible bidders\u201d within the meaning of the statute, and in the defendant\u2019s brief it is stated, at the very outset let it be made clear, that the financial responsibility of the H. John Homan Company is not questioned by the defendant. Mr. Homer H. Lotier, a witness, and member of the board of education, at page 164 of the record,, testified: <em>\"Q. </em>Now, it is true, is it not, that each contractor was privileged to state his own time within which he could complete the contract? <em>A. </em>Oh, yes,\u2019ves, they stated their own time.\u201d The advertising for bids, however, requested that the time be stated in the contract within which the building would be finished.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">As was, said by this court, in the ease of <em>Armitage </em>v. <em>Mayor, &amp;c., of Newark, </em>86 <em>N. J. L. </em>6, the general vice of this course is that no common standard for the competition is set up. So, in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Atlantic City, </em>85 <em>Id. </em>145 ; <em>Tice </em>v. <em>Commissioners of Long Branch, </em>98 <em>Id. </em>214, testimony was taken which is urged as a justification of the board\u2019s action, viz., that the prosecutors delayed the completion of prior contracts with the board, but this is no legal excuse for not complying with the plain mandate of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Por these reasons the award of the contract in this case is set aside, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
