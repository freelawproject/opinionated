It was answered by the witness in the affirmative, and, thereupon, plaintiff\u2019s counsel put to the witness the following question: <em>\u201cQ. </em>Now, tell us what is the exact translation of that paragraph in so far as it relates to the loss of the notes.\u201d This question was objected to upon the ground that the question did not call for a full translation, and that the witness had already made 'a. translation on the stand, and that the defendant\u2019s counsel should have an opportunity to examine and ascertain whether it is a better or fair translation. Thereupon the court directed the paper to be handed to the defendant\u2019s counsel so that his client could examine the translation to ascertain whether it was a better or fair translation. This direction was complied with, and after such examination defendant\u2019s counsel said: \u201cI object still that the question calls for only a translation of part of the original letter, and also that the translation referred to here is only a part of the original letter.\u201d The court said: <em>\u201cI </em>will allow the matter to stand as it is,\u201d to which ruling an exception was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-4\">The original letter was written in Spanish by the defendant, who admitted writing the same to the plaintiff. It is to be observed that the objection to the question was based upon the ground that the translation about to be read by the interpreter was of only a part of the letter, but even if this objection was a valid one, the error, if any, in the ruling, was cured, when the interpreter, upon cross-examination by defendant\u2019s counsel, in relation to the translation of the letter, was asked by plaintiff\u2019s counsel to translate and read the rest of the letter, which was done with the apparent acquiescence of defendant\u2019s counsel. The judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
