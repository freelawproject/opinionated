The assessments are on two vacant lots used as athletic^ fields. In an opinion by Judg'e Jess, then a member of the board,' the facts are reviewed, and the opinion of Mr. Justice Parker, filed in 1909 <em>(Stevens Institute </em>v. <em>Bowes, </em>78 <em>N. J. L. </em>205), denying relief on a similar application in which the conditions then existing were not greatly .dissimilar from the present, held to be still controlling. We agree with this view, and for the reasons expressed the assessment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
