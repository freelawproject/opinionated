FRANCIS H. McCAULEY, DEFENDANT.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b276-4\">Argued October 9, 1924</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A8e\">Decided February 26, 1925.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b276-7\">\n<em>9</em>\n</p>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b276-8\">Before Justices Kalisch, Black and Campbell.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b276-9\">Pot the rule, <em>Jolm M.

The defendant also counter-claimed for certain alleged services to&gt; the plaintiff in and about the rebate, &amp;c., of the federal income taxes of the plaintiff for the years 1917, 1918, 1919 and 1920.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-14\">The trial of the issue at Circuit resulted in a verdict against the plaintiff upon its cause of action upon the note; and. also against the plaintiff and in favor of the defendant upon the counter-claim in the sum of $15,291.78, upon which judgment has been entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-15\">Under the rule to show cause nine reasons for setting aside the judgment were filed; three of them are relied upon and argued.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-16\">It is necessary, however, for us to pass upon the question only as to whether the verdict in favor of the defendant and against the plaintiff upon plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, namely, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>the note of $15,000, and the verdict against the plaintiff and in favor of the defendant upon his counter-claim are against the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">In doing so we deem it entirely unnecessary to state the details of the transactions involved in the controversy, it-being entirely sufficient, in our judgment, to say that an examination of the proofe brings ns to the irresistible conclusion that the verdict upon both branches of the controversy is against the clear weight of the evidence, thus requiring the judgment and the verdict upon which it is based to be set aside, and that a <em>venire de novo </em>issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Such an order may therefore be taken and entered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
