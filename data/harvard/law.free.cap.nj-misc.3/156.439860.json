To this, claim the defendant answered setting up a denial, and also a counter-claim for damages and a claim of a subcontractor of the plaintiff. The defendant and its witnesses reside and have their offices, in Middlesex county. It further appears that it will be necessary to- call as witnesses a large number of persons within the jurisdiction of Middlesex county as well as to produce the minutes, of the board and other records of the school district. It further appears that the plaintiff resides in the city of Plainfield. The plaintiff\u2019s affidavit sets up that the means of transportation to- Elizabeth and to New Brunswick are not greatly different, but does not deny the facts above recited.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">We think, under all the circumstances, the case is. one that should be tried in the county of Middlesex. <em>Keeley </em>v. <em>Belmar, </em>97 <em>N. J. L. </em>98.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">The rule is made absolute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
