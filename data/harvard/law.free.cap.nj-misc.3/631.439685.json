The verdict is contrary to the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-14\">3. The verdict is manifestly the result of errors, prejudice and passion.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-15\">3. The verdict is excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-16\">4. The court erroneously admitted evidence over the objection of the defendant, and erroneously refused to admit evidence offered by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-17\">5. The court refused to charge, as requested, defendant\u2019s request to charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-18\">6. The court erroneously charged that, under the evidence, punitive damages might be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>7. The court erroneously charged that the fact that there might be no love between the plaintiff and his wife constituted no defense in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">Later, the defendant assigned and filed fifty reasons which are denominated amended reasons, which include the reasons above stated, but with more specificness, as is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">In the brief reasons one, two, three and four are argued together. Eeason four was amended so as to read: \u201cThe verdict of the jury is contrary to the charge of the court.\u201d These reasons require a consideration of the evidence adduced in the cause. Counsel of the defendant in his brief says: \u201cThe urgent reasons for a new trial are that the verdict is excessive and against the clear weight of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The substance of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint is that the defendant contriving and wrongfully intending to injure the plaintiff, and to deprive him of the society and services of his wife, and to alienate and destroy her affection for him, unlawfully gained her affections; that he wrongfully enticed and procured the plaintiff\u2019s wife, unlaAvfully and against the plaintiff\u2019s will, to depart and remain absent from the plaintiff\u2019s home and society; that the defendant also wrongfully, and 'against the plaintiff\u2019s will, received, harbored and detained the plaintiff\u2019s wife; that thereby he lost the society and services of his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">A careful reading and consideration of the evidence leads us to the conclusion that the jury was warranted in finding that the defendant had alienated the affections of the plaintiff\u2019s wife and broken up his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">Although the acquaintanceship between the defendant and the plaintiff\u2019s wife had its origin in a casual introduction through the plaintiff\u2019s son and not by the defendant\u2019s seeking, it brought with it in its results, according to the testimony, an end to the plaintiff\u2019s peace and domestic happiness. The defendant was invited by the plaintiff to take his meals with the latter\u2019s family instead of eating at restaurants. This the defendant did for a short time and then ceased, for the reason that he, being a married man, and there being grown-up daughters of the plaintiff in the household, his visits might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>cause censorious talk. The acquaintanceship between the defendant and the plaintiff\u2019s wife, innocent enough in its inception, ripened in a short time into a friendship, with hypnotic affect on her conduct. It appears that shortly after the defendant\u2019s acquaintance with plaintiff\u2019s wife began, the defendant separated from his wife to whom he had been married only for a short time. He made costly presents to the plaintiff\u2019s wife and gradually gained complete control over her, to the extent that she welcomed his visits and shunned those of her husband, confided in the defendant and followed his advice and direction in preference to that of her husband. The testimony discloses many facts and circumstances from which the only reasonable inference can be that the defendant had assiduously and insiduouslv labored to eradicate the last grain of respect and affection that the plaintiff\u2019s wife had for her husband. The defendant\u2019s conduct, according to the testimony, towards the plaintiff\u2019s wife was of such a character as to lower her respect for her husband, and to raise himself, the defendant, in her esteem and affection.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">The jury was warranted in finding from the evidence that the house in Pine Valley was the defendant\u2019s choice for the plaintiff\u2019s wife\u2019s residence and was under his control and management, and was maintained at the defendant\u2019s expense; that he visited there frequently and maintained the plaintiff\u2019s wife there.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The jury awarded $25,000 damages, which sum is claimed to be excessive and the result of passion and prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">First, it is argued on behalf of the defendant that there was no alienation or affection for the reason that, because of the husband\u2019s conduct towards her, she had no affection for him. She was a witness for the defendant and testified to alleged cruelties on part of her husband and toward her during her twenty-four years of married life. But even if this be so, it was not a complete defense to the plaintiff\u2019s action, for he was entitled to recover damages for the loss of <em>consortium </em>and the services of his wife. <em>Dey </em>v. <em>Dey, </em>94, <em>N. J. L. </em>342; <em>Davenport v. Holden, </em>95 <em>Id. </em>197.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>Moreover, the plaintiff was not only entitled to recover compensation for the loss of the society and services of his wife, but punitive damages also, the amount of the latter resting largely in the sound discretion of a jury. We cannot say, after a careful perusal of the evidence, that the jury, in arriving at the result in this case, was influenced by prejudice, passion or partiality, and, therefore, the verdict, in this regard, will not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">It is argued under point one, in the brief of defendant\u2019s counsel, that the verdict should be set aside because there was prejudicial error in the overruling by the trial judge of the following question put by defendant\u2019s counsel to the defendant on his direct examination: <em>\u201cQ. </em>At that time were you trying to get them together ?\u201d The defendant was testifying to a visit made by him, accompanied by the plaintiff to the plaintiff\u2019s wife, and to conversations had with her regarding differences existing between herself' and her husband, and to acting in the role of a peacemaker between the couple, all of which the defendant said he did at the instance of the husband. It is quite clear that the.question, as put, sought the conclusion of the defendant predicated on his own acts and conversations had with the plaintiff\u2019s wife, which was the jury\u2019s province and not that of the witness, and, therefore, the question was propertly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Counsel of defendant then asked the defendant this question : \u201cThe question was asked Mr. Muloclc as to the conversation between his wife and himself on the occasion when you were there, and he stated that, in substance, that you said you didn\u2019t think it was proper for her to take three months to consider the matter, with what I think was the possible inference or implication that you were trying to keep them apart rather than to have them come together. I ask you which it' was you were trying to do?\u201d This question was overruled, and, we think, properly so.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The legal impropriety of this inquiry is palpable. It not only asks the witness for his opinion whether or not counsel of defendant has drawn a proper inference from the plaintiff\u2019s testimony as to what took place and was said, when the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>tiff and defendant visited the plaintiff\u2019s wife together, but also to what inference he, the defendant, drew from his own conduct and conversations with the plaintiff\u2019s wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">The defendant was then asked by his counsel: <em>\"Q. </em>What were you trying to do when you made the statement to Mrs. Unlock?\u201d The question was objected to by counsel of plaintiff, and a colloquy ensued between the court and counsel and the inquiry was not further pursued, nevertheless, it is presented as one of the reasons why the verdict should be set aside. It does not appear that tbe question was overruled, and a fair inference from tbe record is that it was abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Next, under point two of defendant\u2019s brief, it is argued that the court erred in refusing to charge the defendant\u2019s request, which was as follows: \u201cThe jury would not be warranted in finding a verdict against the defendant on any one of the allegations contained in the complaint, based upon any act or transaction occurring before July 9th, 1923.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">This request was properly refused. There was evidence of gifts made by defendant to the plaintiff\u2019s wife prior to that Erne, and even though the plaintiff was aware of that fact, and did not object, is no legal reason why those facts may not be considered by a jury on the question whether or not ike defendant made these gifts for ulterior and improper motives, which were hidden from a confiding husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Under point three it is urged that the court erred in refusing to charge the defendant's request, which was as follows: \u201cThere is no direct evidence to support any of the causes of action set forth in the complaint, and there can be a recovery against the defendant only if the jury, by drawing reasonable inferences, can find that the fair weight of the evidence proves the allegations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">The court had fully charged the legal rule on this phase of the case, and it was not a duty incumbent upon the judge to charge in the form of the request presented by counsel. . <em>Consolidated Traction Co. </em>v. <em>Chenowith, </em>61 <em>N. J. L. </em>554.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">We have examined the reasons presented under points five and six and find them destitute of merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">The rale to show cause is discharged, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
