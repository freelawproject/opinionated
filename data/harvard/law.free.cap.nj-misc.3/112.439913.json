Plaintiff\u2019s case was that as he approached the crossing he stopped; that he saw defendant\u2019s truck rapidly approaching; that defendant\u2019s truck skidded on the icy road; that plaintiff suddenly started his car to get out of the way, and the rear of defendant\u2019s truck swung around, and in the endeavor to avoid it the plaintiff struck the curb with his machine and was damaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-12\">Defendant\u2019s case presented a denial of negligence, by alleging that plaintiff\u2019s car was going at about twenty miles an hour; that defendant\u2019s car skidded when plaintiff\u2019s car was about forty feet from him; that plaintiff had given no signal, and that defendant had given a signal.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-13\">Manifestly, this presentation of fact raised a jury question, both upon the questions of negligence and contributory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>negligence. The trial court, therefore, erred in directing counsel to limit his address only to the question of damages, and by directing a verdict in favor of the plaintiff upon the question of defendant\u2019s liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">The questions of negligence of the defendant, the alleged contributory negligence of plaintiff, as well as the question of resulting damages, were questions for the jury. <em>Daly </em>v. <em>Case, </em>88 N. <em>J. L. </em>295.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The judgment will be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
