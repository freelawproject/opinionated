Hall, Treasurer,\u201d plaintiff, to recover $500 on a <em>check, </em>made\u2019by the defendant and payable to the order of \u201cGeorge L. Hall, Treasurer.\u201d The action was styled \u201cin tort.\u201d The defendant, on the return day in the District Court, moved to strike out the complaint on the ground of misjoinder and non-joinder o\u00a3 the parties, and on the further ground that the plaintiff sued as agent, not as principal. This motion was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-12\">Thereafter, on <em>June 26th, 192J, </em>the cause came on for trial. Hall testified that he was treasurer of the Precision Products Corporation, and that the check was given to him in discharge of a contract obligation of the defendant to the Precision Products Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-13\">Thereupon, the defendant moved to nonsuit on the ground, first, that the action was' brought in tort, and should have been on contract: secondly, that the plaintiff in the action, George L.

Judgment then to be entered against defendant for the amount of the <em>note/ \u201d </em>This, it is asserted, and the presumption is, was done in the absence of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">We think there should be a reversal and a proper trial, at which appropriate motions for appropriate amendments of process and pleadings may bo made and dealt with in the presence of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The judgment will be' reversed and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
