He did not .vacate, however, until July 2d, 1923. Plaintiff was unsuccessful in renting the apartment until October 1st. This suit was brought to recover for the rent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>due for July, August and September. The trial judge found for the plaintiff. The appellant contends that this was erroneous, in that there was no monthly tenancy subsisting at the time upon which a rental could be predicated, but the trial judge found that there was, and it must be assumed that there was evidence to support the finding, the evidence not being before ns. Being a monthly tenancy, it required three months\u2019 notice in writing, of the intention to terminate the tenancy upon one of the dates upon which rent is payable. <em>Pamph. L. </em>1923, <em>p. </em>145, <em>ch. 72. </em>A notice to quit at any other period sooner or later than the termination of the tenancy will not avail. <em>Steffens </em>v. <em>Earl, </em>40 <em>N. J. L. </em>128; <em>Waters </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>59 <em>Id. </em>337; <em>Finkelstein </em>v. <em>Herson, </em>55 <em>Id. </em>217.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">The only other point urged for reversal is that the judgment of the court was excessive, in that it included rent for tire month of September, but we think if the plaintiff was entitled to recover at all, he was entitled to recover for the three months in suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
