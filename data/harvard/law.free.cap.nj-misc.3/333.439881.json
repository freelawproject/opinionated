Feinswog.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b349-9\">For tlie respondents, <em>Joseph T.

That said lands are embraced In \u201cResidence B\u201d district of the zoning ordinance of Elizabeth. Since the erection of the building on said premises there has been in said building three stores \u2014 a tailor shop and pharmacy bn Monroe avenue and a barber shop on Louisa street. On July 11th, 1924, relators made application to William T. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Kaltenbach, building inspector of the city of Elizabeth, for a permit to add an extension to said building at the rear thereof, facing on Louisa street, for the purpose of enlarging a store. Tlie said application was in proper form, accompanied by plans and specifications in all respects complying with the regulations of the building departments of the city, and not in conflict with any laws of the state, and a proper fee was tendered for the issuing of the permit. On August 6th, the building inspector- refused to issue the permit on the ground that the contemplated extension of the building on Louisa street was in violation of the zoning ordinance, the lands being in \u201cResidence B District,\u201d in which stores are not permitted. Relators then appealed to the board of adjustment of the city, created under <em>Pamph L. </em>1924, <em>p. </em>324, and that board, after a hearing, affirmed the decision of the building inspector not to issue the permit. Relators then applied for and obtained the present rule to show cause why an alternative or peremptory writ of <em>mandamus </em>should not issue, requiring the building inspector to issue the permit as applied for by relators.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">In opposition to this rule, counsel for respondents urged two reasons only.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">1. <em>Certiorari </em>is the proper remedy to be pursued, and that should be directed to a review of the determination of the board of adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">But such a procedure would accomplish nothing and be unavailing. <em>Biddle </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Banking, </em>100 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>692.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">2. <em>Mandamus </em>is not the proper remedy to review the proceedings of a statutory tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"A-6\">The answer to this is that the present proceeding does not contemplate a review of the action and proceedings of the board of adjustment, but seeks the assistance of this court\u2019s prerogative writ to compel the building inspector to- perform an administrative act which it is asserted he, in law and fact, should have performed, namely, issue the permit applied for.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>\"The fact that another remedy may exist for reaching the evil complained of will not avail to prevent the resort of <em>mandamus </em>unless such other remedy is specific and adequate * * <em>Lay </em>v. <em>Hoboken, </em>75 <em>N. J. L. </em>315, and cases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">We have already pointed out that <em>certiorari </em>is unavailing and inadequate, therefore, resort to <em>mandamus </em>is proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">We think the facts in this case makes the finding in <em>Ignaciunas </em>v. <em>Risley, </em>98 <em>N. J. L. </em>712, controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">As all the facts are before us upon argued stipulation, no advantage or benefit can arise in the allowance of an alternative writ and therefore a peremptory writ of <em>mandamus </em>may issue, with leave to apply for a molding of pleadings in the event that an appeal is desired.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
