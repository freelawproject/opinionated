The reasons for this lies in the fact that the trial <em>de novo </em>nullifies the proceedings before the magistrate, except the initiatory proceedings of complaint and warrant. Because of the failure of the trial judge to make a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>finding that the accused was guilty of the offense charged against him in the complaint, and to pronounce judgment on such conviction, it becomes unnecessary to consider the other reasons urged in the prosecutor\u2019s brief for setting aside the conviction, the conviction under review will be set aside.
