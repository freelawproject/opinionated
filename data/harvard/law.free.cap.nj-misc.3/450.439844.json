The judgment was for plaintiff for $50, being two weeks\u2019 wages. The state of the case, as settled by the court, shows that the action was brought to recover two weeks\u2019 wages alleged to be due under a written contract of employment. The services for which claim was made were never rendered, because of plaintiff\u2019s discharge by defendant. \u2018The action, therefore^ should have been for breach of contract. The plaintiff\u2019s duty under the contract was to act as driver or chauffeur of a motor truck, and to make deliveries and perform general work in a coal business.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-12\">The contract empowered the defendant to terminate the employment upon one week\u2019s notice, if the plaintiff\u2019s services were not satisfactory. The work to be performed was ordinary mechanical or manual labor, not involving personal taste or fancy, and, hence, the defendant had no legal right to arbitrarily dismiss the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-13\">The question of reasonable grounds of defendant\u2019s dissatisfaction, as well as the question whether or not proper notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>was given to the plaintiff, were fact questions for a jury, and since there was some evidence which would justify their submission to a jury, we will not review the finding on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"AYv\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
