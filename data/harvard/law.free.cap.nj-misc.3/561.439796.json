The next count charged a similar offense, laying the occurrence, however, on a different day. The third count charged the defendant with unlawfully and willfully possessing liquor contrary to the statute. When the case came on to be tried the defendant pleaded <em>non vult </em>to the indictment, and thereupon he was sentenced to the county jail for a period of six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">The defendant now challenges the validity of this sentence upon the ground that it is excessive, for the reason that the statute upon which the indictment is founded <em>(Pamph. L. </em>1922, <em>p. </em>615) only permits the imposition of a fine not exceeding $500 upon a conviction of the offense laid in the third count of the indictment, when such an offense is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>first of which the defendant has been guilty. We find nothing in this cause of reversal. The defendant pleaded <em>non vult </em>to the indictment as a whole. \" Such a plea, in cases where the indictment contains several counts, each charging a separate offense, is an admission of guilt as to each of such offenses; and the correct practice is to sentence on the count containing the charge of the highest offense, unless the- several offenses are positively repugnant, and the sentence is valid if it does not exceed that which may lawfully be imposed for such offense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dugan, 65 N. J. L. 65. </em>The sentence under review is within the limit fixed by the statute for the commission of the-offense charged against the defendant in the first, as well as in the second, count of the indictment; and the three offenses specified in 'the several counts are not repugnant.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">The judgment under review will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
