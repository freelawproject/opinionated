The license desired is not a building permit, but a license to operate a tea room or restaurant at Nos. 118 and 120 Broad street, Newark, which is in a district classed as residential. The director denied a license and the board of adjustment concurred. There is no plea or demurrer to the return, but we have a stipulation of facts as in the other case, showing that there are a number of mercantile establishments and hoarding-houses already operating in the immediate neighborhood and in this restricted district, and it is stipulated that \u201cthe said proposed tea <em>room or </em>restaurant would not affect the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the community.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-12\">We need not repeat what has been said in the Builders Realty Company case and in the cases cited. A peremptory writ is awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
