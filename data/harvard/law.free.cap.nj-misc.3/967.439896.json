The trial resulted in a nonsuit of the plaintiff, and this is the error complained of. The testimony shows that the lampe were furnished under a writen contract dated April 23d, 1923, at the bottom of which was written \"salesman D. Dobrin.\u201d The plaintiff proved that Mr. Dobrin was in Los Angeles, California, by a witness Max Forman. The defendant was then called. <em>\"Q. </em>Did you sign this paper? <em>A. </em>Yes. sir. Mr. Grecnbaum, I offer it in evidence. Mr. Kennedy \u2014 I object to that. The court\u2019s objection sustained.\u201d This was reversible error. If D. Dobrin was a subscribing witness, which we do not think he was, it was shown he was out of the state, then other proof of the paper\u2019s execution is competent. <em>New Jersey Zinc, &amp;c., Co. </em>v. <em>Lehigh Zinc, &amp;c., Co., </em>59 <em>N.

As stated, this was reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-12\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
