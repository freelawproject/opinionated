The trial resulted in a verdict in her favor, and from the judgment entered thereon the defendant has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-12\">The only ground upon which a reversal is sought is an alleged error on the part of- the trial court in permitting Dr. Bien, who was the plaintiff\u2019s physician, and attended her in the hospital, to look at an X-ray plate which he was unable to say was a photograph of the plaintiff\u2019s leg after her injury, \u2022and to testify that an inspection of this plate refreshed his recollection as to the condition of the bones in Mrs. Hinkelman\u2019s foot. The testimony was objected to on the ground that it was improper to permit the doctor to refresh his recollection by the use of a photograph that he could not swear was taken of the plaintiff\u2019s foot or leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>We think that the objection was without merit. Anything which will refresh the recollection of a witness may be looked at by him for that purpose, although, in itself, it is not evidential.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-4\">We conclude, therefore, that the judgment under review should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
