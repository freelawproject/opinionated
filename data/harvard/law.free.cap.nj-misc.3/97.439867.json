The defendant filed a counter-claim for $152 for alleged damages by reason of breach of an implied warranty of <em>fitness for use. </em>Judgment was rendered in favor of defendant for $112 and costs by the trial judge, sitting without a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-12\">. After reciting ou'dence produced hv the defendant tending to show that the instrument was <em>not fit for </em>use, the agreed state of case states \u201cthe defendant then stopped payment on the lease and demanded that the instrument he removed. Defendant testified, over objections of plaintiff, that such testimony was incompetent, that plaintiff\u2019s agent then visited the defendant\u2019s house with a workman, who, having examined the instrument, turned to plaintiff\u2019s agent and said, Tor * * * sake get it out of here, it\u2019s no good,\u2019 referring to the piano in question, the declarations of the workman were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>admitted over the objections of plaintiff\u2019s attorney on the ground that the statements were not binding, and were made without the authority and were incompetent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">Plaintiff now urges-that, as matters stood, such testimony was incompetent and not binding on the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">We think that there, was error in the admission of the declaration of the workman, \u201cget it out of here; it is no good.\u201d This workman, plainly, had no authority'to bind the plaintiff, and if he had been present in the court, would not have been permitted to testify until his .expert qualifications had been shown. The statement was hearsay, and the workman was not authorized to make declarations concerning the <em>condition of the piano. Huebner </em>v. <em>Erie Railroad </em>Co., 69 <em>N. J. L. </em>327, is controlling. A principal is bound by'acts and- concomitant declarations of an. agent touching such matters only as are within the scop\u00e9 of his general emplo3rment, or have been specially entrusted to his agencjr bjr the principal.' As the proofs stood, he went there as a \u201cworkman\u201d (not as a repairman) in response to a demand \u201cthat the instrument be removedThe-fair implication is that this particular workman was sent to remove the Instrument, and not to ascertain its condition and fitness for use as a musical instrument. It is true that he examined the instrument, but the declaration was made thereafter, and his examination, so fan as appears, was entirely consistent -with the purpose for which he was sent, namely, to remove the piano.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">We, therefore, think that the workman\u2019s declaration was not made by one authorized to'make it so as to be binding upon the-plaintiff, and that the- court erred in admitting it. As the court thought it was evidential, it is just to presume that he gave credence to it in deciding against the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Since the case must be retried we remark that we do not perceive -any other error in the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">The judgment will be reversed and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
