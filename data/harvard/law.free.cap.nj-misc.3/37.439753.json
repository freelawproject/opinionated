Because such improvement should be authorized by ordinance under article 20 of <em>Pamph. L. </em>1917, <em>pp. </em>319, 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-14\">2. The cost of grading and graveling Fourth street will exceed $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-15\">3. The common council did not advertise for bids. <em>Comp. Slat., p. </em>1021, \u00a7 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-16\">4. The motion is vague and indefinite; it does not indicate whether said grading and graveling be extended in a northeasterly direction or in a southwesterly direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>5. The motion does not establish what portion of Fourth .street is to b.e improved by the grading and graveling thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">6. The motion in' divers other respects is illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">We think, for these reasons, the motion or resolution should be set aside. A taxpayer has a right to* know what the contemplated improvement is to cost and the exact part of Fourth street proposed to be graded and graveled.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">It is set aside&gt; with costs, so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
