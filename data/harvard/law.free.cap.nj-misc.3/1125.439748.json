On the way to the place of purchase a stranger was taken into the automobile.- Upon their arrival at an isolated alley two men sprang from the bushes, one with a revolver, and the other with an iron bar, and-those two were joined by the stranger. They, took from the silk dealer some $600 and a diamond-ring. Bernswerg recognized one of the men as Montagna, the defendant. Bernswerg was indicted with Montagna, but a severance was granted and Montagna was tried alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-8\">Our examination of the record satisfies us that there was no harmful error in the charge of the court, and that the verdict is amply supported by the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-9\">The conviction will therefore be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
