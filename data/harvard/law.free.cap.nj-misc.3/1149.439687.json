The first application merely says that relator \u201cmakes application for a theatre license. We propose to erect an up-to-date theatre with stores and office, 16-22 Palisade avenue, Englewood.\u201d This application, having been made before the relator was incorporated, and having been denied, a second application was made a few weeks later, and, after incorporation, saying merely that relator \u201cmakes application for a theatre license; said theatre to be erected on 16, 18, 20, 22 West Palisade avenue, Englewood, New Jersey.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-7\">The fee required by the ordinance was paid and returned when the second application was refused for reasons which do not clearly appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-8\">We have no brief for the respondents, and, as matters now stand, we are not definitely advised, either by the record or otherwise, as to the reason for the refusal. The building where the show is to hold forth apparently has not as j^et been erected, but the application is not for a permit for erection. It is, as we have stated, an application for a theatre license at a place in the city where it is proposed to erect a building.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1151\">*1151</page-number>In such state of uncertainty as to factual situation, the most that the relator can properly Jiope to obtain is an alternative writ of mandamus, and that will he awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
