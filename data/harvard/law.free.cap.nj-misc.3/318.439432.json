L. </em>1923, <em>p. </em>243) providing for the consolidation of adjoining municipalities- in the- same county.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The relator claims to be- the legal member o-f the board of co-uncilmen from the Third ward, and Abe-1 Bo-zzo claims- to-be such member. Abel Bozzo- has been recognized as such member, hence, the controversy. Bo-zzo- was elected at the general election held November 4th, 1924.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The relator seeks the intervention of this court by its writ of <em>mandamus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">He relies upon the case o-f <em>Leeds </em>v. <em>Atlantic City, </em>52 <em>N. J. L. </em>332, to sustain his position. Manifestly, that case does not help him, because the <em>prima facie </em>right o-f the relator to be admitted to the office of sergeant o-f police in Atlantic City was <em>res adjud&amp;cata. </em>His status has been previously determined by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">The writ of <em>mandamus </em>will not issue except where the act to he done is purely ministerial, .and the legal obligation to perform it is clear. <em>West Jersey Railroad, Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utility Board, </em>85 <em>N. J. L. </em>468; <em>affirmed, </em>87 <em>Id. </em>170.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">The title of an incumbent to- an office will not be directly passed upon by the- Supreme Court except in a <em>quo warranto </em>proceeding brought against the incumbent himself. <em>Bumstead </em>v. <em>Blair, </em>73 <em>N. J. L. </em>378. The application for a writ o-f <em>mandamus </em>is refused and the rule to show cause- discharged, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
