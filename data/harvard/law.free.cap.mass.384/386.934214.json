L. c. 266, \u00a7 60. We are not concerned here with the receipt of stolen video cassette tapes, but only with the receipt of the allegedly stolen material contained on those tapes. A Superior Court judge dismissed the indictments, and the Commonwealth appealed. See G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28E; Mass. R. Crim. P. 15 (a) (1), 378 Mass. 882 (1979). We granted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>parties\u2019 joint application for direct appellate review and now affirm the order dismissing the indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Each indictment alleged that the defendant received, purchased, and aided in the concealment of \u201ccertain intellectual property contained in and on two video cassette tapes of a movie entitled Star Wars.\u201d Each indictment further alleged that the intellectual property, which had a value in excess of $100, was the property of Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation, and that the defendants were aware that the property was stolen. We repeat that no claim is made that the video cassette tapes were themselves stolen property.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">In order to be guilty of the crime of receiving stolen goods, \u201c(1) one must buy, receive or aid in the concealment of property which has been stolen or embezzled, (2) knowing it to have been stolen.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donahue, </em>369 Mass. 943, 949, cert, denied, 429 U.S. 833 (1976). G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 60. Property which may be the subject of larceny, other than property which could be the subject of larceny at common law, is defined in G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 30 (2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Engleman, </em>336 Mass. 66, 69 (1957). The Commonwealth does not assert that the material on the cassettes was property of the character that could have been subject to larceny at common law. It does assert, however, that the allegedly stolen material is property which may be subject to an indictment under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>The Commonwealth points to Federal court opinions concerning 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314 (1976), which prohibits the transportation in interstate or foreign commerce of \u201cany goods, wares, merchandise, securities or money,\u201d of a value in excess of $5,000, known to be \u201cstolen, converted or taken by fraud.\u201d Those Federal court opinions treat the unauthorized act of duplicating copyrighted aggregations of sound or sight, or both, as the stealing, converting, or taking of \u201cgoods, wares [and] merchandise\u201d in violation of \u00a7 2314. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Drebin, </em>557 F.2d 1316, 1332 (9th Cir. 1977), rev\u2019g in part on other grounds, 572 F.2d 215 (9th Cir.), cert, denied, 436 U.S. 904 (1978) (films); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sam Goody, Inc., </em>506 F.Supp. 380, 391 (E.D.N.Y. 1981) (sound recording). Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Greenwald, </em>479 F.2d 320, 321-322 (6th Cir.), cert, denied, 414 U.S. 854 (1973) (trade secrets); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bottone, </em>365 F.2d 389, 393-394 (2d Cir.), cert, denied, 385 U.S. 974 (1966) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">We do not read the definition of \u201cproperty\u201d in G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 30 (2), as reaching the property interest that is alleged to have been stolen in this case. Certainly, the images and sounds captured on the cassette tapes are not within any of the items specified in \u00a7 30 (2). We have treated \u00a7 30 (2)\u2019s definition of property as all-inclusive, apart from items that were subject to larceny at common law. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Engleman, supra </em>at 69. Thus, we have not read the word \u201cproperty\u201d in \u00a7 30 (2) as broadly as the Federal courts have read the words \u201cgoods, wares [and] merchandise\u201d in \u00a7 2314. For example, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bottone, supra </em>at 393-394, held an intangible trade secret to be within \u00a7 2314, whereas <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Engleman, supra, </em>held that theft of a trade secret was not a violation of our larceny statute. See now, however, G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 60A, inserted by St. 1967, c. 817, \u00a7 2, concerning the knowing receipt of stolen trade secrets. We conclude that the intellectual property which appears on the cassette tapes is not \u201cproperty\u201d within the definition of property in G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 30 (2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>In light of our conclusion that the intellectual property appearing on the cassette tapes is not property within the meaning of the definition appearing in G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 30 (2), we need not consider the defendants\u2019 further argument that the Commonwealth\u2019s power to regulate conduct of the type alleged in these indictments is preempted by the supremacy clause of the Constitution of the United States, art. 6, cl. 2.

L. c. 266, \u00a7 143, inserted by St. 1973, c. 979, \u00a7 1, it is a crime knowingly to transfer, directly or indirectly, \u201cany sounds recorded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>on a phonograph record, disc, wire, tape, film or other article on which sounds are recorded, with intent to sell . . . without the consent of the owner\u201d or knowingly to sell such an article. This statute applies only to transfers of sound and does not make a crime of the knowing receipt of recorded sounds pirated by others. It does suggest, however, that the Legislature chose to deal with this problem apart from the definition of \u201cproperty\u201d for the purposes of larceny, just as it did with respect to the theft of trade secrets (see G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 60A, cited above).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b403-10\"> The copyright act specifically excepts from preemption the power of States to regulate \u201cactivities violating legal or equitable rights that are not equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright as specified\u201d in the copyright act. See 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 301(b)(3) (1976). We offer no opinion whether the Legislature is preempted from enacting a statute making a crime of the receipt of pirated intellectual property contained within motion picture films, phonographic records, or videotapes.
