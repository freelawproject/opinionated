The questions raised call for a construction of G. L. c. 120, \u00a7 20, which grants a right of appeal from a judgment confirming a Department of Youth Services extended commitment order. We hold that, by the terms of the statute, a juvenile is entitled on appeal to a new trial before a jury-of-six, and to a standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt that his release would endanger the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">In 1978, at the age of sixteen, the defendant was adjudicated a delinquent child pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 58.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court committed the defendant to the custody of the department, which placed him in the juvenile unit of a State hospital. In 1979, just before the defendant\u2019s eighteenth birthday, the department issued an order extending his commitment. As required by G. L. c. 120, \u00a7 17, the department applied for review by the original committing court, which confirmed the department\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">The defendant, pursuant to G. L. c. 120, \u00a7 20, appealed the confirmation judgment to the District Court jury session, and filed a demand for a jury trial. A judge sitting in jury session denied the defendant\u2019s demand and heard the case without a jury. Evidence at the hearing consisted of a psychological evaluation of the defendant, and testimony by a psychiatrist, members of the juvenile center staff, and the defendant. The judge found that the defendant had committed a number of assaults and batteries during the last six months of his detention. He concluded that the defendant\u2019s release would be \u201cphysically dangerous to the public because of his mental deficiency,\u201d and affirmed the judgment confirming the department\u2019s extended commitment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">The defendant filed notice of appeal in the Appeals Court, and we transferred the case sua sponte.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-10\">1. <em>Mootness. </em>The Commonwealth argues that we should dismiss this case as moot, because the defendant has already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>been released from the department\u2019s custody.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We believe, however, that despite his release the defendant has a stake in the outcome of this appeal. Therefore, we will decide the issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">A defendant convicted of crime faces a number of adverse consequences, apart from the punishment imposed by law. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>382 Mass. 387, 396 (1981). <em>Sibron </em>v. <em>New York, </em>392 U.S. 40, 55-58 (1968). <em>See Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Mimms, </em>434 U.S. 106, 108 n.3 (1977). If he appears as a witness in future criminal proceedings, his previous conviction may be used to impeach him. <em>Sibron </em>v. <em>New York, supra </em>at 55-56. <em>Commonwealth v. Jones, supra </em>at 396. See Rule 609 of the Proposed Mass. R. Evid. (July, 1980). If he is convicted of other crimes, the prior convictions may weigh against him in sentencing, and may subject him to punishment as a criminal recidivist. <em>Sibron </em>v. <em>New York, supra </em>at 55-56. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, supra </em>at 396. Recognizing these possibilities, we have held that an appellate court must vacate an erroneous conviction even when the correction will not relieve the defendant of time in prison. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, supra </em>at 395-397 (convictions vacated despite concurrent valid sentence). On the same principle, we believe that we should not dismiss a. criminal appeal simply because the defendant\u2019s sentence has expired. See <em>Sibron </em>v. <em>New York, supra </em>at 55-58. Cf. <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Parole Bd., </em>369 Mass. 701, 703-706 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">An adjudication concerning a juvenile is not, of course, a conviction of crime. See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 53; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>376 Mass. 632, 634-637 (1978); <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston </em>v. <em>Municipal Court of the Dorchester Dist., </em>374 Mass. 640, 666-667 (1978). The governing statutes minimize \u201ccollateral\u201d consequences by providing that records of delinquency or extended commitment proceedings are inadmissible against the juvenile in subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>criminal trials. G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 60. G. L. c. 120, \u00a7 21. This statutory protection does not, however, extend to subsequent sentencing proceedings; the Commonwealth would be free to place the defendant\u2019s extended commitment record before a sentencing judge in a future criminal matter. G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 60. G. L. c. 120, \u00a7 21. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>376 Mass. 632, 638-640 (1978).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Further, if the juvenile later appears as a State\u2019s witness in a criminal case, the defendant\u2019s right to confront and cross-examine witnesses may require admission of the juvenile\u2019s delinquency record as evidence of bias. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferrara, </em>368 Mass. 182,189 (1975). <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308 (1974). We consider these possible adverse consequences sufficient to justify our consideration of the defendant\u2019s postrelease appeal of his extended commitment order.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">In addition, the issue in this case, even if factually moot, might be \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Southern Pac. Terminal Co. </em>v. <em>ICC, </em>219 U.S. 498, 515 (1911); <em>Superintendent of Worcester State Hosp. </em>v. <em>Hagberg, </em>374 Mass. 271, 274 (1978); <em>Diafario </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>371 Mass. 545, 552 (1976). A juvenile subject to a continued commitment order must be released after two years have passed, unless a new order is issued, reviewed, and confirmed. G. L. c. 120, \u00a7 19. There are some indications that the present appeal might have been completed before the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>fendant\u2019s release if not for an excusable delay by the defendant\u2019s counsel.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nevertheless, there is a substantial likelihood that persons in the defendant\u2019s position will have difficulty in completing the appellate process before their release, and this reinforces our decision to hear and decide the present appeal. See <em>Commissioner of Correction </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>379 Mass. 255, 260-261 (1979); <em>First Nat'l Bank </em>v. <em>Haufler, </em>377 Mass. 209, 211 (1979); <em>Superintendent of Worcester State Hosp. </em>v. <em>Hagberg, </em>374 Mass. 271, 274 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">2. <em>Right to a jury trial. </em>The defendant asserts that he was entitled under G. L. c. 120, \u00a7 20, and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights to a jury trial on appeal of the order extending his commitment to the department\u2019s custody. We accept the statutory branch of the defendant\u2019s argument, and therefore we do not address his constitutional claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">An analysis of G. L. c. 120, \u00a7 20, which provides for appellate review of extended commitment orders, must begin with a description of the series of statutes to which \u00a7 20 belongs. Ordinarily, the department\u2019s custody of a delinquent juvenile terminates when the juvenile reaches age eighteen. G. L. c. 120, \u00a7 16. However, if the department believes that discharge would create a public danger, it may issue an order extending the juvenile\u2019s commitment. G. L. c. 120, \u00a7 17. Upon issuing such an order, the department must apply for review by the court that originally committed the juvenile to its care. <em>Id. </em>The court must then notify the juvenile of the department\u2019s action, and conduct a full hearing, at which the juvenile is entitled to counsel and an opportunity to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of evidence. G. L. c. 120, \u00a7 18. After the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>hearing, the court shall confirm the department\u2019s order if it finds \u201cthat discharge of the person to whom the order- applies would be physically dangerous to the public because of his mental or physical deficiency, disorder, or abnormality.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">At this point G. L. c. 120, \u00a7 20, the section upon which this appeal focuses, comes into play. Section 20 provides that a juvenile who contests the judgment of the District Court may appeal to a District Court jury session, and that the \u201cappeal shall be taken in the manner provided by law for appeal to the said session from judgments of a justice sitting without jury in criminal cases.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">In its natural sense, this language incorporates the statutes governing criminal appeals in the District Courts. Turning to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18, we find that a defendant who has waived a jury trial in the first instance and submitted to trial by a District Court judge may appeal and claim a new trial before a jury-of-six in the District Court jury session. <em>Id. Costarelli, petitioner, </em>378 Mass. 516, 517 (1979). See, in addition, G. L. c. 218, \u00a7\u00a7 26A, 27A. This legislative sequence strongly supports the defendant\u2019s claim. Further, we have interpreted a similar reference to normal criminal procedure in a related statutory context as a mandate for a jury trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>359 Mass. 386, 387-388 (1971). The statute at issue in <em>Thomas </em>authorized a juvenile adjudged delinquent by a District Court to appeal to Superior Court, and provided that the appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>should be \u201ctried and determined in like manner as appeals in criminal cases.\u201d G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 56, as amended through St. 1964, c. 308, \u00a7 1. We concluded that this language entitled the juvenile to a new trial before a jury in Superior Court. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra </em>at 388.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Miaskiewicz </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>380 Mass. 153, 156-157 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">The Commonwealth, however, contends that extended commitment, unlike delinquency adjudication, is a \u201cdispositional\u201d issue, analogous to sentencing. Therefore, in the Commonwealth\u2019s view, it is a matter within the exclusive province of the court, and should not be submitted to a jury. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 28, 29, 378 Mass. 898, 899 (1979). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marino, </em>254 Mass. 533, 536 (1926); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crapo, </em>212 Mass. 209, 210 (1912). To harmonize this position with \u00a7 20, the Commonwealth suggests that the statutory language incorporating District Court procedure in criminal appeals refers to <em>sentencing </em>procedure, cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>376 Mass. 632, 639 (1978); <em>A Juvenile, petitioner, </em>364 Mass. 531, 534-536, 538 (1974), and that the words \u201cjury session\u201d denote only the <em>forum </em>in which these procedures are to take place.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Although we agree with the Commonwealth that judges have a broad dispositional function under the juvenile statutes, see G. L. c. 119, \u00a7\u00a7 39G, 58, 61; <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston </em>v. <em>Municipal Court of the Dorchester Dist., </em>374 Mass. 640, 667 (1978); A <em>Juvenile </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>370 Mass. 272, 277-283 (1976); A <em>Juvenile, petitioner, supra </em>at 536-539, we believe that the Legislature intended that extended commitment be treated as a matter for independent determination rather than an extension of prior juvenile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>proceedings. \u201cJuvenile\u201d jurisdiction ends when a child reaches eighteen; the court in its juvenile session has no authority to commit a person over eighteen to the care of the department. G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 72. The provision for extended commitment appears in a separate chapter of the General Laws, and calls for a new determination of fact, independent from the original delinquency adjudication. The trier must find that, at the time of the extended commitment hearing, the person under consideration is dangerous to the public due to a mental or physical disorder. G. L. c. 120, \u00a7 18. In other contexts, the Legislature has entrusted similar issues to the discretion of judges sitting without juries, see G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 61 (transfer of juvenile cases to criminal docket); G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 8 (commitment of mentally ill persons); G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 6 (commitment of sexually dangerous persons); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nassar, </em>380 Mass. 908, 915-916 (1980); <em>Andrews, petitioner, </em>368 Mass. 468, 479 (1975), but when it has done so it has not provided for appeal to a jury session as it has in \u00a7 20. Compare G. L. c. 119, \u00a7\u00a7 391, 56 and G. L. c. 120, \u00a7 20, with G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 61, G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 9, and G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 6. Indeed, a provision for appeal to the jury session would have little practical meaning if read to require only the opinion of a second trial judge on a dispositional issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">We hold, therefore, that by the terms of G. L. c. 120, \u00a7 20, the defendant was entitled to appeal the judgment confirming the department\u2019s extended commitment order for trial before a jury-of-six in the District Court session. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment entered in jury session by a judge sitting without a jury. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. A <em>Juvenile (No. 2), ante </em>390, 393-394 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">3. <em>Standard of Proof. </em>The defendant also contends that his extended commitment could not be confirmed unless the State had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he suffered from a mental or physical disorder, and that his release would endanger the public.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In light of our conclusion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>the previous section of this opinion \u2014 that the Legislature intended procedure on appeal of an extended commitment to conform to procedure on appeal of an adult criminal conviction \u2014 the question of standard of proof can quickly be resolved in the defendant\u2019s favor. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is one of the most basic elements of our criminal process. <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 363 (1970). <em>Andrews, petitioner, </em>368 Mass. 468 (1975). We have often recognized that this fundamental standard applies not only to \u201ccriminal\u201d proceedings, but also to proceedings that bear a \u201ccivil\u201d or \u201cnonpunitive\u201d label, but are sufficiently analogous to determinations of guilt to require a high degree of certainty in findings of fact. <em>In re Winship, supra </em>at 365-366, 368 (opinion of the Court), 370-371 (Harlan, J., concurring). <em>Superintendent of Worcester State Hosp. </em>v. <em>Hagberg, </em>374 Mass. 271, 275-277 (1978). <em>Andrews, petitioner, supra </em>at 486-491. This is not to say that proof beyond a reasonable doubt is constitutionally required in every commitment proceeding; the Legislature retains some leeway to provide for protective or rehabilitative confinement based upon a lesser standard of proof. <em>Addington </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>441 U.S. 418, 433 (1979). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Travis, </em>372 Mass. 238, 251 (1977). Constitutional boundaries, however, are not at issue in this case. Under \u00a7 20, an extended commitment proceeding is \u2014 as we have explained \u2014 to be treated in like manner as a criminal conviction. Accordingly, we believe that the Legislature intended that grounds for extended commitment must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">The defendant also argues that he was entitled on equal protection grounds to a standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. We need not decide this constitutional issue in light of our holding that G. L. c. 120, \u00a7 20, mandates a standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>In sum, we hold that G. L. c. 120, \u00a7 20, entitles a person subject to a Department of Youth Services extended commitment order to appeal a District Court confirmation of that order for trial before a jury-of-six. We also conclude that to justify extended commitment, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that release would create a public danger, due to the subject\u2019s mental or physical disorder. Therefore, we vacate the judgment entered in jury session affirming the District Court judge\u2019s confirmation of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b799-11\"> The adjudication of delinquency was based on evidence that the defendant had committed assault and battery on members of his family. The defendant raises no objections here to the original proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b800-6\"> On the defendant\u2019s motion, the judge who had heard the defendant\u2019s appeal in jury session held a new hearing. He found that the defendant was no longer dangerous, and ordered his release.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b801-5\"> The defendant is currently facing criminal charges; seven days after his release from juvenile detention, he was arrested for burning of a motor vehicle and possession of a Molotov cocktail.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b801-6\">In <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Parole Bd., </em>369 Mass. 701, 703-704 (1976), we held that a defendant could not challenge a denial of early eligibility for parole after his release from prison. We noted, however, that denial of early parole may depend on \u201cthe seriousness of the underlying crime rather than . . . rehabilitative progress or suitability for parole,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 704, and concluded that the collateral consequences of such a decision were \u201cinsignificant,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 703. In contrast, an extended commitment order represents an independent judicial determination that the juvenile, at the time the order is issued, presents a threat to the public. G. L. c. 120, \u00a7\u00a7 17-20. It is not redundant of the original delinquency adjudication, and would be of significant interest to a sentencing judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b802-6\"> The defendant\u2019s appellate counsel was appointed in March, 1980, but was not notified of the appointment until November, 1980.
