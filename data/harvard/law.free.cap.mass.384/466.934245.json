The single jus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>tice reserved and reported ten questions to the full court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">A number of issues are raised. Both the statute and the executive order are challenged in their entirety as an inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>ference in labor negotiations in violation of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), and thereby in conflict with the supremacy clause of the United States Constitution, art. VI, cl. 2. Both are also said to be invalid because of the Federal constitutional protections contained in the privileges and immunities (art. IV, \u00a7 2, cl. 1), due process, contract, and commerce clauses. Analogous provisions in the Constitution of the Commonwealth are also invoked by the plaintiffs, chiefly arts. I, 10, and 12. The executive order alone is claimed to be an improper exercise of power under the \u201chome rule\u201d provisions of art. 2, as amended by art. 89, of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution, and as beyond the inherent power of the mayor under the city charter. So too the actions of the BRA are claimed to exceed the authority granted by G. L. c. 121A. Finally both G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 26, and the executive order are challenged in part as they apply to Federal funds. The plaintiffs contend that the Federal statutory and regulatory frameworks for the distribution of these funds forbid the imposition of residency provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">We must first consider those statutory arguments which would invalidate the challenged provisions. It is only if the statute and order survive this scrutiny that we need consider constitutional issues. Compare <em>School Comm. of Springfield </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>366 Mass. 315, 338 (1974) (Quirico, J., concurring), cert, denied, 421 U.S. 947 (1975), with <em>id. </em>at 339-350 (Tauro, C.J., addendum). In the questions before us, only affirmative answers to the questions concerning preemption under the NLRA (questions 3 and 6) would fully resolve the plaintiffs\u2019 claims without reaching a constitutional issue. Since we find for the defendants on that issue, we turn to the privileges and immunities clause of art. IV, \u00a7 2,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the commerce clause* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> of the United States Constitution, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>which dictate a decision in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Finally, we decline to answer question 8, which concerns the residents preference instituted by the BRA, both because we believe the agency may wish to reconsider its regulation in light of this opinion and because the issue has not been adequately argued before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">I. The Character of the Residents Preferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 26, provides an absolute preference for residents<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> of the Commonwealth in the positions described. There seems little dispute that a qualified resident of the Commonwealth, if available, must be hired for any job covered by \u00a7 26. Although the statute also contains a local preference, the Department of Labor and Industries has chosen not to enforce that provision because of concerns about its constitutionality.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The order of the mayor is somewhat broader in its application to all \u201cworker hours on a craft-by-craft basis,\u201d but rather than imposing an absolute preference it mandates that fifty percent of those hours must be contributed by workers who are residents of the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">To the extent that all workers are hired anew by contractors for every project, these provisions may have little impact on the structure of the industry or its functioning in interstate commerce. In differing degrees many subcontractors do hire for each project. Frequently, however, a contractor will have a regular work crew, particularly in certain specialized fields. If some members of a crew are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>not residents of the Commonwealth or of the city, it will be necessary that they be replaced or, alternatively, their employer may opt out of bidding on these projects. The defendants acknowledge that both results do occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">The goals of both G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 26, and the executive order are to lessen unemployment in the Commonwealth or in the city and to ensure that the expenditure of local funds results in maximum benefits to the locality where the monies are raised. As an additional reason for the mayor\u2019s order the city describes a desire to ensure adequate representation of city residents in construction union jobs and a lessening of racial tensions.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">II. Preemption and the National Labor Relations Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The plaintiffs suggest that the policy of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151 et seq. [1976]) preempts the residents preference contained in both the statute and executive order. In effect G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 26, and the order are claimed to be invalid as attempts to override or control substantive terms in agreements between unions and contractors. Neither the Commonwealth nor any of its subdivisions may act in a manner that frustrates Federal labor policy. States are forbidden to penalize practices which Congress and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) deem to be legitimate economic weapons. <em>Lodge 76, lnt\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Machinists </em>v. <em>Wisconsin Employment Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>427 U.S. 132 (1976) (State may not penalize union refusal to work overtime when such refusal was allowed under the NLRA); <em>San Diego Bldg. Trades Council </em>v. <em>Garmon, </em>359 U.S. 236 (1959) (State may not penalize picketing arguably protected under the NLRA even though the NLRB declines jurisdiction), nor may State law be used to dictate the outcome in an area of mandatory bargaining, <em>Local 24, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number><em>Int\u2019l Bhd. of Teamsters </em>v. <em>Oliver, </em>358 U.S. 283 (1959) (State antitrust laws may not be used to invalidate an agreement meant to protect negotiated wage scale).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">Here, however, it is difficult to imagine how the Commonwealth or the city is intruding into the negotiating process between contractors and unions. In essence, the plaintiffs argue that the Commonwealth may do nothing that influences any possible condition of a labor contract. This is far too broad a reading of preemption under the NLRA. See <em>Amalgamated Transit Union, Div. 819 </em>v. <em>Byrne, </em>568 F.2d 1025 (3d Cir. 1977) (en banc) (State did not violate NLRA by threatening to withdraw subsidies to private transportation companies which included unlimited cost of living increase provisions in their collective bargaining agreements). Additionally, in this particular instance, it is curious to contend that the negotiating process has been skewed in favor of either party when both unions and contractors are before this court opposing the residents preference. We therefore answer both parts of questions 3 and 6 in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">III. The Constitutional Provisions at Issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The privileges and immunities and commerce clauses act together to provide a free flow of individuals and business activities among the States. The former \u201cwas designed to insure to a citizen of State A who ventures into State B the same privileges which the citizens of State B enjoy,\u201d <em>Toomer </em>v. <em>Witsell, </em>334 U.S. 385, 395 (1948), while the latter serves as an embodiment of the assumption implicit in the Constitution that \u201cthe peoples of the several states must sink or swim together, and that in the long run prosperity and salvation are in union and not division.\u201d <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>G.A.F. Seelig, Inc., </em>294 U.S. 511, 523 (1935) (Cardozo, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Thus, while States are not prevented from favoring their citizens in certain circumstances, <em>Reeves, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stake, </em>447 U.S. 429 (1980) (State may favor its own citizens in selling cement from State-owned plant during shortage); <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>Fish &amp; Game Comm\u2019n, </em>436 U.S. 371 (1978) (States may charge nonresidents substantially higher fees for recreational hunting licenses), there are definite limita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>tions on the methods that may be used, <em>Philadelphia </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>437 U.S. 617, 627 (1978), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">IV. The Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Determining whether G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 26, violates the privileges and immunities clause requires a two-step analysis. First, is the right at stake \u201cfundamental\u201d ? See <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>Fish &amp; Game Comm\u2019n, </em>436 U.S. 371, 387 (1978). Compare <em>Ostrager </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Control, </em>99 Cal. App. 3d 1, 5 (1979) (participation in State compensation program for victims of crime not fundamental), with <em>State </em>v. <em>Nolfi, </em>141 N.J. Super. 528, 537-538 (1976) (out-of-State resident must be allowed to participate in pretrial diversion program for criminal defendants). Second, if the right is found to be fundamental, the discrimination challenged may be justified if there is a showing that nonresidents are a \u201cpeculiar source\u201d of an \u201cevil\u201d that the Legislature is seeking to remedy, <em>Hicklin </em>v. <em>Orbeck, </em>437 U.S. 518, 525 (1978), quoting from <em>Toomer </em>v. <em>Witsell, supra </em>at 398, or that there is a valid justification for the distinction other than the mere fact of nonresidency, <em>Hicklin, supra. </em>See, e.g., <em>Rubin </em>v. <em>Glaser, </em>83 N.J. 299, 305-306 (1980) (State may treat residents and nonresidents differently for some tax purposes, if such treatment bears a close relation to extra taxes paid by residents in other contexts). Accord, <em>Lung </em>v. <em>O\u2019Chesky, </em>94 N.M. 802, 804 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">A. <em>Fundamentality.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Initially the defendants contend that the employment at issue involves no fundamental interest and so the privileges and immunities clause is inapplicable. A certain surface plausibility is lent to this theory because the term \u201cfundamental\u201d has been used to describe several very different concepts in constitutional analysis. <em>Carchman </em>v. <em>Korman Corp., </em>456 F. Supp. 730, 738 &amp; n.9 (E.D. Pa. 1978). Note, Of Interests Fundamental and Compelling: The Emerging Constitutional Balance, 57 B.U. L. Rev. 462 (1977). Our attention is directed to eases that hold certain rights fundamental for purposes of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>rights which, therefore, can be restricted only upon the showing of a compelling State interest. See, e.g., <em>Shapiro </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>394 U.S. 618 (1969) (right to interstate travel); L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law \u00a7 16-10 (1978) (discussing fundamental nature of equal access to the ballot). Admittedly, employment opportunities, whether public or private, have not been given this extraordinarily high level of protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">For purposes of art. IV, \u00a7 2, however, from the earliest incorporation of the notion of \u201cfundamentality,\u201d the clause has been thought to protect the \u201cright of a citizen of one state to pass through, or to reside in any other state, for purposes of trade, agriculture, professional pursuits, or otherwise,\u201d <em>Corfield </em>v. <em>Coryell, </em>6 F. Cas. 546, 552 (C.C.E.D. Pa. 1823) (Washington, Circuit Justice). This position has been consistently followed. See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Bolton, </em>410 U.S. 179, 200 (1973); <em>Ward v. Maryland, </em>79 U.S. (12 Wall.) 418, 430 (1870). Indeed, reconciling the holding in <em>Baldwin, supra, </em>which allowed a substantially higher licensing fee to be charged to out-of-State hunters, with the holding in <em>Toomer </em>v. <em>Witsell, supra, </em>which negated a substantial differential in license fees for commercial shrimp fishing, is possible because the Court in <em>Baldwin, supra, </em>recognized a constitutional difference between recreational activity and the pursuit of a livelihood.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See Note, The Privileges and Immunities Clause: A Reaffirmation of Fundamental Rights, 33 U. Miami L. Rev. 691, 693 (1979). Limiting a particular kind of work opportunity because of a person\u2019s place of residence does impinge upon a \u201cfundamental\u201d right and thus satisfies the first element of a privileges and immunities analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">B. <em>Possible Sources of Justification for the Discrimination.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\"><em>Hicklin </em>v. <em>Orbeck, </em>437 U.S. 518 (1978), is controlling on this issue because it establishes a clear rule that a State may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>not use its control over a resource to create an absolute employment preference for its own residents. There, Alaska had attempted to utilize its control over oil leases on State-owned land to require that Alaska residents be given absolute preference in hiring not only in the oil fields, but also in any activity that benefited from the ripple effect of the energy boom. <em>Id. </em>at 531. The Supreme Court rejected Alaska\u2019s claim that ownership of the land in question gave the same authority that any owner might have to place conditions on the lease or sale of a resource. <em>Id. </em>at 528. A significant factor in the Court\u2019s holding was that no evidence was presented that nonresidents were a particular source of Alaskan unemployment. <em>Id. </em>at 526. Additionally, the statute was suspect because it swept more broadly than necessary to achieve the goal of increased training and employment of Alaska residents, an end better served by a preference aimed at the unemployed or those in training programs.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Id. at 527-528. Since <em>Hicklin </em>forbids the use of State control over a resource to force an absolute preference in hiring by a private contractor, the residents preference provisions of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 26, must fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">The defendants would distinguish <em>Hicklin </em>on two bases.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">First, that the regulation at issue merely protects the use of a limited resource (jobs), restricting them to State residents and second, by analogy to certain commerce clauses, that as a market participant it may act unfettered by the restrictions of the privileges and immunities clause. See Reeves, <em>Inc. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number><em>Stake, </em>447 U.S. 429 (1980); <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Alexandria Scrap Corp., </em>426 U.S. 794 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">1. <em>Limited resources. </em>There may be a suggestion in older cases that when a State-controlled resource is limited, a preference can be given to residents. See <em>Toomer </em>v. <em>Witsell, supra </em>at 397-398. But there must be some evidence that the services or resources, assuming they involve fundamental rights, are overburdened. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Bolton, </em>410 U.S. 179, 200 (1973). The defendants point to a high level of Statewide unemployment. <em>Hicklin, supra, </em>however, clearly rejects such an argument without a clear demonstration that out-of-State residents are a peculiar source of high unemployment. <em>Id. </em>at 526. Such a showing is not made on the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">2. <em>Acting as a market participant. </em>The defendants\u2019 second contention is that a residents preference in hiring for construction financed by public funds is substantially different from a preference based on the fortuitous location of a natural resource within a State\u2019s borders. The Commonwealth would thus turn to <em>Hughes, supra, </em>and <em>Reeves, supra, </em>in determining the extent to which a State, acting as a purchaser of goods and services, is exempt from the restrictions of the privileges and immunities clause.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">The Commonwealth is correct that the commerce clause does not prevent a State from preferring resident business in purchasing goods, see <em>Hughes, supra </em>at 810, or services, <em>American Yearbook Co. </em>v. <em>Askew, </em>339 F. Supp. 719, 723 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>(M.D. Fla.) (three-judge court), aff\u2019d mem., 409 U.S. 904 (1972), or in the distribution of State-produced materials in a shortage situation, <em>Reeves, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stake, supra </em>at 446-447. One major weakness in such an analogy is that in none of the cases cited was the use of the State\u2019s market power extended beyond granting an initial contract or a first sale. The commerce clause cases suggest that Alaska might quite properly have preferred its own residents in granting initial leases on its oil land, but <em>Hicklin, supra, </em>leaves no question that the extension of this power to favor absolutely all State residents in employment was unacceptable. Therefore, the statute before us cannot stand. See <em>Salla </em>v. <em>County of Monroe, </em>48 N.Y.2d 514 (1979) (overturning on privileges and immunities grounds a New York statute nearly identical to G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 26, as enforced). We thus respond \u201cYes\u201d to the first issue raised in question 2. We need not consider the additional issues raised therein, nor need we answer question 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">V. The Executive Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">A. <em>Privileges and Immunities.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The invalidity of the residents preference contained in the statute does not necessarily dictate a similar result with regard to the mayoral order. The plaintiffs contend that the same privileges and immunities analysis should be applied, but neither on its face, nor in fact, can the order be said to aim solely, or chiefly, at out-of-State residents. The preference is for inhabitants of the city, and its \u201cnegative\u201d effect is felt in significant part by other citizens of the Commonwealth, as well as by residents of other States. In such circumstances it may be more difficult to find a violation of the privileges and immunities clause because the discrimination adversely affects citizens of the Commonwealth as well.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> But see <em>Construction &amp; Gen. Laborers Local 563 </em>v. <em>St. Paul, </em>270 Minn. 427, 431 (1965) (invalidating, partially on privileges and immunities grounds, a city ordinance re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>quiring contractors on public building projects to hire only residents of the county in which the city was located).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">B. <em>The Commerce Clause.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The commerce clause, however, presents a clear obstacle to the city\u2019s order. Neither party would, we think, seriously dispute the proposition that an attempt by the city to apply the regulations contained in the order to all private construction would fall to such a challenge. Simple economic protectionism triggers a \u201cvirtually <em>per se </em>rule of invalidity.\u201d <em>Philadelphia </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>437 U.S. 617, 624 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The key question is whether the exception for a State (or one can safely say a municipality) as a market participant, discussed <em>supra, </em>serves to protect the mayoral order. In addition, we must consider our decisions and those of other courts which have held that in at least certain kinds of direct hiring, a municipality may employ only residents or may give preference to residents. See <em>Milton </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>365 Mass. 368 (1974); <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Philadelphia Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>424 U.S. 645 (1976); <em>Wardwell </em>v. <em>Board of Educ. of the City School Dist. of Cincinnati, </em>529 F.2d 625 (6th Cir. 1976); <em>Detroit Police Officers Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Detroit, </em>385 Mich. 519 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">We perceive, however, three key distinctions between the actions upheld in the cases cited by the defendants and the mayoral order. First, given the statement of agreed facts, there is no doubt that the implementation of the mayor\u2019s order will have a significant impact on those firms which engage in specialized areas of construction and employ permanent works crews composed of out-of-State residents. The municipal hiring cases are quite different since they affect the permanent domicil of employees rather than discouraging the interstate activities of construction firms. Second, the record indicates that a significant percentage of the funds affected by the order are received from Federal sources. Thus, it is inaccurate to describe the preference as a mere use of city-raised funds to further local interest. The analysis in <em>Reeves, supra, </em>which the city cites in defense of the executive order, is distinguishable on this ground. There, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>the concrete plant operated by South Dakota was an example of State-raised revenues being expended with a genuine risk of failure, the cost of which would have been borne by the State. The Court of Appeals of New York in <em>Salla, supra </em>at 524-525, found this element nearly definitive in justifying the invalidation of New York\u2019s residents preference in the awarding of public construction contracts. We do not go so far, but the presence or absence of substantial funds from nonlocal sources is at the very least an important factor in determining whether the <em>Reeves </em>decision is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Finally, as in <em>Hicklin, supra, </em>there is a broadly drawn statute which sweeps far wider than merely favoring unemployed or underemployed local residents. Although <em>Reeves, supra, </em>does indicate that a sympathetic reading under the commerce clause should be given to State or local action in a proprietary capacity, it is doubtful that the city is acting in its proprietary capacity in all the activities affected by the executive order. Even if this were so, the extensive preference for local residents contained in the executive order cannot come within the exception outlined by <em>Reeves </em>because it sweeps so broadly. In <em>Reeves, </em>the existence of a genuine shortage of concrete necessitated some form of rationing. The State\u2019s choice of favoring its own citizens was a rational means of allocation which recognized the special interests of local taxpayers. The executive order before us establishes a strict numerical requirement which is not at all targeted to the legitimate interests which the city has asserted.

Is the application of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 26, to construction projects involving Federal assistance invalid because it is in conflict with the Federal statutes (and rules and regulations derived therefrom) authorizing such assistance and/or is such application of the statute invalid under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">\u201c2. Does G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 26, conflict with the privileges and immunities clause, the due process clause, the equal protection clause, the contract clause and the commerce clause of the United States Constitution, and does it conflict with Articles I, X, and XII of the Massachusetts Constitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">\u201c3. Does G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 26, conflict with the obligations of the plaintiffs under the National Labor Relations Act, and is it therefore invalid under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">\u201c4. Is the application of the residency aspects of Executive Order to construction projects involving Federal assistance invalid because in conflict with the federal statutes (and rules and regulations derived therefrom) authorizing such assistance and/or is such application of the Executive Order invalid under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">\u201c5. Does the Executive Order, by establishing a residents\u2019 preference, conflict with the privileges and immunities clause, the due process clause, the equal protection clause, the contract clause and the commerce clause of the United States Constitution, and does it conflict with Article I, Article [X] and Article XII of the Massachusetts Constitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">\u201c6. Do the residency aspects of Executive Order conflict with the obligation of the plaintiffs under the National Labor Relations Act, and is it therefore invalid under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b483-13\">\u201c7. Are the residency aspects of Executive Order invalid under Section 6 or Section 7(5) of Article 89 of the amendments to the Constitution of Massachusetts, and/or G. L. c. 43B, \u00a7 13 (the Home Rule Procedures Act)?</p>\n<p id=\"b483-14\">\u201c8. Does the BRA violate the provisions of G. L. c. 121A by conditioning approval of application for tax status under that Chapter upon an applicant\u2019s acceptance of Section 8 of the BRA\u2019s \u2018Rules and Regulations Governing Chapter 121A Projects in the City of Boston\u2019?</p>\n<p id=\"b483-15\">\u201c9. Are the residency aspects of the Executive Order invalid as beyond the inherent power of the Mayor under the City Charter?</p>\n<p id=\"b483-16\">\u201c10. Is the conditioning of a developer\u2019s application for a UDAG [Urban Development Action Grant] upon his agreement to abide by the residency aspects of the Executive Order in conflict with 42 U.S.C. sec. 5301 <em>et seq. </em>and/or is such conditioning invalid under the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b484-6\"> Article IV, \u00a7 2, cl. 1, of the United States Constitution reads as follows: \u201cThe Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b484-7\"> Article I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3, of the United States Constitution, the commerce clause, reads: \u201cThe Congress shall have Power ...

L. c. 149, \u00a7 26.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b486-7\"> The city states that if this action came to trial, evidence would be presented to demonstrate that some members of Boston\u2019s nonminority population resented attempts to ensure certain minimal levels of minority and female employment on construction projects. The fifty percent quota was thus established in part to ensure that all segments of the city\u2019s population received some of the jobs, thereby alleviating any hostility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b489-8\"> The degree to which \u201clearned professions\u201d may present a different situation is not now before us and we express no opinion on that point except to note that the issue is one on which there is substantial debate. See generally Note, A Constitutional Analysis of State Bar Residency Requirements Under the Interstate Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV, 92 Harv. L. Rev. 1461 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b490-6\"> It is not totally clear how closely a statute must match means and ends once a substantial State interest in discriminatory treatment has been identified. <em>Austin </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>420 U.S. 656, 663 (1975), in analyzing art. IV, \u00a7 2, cl. 1, as applied to tax matters, describes \u201ca standard of review substantially more rigorous\u201d than that usually applied to State tax distinctions. This has been compared to the intermediate scrutiny apparently applied in cases dealing with illegitimacy and alienage. See Note, A Constitutional Analysis of State Bar Residency Requirements Under the Interstate Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV, 92 Harv. L. Rev. 1461, 1479 (1979); Note, The Privileges and Immunities Clause: A Reaffirmation of Fundamental Rights, 33 U. Miami L. Rev. 691, 698-699 (1979). We need not determine the exact standard of review required since we believe <em>Hicklin </em>v. <em>Orbeck, </em>437 U.S. 518 (1978), is controlling on these facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b491-7\"> Neither party discussed to any substantial degree several older decisions upholding G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 26, and similar statutes against challenges based on the exclusion of aliens from public construction employment. See <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Lynn, </em>223 Mass. 109 (1916) (upholding G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 26, against a challenge from Massachusetts residents with foreign citizenship); <em>Crane </em>v. <em>New York, </em>239 U.S. 195 (1915); <em>Heim </em>v. <em>McCall, </em>239 U.S. 175 (1915). The holdings of these cases are at best questionable in light of more recent decisions dealing with constitutional protections for aliens. See generally Note, A Dual Standard for State Discrimination Against Aliens, 92 Harv. L. Rev. 1516 (1979). In any case, <em>Hicklin, supra </em>at 531 n.15, indicates that <em>Heim </em>and <em>Crane </em>have no weight as precedents in construing art. IV, \u00a7 2, of the United States Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b492-8\"> We do not reach the question whether such discrimination is contrary to the Massachusetts Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
