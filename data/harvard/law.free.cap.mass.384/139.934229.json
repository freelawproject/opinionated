It furnished coverage for property damage, general liability, and automobiles. The policy was in force at 2:03 p.m. on June 15, 1974, when the burglar alarm was activated at the plaintiffs store. Police and alarm company personnel arrived on the scene at approximately 2:42 p.m. The judge found that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>plaintiff s president and one of its employees had closed and locked the plaintiffs store at 1 p.m. on June 15,1974. In early July, when the owner first learned the alarm had been actuated, an inventory was taken. Ultimately, the judge found for the plaintiff in the amount of the inventory loss, which he determined to be $19,380, plus costs. This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">The plaintiff had purchased burglary coverage. The policy defines burglary as follows: \u201c \u2018Burglary\u2019 means the felonious abstraction of insured property: (a) from within the premises by a person making felonious entry therein by actual force and violence, of which force and violence there are visible marks made by tools, explosives, electricity or chemicals upon, or physical damage to, the exterior of the premises at the place of such entry; (b) from within a showcase or show window outside the premises by a person making felonious entry into such showcase or show window by actual force and violence, of which force and violence there are visible marks thereon; or (c) from within the premises by a person making felonious exit therefrom by actual force and violence as evidenced by visible marks made by tools, explosives, electricity or chemicals upon, or physical damage to, the interior of the premises at the place of such exit.\u201d The judge found that \u201cthere were no visible marks of entry or exit by tools, explosives, electricity or chemicals or physical damage to the entry or exit.\u201d Therefore, there could be no recovery under burglary coverage. See <em>Shattuck &amp; Jones, Inc. </em>v. <em>Travelers Indem. Co., </em>323 Mass. 146, 147 (1948). It is the plaintiff s burden to prove that its loss was within the description of the risks covered. <em>Tumblin </em>v. <em>American Ins. Co., </em>344 Mass. 318, 320 (1962). The reason for the visible marks restriction is to protect insurers from \u201cinside jobs.\u201d 10 G. Couch, Insurance, \u00a7 42:129 (2d ed. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-31\">The plaintiff presses the argument that the trial judge read the policy as providing coverage for theft, in addition to burglary coverage. The judge\u2019s findings and conclusions do not include his reasons for finding for the plaintiff. If the plaintiff is correct in its assumption of the judge\u2019s basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>for recovery, the judge made a clearly erroneous ruling. The policy specifies the plaintiff s purchase of burglary coverage but not coverage for theft. The relevant provisions of the policy are reproduced in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">There is no merit to the plaintiff s claim that the policy is sufficiently ambiguous to permit us to read \u201ctheft\u201d coverage into the contract between the parties. Before we can apply the settled principles of law that any obscurity or vagueness must be construed against the defendant, see <em>Slater </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity </em>&amp; <em>Guar. Co., </em>379 Mass. 801, 804 (1980), we must conclude that there is an ambiguity. We are unable to do so. Rare, indeed, is the insurance policy which permits easy reading. The language is generally forbidding, if not esoteric. However, as insurance policies go, the one under review is reasonably clear in this respect. We have read those sections of the policy which define and limit \u201ctheft,\u201d but they do not solve the threshold problem of the coverage purchased by the plaintiff. In short, the plaintiff did not buy \u201ctheft\u201d coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Next, the plaintiff asks us to sustain the judgment below because of its \u201creasonable expectation\u201d of coverage for this type of loss. The plaintiff concedes that no Massachusetts case can be found to support this position. It appears that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>the trial judge did not rely on this theory. We are not prepared to make this the first case in which this court adopts such an approach to the purchase of insurance. In any event, the testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s president that it was his understanding that the \u201c[cjoverage was complete fire, theft and liability insurance\u201d falls fatally short of evidence to support the plaintiff\u2019s claim of \u201creasonable expectation\u201d of coverage for this loss. Even if we were to adopt the theory of reasonable expectation, the plaintiff would not prevail. In the Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 237, Comment f (Tent. Draft Nos. 1-7, 1973), the following description of \u201creasonable expectation\u201d appears: \u201cAlthough customers typically adhere to standardized agreements and are bound by them without even appearing to know the standard terms in detail, they are not bound to unknown terms which are beyond the range of reasonable expectation. A debtor who delivers a check to his creditor with the amount blank does not authorize the insertion of an infinite figure. Similarly, a party who adheres to the other party\u2019s standard terms does not assent to a term if the other party has reason to believe that the adhering party would not have accepted the agreement if he had known that the agreement contained the particular term. Such a belief or assumption may be shown by the prior negotiations or inferred from the circumstances. Reason to believe may be inferred from the fact that the term is bizarre or oppressive, from the fact that it eviscerates the non-standard terms explicitly agreed to, or from the fact that it eliminates the dominant purpose of the transaction. The inference is reinforced if the adhering party never had an opportunity to read the term, or if it is illegible or otherwise hidden from view. This rule is closely related to the policy against unconscionable terms and the rule of interpretation against the draftsman.\u201d There is nothing in the record before us to bring this case within the sweep of this language.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Equally without merit and authority are the plaintiff\u2019s arguments based on an implied warranty, see the Uniform Commercial Code \u2014 G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-315, and a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>sumer violation, G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2. An attentive reading of the transcript fails to reveal any evidence to support these arguments. Further, the warranty section of the Uniform Commercial Code on which the plaintiff relies, at least by way of analogy, applies only \u201cto transactions in goods.\u201d G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-102, as appearing in St. 1957, c. 765, \u00a7 1. The term \u201cgoods\u201d is not sufficiently protean to include an insurance policy. See G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-105 (1). The defendant\u2019s conduct does not offend either the principles of unconscionability recognized at common law (see <em>Hodge </em>v. <em>Mackintosh, </em>248 Mass. 181, 184-186 [1924]), or provisions not entirely dissimilar, codified in G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-302.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">\n<em>Judgment for defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b155-7\">\u201c3.

The plaintiff purchased a \u201cStore-owners 700\u201d policy from the defendant through its agent. This policy purported on its face to provide coverage for (1) personal property damage, (2) general liability, and (3) crime, specifically \u201cburglary.\u201d The word \u201cburglary\u201d is defined in later pages of the multipage policy to require \u201cvisible marks\u201d before recovery might be had.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The fact of loss is not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">The trial judge found there were no \u201cvisible marks\u201d of entry or exit yet found for plaintiff without further explanation in the written findings and rulings. This court now sets aside that finding for reasons which seem to me to have little relevance to what occurred at trial. While the court\u2019s opinion discusses the possibility that the judge may have thought plaintiffs had theft coverage, the judge\u2019s findings do not mention that theory. Additionally, plaintiff submitted extensive requests for findings of fact and rulings of law, none of which are based on a theory of \u201ctheft\u201d coverage. Those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>requests reflected instead alternative theories of recovery in which the reasonable expectations of the plaintiff as to the coverage he had secured played a prominent part.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>judge made no explicit findings under this theory, but it appears that his findings were based on the theory of reasonable expectations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Despite this state of the record, the court now concludes as to the issue of reasonable expectations that \u201c[i]t appears that the trial judge did not rely on this theory.\u201d <em>Supra </em>at 141-142. This conclusion of the court is warranted neither by the record nor by the evidence adduced at trial. In my view, this conclusion is unjust to the trial judge as well as to the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">It is not apparent which of five premises of law advanced by trial counsel was the basis for the judgment of the judge. I would agree that the judge erred if he relied on the language of the insurance policy and concluded that the plaintiff had theft coverage. I do not believe he did so. I would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>also agree that a claim based on G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2, is without merit here, <em>supra </em>at 142-143, because the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that he followed the procedural requisites of that statute. See <em>Whitinsville Plaza, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kotseas, </em>378 Mass. 85, 100 (1979); <em>Slaney </em>v. <em>Westwood Auto, Inc., </em>366 Mass. 688, 691, 704 (1975). There were, however, three other possible bases for this judgment, viz., the reasonable expectations doctrine, the unconscionability of the liability exclusion, or the breach of an implied warranty of fitness. See <em>C &amp; J Fertilizer, Inc. </em>v. <em>Allied Mut. Ins. Co., </em>227 N.W.2d 169 (Iowa 1975), and authorities cited. Cf. <em>Avco Installment Sales Co. </em>v. <em>Edge, </em>83 Misc. 2d 1011, 1018 (N.Y. Civ. Ct. 1975). While I concur that there is little or no support in the record for the last theory, I feel that the court pays short shrift to the claim of reasonable expectations and the notions of unconscionability inherent therein. The Iowa court has succinctly stated this doctrine in these terms: \u201cThe objectively reasonable expectations of applicants and intended beneficiaries regarding the terms of insurance contracts will be honored even though painstaking study of the policy provisions would have negated those expectations.\u201d <em>Rodman </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>208 N.W.2d 903, 906 (Iowa 1973). Professor Williston notes that unconscionability, though elusive of any single definition, lurks in \u201c[t]he use of fine-print clauses negating the reasonable expectations of the nondrafting party.\u201d 15 S. Williston, Contracts \u00a7 17 63A, at 215 (3d ed. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">It is patently inconsistent for this court to acknowledge on the one hand that the doctrine lacks precedent in our case law and at the same time to declare that the evidence on record falls short of a reasonable expectation standard. The majority, quoting \u00a7 237 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts, choose to ignore the clear parallel between this case and the Restatement: \u201cSimilarly, a party who adheres to the other party\u2019s standard terms does not assent to a term if the other party has reason to believe that the adhering party would not have accepted the agreement if he had known that the agreement contained the particular term. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Such a belief or assumption may be shown by the prior negotiations or inferred from the circumstances.\u201d Also, \u201c[r]eason to believe may be inferred from the fact that the term . . . eliminates the dominant purpose of the transaction.\u201d <em>Supra </em>at 142. Restatement (Second) of Contracts, Comment f, at 541 (Tent. Draft Nos. 1-7, 1973). The evidence here was that the plaintiff expected \u201ccomprehensive coverage,\u201d having been assured of such coverage by the insurer\u2019s agent. The interpretation of the circumstances of the plaintiff\u2019s entering the contract are highly material under the general principle that the intent and reasonable expectations of the parties govern the construction of insurance contracts. <em>Ayres </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co. of America, </em>602 F.2d 1309 (9th Cir. 1979). See 12 G.J. Couch, Insurance \u00a7 45:5, at 107 (2d ed. 1964) (basic guide to insurance contract construction is that \u201cparties apparently intended there should be effective coverage with respect to a particular kind or kinds of risk\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The Restatement informs us that \u201ccourts in construing and applying a standardized contract seek to effectuate the reasonable expectations of the average member of the public who accepts it.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 237, Comment e, at 540 (Tent. Draft Nos. 1-7 1973). Cf. <em>Ayres, supra </em>at 1313 (\u201cthe exclusion fails only if the insured can reasonably believe [burglary] is not excluded in light of what is publicly known of such exclusions\u201d). Here, the judge found the plaintiff complied with the insurer\u2019s requirement that he install a burglar alarm. As soon as he received notice of the alarm\u2019s activation he notified the insurer. These facts, along with the agent\u2019s precontract assurances, bespeak the plaintiff s reasonable expectation that if the alarm was activated and a loss of inventory occurred, which was otherwise unexplainable, the loss was covered by the burglary provisions of his policy. The issue of reasonable expectation and the unconscionability of defeating those expectations by obscure exclusionary language was adequately raised in the plaintiff\u2019s trial brief requesting findings and rulings, and by the evidence at trial. If the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>did utilize these theories in reaching his conclusion, then the question of the plaintiff s reasonable expectation has been placed squarely before us. Rather than put our own gloss on the unclear rulings of the judge, I would remand for a more specific statement of the reasons underlying the judgment. I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b157-9\"> See the language of the policy quoted in the court\u2019s opinion, <em>supra </em>at 140.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Plaintiffs proposed findings of fact were, inter alia, that: \u201c(1) The plaintiff performed and complied with all conditions precedent to its recovery under the said policy. ...

(3) The objectively reasonable expectations of applicants and insured entities regarding the terms of insurance contracts will be honored even though painstaking study of policy provisions would have negated those expectations. <em>Rodman </em>v. <em>State Farm Mutual Ins.

(5) In light of the broad language of the defendant\u2019s insurance policy as contrasted with the exclusions buried in the end of the policy under the heading \u2018Additional or Amended Definitions\u2019 and other conduct by the defendant, the limitations of said insurance policy upon which the defendant seeks to rely are unconscionable and unenforceable as a matter of law. <em>C &amp; J Fertilizer, supra, </em>at 180, and cases and authorities cited therein; Mass.

Having found there were no \u201cvisible marks\u201d of entry or exit, he also found: \u201c1. As a condition to have the insurance policy written covering his store, the plaintiff was required to have an \u2018UL\u2019 approved alarm system installed; and after the installation by the American Protective Service, the agent for the defendant approved the installation. 2. On Saturday, June 15, 1974, Herbert Kline, president of Markline Company, and another employee named Kyler Bloom closed and locked the store at 1:00 p.m. and exited the front door. 3. On Monday, June 17, 1974, Herbert Kline arrived at the store between 8:30 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. and observed there was not as much inventory in the same location in the back hall as he remembered to be there on June 15. The inventory consisted of calculators which were individual [sic] boxed and there were four calculators banded together in a 20\" by 4\" container. On June 15 he observed approximately two hundred banded boxes stacked, but on June 17th there weren\u2019t as many and he did not know why there appeared to be less. 4. Later in early July, the monthly report from the alarm company was received indicating that the alarm had been activated on June 15th in the afternoon. Herbert Kline notified Albert Kline and the two of them conducted an inventory. This inventory consisted of examining all sales slips, returns and purchases from the commencement of business to the date of the inventory. The prior inventories, dated January 30, 1974, and April 30,1974, indicated no items were missing. ... 6. As a result of the inventory conducted by Herbert Kline and Albert Kline, a loss of $19,380.00 was calculated. 7. Mr. Albert Kline, the insurance agent for Travelers, told Herbert Kline that the police had been notified by the alarm company and that was sufficient for the policy conditions.
