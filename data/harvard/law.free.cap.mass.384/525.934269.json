L. c. 268A). A judge of the Superi- or Court reported the case to the Appeals Court on the parties\u2019 agreement as to \u201cthe material facts.\u201d We granted the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>tiff\u2019s request for direct appellate review. We conclude that declaratory relief is not appropriate in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The defendant was one of three members of the West Springfield board of selectmen at the time the complaint was filed and at the time the case was reported to the Appeals Court. We were advised at oral argument that the defendant is no longer a member of the board of selectmen of West Springfield. The selectmen serve as the local licensing authority with respect to alcoholic beverage licenses and the local regulation of licensed sellers of alcoholic beverages. See, e.g., G. L. c. 138, \u00a7\u00a7 12, 14, 15, 23. As such, the selectmen are concerned with the granting and transfer of liquor licenses and with disciplinary proceedings concerning holders of local alcoholic beverage licenses. The defendant was and is the sales manager of a wholesale liquor company in West Springfield, engaged in the distribution of beer and wine. The statement of agreed facts provides no information concerning the extent of the involvement of the defendant or his employer in sales to, or in the solicitation of business from, holders of alcoholic beverage licenses in West Springfield. Nor does the statement of agreed facts show the extent, if any, to which the defendant participated as a selectman in matters involving alcoholic beverage licenses and the holders of those licenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The circumstances of this case do not permit us to deal with questions concerning the defendant\u2019s duties and obligations under the conflict of interest law. As we have noted, the defendant is no longer a member of the board of selectmen and the facts agreed to by the parties are sparse. The district attorney has not asserted that the defendant has violated any provision of the conflict of interest law. He has merely alleged in his complaint that the defendant may be in violation of G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 19 (a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and portions of G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>c. 268A, \u00a7 23.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In his brief, the district attorney repeats that the defendant may have violated these statutes. He further suggests that, even if the defendant were to disqualify himself from some or all matters involving alcoholic beverage licenses, there might nevertheless be a problem under subsections <em>(e) </em>and (/) of \u00a7 23. The assertion of possibilities does not present a dispute between the parties, and an actual controversy is essential to the granting of declaratory relief. G. L. c. 231 A, \u00a7 1. <em>See Department of Community Affairs </em>v. <em>Massachusetts State College Bldg. Auth., </em>378 Mass. 418, 422-423 (1979); <em>Bunker Hill Distrib., Inc. </em>v. <em>District Attorney for the Suffolk </em>Dist., 376 Mass. 142, 144 (1978), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Because G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 19 <em>(a), </em>is a criminal statute and the plaintiff is responsible for prosecuting criminal violations, the question of the defendant\u2019s violation of \u00a7 19 <em>(a), </em>if</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>properly presented, would not be moot. As a selectman, the defendant was a \u201cmunicipal employee\u201d subject to the restrictions of \u00a7 19. G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 1 (g). We have, however, no indication that the defendant, acting as a selectman, participated in a particular matter in which he or his employer had a financial interest. One can speculate that the defendant\u2019s involvement, if any, or potential involvement in various matters as a selectman might have affected the willingness or ability of license holders to do business with the defendant\u2019s employer. It has been suggested, however, that the words \u201cfinancial interest\u201d in \u00a7 19 <em>(a) </em>must have a restrictive meaning because the words \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d do not appear in \u00a7 19 <em>(a), </em>but do appear in other sections of G. L. c. 268A (see, e.g., \u00a7 20 [a]). R. Braucher, Conflict of Interest in Massachusetts, in Perspectives of Law, Essays for Austin Wakeman Scott 3, 24-25 (1964). Of course, a selectman in such a situation might choose to disqualify himself from participation in such a matter, quite apart from any requirement of law that he do so. In the case of disqualification, the remaining members of the board could properly deal with the matter. See <em>Selectmen of Barnstable </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>373 Mass. 708, 719 (1977).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 4We do not have a record sufficient to determine whether the defendant in any respect violated \u00a7 19 <em>(a). </em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">As to the standards of conduct set forth in \u00a7 23, the stated remedy for any violation of those standards is that such \u201cappropriate administrative action as is warranted may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>taken by the appropriate constitutional officer or by the head of a . . . municipal agency.\u201d The district attorney appears to have no role in relation to selectmen under \u00a7 23. The other members of a board of selectmen are appropriate parties to invoke the provisions of \u00a7 23 as to another member of the board. See <em>Selectmen of Avon </em>v. <em>Linder, </em>352 Mass. 581, 582-583 (1967). Because the defendant is no longer a selectman and because we do not have sufficient facts before us to reach any meaningful conclusion concerning the defendant\u2019s possible violation of \u00a7 23, we decline to state generally any views on the matter. Judgment shall be entered dismissing the complaint because of the absence of an actual controversy justifying the granting of declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">So <em>ordered.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b540-7\"> General Laws c. 268A, \u00a7 19 (a), as appearing in St. 1962, c. 779, \u00a7 1, reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\"><em>\u201c(a) </em>Except as permitted by paragraph <em>(b), </em>a municipal employee who participates as such an employee in a particular matter in which to his knowledge he, his immediate family or partner, a business organization in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>which he is serving as officer, director, trustee, partner or employee, or any person or organization with whom he is negotiating or has any arrangement concerning prospective employment, has a financial interest, shall be punished by a fine of not more than three thousand dollars or by imprisonment for not more than two years, or both.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b541-7\"> The complaint refers to subsections <em>(e) </em>and <em>(f) </em>in \u00a7 23. The plaintiff\u2019s brief makes an additional reference to subsection (d). Section 23, as amended through St. 1975, c. 508, limited to subsections <em>(d), (e), </em>and (/), reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\"><em>\u201cSection 23. </em>In addition to the other provisions of this chapter, and in supplement thereto, the following are established as standards of conduct for all state, county and municipal employees for the violation of which appropriate administrative action as is warranted may be taken by the appropriate constitutional officer or by the head of a state, county or municipal agency.
