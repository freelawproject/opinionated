It claims damages on the basis of common law tort liability for negligence or misrepresentation and on the basis of G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 8, and G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 145. The complaint was dismissed in the Superior Court under Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974), and we transferred the plaintiffs appeal to this court on our motion. We affirm the judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>The complaint contained two counts. In the first the town alleged that the defendants had negligently dumped some 750,000 used tires on land in the town, violating G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7\u00a7 143 &amp; 150A, and creating a nuisance and a fire hazard, and that as a result the town fire department was unable to inspect the premises properly and unable to extinguish promptly a fire that occurred on the premises. As a result the town \u201cincurred greater expense than usual and necessary\u201d in extinguishing and controlling the fire. The second count added an allegation that the defendants \u201cfalsely and maliciously with intent to defraud, mis-stated to the Board of Health . . . and the Board of Selectmen the proposed use and scope of operations at the site,\u201d and that as a result the town boards could not take proper precautions.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">There seems to be no authority for common law recovery by a town of its expenses in fighting a fire. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>240 Cal. App. 2d 574, 576 (1966); <em>Portsmouth </em>v. <em>Campanella &amp; Cardi Constr. Co., </em>100 N.H. 249, 253 (1956); <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Soo Line R.R., </em>63 Wis. 2d 500, 503 (1974); <em>Allenton Volunteer Fire Dep\u2019t </em>v. <em>Soo Line </em>R.R., 372 F. Supp. 422, 423 (E.D. Wis. 1974); Annot., 90 A.L.R.2d 873 (1963). No claim is made for fire damage to town property of a type that would give rise to damage liability to a private owner for negligence or nuisance. G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 145. See <em>Dartmouth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>325 Mass. 401, 404 (1950); <em>Hanifin </em>v. C &amp; <em>R Constr. Co., </em>313 Mass. 651 (1943); cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chesapeake &amp; O. Ry., </em>130 F.2d 308, 310 (4th Cir. 1942) (expense of protecting public property from advancing fire). Expense incurred by the town in extinguishing a fire on private land stands on a different footing. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Me. R.R., </em>99 N.H. 66, 71 (1954). Once a town establishes a fire department under G. L. c. 48, \u00a7 42, as amended by St. 1973, c. 1048, \u00a7 1, the fire chief has \u201ccharge of extinguishing fires in the town and the protection of life and property in case of fire.\u201d Safeguards against fire are maintained \u201cfor the benefit of the public and without pecuniary compensation or emolument.\u201d <em>Painter </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>123 Mass. 311, 316 (1877).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>Under these authorities the right of the town to recover firefighting expenses depends on statute. See, e.g., G. L. c. 48, \u00a7 59A, providing for a written agreement for reimbursement in case of aid to another municipality; G. L. c. 148, \u00a7 5, abatement of fire hazard at owner\u2019s expense on twenty-four hour notice. Such statutes have generally been strictly construed. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Burlington N., </em>Inc., 500 F.2d 637, 639 (9th Cir. 1974); <em>State </em>v. <em>California Or. Power Co., </em>225 Or. 604, 612 (1961). The town argues that G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 8, as appearing in St. 1958, c. 526, \u00a7 2, provides for liability in the present case, but the complaint lacks the necessary allegation that the defendants set or increased \u201ca fire upon land of another\u201d or that they suffered any fire upon their own land \u201cto extend beyond the limits thereof whereby the woods or property of another are injured.\u201d See <em>State Forester </em>v. <em>Obrist, </em>237 Or. 63, 67 (1964). Thus, the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
