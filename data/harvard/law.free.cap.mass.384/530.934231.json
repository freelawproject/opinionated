L. c. 131, \u00a7 40A (Inland Wetlands Act), was the \u201cequivalent of a taking.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We granted the Commissioner\u2019s application for direct appellate review. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>We summarize the judge\u2019s findings of fact. The plaintiff owns approximately 297,000 square feet of undeveloped land in Newton (parcel). The judge found that approximately 55% of the parcel (area 17) is inland wetland, because its vegetation and muck soil are typical of that found in such areas. The dominance of vegetation characteristic of wetlands \u201cindicates that the ground water is at or near the surface of the ground during the majority of the year. The ground beneath area 17 is composed of between 3.5 and 5.5 feet of muck soil, which has a high organic content and contains silt and fine sand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">On April 7, 1977, the Commissioner placed a restrictive order on area 17.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under this order, the plaintiff may not dredge, fill, or alter the wetland. The judge found that \u201c[pjarcel 17\u2019s low, flat topography, muck soils and dense vegetation retain peak flows during periods of flooding and release this water slowly and evenly over extended periods of time. This moderates extremes in water level and velocity, and reduc\u00e9s flood damages in downstream areas of the Charles River Watershed. The parcel\u2019s profuse vegetation and muck soil functions as a natural filter system, removing sediments, salt, petroleum products, and other pollutants from the water. In addition, area 17 helps to maintain base flows in downstream areas during periods of low flow, thereby diluting concentration of water pollutants during these periods.\u201d The judge therefore found that area 17 plays an important role in preventing floods and reducing pollution in the Charles River Watershed.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Under the Commissioner\u2019s order, the judge found that the plaintiff could still use area 17 for certain limited purposes. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>These uses include: \u201ca. The construction and maintenance of catwalks, wharves, boathouses, boat shelters, fences [,] duckblinds, wildlife management shelters, foot bridges, observation decks and shelters; b. The construction and maintenance of a roadway or driveway of minimum and practical width where reasonable alternative means of access from a public way to unrestricted land of the same owner is unavailable; c. The installation and maintenance of underground or overhead utilities; d. Commercial and non-commercial outdoor recreation activities including hiking, boating [,] trapping [,] hunting, e. Other works which are designed to enhance the appearance and attractiveness of open space of recreational areas without altering their use as such; and f. The use or improvement of land or water for agricultural purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The judge correctly concluded that the Commonwealth can reasonably regulate private property in the public interest. See <em>Lovequist </em>v. <em>Conservation Comm\u2019n of Dennis, </em>379 Mass. 7, 19 (1979); <em>Turnpike Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Dedham, </em>362 Mass. 221, 227-229 (1972), cert, denied, 409 U.S. 1108 (1973); <em>Penn Cent. Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>New York City, </em>438 U.S. 104, 125 (1978). \u201cControlling and restricting the filling of wetlands is clearly within the scope of the police power of the State.\u201d <em>Sibson </em>v. <em>State, </em>115 N.H. 124, 126 (1975). See <em>Commissioner of Natural Resources </em>v. <em>S. Volpe &amp; Co., </em>349 Mass. 104, 107 (1965); <em>Candlestick Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>San Francisco Bay Conservation &amp; Dev. Comm\u2019n, </em>11 Cal. App. 3d 557, 570-571 (1970); <em>Brecciaroli </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>168 Conn. 349, 353-354 (1975); <em>Pope v. Atlanta, </em>242 Ga. 331, 333-334 (1978), cert, denied, 440 U.S. 936 (1979); <em>Potomac Sand &amp; Gravel Co. </em>v. <em>Governor of Md., </em>266 Md. 358, 367, cert, denied, 409 U.S. 1040 (1972). The judge also correctly concluded that the \u201ccrucial issue is whether, notwithstanding the meritorious character of the regulation, there has been such a deprivation of the practical uses of a landowner\u2019s property as to be the equivalent of a taking.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Natural Resources </em>v. S. <em>Volpe </em>&amp; <em>Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>The judge then determined that the order was the \u201cequivalent of a taking\u201d for two reasons. \u201cFirst, any and all profitable use of [area] 17 has been prohibited; the ban is permanent. The owner is to be denied effectively the use of more than half of his parcel. Second, unlike zoning and historical district types of cases, there is no reciprocity of benefit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The findings of the judge do not support his conclusion. He found that after the restrictive order the plaintiff could build a single family residence on his land. A single family house is a sufficient practical use to prevent the wetland restrictions from constituting a taking. See <em>Lovequist </em>v. <em>Conservation Comm\u2019n of Dennis, </em>379 Mass. 7, 20 (1979). Government regulations like the wetlands restrictions at issue in this case, \u201cmay deprive an owner of a beneficial property use \u2014 even the most beneficial such use \u2014 without rendering the regulation an unconstitutional taking.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19. See <em>Penn Cent. Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>New York City, </em>438 U.S. 104, 123-128 (1978); <em>Goldblatt </em>v. <em>Hempstead, </em>369 U.S. 590, 592 (1962); <em>Turnpike Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Dedham, </em>362 Mass, at 234. \u201c\u2018Taking\u2019 jurisprudence does not divide a single parcel into discrete segments and attempt to determine whether rights in a particular segment have been entirely abrogated. In deciding whether a particular governmental action has effected a taking, this Court focuses rather both on the character of the action and on the nature and extent of the interference with rights in the parcel as a whole . . . .\u201d <em>Penn Cent. Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>New York City, </em>438 U.S. at 130-131. Since the plaintiff may still use his property for a dwelling or dwellings, there has not been such an extensive interference with the parcel as a whole that it constitutes a taking.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Although the judge realized that he should look at the effect of the restriction on the plaintiff\u2019s entire parcel, not just area 17, nevertheless he did not do so. Rather, the judge focused solely on area 17 and the limitations on its use. Consequently, the judge erred in concluding that the restrictive order was a taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The judge also determined that the restrictions were the \u201cequivalent of a taking,\u201d because the plaintiff received \u201cno reciprocity of benefit\u201d from the restrictions. He found that \u201cthe area receiving the benefit is an area downstream and far removed from the locus.\u201d Since the plaintiff received no direct benefit from the restrictions, the judge determined that he was unconstitutionally deprived of his property without compensation. Even if we were to assume that the plaintiff received no benefit, however, the restrictions did not constitute a taking. The fact that the Inland Wetlands Act \u201chas a more severe impact on some landowners than on others . . . does not mean that the law effects a \u2018taking.\u2019 Legislation designed to promote the general welfare commonly burdens some more than others.\u201d <em>Penn Cent. Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>New York City, </em>438 U.S. 104, 133 (1978). See <em>Hadacheck </em>v. <em>Sebastian, </em>239 U.S. 394 (1915). As long as \u201cthe restrictions [are] reasonably related to the implementation of a policy . . . expected to produce a widespread public benefit and applicable to all similarly situated property,\u201d they need not produce a reciprocal benefit. <em>Penn Cent. Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>New York City, </em>438 U.S. 104, 134 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>n.30 (1978). Since the Inland Wetlands Act is reasonably related to the goals of flood and pollution control, its application to the plaintiff is not unconstitutional.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for the entry of a judgment that the Commissioner\u2019s restrictive order is not the \u201cequivalent of a taking\u201d and that the restrictive order for the city of Newton, as it applies to area 17, is valid and enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b544-16\">The plaintiff had also claimed that the statute, G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40A, was so broad as to be an unconstitutional delegation of authority. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>judge concluded that \u201c[t]he delegation of power to the department was proper; the department hearings were not adjudicatory; the hearings were legislative in nature . . . [and that] [t]he issuance of the restriction was in accord with the provisions of c. 131, \u00a7 40A.\u201d The plaintiff has not appealed from these rulings, and thus they are not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b545-8\"> The restrictions on area 17 can be modified if wetland conditions change. Under G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 11, real estate restricted under G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40A, is assessed as a separate parcel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b547-6\"> The construction of a single family house may not be the only practical use. At trial, there was evidence that the plaintiff could subdivide his parcel into four lots without violating the restrictions. In addition, there was evidence that twenty years earlier the plaintiff had planned to subdivide his parcel into eight lots. The judge found that the plan as proposed did not comply with Newton\u2019s existing zoning ordinance. He also found that, even without the department\u2019s restrictions, the plaintiff could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>subdivide his parcel into eight lots. We need not determine whether there is any inconsistency in these findings, for even if an eight lot subdivision were permissible in the absence of restrictions, the Commissioner\u2019s order would still not be a taking. A reduction in the number of houses that an owner may build is a diminution in value and not a taking. \u201cThere is no set formula to determine where regulation ends and taking begins. Although a comparison of values before and after is relevant. . . it is by no means conclusive . . . .\u201d <em>Turnpike Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Dedham, </em>362 Mass. 221, 236 (1972), cert, denied, 409 U.S. 1108 (1973), quoting from <em>Goldblatt </em>v. <em>Hempstead, </em>369 U.S. 590, 594 (1962). The plaintiff offered no evidence which showed that he suffered an actual financial loss as a result of the restrictions. Thus, there is no factual support for his claim of confiscation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b549-7\"> The record suggests that the plaintiff may benefit from the restrictions. As a citizen, the plaintiff benefits from the Inland Wetlands Act because it helps society avoid the relief expenditures connected with flooding and pollution control. <em>Turnpike Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Dedham, </em>362 Mass. 221, 234-235 (1972). See generally McGregor &amp; Dawson, Wetlands and Floodplain Protection, 64 Mass. L. Rev. 73 (1979); Dawson, Protecting Massachusetts Wetlands, 12 Suffolk U.L. Rev. 755 (1978). Property with a view of the wetlands may increase in value. See <em>Department of Ecology </em>v. <em>Pacesetter Constr. Co., </em>89 Wash. 2d 203 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
