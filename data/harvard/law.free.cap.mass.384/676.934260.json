L. c. 183A, \u00a7 10 <em>(a). </em>The statute provides: \u201cEach unit owner shall have the same percentage interest in the corporation, trust or unincorporated association provided for in the master deed for the management and regulation of the condominium as his proportionate interest in the common areas and facilities. Such interest shall not be separated from ownership in the unit to which it appertains and shall be deemed conveyed or encumbered with the unit even though such interest is not expressly mentioned or described in the conveyance or other instrument.\u201d G. L. c. 183A, \u00a7 10 <em>(a), </em>inserted by St. 1963, c. 493, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">In apparent conflict with the statute is \u00a7 3.1.3 of the condominium trust which provides that \u201c [ujntil [the developer] owns less than 12 units, there shall not be more than three Trustees and it shall be entitled to designate two such Trustees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">The plaintiff, trustee of the Vend\u00f3me Development Trust (development trust), filed a complaint in the Superior Court seeking to enjoin the defendants, who had been selected by the unit owners to replace the plaintiff\u2019s appointees, from exercising any power as trustees. The judge entered judgment for the plaintiff. On appeal, the Appeals Court, with one judge dissenting, reversed. <em>Barclay </em>v. <em>DeVeau, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 236 (1981). We granted the plaintiff\u2019s application for further appellate review. G. L. c. 211A, \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">The facts are as follows. In 1975 the Franchi Development Trust, of which Pasquale Franchi is the sole beneficiary, established the Vend\u00f3me Condominium Trust (condomini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>um trust). See G. L. c. 183A, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 10. The Vend\u00f3me is Boston\u2019s first mixed commercial and residential condominium. After the Franchi Development Trust defaulted on a construction loan with its mortgagee, the Commonwealth Capital Investment Corporation (CCIC), the name of the trust was changed to Vend\u00f3me Development Trust, the former trustee resigned, and CCIC appointed the plaintiff as trustee to manage the condominium and market the unsold condominium units.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff, as trustee of the development trust, appointed two trustees to the condominium trust pursuant to \u00a7 3.1.3 of the condominium trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">In late 1977 the trustees of the condominium trust approved a 38% increase in common area charges.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At this time all but one of the 110 residential units had been sold. The developer, however, owned twenty-three of the commercial units, twenty of which were under long or short term leases, most with options to purchase.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At a special meeting called by the unit owners on May 23, 1978, the unit owners voted, by approximately a 60 % majority, to remove the two appointed trustees, expand the board to seven, and appoint as new trustees the five persons who are the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>ants in this case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The unit owners purported to act under \u00a7 3.3 of the condominium trust, which grants the unit owners the power to remove a trustee by a vote of the owners of 51 % of the beneficial interest. By the terms of \u00a7 3.3, however, this right is subordinate to the right of the development trust under \u00a7 3.1.3 to retain the trustees of its choice until fewer than twelve units remain unsold.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">The defendants, newly elected as trustees, claim that \u00a7\u00a7 3.1.3 and 3.3 of the trust violate G. L. c. 183A, \u00a7 10.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendants argue that \u00a7 10 <em>(a) </em>requires that a unit owner\u2019s percentage ownership interest in the association of unit owners, set up for the management and regulation of the condominium, be the same as his proportionate interest in the common areas and facilities. Although we agree that the unit owners have a proportionate interest in the association, we find nothing in the statute which prohibits the unit owners from entering into valid agreements for management and control of the condominium. The fact that the unit owners are entitled to a certain percentage interest in the association does not necessarily mean that the owners must have the same proportionate interest in management.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">General Laws c. 183A, \u00a7 10 <em>(a), </em>states that \u201c[e]ach unit owner shall have the same percentage interest in the . . . trust . . . provided for in the master deed for the management and regulation of the condominium as his proportionate interest in the common areas and facilities.\u201d The defendants contend that this \u201cinterest\u201d must include power to appoint and remove the trustees of the condominium trust and cannot be diluted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>through a developer control clause such as \u00a7 3.1.3. The plaintiff argues that a proportionate interest in the unit owners\u2019 association may be a beneficial one that includes, for example, rights in event of casualty losses (G. L. c. 183A, \u00a7 17) and the right to make and the obligation to pay for capital improvements (G. L. c. 183A, \u00a7 18), without including proportionate management rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">1. <em>Legislative history of G. L. c. 183A. </em>We are mindful of the often-stated principle of statutory construction requiring us first to turn to the statutory language where it is plain and unambiguous for insight into the legislative purpose. <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Howmedica, Inc., </em>373 Mass. 32, 37 (1977). But where the language of a provision is unclear, we may look to outside sources for assistance in determining the correct construction of the statute. <em>Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps, &amp; Taxation, </em>363 Mass. 685, 690 (1973). Cf. <em>Rosenbloom </em>v. <em>Kokofsky, 373 </em>Mass. 778, 781 (1977). The crucial language of G. L. c. 183A, \u00a7 10 <em>(a), is </em>not free of ambiguity. To ascertain what the Legislature intended when it provided in G. L. c. 183A, \u00a7 10 <em>(a), </em>that unit owners have a proportionate \u201cinterest\u201d in the trust set up for the management of the condominium, we turn to the legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">The legislative history of G. L. c. 183A indicates that the Legislature was aware of precisely this issue when it enacted the statute, i.e., whether and by what means the unit owners would be able to control the management association. What is now G. L. c. 183A was first reflected in 1963 House Doc. No. 1708. Under \u00a7\u00a7 2 <em>(d), </em>18 &amp; 19 of House 1708, the condominium would be administered by an unincorporated association whose by-laws were to be recorded as part of the declaration. This bill went further to structure that association and particularly referred to voting. Section 2 (k) defined a majority for voting purposes as those \u201capartment owners with fifty-one per cent or more of the votes in accordance with the percentages assigned in the declaration to the apartments for voting purposes.\u201d Section 19 of House 1708 required that the by-laws provide for election of a board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>of directors for staggered terms from \u201camong the apartment owners.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">It was 1963 House Doc. No. 3324 that ultimately became G. L. c. 183A. Although retaining the concept of percentage interests expressed in House 1708 as the vehicle for shared ownership in the condominium (compare 1963 House Doc. No. 1708, \u00a7\u00a7 6 [o] and 6 <em>[b], </em>with G. L. c. 183A, \u00a7\u00a7 5 [a] and 5[b]), the provisions of House 1708 dealing with voting rights and the specific structure of the owners\u2019 organization were deleted and \u00a7 10 <em>(a) </em>was substituted. Use of a corporate or trust form for the owners\u2019 association was approved, rather than the unincorporated form found in House 1708. The Legislature refrained from including any specific language as to voting rights in \u00a7 10 (a), which outlines the unit owners\u2019 powers of management, but retained certain limitations on majority rule by unit owners as set forth in House 1708.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Legislature apparently intended to leave the matter of who shall control the management of the common areas and facilities of the condominium to discretionary agreement among the unit owners and the developer.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> To infer that \u201cinterest\u201d means \u201cvoting interest\u201d would be to impose a structure in the association that the Legislature did not intend to require.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Point East Management Corp. </em>v. <em>Point East One Condominium Corp., </em>282 So.2d 628, 629-630 (Fla. 1973), cert, denied, 415 U.S. 921 (1974) (legislative mandate that \u201coperation of condominium shall be by the association\u201d does not preclude association from contracting for management of condominium).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>2. <em>Validity of \u00a7 3.1.3. </em>Although arguably the concept of a condominium<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> was not unknown to the common law, condominium as a form of real estate ownership did not flourish until statutory authorization. See Berger, Condominium: Shelter on a Statutory Foundation, 63 Colum. L. Rev. 987, 1002 (1963); Schwartz, Condominium: A Hybrid Castle in the Sky, 44B.U. L. Rev. 137,139-144 (1964). The apparent purpose of c. 183A \u201cwas to clarify the legal status of the condominium in light of its peculiar characteristics.\u201d <em>Grace </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>379 Mass. 43, 52 (1979). Statutes like c. 183A which imprint the condominium with legislative authorization are essentially enabling statutes. Rosenstein, Inadequacies of Current Condominium Legislation \u2014 A Critical Look at the Pennsylvania Unit Property Act, 47 Temple L.Q. 655, 683 n.75 (1974). Schwartz, <em>supra </em>at 138. This statute provides planning flexibility to developers and unit owners. See P. Rohan &amp; M. Reskin, Condominium Law &amp; Practice \u00a7 5.04, at 5-26 (1981). Unless expressly prohibited by clear legislative mandate, unit owners and developers may validly contract as to the details of management.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Absent overreaching or fraud by a developer,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> we find no strong public policy against interpreting c. 183A, \u00a7 10 <em>(a), </em>to permit the developer and unit owners to agree on the details of administration and management of the condominium unit.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Public policy actually favors this in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>terpretation. See <em>Beaver Lake Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Beaver Lake </em>Corp., 200 Neb. 685 (1978) (provisions of by-law giving corporate developer authority to appoint majority of board of directors of homeowners\u2019 association not void ab initio as against public policy). Expert testimony at trial established that developer control clauses similar to \u00a7 3.1.3 of the condominium trust are common in Massachusetts. See generally Condominium Law 37, 64 (MCLE-NELI 1978) (including use of developer control clauses in drafting condominium documents). The developer and its mortgagee risk a great deal undertaking a condominium and, to protect their large investment, may need to maintain control of the project for a specific period of time. See Uniform Condominium Act (1977), 7 U.L.A., \u00a7 3-103, Comment 3 (Master ed. 1978) (recognizing practical necessity of developer control during development phase of condominium project); 1 A. Ferrer &amp; K. Stecher, Law of Condominium \u00a7 473, at 314 (1967) (developer desires effective role in project management if unsold units remain). Cf. D. Clurman &amp; E. Hebard, Condominiums and Cooperatives 52 (1970) (unit mortgagees ordinarily impose controls on major management decisions by condominium boards).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">The condominium trust in this case contains no express time limit on the developer\u2019s control. Under the express terms of the condominium trust the developer may retain control of the unit owners\u2019 association as long as twelve units are unsold. The defendants filed requests for rulings of law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>one of which stated: \u201cBecause no time unit [sic] is placed on the power granted to the Vend\u00f3me Development Trust by Article III, Section 3.1.3, the power, even if valid, will only be enforced for a reasonable period of time.\u201d The trial judge allowed this request, and the plaintiff concedes that a limitation of a reasonable period of time is properly placed on such a clause. Consequently, we need not determine whether such a limitation of time is necessarily implicit or will be imposed as a matter of policy on such provisions.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">It is arguable, however, that an agreement designed to protect the developers\u2019 interests during the development and marketing phase of a condominium implicitly contains limitations of time on such a phase. See <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Campello Co-op. Bank, </em>344 Mass. 76, 79 (1962). See also <em>Catania </em>v. <em>Hallisey, </em>352 Mass. 327, 331 (1967) (contractual clauses that restrict another\u2019s rights, unlimited in time, enforceable for reasonable period of time). \u201cWhat is a reasonable time is a question of law, to be determined in reference to the nature of the contract and the probable intention of the parties as indicated by it.\u201d <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Ball, </em>341 Mass. 350, 353 (1960), quoting from <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Whoriskey, </em>170 Mass. 63, 67 (1898). A reasonable period of time is the period necessary to carry out the supposed intention of the parties, see 1 S. Williston, Contracts \u00a7 38 (3d ed. 1957), i.e., protect the developer while it is at risk. - Such a view would be consistent with the basic concept of condominium, i.e., that unit owners will be afforded a proportionate voice in the management of the common areas and facilities. Schwartz, <em>supra </em>at 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">We note that the judge treated the \u201cmarketing phase\u201d of a condominium project as a reasonable period of time in which the developer may maintain control of the unit owners\u2019 association. The marketing phase of the condominium is that time during which the developer actively engages in selling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>the condominium units.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Notwithstanding this good faith effort, however, a point in time may be reached where, despite the presence of unsold units, the developer must relinquish control.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The record before us does not clearly indicate what criteria the judge considered in determining that the Vend\u00f3me Condominium was still in the marketing phase, nor does it reveal whether he considered the question of reasonable time apart from marketing efforts. In the amended findings and judgment, the judge stated that \u201c[t]he primary aim of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>Vend\u00f3me Development Trust under Franchi\u2019s and the mortgagee's direction, has been to sell the units and since twenty-three (23) commercial units were unsold, the Vend\u00f3me Condominium was still in the marketing phase.\u201d As stated earlier, however, the inquiry is not whether a particular number of units remain unsold, but whether the developer is actively engaged in a bona fide effort to sell the units, and whether, in any event, the circumstances, considered as a whole, require a conclusion that control must pass to the unit owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>We set aside the judgment and remand the case to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b691-8\"> The unit owners appoint the third trustee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b692-5\"> At the time of the mortgage default, Pasquale Franchi pledged his beneficial interest in the development trust to the mortgagee, CCIC.

The management fee of $2,000 a month did not increase. The defendants do not contend that the trustees misrepresented the operating costs or otherwise acted fraudulently in this matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b692-7\"> Although neither side argues the issue in its brief, letters from the attorneys on file in the Appeals Court indicate that this case may be moot. The plaintiff\u2019s correspondence, filed before the release of the Appeals Court decision, states that the plaintiff sold her remaining interest in the condominium units and, therefore, the matter is now moot. We, however, agree with the defendants that the case is not moot since the validity of the May 23, 1978, election and the defendants\u2019 status as trustees are at issue in this case.

Al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>though the judge made no specific finding as to the meaning of the word \u201cunits,\u201d we assume, because the judge denied the defendants\u2019 requests for rulings of law on this issue, that the judge interpreted the word \u201cunits\u201d to mean commercial or residential units.
