Both this court and the appellate court have previously considered other issues arising from this litigation. Kazubowski v. Kazubowski, 45 Ill.2d 405; Kazubowski v. Kazubowski, 93 Ill. App. 2d 126.</p> <p id=\"b411-15\" pgmap=\"411\">The' order of default provides \u201c* * * it was ordered that the defendant Edward J. Kazubowski answer plaintiff\u2019s petition to foreclose on or before December 10, 1969 and he haying failed to file or otherwise make appearance herein in the petition to foreclose, said defendant, Edward J. Kazubowski is adjudged in default, and</p> <p id=\"b411-16\" pgmap=\"411(9) 412(11)\">\u201cIT IS ORDERED that the complaint to foreclose herein be taken as confessed against said defendant Edward J. Kazubowski.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b412-3\" pgmap=\"412\">An order of default does not dispose of the merits of the case and determine the rights of the parties. It is not, therefore, a final judgment. (Hess v. People ex rel. Miller, 84 Ill. 247.) There was no effort to comply with Supreme Court Rule 304(a) (43 Ill.2d R. 304) so we do not decide whether such compliance can serve to make the order appeal-able.</p> <p id=\"b412-4\" pgmap=\"412\">The briefs raise and discuss other questions, many of which were decided in the prior appeals. The record presents no final appealable order reviewable at this time and the appeal is dismissed.</p> <p id=\"b412-5\" pgmap=\"412\">Appeal dismissed.</p> <p id=\"b412-6\" pgmap=\"412\">Mr. Justice Ward took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
