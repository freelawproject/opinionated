The defendants have complied with all the requirements essential to entitle them to have the cause removed to the federal court. The matter in dispute exceeds the sum of $500, exclusive of costs. They were incorporated under the law of New York, and have their principal place of business in that state-At the time of their appearance in the superior court, they filed a proper petition for the removal of the cause, and offered a sufficient bond. When these facts were made to appear to the satisfaction of the superior court, the right of the defendants, under the judiciary act of the United States, to remove the cause was absolutely vested, and the court had no authority to forbid the removal.

It is settled law that a corporation is an inhabitant of the state in which it was created and does its principal business, and under the judiciary act of the United States is to be regarded as a citizen of that state. <em>Louisville, Cincinnati &amp; Charleston Railroad Co. v. </em>Letson, 2 How. 497. <em>Covington Drawbridge Co. </em>v. <em>Shepherd, </em>20 How. 227, 232. <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Baltimore </em>&amp; <em>Ohio Railroad Co. </em>16 How. 314. <em>Cowles v.

Sts. <em>c. </em>58, \u00a7 68, do not affect the citizenship of foreign corporations, or render them domestic corporations, or deprive them of the right to have their causes removed. <em>Knorr </em>v. <em>Home Insurance Co. </em>25 Wisc. 143. <em>Hatch </em>v. <em>Chicago, Rock Island Pacific Railroad Co. </em>6 Blatchf. 105. <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Ph\u0153nix Insurance Co. </em>41 N.

If that section should be held to deprive foreign insurance companies of remedies secured to foreign citizens under the judiciary act, the federal courts might be deprived of nearly all their jurisdiction, by the concurrent legislation of the various states. Nor, by complying with the provisions of the Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>58, did the defendants bind themselves to submit their causes to the final determination of our domestic tribunals. Stipulations of this nature, affecting remedies secured to the citizen by law, cannot be annexed to the contract, or be enforced by courts. <em>Nute </em>v. <em>Hamilton Insurance Co. </em>6 Gray 174. <em>Dennistoun </em>v. <em>New York &amp; New Haven Railroad Co. </em>1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Hilton, 62. As the right given by the Constitution and laws of the United States, to any citizen of one state who is sued in the courts of another, to remove the suit into the federal courts, is one which no state legislature can abridge or take away, no more can the jurisdiction of the national tribunals in such a case be ousted by agreement of the parties. The nature of the remedy which the government furnishes, in pursuance of its duty to enforce justice between parties subject to its jurisdiction, cannot be made a part of the contract to be enforced, or be regulated by agreement. Any such stipulation would be void in law. The legislature did not intend to deprive foreign insurance companies, either by positive law or by contract, of the right to remove their causes to federal courts, but only to provide to our citizens a way of reaching them by legal process, either in the state courts or our own United States judicial district. The statute was made in view of the extended area of country over which the companies transact them business, and the impossibility of seeking remedies against them in the remote states where they are incorporated. The language of the supreme court of Maine answers every suggestion which can be made against removing the present cause ; and the statutes of Maine on this subject cannot, in principle, be distinguished from those of Massachusetts. <em>Hobbs </em>v. <em>Manhattan Insurance Co. </em>56 Maine, 417, 421.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b155-5\"><em>M. P. Knowlton &amp; G. D. </em>Robinson, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAp\">The course of legislation shows that it was the intention of the legislature not only to provide against loss from insurance made by foreign corporations, but also to secure a remedy in our domestic forum upon contracts made in this state by such corporations, and compel them to make answer here for breach of such contracts. Rev. Sts. <em>e. </em>37, \u00a7\u00a7 40-48. Sts. 1847, <em>e. </em>273 ; 1851, <em>e. </em>331; 852, <em>e. </em>311; 1856, <em>e. </em>252. Gen. Sts. <em>e. </em>58, \u00a7\u00a7 68, 69. The Sts. <em>I </em>1851 and 1852 only require the acceptance of service of process, and entry of appearance, \u201c in like manner as if such corporation had existed and been duly served with process in this state.\u201d The St. of 1856 provides that service may be made upon the agent \u201c in like manner as u the company had existed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>been duly served with process in this Commonwealth,\u201d and requires the company to stipulate and agree in writing that any lawful process against the company so served \u201c shall be of the same legal force and validity as if served on said company.\u201d The General Statutes substantially reenact the St. of 1856, and in \u00a7 68 substitute the phrase \u201cwith like effect\u201d for the narrower phrase \u201c in like manner.\u201d These statute provisions are not unreasonable, or in conflict with any principle of public law. <em>Lafayette Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>French, </em>18 How. 407. <em>Gillespie </em>v. <em>Commercial Insurance Co. </em>12 Gray, 201.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b156-6\">It was only by virtue of the statute that these defendants could be sued in the state court without an attachment of property. <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Michigan Central Railroad Co. </em>99 Mass. 534. And they voluntarily subjected themselves to this jurisdiction. They came of their own free will into the state, complied with the conditions in order to secure the advantages of the statute, and then made the contract which is the subject of this suit. Service according to the statute rendered them personally amenable to the jurisdiction, and gave the basis for a judgment as valid as if they had been here incorporated. 18 How. 407, and 12 Gray, 201, above cited. And on the same principle they are debarred of the right of removal prayed for. They have estopped themselves to claim it, by their own agreement made pursuant to the statute. If this cause may of right be removed, the statute is nugatory, except that the removal must be to the circuit court of this district.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b156-7\">In <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Mutual Insurance Co. </em>14 Allen, 336, the court declined to entertain jurisdiction as to the subject matter, not as to the parties. But that case lacked three important elements which are found here. It was on a contract not made within this state, nor with a citizen thereof, nor insuring a life therein. So far as the opinion touches the question now under discussion, it supports the plaintiff\u2019s position.

Louisville, <em>Cincinnati &amp; Charleston Railroad Co. v. Letson, </em>2 How. 497. <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Co. </em>16 How. 314. <em>Covington Drawbridge Co. </em>v.

When sued in a state court, it may, as such citizen of another state, remove the cause to the circuit court of the United States, if there is nothing in the legislation of the state to prevent it. <em>Hobbs </em>v. <em>Manhattan Insurance Co. </em>56 Maine, 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">It is contended by the plaintiff in this case, that the provisions of the Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>58, \u00a7\u00a7 68, 69, were intended by the legislature to compel foreign insurance companies to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state, and to prohibit them from removing a cause from the courts of the state to those of the United States. The question thus presented is one of interpretation merely. We must take it for granted that all that was intended is expressed; and we cannot derive any essential aid from considerations of what legislative policy would be likely to be in respect to the matter. By \u00a7 68, foreign insurance companies are required to appoint, in writing, a citizen resident in the state, a general agent, upon whom all lawful processes against the company may be served, with like effect as if the company existed in this state; and the writing is to stipulate for the legal force and validity of the service. Service on this agent is to be deemed legal service upon the principal. Section 69 provides that the agent shall give bond to the treasurer of the Commonwealth, with condition that he will accept service of all lawful process against the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">But all this relates to the service of process, and contains no restriction upon the company after it comes into court. The clause providing that the service \u201c shall be of the same legal force and effect as if served on said company \u201d does not imply a restriction upon the right to remove the cause, as the plaintiff contends it does; for the right of removal cannot be affected by the mere fact that the process has been perfectly served. It would not be safe to attribute to the legislature an intent not expressed either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>directly or indirectly. In the case of <em>Hobbs </em>v. <em>Manhattan Insurance Co. </em>56 Maine, 417, the supreme court of Maine gave a similar construction to \u00e1 similar statute of that state.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The question whether a state legislature would have power to impose such a restriction upon a foreign corporation does not arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">\n<em>Petition granted.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
