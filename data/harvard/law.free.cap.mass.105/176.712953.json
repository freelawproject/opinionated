On the warrant, the liquors were seized ; and Spurr and Williams were summoned as claimants. They appeared accordingly in the superior <em>court; </em>and before the jury were empanelled they filed a motion to quash the proceedings, \u201cbecause, they say, the complaint, warrant, judgment of the municipal court, order of notice, notice and ser\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>vice thereof, are all fatally defective; and because the warrant in said case does not purport to be the precept of any court or magistrate authorized to issue the same; and because the municipal court of the city of Worcester is not authorized by law to receive a complaint under the provisions of the St. of 1869, <em>c. </em>415, \u00a7 44.\u2019 This motion Devens, J., overruled; on the trial, judgment was rendered for the forfeiture of the liquors; and the claimants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b187-5\"><em>G.
