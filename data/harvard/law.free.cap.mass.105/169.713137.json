F. </em>Verry, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACq-\">The want of a direct averment of anything material, in the description of the substance, nature or manner of the offence, cannot be supplied by intendment or implication. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>7 Met. 52. The crime attempted to be charged is of an attempt to commit larceny from- the person. The substantive averments must charge this fully and plainly, and a defective averment of these cannot be cured by a general clause. These averments are, that the defendant did \u201c thrust, insert and place his hand into the pocket of said Andrew Franklin, without the knowledge of said Franklin,\u201d &amp;c. But this might well be, and yet not constitute the offence sought to be charged. There is no averment that the pocket was on Franklin\u2019s person. The forms adjudged sufficient ji <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Bonner, 97 Mass. 587, and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>5 Cush. 365, averred that the defendant, with intent to steal the property of a certain woman, \u201c being in her pocket and on her person,\u201d did thrust Ms hand, &amp;c.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b180-7\"><em>C. Allen, </em>Attorney General, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b180-8\">Wells, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ar8\">TMs Mdictment is for an attempt to commit the crime of larceny from the person. The statute pumshes such an attempt when the offender \u201c does any act towards the comnffssion of such offence,\u201d but fails therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">The offence attempted is sufficiently set forth, according to the decisions m <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>5 Cush. 365, and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bonner, </em>97 Mass. 587. It was also held in <em>McDonald's </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number><em>case, </em>that neither allegation nor proof was necessary, that there was any property, capable of being stolen, in the pocket or upon the person of the one against whom the attempt was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The objection, urged in this case, is, that it is not alleged that the pocket, into which the defendant thrust his hand, was upon the person of Franklin; and so it is not shown that any act was done \u201c towards the commission <em>\u201d </em>of the offence of larceny from the person. But the same objection was taken in <em>Bonner's ease, </em>without avail. The allegation there was, that the defendant put his hand \u201c upon the dress near and into the pocket of said woman, without her knowledge.\u201d Objection was distinctly made to the indictment as being \u201c equivocal, and insufficient in its description of the alleged overt act.\u201d The language of the court, in the opinion, is: \u201c The description of the offence in the indictment is sufficiently precise and unequivocal; \u201d showing that the point was considered and adjudicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">When an act is said to be done to the dress of a person, to the natural and ordinary understanding it would indicate the dress worn by such person. And so \u201cthe pocket of Andrew Franklin \u201d naturally indicates a pocket in the clothing worn by him. This implication is strengthened by the preceding allegation, that it was done in attempting to steal from his person property alleged to be at the time upon his person.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">A greater degree of circumstantial precision might be commendable, in' criminal pleading. But we do not think this allegation is so lacking in precision as to make it uncertain what was intended to be charged. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
