Campbell.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b50-5\">The description, in a certificate filed by a married woman under the St. of 1862, <em>s. </em>198, \u00a7 1, of the nature of a business proposed to be done by her on her separate account in a counfay town, as \u201cthe general business of saloon keeper,\u201d is not insufiicient as matter of law.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-6\">Tort against a deputy of the sheriff of Hampshire, for the conversion of some whiskey, gin and beer, with the vessels in which they were contained. The answer admitted the taking of the property September 29, 1868, by the defendant, on an execution against the plaintiff\u2019s husband.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-7\">At the trial in the superior court, \u201c the plaintiff testified that she kept a saloon in Easthampton; and the evidence tended to show that she kept a place there, in her husband\u2019s house, for the sale of cigars, tobacco and other articles, including spirituous and intoxicating liquors; that her husband had no concern in the business ; and that the property in question was her separate property, and kept by her for sale at said place, and taken and converted to his own use by the defendant \u201d on the execution. Then, in order to prove her right to claim the property against her husband\u2019s creditors, she offered in evidence a certificate filed by her under the St. of 1862, <em>e. </em>198, in the clerk\u2019s office of Easthampton, in these terms : \u201c September 27, 1867. I, Bridget Cahill, of Easthampton, County of Hampshire and State of Massachusetts, do hereby certify that I am the wife of Patrick Cahill of said Easthampton ; that I am now doing business in said Easthampton, in a building known as Cahill\u2019s House, at New City, so called, and being the general business of saloon keeper, and it is my intention to continue said business in the place aforesaid in my own name and free from the interference or control of my said husband.\u201d But <em>Seudder, </em>J., ruled \u201cthat the certificate was on its face invalid and insufficient to protect the property of the plaintiff from being taken on execution by her husband\u2019s creditors,\u201d and directed a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b50-8\"><em>W.

In case no such certificate shall be filed, such married woman shall not be allowed to claim any property employed in said business as against any creditors of her husband, but the same may be attached on mesne process by any such creditor, or taken udou execution, against the husband of said womv* \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b51-5\">Colt, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ah\">The judge ruled, as matter of law, that the certificate, by which the plaintiff, intending to do business on her separate account, sought to protect her property, under the St. of 1862, <em>a. </em>198, from the claims of creditors of her husband, was invalid on its face. It is objected to this certificate, that the nature of the business proposed to be done is not sufficiently set out.- But it is described as \u201c the general business of saloon keeper; \u201d and we cannot see, as matter of law, that these words are not sufficiently descriptive and definite, when applied to such a business, carried on in a country town or village. The description would seem to be quite as intelligible to the jury as the words grocer, innkeeper, storekeeper, and the like, and the certificate is not to be held insufficient in law for this reason. <em>Exceptions sustained.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
