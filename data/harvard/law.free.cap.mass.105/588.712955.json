On cross-examination, she stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>she would not swear positively that the window might not have been raised at the time of the entry, and before the entry, from a quarter of an inch to an inch; but that it could not have been more.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b599-5\">\u201c The defendant\u2019s counsel asked the 'judge to rule, upon this evidence, that if, at the time of the alleged breaking and entering, the lower sash of the window was not closed, but was partially open, and was so found by the defendant, so that the alleged entering was therefore effected merely by the further raising and opening of this sash, and with no actual breaking, such further opening constituted no breaking.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b599-6\">\u201c The judge declined so to <em>rule; </em>but did rule, that, if the jury believed that the window was not entirely shut down, but might have been open to the extent to which the domestic testified that it might have been, but not sufficiently so for the defendant to be able to introduce any part of his person, so as to take the property, and the defendant, with felonious intent, opened the sash to the extent to which it was found open, for the purpose of introducing some part of his body to take the property, and did so introduce it, and take it, then there was a breaking and entering by the defendant.\u201d The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b599-7\"><em>J.

It should appear \u201c that the house was secured in the ordinary way, so that by the carelessness of the owner, in leaving the door or window open, the party accused of burglary be not tempted to enter.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Stephenson, 8 Pick. 354. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Steward, 7 Dane Ab. 136, it was held in 1789, that ,f if a window be a little pushed up \u201d it is not a breaking to obtain entrance by lifting it. higher. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Hays, Ib. The English authorities are to the same effect. Thus in <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Hyams, </em>7 C. <em>&amp; </em>P. 441, it was held not to be a breaking, where the prisoner threw up a sash which had been raised a couple of inches, and so effected an entrance. And in 1827 it was held by the twelve judges of England, in <em>Rex </em>v. Smith, 1 Moody, 178, that there was no decision under which, in case of a sash partly open but not sufficiently open to admit a person, the raising of it so as to admit a person could be considered a breaking; and that in this respect the court ought not to go beyond decided cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The instructions of the presiding judge at the trial were not in conformity to this rule, and were therefore incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
