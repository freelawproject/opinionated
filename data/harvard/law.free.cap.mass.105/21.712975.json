But <em>Eevens, </em>J., permitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>the plaintiff to testify, in support of it, that he worked several days for the defendant \u201c in grading about the house,\u201d besides working on the house ; and instructed the jury \u201c that if the plaintiff had satisfied them that he had done days\u2019 work on the house itself, and also about the house in grading and preparing the ground for it, he might recover under this item for all the days thus proved, not exceeding the number of days charged.\u201d The jury found for the plaintiff, and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b32-5\"><em>G.

With the utmost liberality of construction, either its significance must be limited to structures connected with or related to the house, like outbuildings; or it must be construed to mean \u201c and other days\u2019 work,\u201d in which event only one particular of the item could be proved. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Ilsley, </em>1 Allen, 273.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b32-6\"><em>W Griswold W.
