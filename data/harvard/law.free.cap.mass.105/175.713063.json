The word \u201c to \u201d instead of \u201c by,\u201d has always been used in indictments to indicate the relation mentioned. 1 Bishop Crim. Proc. <em>e. </em>19, vi. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Knapp, 10 Pick. 477, 478. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Sherman, 13 Allen, 248. This averment is traversable, and if the name or person was known to the jurors or the complainant, the defendant is entitled to an acquittal. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Stoddard, 9 Allen, 280. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Blood, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>4 Gray, 31. It follows that it must be made in formal and unambiguous language. Declaration of Rights, art. 12. The word \u201c by \u201d in this connection does not satisfy the requirement. Its sense after the words \u201cknow\u201d and \u201cknown\u201d is ambiguous, as it often denotes medium or instrumentality, and might be interchanged with \u201cthrough\u201d or \u201cby means of.\u201d \u201cWe shall know by this fellow.\u201d Hamlet, act iii. scene 2. \u201c For I know nothing by myself.\u201d 1 Corinthians, <em>c. </em>iv. <em>v. </em>4. \u201cA man is known by the company he keeps; \u201d and in the Latin, <em>noscitur a sociis. </em>This sense would naturally be suggested in the use of the word in this complaint, as it was the office of the complainant to be the medium of information to the court in respect to the offence complained of.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b186-6\"><em>C. </em>Allen, Attorney General, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b186-7\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"AcJ\">The allegation that a person is not known by the complainant has the same signification as the allegation that he is not known to him. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
