Hoar &amp; B. W. </em>Potter, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9u\">This case presents the question whether a well known class of benevolent associations, of which the Connecticut Mutual Benefit Company is an example, may lawfully receive members in this Commonwealth. All these associations are based upon the principle that the contributions, made by the members for the benefit of the representatives of deceased associates, are wholly voluntary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-7\">Sections 1 and 4 of the charter of the Connecticut Mutual Benefit Company incorporate it under its present constitution and by-laws, and subject the officers and contracts of the company thereto. Section 2 provides that the company may issue certificates of membership, \u201cwhich certificate shall state on its face the agreement with the member receiving the same.\u201d The certificates issued set forth the agreement as follows: \u201c At the end of sixty days after satisfactory proof of the death of has been received, the said Connecticut Mutual Benefit Company hereby promise and agree to pay as many dollars as there are then members in Division of Series to or his legal representatives at their office in New Haven.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Section 3 of the by-laws provides that any member falling to pay the assessment of one dollar and ten cents within forty days from date of notice of the death of a member shall cease to be a member. The application signed by the member stipulates that \u201c this application and this declaration shall form the basis of the contract between the applicant and the company \u201d and that in case of omission to make any of the payments \u201c this contract shall become null and void.\u201d And these provisions constitute the entire contract so far as is material to the question now raised. The by-laws, it is true, somewhat inexactly speak of these sums so to be paid as dues, and authorize the directors in their discretion to appropriate the admission fees to \u201c cover losses caused by the delinquencies of members.\u201d But the corporation is nothing more than the custodian of a trust, collecting and distributing voluntary offerings. Such an institution is not within the laws of this Commonwealth touching foreign insurance companies.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-5\">It is conceded that the defendant and the Connecticut Mutual Benefit Company have failed to comply with those laws. The whole system of regulations prescribed for mutual insurance companies, domestic or foreign, is inapplicable to an organization of this kind. The Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>58, \u00a7\u00a7 60, 67, require such companies to possess a guaranty capital of at least $100,000. Schedule D in <em>e. </em>58 prescribes minute returns. The St. of 1861, <em>c. </em>186, provides that the policy shall not become void by nonpayment of the premium, except as to the right to have it continue beyond a limited time calculated in the manner prescribed. The St. of 1863, <em>c. </em>148, prohibits the issuing of policies unless the funds equal its liabilities. See also Sts. 1862, <em>c. </em>224; 1864, <em>e. </em>197; 1867, <em>c. </em>267; 1868, \u00ed 317.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-6\">The phrases, \u201c insurance companies doing business on the mutual plan,\u201d in Gen. Sts. <em>o. </em>58, and \u201c mutual insurance companies,\u201d are technical terms well known in business. They denote associations paying at the death of the party insured a sum of money in etum for a premium based on a risk calculated or capable of emulation. <em>\u201c </em>A policy of insurance is a contract between A. and B., that upon A.\u2019s paying a premium equivalent to the hazard run, B, will indemnify, or insure him against a particular event.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>2 Bl. Com. 458. <em>Assecuratio est conventio seu contractus quo quis in se suscipit incertum periculum eui alter est obnoxius, qui a contraria eo nomine illi prcemium retribuere tenetur. </em>Grotius, Introduction to Jurisprudence of Holland, cited by Lawrence, J., in <em>Lucena </em>v. <em>Craufurd, 2 New </em>Rep. 269, 300. See argument of Serjeant Coleridge, in <em>Paterson </em>v. Powell, 9 Bing. 320, 322-326. In the contract of the case at bar, there is neither risk nor premium. This association is a mere club. Its members subscribe an equal sum without regard to the risk. There is no premium or reward graduated to the hazard, and no sum stipulated to be paid. 1 Angel\u00ed on Ins. \u00a7 287.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b170-5\"><em>C. </em>Allen, Attorney General, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b159-15\"> \u201cNo officer, agent or sub-agent of any insurance company, not incorporated in this Commonwealth, shall act or aid in any manner in transacting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>business of insurance of or with such company, or placing risks or effecting insurance therein, without first procuring from the insurance commissioner a certificate of authority so to do, for each company for which he proposes to act, which shall state in substance that such company is duly authorized to do business in this state under the laws thereof, and that such agent or other person has duly complied with the laws relating to the agents of such companies.

PROSPECTUS.</p>\n<p id=\"AaX\">\u201c This company first organized under a general law of the state and commenced business in October 1868. But a special charter was obtained of the legislature of Connecticut in May 1869, and the company have under its authority raised a guaranty fund of $100,000 as security for all its members.\u201d \u201c The organization of this company opened a branch of business which had, it is true, been successfully tested in other countries for more than thirty years, yet it was new and untried here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A7U\"><em>\u201c </em>Its special aim is to furnish all the security, protection and relief which men seek in life insurance companies, but in a less expensive and more convenient manner. At the expiration of sixty days from the time due notice and proof of the death of any member is received at their office, the company will pay to the family or heirs of the deceased as many dollars as there are memoers in the division to which he or she belonged. The divisions are limited, some to 2500, others to 5000 members.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AqX\">\u201c Any person fifteen and not over sixty years of age, of sound body and mind, may become a member of this company. Persons becoming members are placed in divisions which are determined by their age, the kind of membership, or the amount of benefit desired. The single divisions consist of persons who join the company singly. The joint division consists of married men and their wives who become members jointly. The cost of membership in a single division is an admission fee of $8, an annual due of $2, commencing with the second year, and the payment of $1.10 for each death of a member of the same division. The cost of membership in a joint division is an admission fee of $15, an annual due of $3, commencing with the second year, and the payment of $1.10 for each death of a member of the same division. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>joint division the $3 annual due and the assessment of $1.10 pay for both man and wife.</p>\n<p id=\"Aer5\"><em>\u201c </em>The assessment of $1.10 must be forwarded to the company within forty days from the time due notice of a death is sent by the secretary. If any member neglects to send the amount within forty days after such notification, or shall neglect to pay his annual due at the proper time, he forfeits his membership and all money previously paid the company. But if a delinquent member shall subsequently apply, he may be restored to membership, if in good health, by paying double the amount of back dues and assessments, or, if it be shown to the satisfaction of the board of directors that the neglect was unintentional, he may be restored by paying the amount of back dues and assessments only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ANT\"><em>\u201c </em>A member of one division cannot be assessed for the death of a member in another division, nor are members under any circumstances subject to any other expense than as previously stated. The utmost freedom consistent with justice to all is allowed in regard to travelling, residence and occupation. But any member changing his or her address must immediately notify the secretary. Blank applications for membership can be obtained from the office of the company or any of its agents. The questions should be carefully read and the answers full and explicit, as the application forms the basis of agreement with the company.

In fire insurance and marine insurance, the thing insured is property; in life or accident insurance, it is the life or health of a person. In either case, neither the times and amounts of payments by the assured, nor the modes of estimating or securing the payment of the sum to be paid by the insurer, affect the question whether the agreement between them is a contract of insurance. All that is requisite to constitute such a contract is the payment of the consideration by the one, and the promise of the other to pay the amount of the insurance upon the happening of injury to the subject by a contingency contemplated in the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">The contract made between the Connecticut Mutual Benefit Company and each of its members, by the certificates of membership issued according to its charter, does not differ in any essential particular of form 'or substance from an ordinary policy of mutual life insurance. The subject insured is the life of the member. The risk insured is death from any cause not excepted in the terms of the contract. The assured pays a sum fixed by the directors and not exceeding ten dollars, at the inception of the contract, and assessments of two dollars each annually, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>of one dollar each upon the death of any member of the division to which he belongs, during the continuance of the risk. In case of the death of the assured by a peril insured against, the company absolutely promises to pay to his representatives, in sixty days after receiving satisfactory notice and proof of his death, \u201cas many dollars as there are members in\u201d the same division, the number of which is limited to five thousand. The payment of this sum is subject to no contingency but the insolvency of the corporation. The means of paying it are derived from the assessments collected upon his death from other members; from the money received upon issuing other certificates of membership, which the by-laws declare may, after payment of expenses, be \u201c used to cover losses caused by the delinquencies of members; \u201d and from the guaranty fund of one hundred thousand dollars, established by the corporation under its charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">This is not the less a contract of mutual insurance upon the life of the assured, because the amount to be paid by the corporation is not a gross sum, but a sum graduated by the number of members holding similar contracts ; nor because a portion of the premiums is to be paid upon the uncertain periods of the deaths of such members; nor because, in case of nonpayment of assessments by any member, the contract provides no means of enforcing payment thereof, but merely declares the contract to be at an end, and all moneys previously paid by the assured, and all dividends and credits accrued to him, to be forfeited to the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The fact, offered to be proved by the defendant, that the object of the organization was benevolent and not speculative, has no bearing upon the nature and effect of the business conducted and the contracts made by the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">The ruling that this association was an insurance company, within the meaning of the statute upon which the defendant was indicted, was therefore correct, and his</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">\n<em>Exceptions must be overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
