Horton <em>vs. </em>Edmund Buffinton.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b409-6\">The owner of a wagon sold it on a Lord\u2019s day to one who resold it to a third person, who was ignorant that his vendor had bought it on a Lord\u2019s day. <em>Seld} </em>that it was not liable to attachment in the hands of this buyer on a writ against the original owner.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-7\">Replevin of a wagon. At the trial in the superior court, before <em>Wilkinson, </em>J., it appeared that Jarvis B. Horton, the original owner of the wagon, sold and delivered it to Charles A. Horton, who subsequently sold it to the plaintiff ; and that, while in the plaintiff\u2019s hands, it was attached by the defendant, a deputy sheriff, on a writ against Jarvis B. Horton. There was evidence tending to show that the sale by Jarvis B. Horton to Charles A. Horton was on a Sunday.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-8\">The defendant requested the judge to instruct the jury that \u201cif Jarvis B. Horton undertook to sell the property to Charles A. Horton on Sunday, then Charles A. Horton acquired no title to it by that transaction, and could impart no title to the plaintiff, when he undertook to sell it to him, which the latter could set up against an attaching creditor of Jarvis B. Horton.\u201d The judge declined to give the instruction prayed for, and instructed the jury that \u201c if Charles A. Horton purchased the wagon on Sunday, and sold it to the plaintiff without informing him that it was purchased on Sunday, and the plaintiff was ignorant of that fact when he bought the wagon, and in no way participated in the transaction on Sunday, then he would acquire a title to the wagon by the sale from Charles A. Horton which he could set up against an attaching creditor of Jarvis B. Horton.\u201d The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number><em>G.

It is equally well settled, however, that after such a contract has been executed and carried into full effect, the law will not aid a party, who has paid money or delivered property in pursuance of' its terms, to reclaim what he has so parted with. The policy of the law is to leave the parties in all such cases without remedy against each other. The defence of illegality is allowed, \u201c not as a protection to the defendant, but as a disability in the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Meinrath, </em>101 Mass. 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">The case finds that the wagon in dispute, although it may be true that it was sold by Jarvis B. Horton on the Lord\u2019s day, was delivered to his brother, Charles A. Horton, was subsequently sold by the latter to the plaintiff, and was in the actual possession and use of the plaintiff at the time of the attachment by the defendant. In the absence of all evidence to the contrary, it may be assumed that the consideration of the first sale was paid. Under such circumstances it is difficult to see how the original vendor, Jarvis B. Horton, could have reclaimed it on the ground of any illegality in the contract of sale. The law would not aid him to undo what he had done. He could only impeach the sale by showing the illegality of his own act, which in the case of an executed and completed contract he certainly cannot do. This disability on his part to reclaim it would avail the party holding it, as a sufficient title. <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Meinrath, ubi supra. </em>It had ceased to be the original vendor\u2019s property, or liable for his debts, and therefore the attachment under which the defendant seeks to justify was wrongful. <em>King </em>v. <em>Green, </em>6 Allen, 139. <em>Claridge </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>v. <em>Hoare, 14. </em>Ves. 59. <em>Way </em>v.
