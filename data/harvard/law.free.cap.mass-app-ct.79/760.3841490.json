Sy\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings by a judge of the Superior Court that reversed the MCAD\u2019s findings and ruling that Sy had discriminated against Vanessa Ferguson in connection with her application for rental housing. The judge concluded that (1) Ferguson could not bring a discrimination claim based on Sy\u2019s rental of the second-floor apartment to another, and (2) that the first-floor apartment was not \u201cavailable\u201d because Sy had indicated only that it would become available at some indefinite time in the future. On appeal, the MCAD contends that the judge\u2019s decision failed to \u201cgive due weight to the experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge of the agency, as well as to the discretionary authority conferred upon it,\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7), inserted by St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 3, and thereby undermined the purpose of the fair housing law and the MCAD\u2019s authority to enforce it. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\"><em>Background. </em>Sy owned a two-family dwelling located at 97 Hazelton Street in the Mattapan section of Boston which she purchased in December, 2001, from Glen Williams, who continued to reside in the first-floor unit as a tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">On March 24, 2002, Ferguson saw an advertisement placed by Sy in the Boston Globe for a three-bedroom apartment rental at 97 Hazelton Street, and called to inquire that same day. Sy agreed to show Ferguson the apartment, which she did on the following day. While showing the second-floor apartment, Sy informed Ferguson that there was already an applicant and, pending an inspection, the apartment would be offered to that applicant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ferguson asked if the first-floor apartment was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>available, and Sy told her that the former owner (Williams) still resided in the unit, but it would be available in May or June.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ferguson called and requested a rental application a day or two later. She completed the application, omitting the ages of her children (she had four, ranging from two to fifteen years in age) and returned it to Sy on March 28, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Ferguson learned that the earlier applicant for the second-floor apartment was Carolyn Small, a childhood acquaintance. On April 5, 2002, Ferguson spoke with Small, who told her that Sy was considering Ferguson for the first-floor apartment and had asked Small about Ferguson\u2019s family status and reliability. On April 7, 2002, Sy called Ferguson and said that she noticed that Ferguson had failed to include the ages of her children in her application. When Ferguson asked why the ages were necessary, Sy told her that she could not rent to families with minor children; Ferguson told Sy she could not refuse to do so, but Sy refused to rent to her. On April 8, 2002, Ferguson filed a complaint against Sy with the MCAD for discriminatory refusal to rent based on familial status and lead paint.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">After an investigating MCAD commissioner found probable cause to credit Ferguson\u2019s allegations of discrimination based on familial status, the case was presented at a public hearing in August, 2005. As a result, an MCAD hearing officer found and ruled that Sy refused to rent to Ferguson on account of her children and engaged in unlawful housing discrimination in violation of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(11), as inserted by St. 1983, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>c. 628, \u00a7 3.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The hearing officer rejected Sy\u2019s contention that Sy herself had moved into the first-floor apartment prior to its being vacated by Williams, so as to invoke the exception based on owner-occupancy. The hearing officer awarded Ferguson damages of $10,000 for emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Sy sought review by the entire commission which, in May, 2007, affirmed the hearing officer\u2019s decision in its entirety. Sy then timely commenced an action in Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 6.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There, on Sy\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings, a judge reversed the MCAD\u2019s final decision as unsupported by substantial evidence. Specifically, in concluding that liability under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(11), was not shown, he ruled that the premises in question were not \u201cother covered housing accommodations\u201d as defined in G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1(13), inserted by St. 1963, c. 197, \u00a7 1, specifically because such housing unit was neither \u201cpublicly advertise[d] or offere[d],\u201d nor \u201cavailable\u201d for rent at a \u201ctime with any certainty.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>\u201cAn administrative agency\u2019s final decision is most commonly modified or set aside on judicial review where the court determines that the aggrieved party\u2019s substantial rights were prejudiced because the agency\u2019s decision was based upon an error of law, was unsupported by substantial evidence, or was arbitrary and capricious.\u201d <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>Suffolk County Sheriff\u2019s Dept., 62 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 187, 192 (2004). The standards of judicial review set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act, G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, also regulate judicial review of a final order of the MCAD. See G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 6. Like judicial review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>final decisions of other agencies, review of decisions of the MCAD requires \u201cdue weight [be given] to the experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge of the agency, as well as to the discretionary authority conferred upon it.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Generally, \u201c[t]he duty of statutory interpretation is for the courts . . . but an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute within its charge is accorded weight and deference .... Where the [agency\u2019s] statutory interpretation is reasonable . . . the court should not supplant [its] judgment.\u201d <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles, </em>425 Mass. 523, 525 (1997) (citations omitted), quoting from <em>Massachusetts Med. Soc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>402 Mass. 44, 62 (1988). In reviewing a statutory interpretation by an agency, \u201cwe must apply all rational presumptions in favor of the validity of the administrative action and not declare it void unless its provisions cannot by any reasonable construction be interpreted in harmony with the legislative mandate.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Fedn. of Teachers, AFT, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>436 Mass. 763, 771 (2002), quoting from <em>Consolidated Cigar Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>372 Mass. 844, 855 (1977). \u201c[A] \u2018[S]tate administrative agency in Massachusetts has considerable leeway in interpreting a statute it is charged with enforcing,\u2019 unless a statute unambiguously bars the agency\u2019s approach.\u201d <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Amesbury </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>457 Mass. 748, 760 (2010), quoting from <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Granby, </em>444 Mass. 627, 633 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">The MCAD has been given broad jurisdiction to administer and effectuate the provisions of antidiscrimination statutes. See <em>East Chop Tennis Club </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>364 Mass. 444, 446 (1973); <em>Rock </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>384 Mass. 198, 206 (1981). The Legislature has ordered that c. 15 IB \u201cshall be construed liberally for the accomplishment of its purposes.\u201d G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9, inserted by St. 1946, c. 368, \u00a7 4. The Supreme Judicial Court has recognized that it is \u201cparticularly appropriate to defer to the MCAD\u2019s interpretation [of G. L. c. 151B] where . . . the legislative policy is \u2018only broadly set out in the governing statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dahill </em>v. <em>Police Dept. of Boston, </em>434 Mass. 233, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>239-240 (2001) (citation omitted), quoting from <em>Rock, supra </em>at 204. See <em>Bynes </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Boston, </em>411 Mass. 264, 269 (1991) (MCAD\u2019s interpretations of G. L. c. 151B are \u201centitled to substantial deference\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Additionally, under the substantial evidence standard, the reviewing court must determine whether an agency decision is supported by \u201csuch evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1(6), inserted by St. 1954, c. 681, \u00a7 1. See <em>Gnerre </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>402 Mass. 502, 509 (1988). In determining whether substantial evidence exists to support the decision of the agency, the court must be \u201chighly deferential to the agency on questions of fact and reasonable inferences drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Flint </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>412 Mass. 416,420 (1992). The substantial evidence standard does not permit the reviewing court to substitute its judgment for that of the agency even if there is evidence to support the court\u2019s point of view. See <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 169, 172 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">As noted, the governing statute prohibits \u201cthe owner ... of . . . other covered housing accommodations ... to refuse to rent or lease or sell or otherwise to deny to or withhold from any person such accommodations because such person has a child or children who shall occupy the premises with such person . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 15 IB, \u00a7 4(11). The principal issue in this case, then, is whether the MCAD\u2019s interpretation of \u201cother covered housing accommodations\u201d to include the first-floor apartment owned by Sy was legally tenable, supported by substantial evidence, and consistent with statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">According to G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1(13), \u201cother covered housing accommodations\u201d include \u201call housing accommodations not specifically covered under subsections 10, 11 and 12,[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] which are directly or through an agent made generally available to the public for sale or lease or rental, by advertising in a newspaper or otherwise, by posting of a sign or signs or a notice or notices on the premises or elsewhere, by listing with a broker, or by any other means of public offering.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>Whether the first-floor apartment here was \u201cother covered housing accommodation\u201d depends on whether it was properly considered \u201cavailable\u201d when, in late March, Sy accepted an application from Ferguson for both apartments, telling her the first-floor apartment would become available in May or June.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">1. <em>Availability. </em>Finding that Ferguson established a prima facie case of discrimination in housing,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> specific to the pivotal \u201cavailability\u201d element, the hearing officer found that Ferguson \u201ctestified credibly that Respondent had told her the first-floor apartment at 97 Hazelton Street would be vacant in two months\u2019 time.\u201d The hearing officer expressly found that Ferguson asked if the first-floor apartment was available, and that Sy told her that the apartment would be available in May or June, 2002, when the former owner\u2019s daughter and grandson \u201cfinished out\u201d the school year. The hearing officer found that Ferguson, in fact, intended that the application she submitted to Sy be considered for both the first- and second-floor apartments at 97 Hazelton Street.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">However, the judge ruled that \u201cSy\u2019s non-publicly advertised offer to rent the first-floor apartment in the future only suggested of the apartment\u2019s availability, and is not substantial evidence upon which to base a determination that the apartment was \u2018available.\u2019 \u201d The judge explained further that: \u201cThis is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>particularly so considering that Sy stated that the apartment would be available in two months, but in reality it was not available for five months.\u201d Therefore, the judge concluded, there was no evidence that the apartment was \u201cavailable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">Under the circumstances, we conclude that Sy considered the first-floor apartment \u201cavailable.\u201d She informed Ferguson, in late March, that the apartment would be available in May or June. When Ferguson called Sy to tell her she wished to fill out a rental application, Sy met Ferguson in person and gave her one. Ferguson returned the application as Sy instructed, within three days. Ferguson subsequently learned that the applicant for the upstairs apartment was Small, whom she knew from childhood, and who told her that Sy was considering her (Ferguson) for the first-floor apartment and had asked Small about Ferguson\u2019s background. Therefore, Sy herself considered the first-floor apartment \u201cavailable\u201d because she stated it would be vacant shortly and she voluntarily handed out and took back at least one application from a potential tenant for that unit with the obvious intent of renting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">The judge\u2019s reversal of the MCAD decision because the apartment was not available \u201cin March or April\u201d but \u201cwas becoming available in the future, . . . [that it] was more of an expectation than a time with any certainty,\u201d failed to accord the deference due the specialized knowledge of the MCAD in its determination of what constituted \u201cavailable\u201d housing. The MCAD\u2019s interpretation is supported by substantial evidence and reasonably recognizes a reality of the housing market: that units are often shown to prospective tenants well before a current tenant\u2019s occupancy has ended, by landlords hoping for a seamless transition from one tenant to another. Ferguson understood that the first-floor apartment was not available for occupancy until the existing tenants left which, according to Sy, would be in May or June. Therefore, the judge\u2019s decision to reverse the MCAD on the basis that the apartment was not available was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">2. <em>Public offering. </em>The judge decided, as an additional ground for not enforcing the MCAD order, that the apartment was not \u201cmade generally available to the public ... by other means of public offering.\u201d However, the plaintiff failed to raise the issue whether the unit in question was made \u201cpublicly available,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>and the judge should not have considered the issue. \u201cNo objection that has not been urged before the commission shall be considered by the court, unless the failure or neglect to urge such objection shall be excused because of extraordinary circumstances.\u201d G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 6, inserted by St. 1946, c. 368, \u00a7 4. No extraordinary circumstances were urged by Sy or found by the judge. \u201cSince the [owner] failed to raise the issue . . . before the commission, [she] is precluded from raising it in [the] court.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>375 Mass. 160, 172 (1978). See <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 816, 819 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">Moreover, even if the issue were properly before us, we would disagree with this aspect of the judge\u2019s decision as well. Under c. 151B, \u00a7 1(13), \u201cother covered housing accommodations\u201d include housing accommodations \u201cmade generally available to the public for sale or lease or rental, by advertising in a newspaper or otherwise . . . or by any other means of public offering.\u201d The building was a two-family, nonowner-occupied building, which places it squarely within the purview of c. 15IB. As noted, Sy advertised the second-floor unit in a newspaper, clearly aimed \u201cgenerally\u201d at the \u201cpublic,\u201d and to which \u201cpublic offering\u201d Ferguson responded. Moreover, as a result of Sy\u2019s advertisement, which brought Ferguson to 97 Hazelton Street to view the second-floor apartment, Sy accepted an application for the first-floor apartment. When the judge stated that the apartment was not \u201cavailable to the public for rent by any means,\u201d he failed to consider that Ferguson was drawn to the building by means of a public advertisement, and Sy told her that the first-floor apartment would be available in May or June and accepted an application for both apartments. The judge\u2019s decision neither states nor suggests that the MCAD\u2019s interpretation is legally erroneous. Instead, the judge appears to have substituted his view that the statutory term \u201cother means of public offering\u201d excludes these facts without giving deference to the contrary view of the MCAD of the statute\u2019s applicability in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">When an advertisement for a particular apartment brings potential tenants from whom applications are solicited for other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>units, the MCAD\u2019s view that it is a \u201cpublic offering\u201d within the meaning of c. 151B, \u00a7 1(13), is reasonable and not in conflict with the governing legislation. To rule otherwise would be to frustrate the very purposes of G. L. c. 15 IB that the Legislature has ordered the MCAD to carry out; contrary to the legislative directive for liberal construction, the judge\u2019s narrow view of the statute would allow building owners to discriminate and evade the statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">On this record, we cannot say that the MCAD\u2019s decision is \u201cwholly lacking in evidentiary support or [is] tainted by errors of law,\u201d <em>Sweeney\u2019s Case, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 284, 286-287 (1975); that its administrative interpretation is not \u201cin harmony with the legislative mandate,\u201d <em>Consolidated Cigar Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>372 Mass, at 855; that it is devoid \u201cof any conceivable grounds upon which [it] may be upheld,\u201d <em>Colella </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn., </em>360 Mass. 152, 156 (1971); or that it is \u201cpatently wrong, unreasonable, arbitrary, whimsical, or capricious.\u201d <em>Brookline </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Dept. of Envtl. Quality Engr., </em>398 Mass. 404, 414 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">Consequently, the allowance of the plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings is reversed, and a judgment is to enter affirming the decision of the MCAD.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b797-8\"> In March, 2002, Carolyn Small applied for the apartment on the second floor. Sy accepted Small\u2019s application, contingent upon inspection by the Metropolitan Boston Housing Partnership. Small moved into the apartment around April 15, 2002. In July, 2005, Small moved out of the apartment because she would be raising her granddaughter and did not want Sy to have to remove the lead from the apartment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b798-7\"> As it turned out, Williams did not move out until August, 2002.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b798-8\"> The presence of lead paint in a dwelling unit does not constitute a defense to a charge of discrimination on the basis of children.
