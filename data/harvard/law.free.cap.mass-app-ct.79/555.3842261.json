Dobbins, of resisting arrest, G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 32B.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant appeals from that conviction, arguing that the judge\u2019s failure to give either a limiting instruction regarding which of the defendant\u2019s actions could constitute resisting arrest, or a unanimity instruction, resulted in a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-14\"><em>Background. </em>Based on the evidence at trial, the jury could have found the following facts. On May 3, 2003, a neighbor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>the defendant alerted Woburn police that a man he believed to be the defendant was driving erratically on their street. The police observed the reported vehicle in the driveway of the defendant\u2019s house. The defendant was seated inside the vehicle, talking on the telephone. A police officer approached, smelled the odor of alcohol, and saw several cans of beer in the car. The defendant\u2019s speech was slurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">The defendant left the car and began to walk away from the officer, toward the house. The officer followed and, concerned that the defendant was intoxicated and might later attempt to drive the vehicle, informed the defendant that he was \u201cgoing to be arrested.\u201d When the officer took hold of the defendant\u2019s arm, the defendant began to flail his arms. Another officer arrived, and while the officers attempted to handcuff the defendant, he started to \u201cfight\u201d them by \u201cswinging with his left hand and trying to push away and pull away and get away\u201d as well as \u201cpunching with a fist\u201d and \u201cswinging\u201d in the directions of the officers. One officer sustained a finger laceration and bruised elbow during the struggle.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The officers subdued the defendant with pepper spray, placed him on the ground, handcuffed him, and placed him in the back of the cruiser. On the way to the police station, the defendant kicked the door and window of the cruiser repeatedly. Once in the station, during booking, the defendant remained belligerent and continued swinging his fist. Due to this behavior, the defendant was placed in a cell before the booking process had been completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>The crime of resisting arrest<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> occurs at the time the arrest is \u201ceffected,\u201d i.e., when there \u201cis (1) \u2018an actual or constructive seizure or detention of the person, [2] performed with the intention to effect an arrest and [3] so understood by the person detained.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grandison, </em>433 Mass. 135, 145 (2001) (Grandison), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>419 Mass. 192, 198 (1994). In light of this, \u201ca resisting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>arrest conviction can, in no way, rest on postarrest conduct.\u201d <em>Grandison, supra. </em>On appeal, the defendant argues that, the judge having failed to explicitly instruct otherwise, \u201cthe jury may, at least in part, have rested their verdict on an event incapable of supporting a guilty verdict, i.e., the events at the station,\u201d thereby resulting in a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Grandison, supra </em>at 147. As the defendant neither requested a limiting instruction nor objected to its absence, we review for a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Here, the defendant\u2019s arrest was effected at his house, in a process that continued until police gained control of the defendant and placed him in the cruiser. See <em>Grandison, supra </em>at 146 (arrest was effectuated at the scene); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Katykhin, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 261, 262-263 (2003) (defendant\u2019s arrest effectuated when \u201che was fully detained in the cruiser\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ocasio, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 304, 306, 311 (2008) (process of \u201ceffecting\u201d arrest continued until defendant was placed in cruiser); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 735, 739 (2009) (Knight) (effecting an arrest \u201cends when the person is fully detained by his submission to official force <em>or placed in a secure location from which he can neither escape nor harm the police officer or others </em>nearby\u201d [emphasis supplied]).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">While the judge should have instructed the jury to consider only prearrest conduct in evaluating the resisting arrest charge, the facts here, when viewed in the context of a substantial risk analysis, are adequate to support our ultimate conclusion that the jury relied on \u201csolely the events at the scene in reaching their verdict.\u201d <em>Grandison, supra </em>at 147. Unlike in <em>Grandison, </em>where the prosecutor emphasized the defendant\u2019s postarrest conduct in her closing statement, here the prosecutor confined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>her arguments to prearrest conduct. Compare <em>Grandison, supra </em>at 146 (postarrest conduct \u201cfigured prominently in the prosecutor\u2019s closing,\u201d including references to a video of the defendant\u2019s postarrest conduct during booking). The prosecutor here, in contrast, focused both her opening and closing statements regarding the resisting arrest charge on what happened \u201cat that house that night,\u201d i.e., the defendant\u2019s prearrest conduct, and made no mention of the postarrest conduct in the police cruiser or station.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Similarly, though the judge did not explicitly instruct the jury to not consider the defendant\u2019s postarrest conduct, her instructions were of an order of magnitude better than those deemed deficient in <em>Grandison, supra </em>at 146-147, where the judge simply instructed the jury to consider \u201cthe evidence as a whole.\u201d Here, the judge instructed the jury that \u201ca person commits the crime of resisting arrest if he knowingly prevents or attempts to prevent a police officer . . . from effectuating an arrest of him . . . .\u201d The evidence was plain that the arrest had been effectuated by the time the defendant was secured in the cruiser. From these instructions, we discern no risk that \u201cthe judge implicitly authorized the jury to consider the events at the station in weighing the resisting arrest charge.\u201d <em>Grandison, supra </em>at 147. On the facts at hand, we likewise discern no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice in the judge\u2019s failure to give a limiting instruction,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> sua sponte.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b591-15\"> The outcomes of several other related charges are not relevant to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b592-7\"> The relevant portion of G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 32B, inserted by St. 1995, c. 276, provides: <em>\u201c(a) A </em>person commits the crime of resisting arrest if he knowingly prevents or attempts to prevent a police officer, acting under color of his official authority, from effecting an arrest of the actor or another, by: (1) using or threatening to use physical force or violence against the police officer or another . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b593-7\"> Because the defendant\u2019s arrest was fully effected when he was placed in the cruiser, the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that the defendant\u2019s conduct at the police station was part of a pattern of \u201ccontinuing conduct\u201d of resisting arrest is not persuasive. Cf. <em>Grandison, supra </em>at 147 (\u201cWe add that our determination here has no bearing on prosecutions based on a continuing course of conduct\u201d); <em>Knight, supra </em>at 740 (defendant\u2019s belligerent conduct was \u201ccontinuous,\u201d despite any brief pause, until he was placed in the cruiser, at which point the arrest was effected).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b593-8\"> The defendant does not dispute, nor could he, that his prearrest conduct rose to the level of \u201cresisting arrest\u201d under G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 32B.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b594-6\"> Specifically, the prosecutor stated, \u201cThis defendant was resisting arrest and that went on for minutes at that house that night on Pearl Street, minutes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b594-8\"> Having concluded with reasonable certainty that the jury relied solely on the defendant\u2019s prearrest conduct in reaching their verdict on the resisting arrest charge, we need not reach the defendant\u2019s argument that the judge erred in failing to give a unanimity instruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
