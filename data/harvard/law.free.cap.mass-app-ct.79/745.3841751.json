It appears that the defendant was not aware of the charges at that time. On November 2, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>1995, a warrant issued for the defendant. On April 14, 1997, the defendant was charged in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, with a variety of offenses, including assault by means of a dangerous weapon (a cord) and assault by means of a dangerous weapon (his hands) with intent to murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">On April 24, 1997, an officer of the Pawtucket, Rhode Island police department filed a \u201cFugitive Complaint\u201d against the defendant, attesting that the defendant: \u201cHAS FLED FROM JUSTICE IN THE STATE OF Massachusetts AND THAT (a) THE DEFENDANT IS CHARGED WITH COMMITTING THE CRIME OF Rape of child by force ON 10-25, 1995\u201d and that \u201cTHE STATE OF Massachusetts HAS GIVEN ASSURANCE THAT THEY WILL IMMEDIATELY COMMENCE RENDITION PROCEEDINGS AND WILL EXTRADITE THE . . . DEFENDANT TO THE DEMANDING STATE.\u201d On the same day, the defendant was arraigned on that complaint in a Rhode Island court, was advised of his rights, and chose not to waive extradition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">It appears that on May 23, 1997, a hearing was conducted in the Rhode Island court in which a representative of the district attorney\u2019s office said, \u201cI am confirming from a paralegal that New Bedford, Mass., wants this person. I am just waiting for a call.\u201d The defendant was brought to court again on June 30, 1997, and July 14, 1997, on the fugitive complaint. In another hearing on August 20, 1997, the judge apparently told the defendant that \u201cMassachusetts is not going to come and get you because you haven\u2019t waived extradition, and we don\u2019t have a pending governor\u2019s warrant and we can\u2019t release you until your pending felonies are taken care of.\u201d In March, 1999, the fugitive complaint was dismissed. The record shows no further action by the Commonwealth until December 18, 2006, when it applied for a governor\u2019s warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">The State of Rhode Island tried the defendant on its charges beginning on February 22, 1999; on March 2, 1999, a jury convicted the defendant. He received consecutive sentences of twenty and thirty years, with twelve years to serve, and eight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>and eighteen years suspended, and eight and eighteen years of probation upon release.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">On November 14, 2006, the defendant was notified that he would be paroled. On December 8, 2006, a Rhode Island State trooper informed a representative of the office of the district attorney for the Bristol district in Massachusetts that Rhode Island had the defendant in custody on an outstanding warrant from Massachusetts. On December 14, 2006, the defendant refused to waive extradition. On December 18, 2006, the district attorney for the Bristol district applied for a warrant from the governor of Rhode Island. The warrant issued on January 22, 2007, and on January 30, 2007, the governor of Rhode Island ordered that the defendant be extradited to Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">The defendant was arraigned in the New Bedford Division of the District Court Department on February 16, 2007. On February 1, 2008, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss, claiming that his rights to a speedy trial under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 11 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights had been violated. After a hearing, the motion was denied on March 10, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">Trial began on April 25, 2008, twelve and one-half years after the initial filing of the complaint, and on April 28, 2008, a jury convicted the defendant. On May 12, 2008, the trial judge sentenced the defendant to two consecutive terms of two and one-half years in the house of correction. The defendant filed a motion for new trial on March 2, 2009, based in part on the denial of his right to a speedy trial; the judge who had presided at trial denied the motion on July 13, 2009. The defendant\u2019s appeals from the judgments and the order denying his motion for new trial were consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\"><em>Discussion. </em>The United States Supreme Court has established a nonexhaustive four-factor test to determine whether a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial under the Sixth Amendment has been violated: (1) the length of the delay; (2) the reason for the delay; (3) the defendant\u2019s assertion of the right; and (4) prejudice to the defendant. <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 530 (1972).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Massachusetts applies the same test when analyzing claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>under art. 11 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Look, </em>379 Mass. 893, 897-898, cert, denied, 449 U.S. 827 (1980). In 1992, the United States Supreme Court held that when there has been an excessive or extraordinarily long delay caused primarily by government negligence, prejudice may be presumed. <em>Doggett </em>v. <em>United States, </em>505 U.S. 647, 655, 657-658 (1992) <em>(Doggett). </em>In such circumstances, unless the defendant acquiesced to the delay or the Commonwealth can rebut the presumption of prejudice, the defendant is entitled to relief. <em>Id. </em>at 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">We think it beyond argument that the twelve and one-half year delay was extraordinary. See <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Wingo, supra </em>at 530-531. \u201c[Ejxcessive delay presumptively compromises the reliability of a trial in ways that neither party can prove or, for that matter, identify.\u201d <em>Doggett, supra </em>at 655. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Green, </em>353 Mass. 687, 689 (1968) (twelve year delay where Commonwealth took no action to bring defendant to trial resulted in dismissal of indictments under art. 11).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">The Commonwealth argues that the <em>Doggett </em>decision is distinguishable because the defendant in <em>Doggett </em>did not know of the charges and could not assert a right to speedy trial, but that here, the defendant was aware of the charges and so his failure to assert his speedy trial right, a failure reinforced by his refusal to waive extradition, should be considered a significant factor in the analysis. See <em>Doggett, supra </em>at 653. Accordingly, the Commonwealth urges us to require that the defendant establish that he has been prejudiced from the delay. We disagree. The defendant\u2019s assertion of the right is a factor to consider; however, the defendant is not responsible for bringing himself to trial. See <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Wingo, supra </em>at 527 (\u201cA defendant has no duty to bring himself to trial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">The defendant\u2019s decision not to waive extradition in April, 1997, when the Rhode Island court issued the fugitive complaint does not mean that he waived his speedy trial right for eleven years. It would have been a relatively simple matter for the Commonwealth to obtain a governor\u2019s warrant, as it did successfully in January, 2007. Although there is certainly no indication that the Commonwealth attempted to thwart the defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial, and while negligence by the government weighs less <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>heavily than a deliberate attempt to delay trial, the ultimate responsibility rests with the government. See <em>id. </em>at 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">The Commonwealth also argues that this case is controlled by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferreira, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 67 (1988), where the defendant twice refused to waive extradition. <em>Id. </em>at 69-70. We concluded in <em>Ferreira </em>that the defendant was not prejudiced by a delay of two years, where the Commonwealth did not properly comply with the Interstate Agreement on De-tainers, because he had been able to move from a maximum to a minimum security setting and to obtain work release, furlough privileges, and ultimately parole, none of which would have been available to him had the detainer been lodged. <em>Id. </em>at 69-71. We do not think that <em>Ferreira </em>controls this case. <em>Ferreira </em>concerned a two-year delay, not an extraordinary delay of more than twelve years. Moreover, <em>Ferreira </em>predates <em>Dogged1 </em>s holding concerning the impact of extraordinary delay on the speedy trial analysis. See <em>Doggett, supra </em>at 657-658.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">In the circumstances of this case, prejudice is presumed from the twelve and one-half year delay.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he right to a speedy trial contemplates that the Commonwealth will take reasonable action to prevent undue delay in bringing a defendant to trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGrath, </em>348 Mass. 748, 752 (1965). Furthermore, even a \u201cmere\u201d nine year and ten month delay between the defendant\u2019s choice not to waive extradition and the Commonwealth\u2019s application for a governor\u2019s warrant is not reasonable, where the Commonwealth was aware of the defendant\u2019s location.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">Even though we presume prejudice, \u201csuch presumptive prejudice cannot alone carry a Sixth Amendment claim without regard to the other <em>Barker </em>[v. Wingo] criteria[;] it is part of the mix of relevant facts, and its importance increases with the length of delay.\u201d <em>Doggett, supra </em>at 656 (citation omitted). Here, as in <em>Doggett, </em>where the portion of the delay attributable to the Commonwealth\u2019s negligence far exceeds the threshold<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> needed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>to state a speedy trial claim, and where the presumption of prejudice is neither extenuated by the defendant\u2019s acquiescence nor persuasively rebutted by the Commonwealth, the defendant is entitled to relief. See <em>id. </em>at 658.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">\n<em>Verdicts set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">\n<em>Judgments shall enter for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b781-14\"> The complaint originally charged two counts of rape of a child by force, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22A, and two counts of indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen years of age, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B. Before trial in 2008, the charges of rape were reduced to indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen years of age, and those charges subsequently were dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b782-8\"> When trial counsel for the defendant moved to dismiss the complaint in 2008 because of the delay in bringing the defendant to trial, he was not aware of the facts concerning the fugitive from justice complaint, including any communication from the office of the district attorney for the Bristol district.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b783-9\"> Other contextual considerations might include the seriousness of the crime and the complexity of the case. See <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Wingo, supra </em>at 531.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b785-8\"> Even if the defendant were required to establish prejudice, however, we think such prejudice is readily apparent, as the defendant faced witnesses with memory problems, missing witnesses, and unavailable documentation. The Commonwealth\u2019s argument that some of the memory problems were the defendant\u2019s misses the mark.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b785-9\"> This threshold has been described as the difference between ordinary delay and presumptively prejudicial delay. See <em>Doggett, </em>505 U.S. at 656-658.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b786-8\"> In light of the result we reach, we need not consider the defendant\u2019s other issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
