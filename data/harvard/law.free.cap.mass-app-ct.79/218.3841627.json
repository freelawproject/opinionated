Regs. \u00a7 520.007(J)(4) (2006). The mother, plaintiff Janette Forman (mother), was a nursing home resident who applied to the defendant, the Director of the Office of Medicaid, for MassHealth<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> benefits to cover the cost of her long-term nursing care. MassHealth denied the mother\u2019s application for nursing home benefits from October 28, 2008, to January 9, 2009, due to a disqualifying transfer of $20,000 from the mother to her daughter, Fran Rachlin (daughter). The mother appealed to the Office of Medicaid Board of Hearings (board), which also denied the application. A judge of the Superior Court affirmed that decision, and the plaintiff appealed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\"><em>Facts. </em>On July 9, 2007, the mother entered into a personal services contract with her daughter. The daughter, who had previously provided certain services to the mother without compensation,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>was also the mother\u2019s attorney-in-fact pursuant to a durable power of attorney. At the time that the contract was executed, the mother was eighty-three years old and her health had started to deteriorate to the point that it was \u201cincreasingly difficult for her to complete everyday tasks alone.\u201d Under the terms of the contract, the daughter agreed to provide the mother with room, board, and certain personal care services, including preparation of all meals, housekeeping, household laundry, and transportation to doctors\u2019 appointments.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">In exchange for these services, the mother transferred $20,000 to the daughter in a lump-sum payment upon execution of the contract. As part of the contract, the daughter could terminate the contract if the mother \u201cengage[d] in behavior that [wa]s a threat to the mental and/or physical health or safety of herself or others living on the premises\u201d or was \u201cno longer able to \u2018assist\u2019[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] . . . with her own personal hygiene needs such as bathing, dressing, eating, toileting.\u201d If the daughter terminated the contract for either of these reasons, or if the mother died, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>daughter was entitled to \u201cretain the full amount of all payments\u201d made by the mother to the daughter, regardless of when termination of the contract or the mother\u2019s death occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The contract did not expressly contain any language quantifying the amount of hours to be worked by the daughter per week or any other measurable period. Additionally, the contract had no specific duration. Rather, it was to \u201ccontinue in effect until the services and/or level of care assessed [as of the date of the contract] vary or until terminated.\u201d There was also no provision about the quality of the services to be provided to the mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">The daughter, who was a full-time teacher, testified that she slept at her mother\u2019s home and prepared lunch and dinner for her. She also ordered and picked up her mother\u2019s prescriptions, bathed her, and performed housekeeping chores.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">On August 6, 2008, a little more than a year after the contract between the mother and the daughter was executed, the mother was admitted into a nursing home. The mother applied to Mass-Health on November 10, 2008, requesting MassHealth nursing home benefits retroactive to October 28, 2008. MassHealth declared the mother ineligible for benefits between October 28, 2008, and January 9, 2009, based upon the mother\u2019s $20,000 lump-sum payment to the daughter. MassHealth determined this ineligibility period by dividing the amount of the disqualifying transfer, $20,000, by the average daily private nursing home rate, $267.</p>\n<p id=\"A81\">The mother appealed MassHealth\u2019s denial of nursing home benefits before January 10, 2009, to the board. On June 30, 2009, the board denied the mother\u2019s appeal, affirming Mass-Health\u2019s determination that the mother\u2019s $20,000 lump-sum payment to the daughter was a disqualifying transfer under 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 520.007(J)(4). The board concluded that \u201cwhile the [c]ontract may be a legal one, it is not for fair market [value] as it is not both \u2018legally and reasonably enforceable by the applicant.\u2019 \u201d The hearing officer concluded that the contract between the mother and the daughter was \u201cmerely a device to preserve the [mother\u2019s] assets for her family while she prepare[d] to apply for public assistance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">The mother subsequently appealed the board\u2019s decision to the Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, and moved for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>judgment on the pleadings. On April 7, 2010, a Superior Court judge affirmed the board\u2019s decision, holding that \u201csubstantial evidence supports the hearing officer\u2019s conclusion that [the mother\u2019s] payment of $20,000.00 to [the daughter] was a disqualifying transfer because the [c]ontract was not reasonably enforceable, and would support the same conclusion because the [c]ontract had no ascertainable fair-market value.\u201d The mother now appeals to this court, contending that the board\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\"><em>Standard of review. </em>The mother, as appellant, has the burden of proof \u201cto demonstrate the invalidity of the administrative determination.\u201d <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Division of Med. Assistance, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 228, 231 (2007). In evaluating the administrative determination, the court is also to \u201cgive \u2018due weight to the experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge of the agency, as well as to the discretionary authority conferred upon it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Springfield </em>v. <em>Department of Telecommunications &amp; Cable, </em>457 Mass. 562, 567 (2010), quoting from G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7). This means that \u201c[a] court may not displace an administrative board\u2019s choice between two fairly conflicting views, even though the court would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before it de novo.\u201d <em>Embers of Salisbury, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>401 Mass. 526, 529 (1988), quoting from <em>School Comm. of Wellesley </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>376 Mass. 112, 120 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The agency\u2019s decision must, however, be supported by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d which is defined as \u201csuch evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7), \u00a7 1(6). In reviewing an agency\u2019s decision for substantial evidence, \u201c[t]he court shall make the foregoing determinations upon consideration of the entire record, or such portions of the record as may be cited by the parties.\u201d <em>Fortier </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>342 Mass. 728, 734 (1961), quoting from G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">In sum, reasonable interpretations by an agency of its governing law, which are supported by substantial evidence, must be respected.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\"><em>Overview of Medicaid program. </em>Medicaid \u201cis a cooperative Federal and State program which provides payment for medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>services to eligible individuals and families.\u201d <em>Haley </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>394 Mass. 466, 467 (1985). The Medicaid program is specifically designed to meet the medical needs of individuals \u201cwhose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services[.]\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396(1) (2006). As previously noted in the margin, Mass-Health is the agency within the Commonwealth \u201cresponsible for the administration and delivery of health-care services to low- and moderate-income individuals.\u201d 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 515.002(A). To receive Federal funding, MassHealth regulations and practices must comply with all requirements imposed by Federal Medicaid law. <em>Haley, supra </em>at 467, citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396. See <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Div. of Med. Assistance, </em>423 Mass. 399,402 (1996); 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 515.002(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">MassHealth provides nursing home benefits for individuals who meet certain criteria. \u201cUnderstandably, an elder would prefer to pass along accumulated wealth to the next generation rather than use it to provide her own nursing home expenses, especially if a State program is available to help pick up the cost. Consequently, strict rules have been promulgated which have the effect of limiting the amount of assets that applicants can dispose of without affecting their eligibility for assistance.\u201d <em>Andrews, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. at 229. Among other requirements for eligibility, applicants must have no more than $2,000 in \u201ccountable assets.\u201d 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 520.003(A) (2004). See <em>Shelales </em>v. <em>Director of the Office of Medicaid, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 636, 637 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">\u201cAs part of its determination of eligibility for long-term care benefits, the department enumerates certain disqualifying transfers of resources.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 638, citing 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 520.019(C) (2006). MassHealth reviews an applicant\u2019s transfers of resources during a statutorily-created \u201clook-back period\u201d prior to the individual\u2019s application. \u201cUnder 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396p(c) (2006), G. L. c. 118E, \u00a7 28, and the implementing State regulations, 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 520.018 (2006) and 520.019 (2006), the department will deny an application for nursing home benefits when the applicant has transferred an asset for less than fair market value . . . [within] sixty months preceding the date when the applicant is both a nursing facility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>resident and has applied for or is receiving MassHealth standard medical assistance.\u201d <em>Shelales, supra </em>at 638. MassHealth regulations stipulate that a transfer stemming from a contract for future services to an applicant is a \u201cdisqualifying transfer of assets to the extent that the transaction does not have an ascertainable fair-market value or if the transaction is not embodied in a valid contract that is legally and reasonably enforceable by the applicant.\u201d 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 520.007(J)(4). If Mass-Health determines a disqualifying transfer has occurred, it deems the applicant ineligible for nursing home benefits for a period of time \u201cequal to the total value of the transferred assets divided by the average monthly cost to a private patient receiving nursing home services in Massachusetts.\u201d <em>Shelales, supra </em>at 638, citing 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 520.019(G)(1) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\"><em>Application of the substantial evidence test. </em>We conclude that there was substantial evidence in the record to affirm the board\u2019s determination that the mother\u2019s lump-sum payment to the daughter was a disqualifying transfer under 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 520.007(J)(4), because the July 9, 2007, personal services contract does not have an ascertainable fair market value. We reach this conclusion based on our review of the contract and the record evidence as a whole. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7) (\u201cThe court shall make the foregoing determinations upon consideration of the entire record\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As we uphold the board\u2019s determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>tion that the transaction does not have an ascertainable fair market value, we need not address the alternative ground of whether the contract is \u201clegally and reasonably enforceable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\"><em>Requirement that contract have an ascertainable fair market value. </em>MassHealth regulations define fair market value as \u201can estimate of the value of a resource if sold at a prevailing price.\u201d 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 515.001 (2007). Yet here we cannot fairly estimate the value of the contract because it was self-contradictory, sketchy, and skewed in favor of the daughter\u2019s retention of the upfront payment regardless of the services provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">As a preliminary matter, we note that the contract for personal services was entered into by the mother with the daughter, who \u201chad been providing care to her mother prior to the contract as well\u201d without compensation. There were also substantial discrepancies between the contract and the services actually provided. The language of the contract between the mother and the daughter specified certain services to be provided by the daughter, a full-time teacher, to the mother, including room and board and the preparation of three meals per day. Despite these contractual provisions, the record indicates that the mother provided her own lodging and her own breakfast. Furthermore, the record indicates that the mother received services from Bristol Elder Services three days per week. Given this information, we find that the hearing officer was justified in stating, \u201cEven though I have found that the daughter had provided some of the tasks listed on the [cjontract, it is unclear as to what value, if any these were to the [mother].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The language and provisions of the contract are also important for what they omit. The contract does not quantify the number of hours per week to be worked by the daughter in caring for the mother, nor does it provide a likely duration for which the $20,000 lump-sum payment was contemplated. Because we evaluate the fair market value \u201cbased on the prevailing price at the time of transfer,\u201d the contract\u2019s \u201cascertainable fair-market <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>value\u201d is therefore highly uncertain. 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 515.001.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The contract provision that entitled the daughter to retain the mother\u2019s $20,000 lump-sum payment if the mother was unable to assist in her care or became a safety risk further obscures the fair market valuation of the contract. If the daughter elected to terminate the contract for these reasons, or if the mother died at any point in time following the execution of the contract, the daughter was entitled to retain the full $20,000 regardless of services performed to date. This could occur at any point in time, including on day one of the contract. Cf. <em>E.S. </em>v. <em>Division of Med. Assistance &amp; Health Servs., </em>412 N.J. Sup. 340, 354 (N.J. App. Div. 2010) (court found contract not for fair market value, emphasizing that \u201cshould the \u2018resident\u2019 die, the caregiver is entitled to full payment [of $56,550 advance payment], regardless of services rendered\u201d even if resident died on first day of contract). The contract also does not contain any language providing for a refund of any of the lump-sum payment to the mother under any circumstances, including the daughter\u2019s failure to provide the services for which the payment was made. Cf. <em>In the Matter of Barbato, </em>65 A.D.3d 821 (N.Y. App. Div. 2009) (in the absence of refund provision, lump-sum payment for lifetime services found not for fair market value and reduced to value of nonduplicative services actually provided).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">We therefore conclude that the board reasonably determined, based on substantial evidence, that the contract between the mother and the daughter here was not for fair market value and was therefore a disqualifying transfer. In so concluding, we are not in any way suggesting that all lump-sum prepaid contracts or all contracts between family members for personal services are disqualified. Our decision is limited to those contracts in which compensation does not reflect fair market value, as was the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the aforementioned reasons, we conclude that the mother has not demonstrated the invalidity of the administrative decision disqualifying the transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b255-7\"> \u201cThe MassHealth agency is responsible for the administration and delivery of health care services to low- and moderate-income individuals . . . 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 515.002(A) (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b255-9\"> The nature and extent of the daughter\u2019s services prior to the date of the contract are unclear from the limited record before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b255-10\"> According to the contract, \u201cthe term \u2018assist\u2019 means walk with a walker to the bathroom for a bath, and sit up in bed or in a chair unassisted, raising her arms upward to put on a sweater.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b259-6\"> Here our review is hampered by the fact that the mother has not submitted a transcript from the board hearing as part of the record before us as required by Superior Court Standing Order 1-96. The mother contends that review of the transcript of the board hearing is unnecessary because any such transcript merely contains \u201cprimarily procedural discussions related to the extension of time for filing memorandfa].\u201d In four of nine findings of fact by the hearing officer, however, he referenced testimony, although in two of those four findings, he cited exhibits as well. The two facts for which he cites only testimony are (1) that the daughter had been providing care to the mother prior to contract, \u201calthough not to the same extent\u201d and (2) that the mother \u201creceived services from Bristol Elder Services three days per week.\u201d Neither of these facts appears to be contested. Nonetheless, as the Supreme Judicial Court found in <em>Covell </em>v. <em>Department of Social Servs., </em>439 Mass. 766, 782 (2003), the rule \u201c[t]hat a transcript must be submitted to support a claim that the evidence was insufficient is not some hypertechnical requirement, but a reflection of the fact that resolution of such a claim requires the reviewing court to see the entirety of the evidence that was presented.\u201d As such, this ground may provide an independent basis on which we may affirm the board\u2019s decision. Because, as was the case in <em>Covell, </em>the available record before us sufficiently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>demonstrates that the board\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence, we need not depend on this rationale to decide this case. See <em>id. </em>at 783 (holding that department should prevail based upon inadequate record submitted by plaintiff but ultimately disposing of plaintiff\u2019s claims based upon sufficient evidence in underlying record).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
