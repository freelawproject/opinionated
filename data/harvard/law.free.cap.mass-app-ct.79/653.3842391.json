(French King or plaintiff), appeals from the allowance of two motions for summary judgment in favor of the defendant, Interstate Fire and Casualty Company (Interstate or defendant), that dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The first Superior Court judge ruled that the defendant had no obligation to indemnify French King under the relevant policy for a fire loss because it did not properly \u201cmaintain\u201d a certain fire suppression system required by the policy. The second Superior Court judge ruled that French King was required to return to Interstate advance payments it made under the policy. The primary issue presented requires interpretation of an endorsement to the policy that requires, as a condition to coverage, that French King \u201cmaintain\u201d a fire suppression system, and of its two exclusions from coverage. Specifically, the defendant contends that the duty to maintain the fire suppression system included a duty to upgrade the plaintiff\u2019s dry system, which the manufacturer considered to be obsolete. The plaintiff argues to the contrary, saying that the authorized suppression system maintenance company it hired continued to service the dry system and to certify it as operational. On the motion record submitted and viewed in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, the first judge agreed with the defendant that the plaintiff failed to maintain a fire suppression system.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This appeal followed. We affirm, but upon grounds different than the first judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">A. <em>Background. </em>French King owns real property and operates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>the French King Restaurant (restaurant) in Erving; at all times relevant Frank Prondecki had management responsibilities for the restaurant. A Kidde HDR 50 dry chemical fire suppression system (Kidde system) was installed in the kitchen before French King took ownership of the restaurant in 1974.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">On April 3, 2005, Interstate issued the commercial lines insurance policy in question to French King, effective until April 3, 2006. Relevant to the issue herein, the policy contained a protective safeguards endorsement (PSE) added to the commercial property coverage conditions, that provided, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-6\">\u201cAs a condition of this insurance, you are required to maintain the protective devices or services listed in the Schedule above [e.g., ANSUL SYSTEM OR EQUIVALENT). . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-7\">\u201cThe following is added to the EXCLUSIONS section of . . . CAUSES OF LOSS \u2014 SPECIAL FORM[:] ... We will not pay for loss or damage caused by or resulting from fire if, prior to the fire, you:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-8\">\u201c1. Knew of any suspension or impairment in any protective safeguard listed in the Schedule above and failed to notify us of that fact; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-9\">\u201c2. Failed to maintain any protective safeguard listed in the Schedule above, and over which you had control, in complete working order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">The defendant issued the policy pursuant to an application of insurance (application), dated March 7, 2005, submitted on behalf of the plaintiff and signed by Prondecki. In the general information section of the application the plaintiff was asked in question number 6 whether any insurer had declined coverage, or had canceled or not renewed an insurance policy in the prior three years; Prondecki answered in the affirmative, disclosing that on April 3,2002, MassWest had done so because its \u201c[u]nder-writing guideline required a \u2018wet\u2019 Ansul system.\u201d Question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>number 9 asked if there were \u201cany uncorrected fire code violations\u201d; the application answer was, \u201cNo.\u201d In the application\u2019s property section, specifically, the additional coverages, options, restrictions, endorsements and rating information section, Prondecki stated: \u201cAnsul System in place\u201d;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in a separate section of the application entitled \u201cadditional information section \u2018E,\u2019 \u201d Prondecki stated that the property did not \u201chave [any] outstanding building, sanitary, fire or other code violations which have been brought to the attention of the property owner in writing by a state, city or town inspector.\u201d Finally, Prondecki signed the application directly under the warning: \u201cAny willful concealment or misrepresentation of material fact or circumstances hereon may void the policy. Signed under the pains and penalties of pequry.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">With respect to the Kidde system in place in the restaurant, Kidde Fire Systems had issued a bulletin to \u201cAll Kidde Pre-Engineered Distributors\u201d dated February 11, 2002, advising that as of that date, Kidde Fire Systems would \u201cno longer support the installation, inspection, service, recharge or repair of dry chemical systems protecting kitchen appliances and ventilation.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The bulletin further stated that approximately two years prior to the date of the bulletin issue, i.e., in 2000, Kidde Fire Systems had recommended that the dry chemical systems be upgraded to the Kidde APC wet chemical (UL300) systems, and that Kidde Fire Systems had phased out the inventory of the HDR dry chemical systems parts. According to the bulletin, \u201c[w]hen encountering a dry chemical system protecting kitchen appliances and ventilation, the only acceptable action is to upgrade to a UL300 wet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>chemical system.\u201d Thus, as of February 11, 2002, the Kidde system present at the restaurant for the purposes of protecting the kitchen appliances could no longer be inspected, serviced, recharged, or repaired.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Furthermore, the department of fire services for the Executive Office of Public Safety stated in an August 26, 2004, memorandum that in order for a fire suppression system to be in compliance with Massachusetts code (527 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.03[8]), the \u201csystem is to be installed, maintained and tested in accordance with [National Fire Protection Association] NFPA 96, 2001 edition. . . . Section 10.2.3 [of NFPA 96] requires the fire suppression system to be compliant with UL300 standard.\u201d The memorandum noted that \u201c[d]ry chemical extinguishing systems ... are found to be ineffective on cooking oil fires (deep fat fryers) [and that] [t]hese systems no longer have parts available by the manufacturers and in some cases have been delisted by Underwriter\u2019s Laboratories.\u201d As a result, such systems \u201cwill need to be upgraded to a UL300 compliant system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">After a semiannual inspection by Fire Pro-Tec N.E., Inc.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (Fire Pro-Tec), Fire Pro-Tec sent a letter dated November 14, 2003, to the \u201cowner/manager\u201d of the restaurant, warning that the fire suppression system at the restaurant was not in accordance with current NFPA requirements and not in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s UL listing on the system.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> At that time, Fire Pro-Tec provided its first estimate for installing a compliant wet fire suppression system, at a cost of $3,250. Furthermore, on or about June 10, 2004, Fire Pro-Tec also had issued a \u201crange hood systems inspection report\u201d regarding the restaurant, at the top of which stated, \u201cNoncompliance.\u201d In this report, Fire Pro-Tec again advised that the fire suppression <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>system was not UL300 listed, that certain testing was due to be performed, and that there were structural changes that were required to the system. Prondecki signed the report, acknowledging receipt of the report and, implicitly, that Fire Pro-Tec had informed him that the fire suppression system was determined to be in \u201cNoncompliance\u201d with the current NFPA requirements and not in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s UL300 listing on this system. Prondecki asserts, however, that he never was informed by Fire Pro-Tec, orally or in writing, that his system was not operational and that Fire Pro-Tec did not explain the meaning of the term \u201cnoncompliance.\u201d He considered the report and estimate for system upgrades as recommendations only.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Shortly after the issuance of the insurance policy at issue, the \u201cmanager\u201d of the restaurant again was informed by Fire Pro-Tec, in a letter dated June 23, 2005, that the fire suppression system at the restaurant was not in accordance with the current NFPA requirements or the manufacturer\u2019s UL listing on the system. According to this letter, in order to bring the Kidde system into compliance with the current standards, installation of a new automatic liquid (wet) fire suppression system was required. At that time, Fire Pro-Tec provided a second estimate at installing the wet fire suppression system, for a cost of $3,695.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Finally, in June, 2005, the building inspector of Erving advised French King that the system previously had been \u201cred tagged\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> as of June 10, 2004, and, as a result, he could not issue a certificate of inspection until French King had the system fixed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> While Prondecki claims not to have been informed previously of the presence of a \u201cred tag\u201d on the system, and that he did not know the meaning of a \u201cred tag,\u201d he knew from this inspector that if he did not get the system \u201cfixed,\u201d the restaurant would not be able to renew its liquor, food, and health licenses that were scheduled to expire in January of 2006. However, Prondecki never requested any other entity to reinspect the fire suppression system to confirm whether Fire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>Pro-Tec was correct in issuing a \u201cred tag\u201d on the system. Although Prondecki had obtained replacement quotes in November of 2003 and June of 2005 for a new fire suppression system, nothing further was done with respect to the system before the fire on October 12, 2005,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and the system failed to function at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">In a letter dated February 28, 2006, French King, through counsel, made a demand, in writing, for payment under the policy. In a letter dated April 4, 2006, Interstate, also through counsel, declined, citing as reason that the plaintiff failed to comply with the PSE of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">B. <em>Discussion. </em>The issue at the heart of this case is the interpretation of terms in the PSE that required French King to \u201cmaintain\u201d the restaurant\u2019s fire suppression system as a condition to coverage, and that also included two exclusions from coverage: one required the insured to \u201cmaintain\u201d its system in \u201ccomplete working order\u201d; the other required the insured to notify the insurer in the event that the fire suppression system was suspended or impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">\u201cThe standard of review of a grant of summary judgment is whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, all material facts have been established and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Augat, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>410 Mass. 117, 120 (1991), citing Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). An appellate court reviewing a grant of summary judgment must examine its allowance de novo and from the same record as the motion judge. <em>Matthews </em>v. <em>Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc., </em>426 Mass. 122, 123 n.1 (1997). The record is open to \u201cindependent consideration\u201d on appeal, and the appellate court may make its own determination from the record to decide the ultimate questions of the correctness of summary judgment. <em>Ibid. </em>This court may affirm a motion judge\u2019s ruling on any ground, even if it differs from the reason relied upon by the judge. <em>Hawthorne\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Warrenton Realty, Inc., </em>414 Mass. 200, 210 n.6 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">Once the moving party establishes the absence of a triable issue, the party opposing the motion must respond and allege <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>specific facts establishing the existence of a genuine issue of material fact. Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(e). See <em>Madsen </em>v. <em>Erwin, </em>395 Mass. 715, 719 (1985); <em>Godbout </em>v. <em>Cousens, </em>396 Mass. 254, 261 (1985). The nonmoving party cannot defeat the motion for summary judgment by \u201crestfing] on his or her pleadings and mere assertions of disputed facts.\u201d <em>LaLonde </em>v. <em>Eissner, </em>405 Mass. 207, 209 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">It is well settled that the \u201cinterpretation of an insurance contract is a question of law for the court.\u201d <em>Kelleher </em>v. <em>American Mut. Ins. Co., </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 501, 503 (1992). \u201cLike all contracts, insurance contracts are to be construed according to the fair and reasonable meaning of the words in which the agreement of the parties is expressed. ... A policy of insurance whose provisions are plainly and definitely expressed in appropriate language must be enforced in accordance with its terms.\u201d <em>Cody </em>v. <em>Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co., </em>387 Mass. 142, 146 (1982) (quotations and citations omitted). Unambiguous words in a policy must be enforced according to its terms. <em>Barnstable County Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Lally, </em>374 Mass. 602, 605 (1978). Doubts created by any ambiguous words or provisions, however, are resolved against the insurer in order not to defeat intended coverage or diminish the protection purchased by the insured. <em>Camp Dresser &amp; McKee, Inc. </em>v. <em>Home Ins. Co., </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 318, 324 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">An insured generally bears the burden of proving that a particular claim falls within a policy\u2019s coverage, <em>Markline Co. </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>384 Mass. 139, 140 (1981), while an insurer has the burden of proving the applicability of a particular exclusion, see <em>Hanover Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Talhouni, </em>413 Mass. 781, 785 (1992); <em>Great S.W. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hercules Bldg. &amp; Wrecking Co., </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 298, 302 (1993). The terms of an exclusionary clause will be upheld when \u201cnot reasonably susceptible of more than one meaning.\u201d <em>Mitcheson </em>v. <em>Izdepski, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 903, 905 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">1. <em>Requirements under the PSE. </em>We agree that summary judgment was proper, but for reasons different from those relied upon by the first judge.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As an initial matter, we agree with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>French King that the word \u201cmaintain,\u201d as it is used in the condition to coverage, is ambiguous and must be interpreted in a manner favorable to the plaintiff. When an insurance application is ambiguous, such that there is more than one rational interpretation of the policy language, it should be construed in favor of the party to be insured. <em>Hingham Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Mercurio, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 21, 24 (2008). \u201cHowever, an ambiguity is not created simply because a controversy exists between the parties, each favoring an interpretation contrary to the other.\u201d <em>Citation Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gomez, </em>426 Mass. 379, 381 (1998), quoting from <em>Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Offices Unlimited, Inc., </em>419 Mass. 462, 466 (1995). \u201cA term is ambiguous only if it is susceptible of more than one meaning and reasonably intelligent persons would differ as to which meaning is the proper one.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Here, the word \u201cmaintain\u201d is not defined in the PSE and is ambiguous because the term is susceptible to more than one meaning. In Breton, LLC <em>vs. </em>Graphic Arts Mut. Ins. Co., U.S. Dist. Ct., No. I:09cv60 (E.D. Va. 2009),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia interpreted language in a PSE identical to the one in this case. Cf. Five Star <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Hotels, LLC vs. Insurance Co. of Greater N.Y., U.S. Dist. Ct., No. 09-Civ.-8717 (S.D.N.Y. 2011). The Breton court determined \u201cthat the use of the word \u2018maintain\u2019 in the [PSE] is ambiguous\u201d and, accordingly, it was appropriate to interpret the term against the drafter. Breton, LLC vs. Graphic Arts Mut. Ins. Co., <em>supra </em>at 14. In Breton, the court stated, \u201c[T]here is a wide range of meanings of \u2018maintain.\u2019 For example, the American Heritage Dictionary provides seven definitions for the verb \u2018maintain,\u2019 from the restrictive and narrow meaning \u2018to keep in existence,\u2019 to \u2018keep in an existing state; preserve or retain,\u2019 to the broader meaning \u2018[t]o keep in a condition of good repair or efficiency.\u2019 . . . Similarly, among the definitions included in Webster\u2019s dictionary is \u2018to keep in existence or continuance.\u2019 Black\u2019s Law Dictionary has a number of definitions for \u2018maintain,\u2019 as it relates to property, that range from \u2018to continue in possession of\u2019 to \u2018to care for (property) for purposes of general repair and upkeep.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14-15. The court found \u201cthat the narrower definition of \u2018maintain\u2019 is both a reasonable one and one that increases rather than denies or decreases coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Furthermore, within the PSE itself, the term \u201cmaintain\u201d is used in two different contexts. First, as a condition, the PSE states: \u201c[Y]ou are required to <em>maintain </em>the protective devices or services listed in the Schedule above\u201d (emphasis supplied). Then, in the exclusions, the PSE states, \u201cWe will not pay for loss or damage caused by or resulting from fire if, prior to the fire, you: . . . Failed to <em>maintain </em>any protective safeguard listed in the Schedule above, and over which you had control, in complete working order\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">In contrast to its use in the exclusion, we consider the use of the term \u201cmaintain\u201d in the condition to be ambiguous, as we think it is reasonably susceptible to a range of meanings \u2014 from one by which the obligation is simply to have a fire suppression system in place, to the further obligation to keep the system operational. To accept the defendant\u2019s view of the PSE condition, to \u201cmaintain\u201d the system would require us to determine that it is capable of only one meaning, one that is something akin to \u201cmaintain in complete working order,\u201d which is a meaning at the extreme of the range of possible meanings. In the event that a policy provision is ambiguous, it must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>construed in favor of an insured. Thus, because the record shows that French King had a fire suppression system in place, its coverage claim is not barred by a breach of the PSE condition.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">2. <em>Coverage exclusions contained in the PSE. </em>We next turn to whether the first judge\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment can be sustained because the record establishes conclusively, against the existence of a genuine issue of fact, that either of the two exclusions apply. The PSE states that the insurer \u201cwill not pay for loss or damage caused by or resulting from fire if, prior to the fire, [the insured] . . . knew of any suspension or impairment in any protective safeguard listed in the Schedule above and failed to notify [the insurer] of that fact,\u201d or \u201c[f]ailed to maintain any protective safeguard listed in the Schedule above, and over which you had control, in complete working order.\u201d In consideration of the motion record, Interstate has satisfied its burden to prove that both PSE exclusions apply to bar Interstate\u2019s liability for this loss, that no genuine issues of fact exist to the contrary, and that it is entitled to judgment as matter of law.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">a. <em>Plaintiff\u2019s knowledge of any suspension or impairment, and notification to the defendant. </em>The plaintiff argues that a genuine issue of fact exists whether it knew that the fire suppression system was suspended or impaired; we disagree. The record shows clearly and conclusively that its fire suppression system was impaired, that French King knew it was impaired, and that it failed to inform its insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1131 (2002) defines \u201cimpair\u201d as to \u201cdiminish in quantity, value, excellence, or strength.\u201d Fire Pro-Tec had informed French King on several occasions that the system was noncompliant with the manufacturer\u2019s UL listing, and that it was not in accordance with the current NFPA requirements. The last time Fire Pro-Tec had inspected the system was on June 10, 2004, sixteen months before the fire occurred, and on that date, French King and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>specifically, Prondecki, had been informed that the system was in \u201cNoncompliance,\u201d it was not UL300 listed, and the system was \u201cover pressurized.\u201d Also at that last inspection Fire Pro-Tec issued to French King a \u201crange hood systems report\u201d; \u201cNoncompliance\u201d was handwritten across the top of the report and the report was signed by Prondecki, acknowledging that he had received it.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The record also contained two letters from Fire Pro-Tec, informing French King in both that \u201c[p]ursuant to our recent inspection of your fire suppression system, we find that it is not in accordance with the current National Fire Protection Association . . . requirements or the manufacturer\u2019s U.L. listing.\u201d Each letter also \u201csubmitt[ed] for [French King\u2019s] consideration\u201d a proposal \u201cto bring [the] system into compliance with the current UL 300 requirements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Thereafter, in 2005, the building inspector of Erving refused to issue a certificate of inspection to French King because the Kidde system had been \u201cred tagged\u201d on June 10, 2004, the date of the last service. The building inspector informed Prondecki that the certificate of inspection would not issue until the Kidde system was upgraded. Prondecki was aware that if the system was not \u201cfixed,\u201d and if the certificate of inspection did not issue, then the restaurant would not be able to renew its liquor, food, and health licenses in January of 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">Even if we were to accept, in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, that prior to the building inspector\u2019s ultimatum in June, 2005, Prondecki was unaware of the significance that the Kidde system was noncompliant and \u201cred tagged,\u201d by June of 2005, he understood that the Kidde system needed to be \u201cfixed\u201d and that Fire Pro-Tec had \u201cred tagged\u201d it and had \u201cflunked the system.\u201d He was plainly aware of the deficiency of the restaurant\u2019s fire suppression system and the ramifications of the deficiency as it related to the restaurant\u2019s continuation in business. Twice he had contact with Fire Pro-Tec to get estimates for a system upgrade and on neither occasion did an upgrade occur. This record amply demonstrates that Prondecki kept putting off the day that French King had to upgrade the restaurant\u2019s fire suppression system until it absolutely was forced to do so. At no point, however, was the defendant informed of the status of the Kidde system.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Therefore, the record clearly shows an impairment to the system and no genuine issue as to whether French King had knowledge of the impairment; moreover, the defendant satisfactorily had shown that the plaintiff will be unable to prove otherwise. Regardless of whether French King had or did not have until January of 2006 to upgrade the Kidde system for certificate of inspection purposes, pursuant to the terms of the exclusion, French King was required to notify the defendant that the system was impaired, a requirement that indisputably was unfulfilled. The defendant is entitled to summary judgment on the basis of this exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">b. <em>Plaintiff\u2019s control over the system and keeping it \u201cin complete working order.\u201d </em>Likewise, there are no issues whether the plaintiff had control over the fire suppression system and that the plaintiff failed to maintain the system \u201cin complete working order.\u201d French King had control over the system as it owned the property on which the system was located and had full access to the system. We disagree with French King\u2019s specific contention that the term \u201cin complete working order\u201d is ambiguous. See, e.g., <em>Schwartz &amp; Schwartz of Va., LLC </em>v. <em>Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, London, </em>677 F. Supp. 2d 890, 910-911 (W.D. Va. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 2635 (2002) defines \u201cworking order\u201d as \u201ca condition of a machine in which it functions according to its nature and purpose.\u201d On this record, French King failed to maintain the restaurant\u2019s fire suppression system in complete working order: it no longer could be serviced; it was labeled noncompliant; parts were no longer available for repair or maintenance; and the building inspector of Erving refused to issue a certificate of inspection because the Kidde system had been \u201cred tagged\u201d as noncompliant and needed to be upgraded. While the condition precedent may have allowed the plaintiff to continue in its naive view that it could simply maintain the status quo with regard to its fire suppression system, the PSE exclusion did not; to require an insured to \u201cmaintain\u201d a fire suppression system \u201cin complete working order\u201d means that French King was required to take steps to bring it into compliance. Such a requirement did not allow French King to ignore or minimize the clear warnings provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>by its service contractor (Fire Pro-Tec) that the fire suppression system was noncompliant, i.e., it had been delisted as a system in compliance with relevant fire safety codes and that service on the system no longer could be supported. This record thus does not reveal a fire suppression system in \u201ccomplete working order.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Therefore, based on this record, while French King continues to assert an issue of fact over Prondecki\u2019s imperfect state of knowledge about the significance of Fire Pro-Tec\u2019s inspection of the restaurant\u2019s fire suppression system, there is no genuine issue of material fact whether the Kidde system was in \u201ccomplete working order\u201d at the time the fire occurred, as it clearly was not, and there are no facts or circumstances that the plaintiff can show to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">3. <em>Waiver. </em>French King next argues that the defendant waived its coverage defenses. This argument has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">\u201cAn insurance company is obliged to provide coverage to an insured who has violated a provision of the policy if the company has waived its right to assert the policy breach as a ground for denying liability. Waiver consists of the insurer\u2019s voluntary or intentional relinquishment of a known right.\u201d <em>Merrimack Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Nonaka, </em>414 Mass. 187, 189 (1993). \u201c[Whatever may be the scope of waiver in the law of insurance, it does not extend to the broadening of the coverage, so as to make the policy cover a risk not within its terms. That would require a new contract, and cannot be accomplished by waiver.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 191, quoting from <em>Palumbo </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>293 Mass. 35, 37-38 (1935). See Anderson, Vance on Insurance \u00a7 76, at 427 (3d ed. 1951) (insurer \u201ccannot by a naked waiver assume a non-existent duty. Nothing less than a new agreement on con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>sideration will suffice. . . . The insurer claiming an exception is in no wise contesting the contract, but merely asking that its liability be not extended beyond the express limits of the contract\u201d); 2 Holmes &amp; Rhodes, Holmes\u2019s Appleman on Insurance \u00a7 8.1, at 302 (2d ed. 1996) (\u201cGenerally speaking, however, the rules of waiver . . . can not be used to expand coverage that is specifically and unambiguously excluded by the policy language. . . . This position is strongly favored since to extend coverage through the use of the doctrine of waiver . . . will essentially rewrite the contract entered into by the parties\u201d).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Here, the issue is whether the defendant waived its right to enforce the PSE exclusions.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The burden of pleading and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>proving either satisfaction of policy obligations or waiver of them by an insurer is on the insured. <em>Hannuniemi </em>v. <em>Carruth, </em>278 Mass. 230, 232 (1932). Even though the defendant apparently agreed to insure French King\u2019s dry fire suppression system, the defendant never waived the PSE\u2019s two exclusions (requiring French King to inform them of impairment or suspension of the system and French King\u2019s obligation to maintain the system in \u201ccomplete working order\u201d). There is no argument or evidence that the defendant waived its right to enforce either exclusion, which <em>\u201csubtract </em>from coverage rather than grant it.\u201d <em>Bond Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>393 Mass. 546, 550 (1984). Therefore, given the circumstances of this case, the defendant is justified in not extending coverage to French King because French King is unable to prove that there are exceptions to the exclusions. French King\u2019s argument that the defendant waived its coverage defenses fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">4. <em>General Laws c. 93A claim. </em>French King also argues that the first judge erred in dismissing its G. L. c. 93A claim for unfair claims handling. Given our determination that the defendant is not required to cover the fire loss that occurred on October 12, 2005, we conclude that French King\u2019s 93A claim is deficient because it fails to show that Interstate engaged in unfair or deceptive insurance practices as defined by G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">5. <em>Return of advance payment. </em>French King next argues that it was not required to return to Interstate the advance payment made under the policy because Interstate did not reserve its rights and defenses in connection with the payment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>As stated by the second judge, \u201c[ajlthough no Massachusetts courts have directly addressed this issue, other jurisdictions have persuasively reasoned that an insurer is entitled to reimbursement for an erroneous payment when coverage does not exist under the policy and the insured was unjustly enriched and did not change position to its detriment in reliance on the payment,\u201d citing, e.g., <em>Lindsay Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co., </em>911 F. Supp. 1249, 1259 (D. Neb. 1995), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 118 F.3d 1263 (8th Cir. 1997) (\u201c[A]s a matter of policy, it would be unwise to discourage insurers from making payments, even if the payments were made in error, by refusing to permit later adjustments\u201d). Here, two days after the fire and prior to determining coverage, the defendant advanced $15,000 to the plaintiff. There is nothing in the record that indicates that this was an unconditional advancement, especially because the defendant had not commenced investigating why the fire suppression system did not work. Furthermore, as stated, <em>supra, </em>there was evidence that the plaintiff did, in fact, know that there could be potential issues with the Kidde system. Thus, the second judge correctly determined that the defendant was entitled to reimbursement of $15,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b690-9\"> The plaintiff\u2019s complaint against the defendant, its insurer, alleged breach of contract, violations of G.

Instead, it required the insured to <em>maintain </em>that system. It is undisputed that the ansul system which was present in the plaintiff\u2019s premises could not be maintained because it was obsolete and had to be upgraded to a wet fire suppression system. Therefore, it is clear that it was not \u2018maintained\u2019 by the plaintiff as required, as fully set forth by the defendant in its memorandum of law. The plaintiff failed to comply with a condition precedent, meaning that coverage did not exist on the date of the loss. Accordingly, this motion is Allowed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b697-7\"> There is a dearth of case law in the Commonwealth interpreting this type of policy language. The court in Breton, LLC vs. Graphic Arts Mut. Ins. Co., <em>supra, </em>interpreted identical PSE language and the issue there appears on all fours with the case at bar. In Breton, a fire destroyed Breton\u2019s warehouse \u2014 \u201cit appeared that a sprinkler system installed in . . . one of the damaged warehouse properties was not triggered by the fire because its water supply valve was in the \u2018closed\u2019 position at the time of the fire, thereby shutting off the system and rendering it inoperable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1. The plaintiff in Breton contended, as French King does here, that the word \u201cmaintain\u201d in the PSE was ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">While Breton is not binding on us, the logic of its analysis and the similarity of facts provides persuasive assistance in our review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b699-8\"> Given this conclusion, the plaintiff\u2019s argument that the condition was waived by its disclosure on its application for insurance of a prior declination of coverage by another insurer requires no discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b699-9\"> Our decision is not based upon the fact that the fire suppression system failed to function at the time of the fire.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b702-8\"> As noted, <em>supra, </em>as background facts, by 2002, Kidde Fire Systems had eliminated all parts from its inventory for the HDR dry chemical systems and \u201cKidde Fire Systems w[ould] no longer support the installation, inspection, service, recharge or repair of dry chemical systems protecting kitchen appliances and ventilation.\u201d Thus, Fire Pro-Tec no longer could service, repair, or maintain the Kidde system. Moreover, on several occasions, Fire Pro-Tec had informed French King that the system was \u201cnot in accordance with the current National Fire Protection Association . . . requirements or the manufacturer\u2019s U.L. listing on this system.\u201d We do not impute the knowledge of Fire Pro-Tec to French King, and have determined the applicability of these exclusions solely on the knowledge and actions of French King as shown in the motion record before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b703-6\"> French King relies on the \u201cclass of waiver case [that] involves claimed misrepresentations by the insured that led the insurer to provide insurance coverage.\u201d <em>Merrimack Mut. Fire Ins. Co., supra </em>at 190, citing <em>Employers\u2019 Liab. Assur. Corp. </em>v. <em>Vella, </em>366 Mass. 651, 657-658 (1975). See <em>Charles, Henry &amp; Crowley Co. </em>v. <em>Home Ins. Co., </em>349 Mass. 723, 726-727 (1965). The <em>Vella </em>court \u201cheld that the policyholder had made no material misrepresentation . . . , and that, in any event, the insurer lost its right to disclaim liability \u2018when it [knew] the facts, [failed] to disclaim within a reasonable time, and [acted] in a way inconsistent with an intention to disclaim .... There, the insurer did not raise the question of its right to disclaim until one and one-half years after it had discovered the facts on which it relied.\u201d <em>Merrimack Mut. Fire Ins. Co., supra </em>at 190 n.5. Indeed, had this case solely concerned the policy conditions, French King\u2019s contention that the defendant waived coverage defenses because it knew or should have known of French King\u2019s dry fire suppression system might have more currency because its application for coverage disclosed a prior declination by another insurance carrier based on the dry system. While French King\u2019s additional statement on its application that it had an \u201cAnsul System in place\u201d is reasonably suggestive to an insurer that it had upgraded to a compliant system, such facts might be viewed as genuinely in conflict and material enough to withstand summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">However, this line of cases is inapplicable to the case at bar. The defendant is not justified in denying coverage to French King for having a dry fire suppression system, as French King claims; rather, the defendant\u2019s decision to exclude French King\u2019s loss from coverage for failing to inform the defendant of known suspensions or impairments, or failing to maintain the system in complete working order, are the operative decisions against which the plaintiff\u2019s waiver arguments are ineffective.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b703-8\"> See <em>Kirschner </em>v. <em>Process Design Assocs., Inc., </em>459 Mich. 587, 593-594 (1999) (\u201cThe application of waiver and estoppel is limited, and, usually, the doctrines will not be applied to broaden the coverage of a policy to protect the insured against risks that were not included in the policy or that were expressly excluded from the policy\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b703-9\"> Because we have determined that, based on the language of the condition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>in the PSE, French King did in fact have coverage from the defendant, the parties\u2019 arguments regarding conditions precedent and waiver of conditions no longer are applicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b704-8\"> To the extent that the plaintiff\u2019s c. 93A claim is based upon an alleged delay in responding to its demand, this record demonstrates that in a letter dated two days after the fire, Interstate informed French King that an investigation would begin promptly; the defendant also sent a $15,000 \u201cadvance payment\u201d so that French King could pay for cleaning the rest of the building that held the restaurant. A letter dated January 4, 2006, indicated that French King had yet to provide \u201cinformation relative to the inspections and/or servicing of the ansul system.\u201d The defendant denied coverage in a letter dated April 4, 2006. Thus, the defendant\u2019s delay in denying coverage was at least in part based upon the plaintiff\u2019s own delay in providing necessary information about the fire suppression system.
