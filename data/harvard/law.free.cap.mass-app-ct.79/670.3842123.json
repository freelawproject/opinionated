L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(l)(a)(l), and of negligent operation to endanger, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24. By an immediately subsequent jury-waived trial, the presiding judge found the OUI offense to be the defendant\u2019s third. G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(l)(a)(l), fifth par.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">On appeal, the defendant invokes the evolving Sixth Amendment confrontation doctrine generated by <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 51 (2004), and <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>129 S. Ct. 2527, 2531 (2009), against the application of one of the Commonwealth\u2019s most frequently used eviden-tiary statutes, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79. For both criminal and civil trials, that provision authorizes the discretionary admission of properly certified hospital records related to relevant issues of treatment and medical history. In addition, the defendant challenges the admission of the content of certain 911 telephone calls also as violative of his constitutional right of confrontation. Finally, he complains of ineffective assistance of trial counsel and of prejudicial violation of hearsay evidence standards. For the following reasons, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\"><em>Background. </em>The Commonwealth built its case upon the testimony of civilian witness Sherry Goss, State Troopers Daniel Crespi and Matthew Waples, and toxicologist Kerri Donovan. The defendant did not present any witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">1. <em>Testimony of Sherry Goss. </em>Goss finished her evening work shift in Boston at approximately 1:00 a.m. on October 25, 2005, and began her drive home to Brockton. As she moved southward on Route 93, she observed an automobile randomly alternating its speed and changing lanes. The car appeared to be a silver Mercedes-Benz.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">The car struck a concrete barrier in the middle of the highway, and ricocheted to the right across all of the traffic lanes. As it continued southward onto Route 3, Goss called 911 by cellular telephone and reported the accident. The car continued to change speeds and shift lanes, and eventually slowed to a speed of approximately twenty miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>As Goss passed the car she read its license plate number. The driver appeared to be a male. She again called 911 and reported the license plate number to the dispatcher. She was unsure of the last digit of the number and gave the dispatcher two possibilities. Shortly afterward she left the highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">2. <em>Testimony of Troopers Crespi and Waples. </em>Crespi received a dispatch at about 2:45 a.m. on October 25, 2005. As a result, he drove to Route 3 South. He was looking for a Mercedes-Benz sedan with a specific license plate number traveling in the southbound lanes. As Crespi reached an overpass above Route 3, he saw a sedan driving north in the southbound lanes of Route 3. He turned on his lights and siren and drove onto Route 3 North. Trees and bushes growing in the median blocked his view of the southbound lanes. He turned left into a cutout in the median and emerged onto Route 3 South. Before proceeding southward, he looked down the lanes and did not see a car traveling in the wrong direction. He proceeded several hundred feet southward and saw a Ryder truck stopped in the median.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Crespi pulled to the side of the highway, approached the truck on foot, and spoke with the driver. As he did so, he noticed another vehicle on the opposite side of the highway. It was straddling the breakdown lane and an adjacent embankment. As he crossed the highway toward the car, he radioed dispatch to report an accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">The driver of the car, whom Crespi identified in court as the defendant, was unconscious. Crespi checked the defendant\u2019s vital signs; he had a pulse and was still breathing. His breath carried a strong odor of alcohol. The defendant\u2019s automobile was a gray Mercedes-Benz that had sustained serious damage to its passenger side. The make, color, and license plate number matched the description of the vehicle for which Crespi was looking when he drove onto Route 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">Trooper Waples arrived shortly afterward. He had responded to the scene after receipt of a radio transmission from Crespi reporting the accident. Previously, Waples had received the same dispatch information as Crespi and had been searching Route 3 South for a silver or gray Mercedes-Benz with a specific license plate number. Upon arrival, Waples spoke with Crespi, approached the defendant\u2019s vehicle, and observed its make, color, and license plate number, all of which matched the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>description of the vehicle relayed to him by dispatch earlier. Waples also checked the defendant\u2019s vital signs and smelled a strong odor of alcohol on the defendant\u2019s breath. Waples identified the defendant in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">Emergency medical personnel then arrived and, with the \u201cjaws of life,\u201d removed the defendant from his vehicle. They transported him to South Shore Hospital. Waples investigated the accident scene and then drove to the hospital to inquire whether medical personnel had tested the defendant\u2019s blood. He spoke with both doctors and nurses who were treating the defendant. He then returned to his barracks and drafted charges against the defendant for OUI and for negligent operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">3. <em>Testimony of toxicologist Kerri Donovan. </em>At the conclusion of the testimony by the troopers, pursuant to G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79, the Commonwealth introduced in evidence a copy of the defendant\u2019s hospital records and a signed form from a South Shore Hospital record keeper certifying \u201cthat the attached medical record is a true and accurate copy of the original documents.\u201d The records contained a toxicology report. The Commonwealth then called toxicologist Donovan to explain the significance of the report. She described the process by which blood analysts use a person\u2019s semm alcohol level to calculate blood alcohol content. From the defendant\u2019s hospital toxicology report, she described his ethanol serum level as 303 milligrams per decileter. From that datum, she calculated that the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content by weight on the night of the accident to have been between .256 and .270 percent, a level more than three times the legal limit. See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(l)(a)(l), first par.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\"><em>Analysis. </em>1. <em>Admission of the defendant\u2019s hospital records. </em>Trial defense counsel did not object to the admission of the hospital records. We therefore review the unpreserved alleged error for a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 563-564 (1967); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>438 Mass. 290, 297-298 (2002). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Redmond, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 7-8 (2001) (unpreserved constitutional error typically reviewed under substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice standard).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>The defendant assigns three errors to the uncontested admission of his hospital records under authority of G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79. First, he contends that their admission violated the very terms of the statute because their measurement of his blood alcohol content effectively referred to the ultimate question of his criminal liability. Second, he argues that the unavailability of the hospital record keeper at trial for cross-examination upon the accuracy of the certification of the records deprived him of his right of confrontation under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Finally, he characterizes trial defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the admission of the medical records as constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">The Commonwealth presented the GUI charge to the jury upon the independent alternative theories of (1) a per se violation by reason of a blood alcohol measurement of .08 percent or greater, and (2) impaired operation established by percipient testimony of witnesses. The jury delivered verdicts of guilt upon both versions of the offense. The defendant argues that the improperly admitted hospital toxicology report taints a finding of guilt under the per se theory and prejudicially affects any such finding under the alternative concept of impaired operation. See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(l)(a)(l), first par.; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Col-turi, </em>448 Mass. 809, 817-818 (2007); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Douglas, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 643, 651-653 (2009); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Filoma, ante </em>16, 20-21 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">a. <em>Statutory \u201cquestion of </em>liability.\u201d In pertinent part, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79, as appearing in St. 1959, c. 200, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-6\">\u201cRecords kept by hospitals . . . may be admitted by the court, in its discretion, as evidence . . . so far as such records relate to the treatment and medical history of such cases . . . <em>but nothing therein contained shall be admissible as evidence which has reference to the question of </em>liability\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 24(l)(a)(l), as amended through St. 2003, c. 28, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4, provides in relevant part that \u201c[whoever [upon any public way] operates a motor vehicle with a percentage, by weight, of alcohol in their blood of eight one-hundredths or greater . . . shall be punished . . . .\u201d The defendant proposes that proof of GUI guilt by a credible reading of .08 percent or greater effectively converts a hospital record containing such information to a reference to ultimate criminal liability forbidden by \u00a7 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">We disagree. Objectively determinable facts resulting from medical tests and procedures conducted for diagnostic and treatment purposes and appearing in hospital records submitted under the statute may obviously bear on the ultimate question of civil or criminal liability but do not constitute improper allegations, opinions, or conclusions about liability. Subjective impressions or expressions about fault or guilt may not come in through such records. Trial judges will typically filter them out of the records. That material constitutes the forbidden \u201creference to the question of liability.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dar-gon, </em>457 Mass. 387, 394-395 (2010), and cases cited. See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 803(6)(B) &amp; note at 260-262 (2011). By contrast, objective data constitute reliable information helpful to the fact finder upon issues of a technical medical nature. The test is the distinction between \u201ca conclusory fact central to the jury\u2019s inquiry\u201d and \u201cphysical observations from which inculpatory inferences flow.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 395, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 200, 202 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The blood alcohol test reading belongs to the latter category of \u201cphysical observations.\u201d The decisional law preceding the creation of per se guilt by the 2003 amendments remains in full force. Under it, \u201c[t]he statute has long been construed to permit the admission of a record that relates directly and primarily to the treatment and medical history of the patient, \u2018even though incidentally the facts recorded may have some bearing on the question of liability.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dube, </em>413 Mass. 570, 573 (1992), quoting from <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry., </em>234 Mass. 480, 482-483 (1920). See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 803(6)(B), <em>supra. </em>Blood alcohol tests are admissible so long as their purpose was medical diagnosis or treatment. See <em>Commonwealth </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>v. <em>Dube, supra </em>at 574 (results of \u201cphysician-ordered [blood] tests\u201d are admissible); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 698, 700-701 (1986) (physician-ordered blood test admissible); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sargent, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 657, 660-661 (1987) (results admissible because blood test taken pursuant to hospital\u2019s routine procedures); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dyer, </em>77 Mass. App. Ct. 850, 856 (2010) (same). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sheldon, </em>423 Mass. 373, 376-377 (1996) (blood test inadmissible because the test was not intended \u201cto assist in the achievement of any medical goal\u201d). The limiting language of \u00a7 79 excludes gratuitous or incompetent references to criminal and civil liability; it does not exclude data resulting from medically purposeful treatment. Defendants may seek redaction of improper material, and they may call their own witnesses to challenge the accuracy of properly admitted medical information such as the blood alcohol reading.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">In the present instance, the record itself indicates that the blood alcohol test constituted a part of a series of routine tests, all of which hospital staff conducted for medical purposes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Russo, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 923, 925-926 (1991) (defendant\u2019s hospital record established that hospital personnel performed blood test for purposes of treatment). The defendant offered no evidence challenging the apparent medical purposes of the blood test. The admission of the toxicology report as part of the hospital records did not constitute any violation of the statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">b. <em>Constitutional confrontation rights. </em>It is settled that the Sixth Amendment right to confrontation articulated in <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. at 51, and <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>129 S. Ct. at 2531, does not include an entitlement to cross-examine the authors of routine medical records <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>because \u201cmedical reports created for treatment purposes . . . would not be testimonial.\u201d <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, supra </em>at 2533 n.2. For the same result and reasoning, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lampron, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 340, 344-346 (2005); and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dyer, </em>77 Mass. App. Ct. at 854-855. This court has reached the same result in the application of the Commonwealth\u2019s constitutional assurance of the right of confrontation set forth in art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. at 701-702.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">In this instance, however, the defendant challenges not the introduction of the substance of the hospital records, but rather their certification by the hospital record keeper. He imputes a testimonial character to the certification of the accuracy of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">The certification form has some testimonial characteristics. The keeper of the records signed the form under the pains and penalties of perjury, and created the form in response to a subpoena. However, in <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, supra </em>at 2538-2539, the United States Supreme Court made an explicit exception for \u201ca clerk\u2019s certificate authenticating an official record \u2014 or a copy thereof \u2014 for use as evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2538. The Court acknowledged that this type of affidavit is \u201cprepared for use at trial,\u201d but held that the confrontation clause does not apply because such an affidavit merely \u201ccertifies] to the correctness of a copy of a record\u201d and does not \u201cfurnish, as evidence for the trial of a lawsuit, [an] interpretation of what the record contains or shows, or . . . certify to its substance or effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2539, quoting from <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>141 La. 404, 409 (1917).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">It is clear that the certification form in the present case belongs within this categorical exception. The form certifies that the hospital furnished accurate copies of the defendant\u2019s medical records. The form does not vouch for the substance of those records as an accurate representation of the defendant\u2019s condition on the night of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">In effect, the certification is doubly removed from a right of confrontation. It constitutes a nontestimonial authentication of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>records of nontestimonial information. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>460 F.3d 920, 927 (7th Cir. 2006) (\u201c[gjiven [that hospital] records themselves do not fall within the constitutional guarantee provided by the Confrontation Clause, it would be odd to hold that the foundational evidence authenticating the [hospital] records do[es]\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zein-inger, </em>459 Mass. 775, 784 (2011) (record certifying the working condition of police breathalyzer machinery \u201crather than reflecting \u2018judgment and discretion\u2019 or \u2018expressions of opinion\u2019 of . . . [a] technician, merely signifies that the . . . procedures prescribed by regulation were satisfactorily performed\u201d). The defendant has suffered no deprivation under either the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment or art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">c. <em>Ineffective assistance. </em>Consequently, the absence of an objection to the admission of the hospital records by defense counsel did not fall \u201cmeasurably below [the performance] expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer\u201d and did not \u201clikely deprive[] the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974). The absence of an unmeritorious or futile objection cannot constitute ineffectiveness. See e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Achorn, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 247, 253 (1988); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beauchamp, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 591, 609-610 (2000); and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, </em>76 Mass. App. Ct. 612, 616 (2010).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">2. <em>Hearsay issues. </em>The defendant argues that the testimony of Troopers Crespi and Waples describing the car for which they were searching on Route 3 constituted inadmissible hearsay information from unknown 911 telephone callers; that the admission of such information deprived him of his constitutional right to confront those unknown callers; and that Trooper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>Waples\u2019s account of his visit to the hospital and then to the barracks for the purpose of assembling a criminal complaint constituted so-called \u201cback door\u201d hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">a. <em>The claim of 911 hearsay. </em>The prosecution may introduce \u201ccarefully circumscribed extrajudicial statements in criminal trials to explain the state of police knowledge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosario, </em>430 Mass. 505, 508 (1999). \u201cHowever, even where properly constrained, \u2018testimony of this kind carries a high probability of misuse.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tanner, </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 432, 439 (2006), quoting from <em>Rosario, supra </em>at 509. The testimony runs the risk of implicit communication to the jury of \u201cincriminating statements that are otherwise inadmissible.\u201d <em>Tanner, supra. </em>Consequently, \u201ceven general evidence of extrajudicial conversations presented to show the state of police knowledge\u201d should come into evidence only if \u201c(1) the evidence is presented by a police officer on the basis of his own personal knowledge; (2) the testimony is strictly limited to \u2018facts required to establish the officer\u2019s state of knowledge\u2019; and (3) the question of police knowledge is relevant and material to some live issue before the fact finder.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosario, supra </em>at 509-510. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rupp, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 377, 383 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">It is questionable whether the descriptive information furnished by anonymous 911 telephone callers came into evidence for its truth and therefore constituted hearsay or whether it came into evidence only as an explanation of police knowledge and therefore constituted nonhearsay. In an abundance of caution, we shall assume \u2014 without deciding \u2014 that the jurors may have received the information for its truth. In that event, the dispatch information related to the troopers may have exceeded the second of the above-enumerated <em>Rosario </em>limitations. The defendant acknowledges that, to explain the search along Route 3, the troopers could have testified narrowly that they had received dispatches reporting an erratic driver on that highway. The defendant contends that the description of the car by anonymous callers was, however, unnecessary. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosario, supra </em>at 509-510. Consequently, the defendant asserts, the troopers\u2019 testimony matching the defendant\u2019s car to that description was also superfluous. The admission of the anonymously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>based 911 information would have been error.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Defense counsel preserved the issue by objection. We evaluate whether the admission of this information, if classified as hearsay, could constitute prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">An error preserved by objection or motion is nonprejudicial \u201cif we are sure that the error did not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>431 Mass. 282, 288, cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1020 (2000), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In light of the quantity and quality of properly admitted evidence of guilt, we can confidently conclude that the claimed improperly admitted testimony exerted little or no effect upon the verdicts. The blood alcohol reading interpreted and explained by the toxicologist witness comprised overwhelming evidence of guilt under the per se theory. The troopers\u2019 description of the accident scene and of the aroma of alcohol supplied strong evidence under the theory of impaired operation. As to the conviction of negligent operation, the testimony of Sherry Goss described the prolonged and erratic driving of a silver Mercedes-Benz and its license plate number. Trooper Crespi testified to his observation of a sedan traveling north in the southbound lane of the highway. He testified also that, twenty to thirty seconds later, he arrived on the accident scene a short distance from the point of his first observation of the wrong-way driver, and found the defendant trapped in the driver\u2019s seat of a gray Mercedes-Benz. He too provided the license plate number to the jury. If there were error in the admission of the details of the anonymous 911 telephone calls, it was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">b. <em>Confrontation. </em>Did the introduction of reference to statements from unknown 911 telephone callers deprive the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>ant of his right to confrontation under either the Sixth Amendment or art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights?<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Those provisions protect a defendant against the admission of out-of-court testimonial statements. Out-of-court statements \u201cprimarily aimed at enabling \u2018police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency\u2019 \u201d are not testimonial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nes-bitt, </em>452 Mass. 236, 248 (2008), quoting from <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 828 (2006). In these circumstances, the 911 telephone callers were alerting the police to an ongoing threat posed by a conspicuously dangerous driver. They were urgent, and not testimonial, communications. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Torelli, </em>103 Conn. App. 646, 658-662 (2007) (911 telephone calls reporting erratic driving are not testimonial, citing <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Washington, supra </em>at 822). No constitutional error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">c. <em>Backdoor hearsay. </em>Finally, the defendant challenges the admissibility of Trooper Waples\u2019s testimony that he visited the hospital, spoke with personnel treating the defendant, and then returned to his barracks to draft charges against the defendant. The defendant asserts that this account implicitly admitted hearsay statements in evidence before the jury because it suggested that hospital personnel had informed Waples that they had performed a blood test upon the defendant and had determined his excessive blood alcohol count. Relatedly, the defendant contends that the same implicit hearsay violated his constitutional rights to confront the hospital personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Waples testified that he had visited the hospital to \u201c[cjheck on [the defendant\u2019s] condition and to see if [the hospital staff] administered a blood test\u201d; that he had spoken with doctors and nurses in the emergency room; and had then gone to the barracks. This testimony did not communicate to the jury that hospital personnel had completed a blood test or that they had learned of a result. It was not so suggestive as to amount to implicit hearsay. Finally, even if it were so suggestive, the eventual blood test results properly came into evidence and superseded any earlier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>improper suggestion. Consequently, no harmful backdoor hearsay occurred. No violation of a constitutional right of confrontation resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b709-7\"> The decision of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vasquez, </em>456 Mass. 350, 358-360 (2010), carves out an exception to this rule; other exceptions exist. None applies here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b710-7\"> The statute serves two objectives: the authentication of medical records without the burdensome attendance of medical personnel and record keepers as witnesses; and the exemption of record contents from the common-law hearsay bar. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>450 Mass. 132, 139 (2007). The criminal defendant and civil opponent remain free to challenge authenticity, accuracy, and inferences, upon specific grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b712-7\"> The toxicology result appeared on a standard hospital form containing three panels of tests (\u201cchemistry,\u201d \u201cTDM/toxicology,\u201d and \u201curine drug screens\u201d) and twenty-one readings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b712-8\"> A familiar canon of construction reinforces our conclusion that G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(l)(o)(l), and G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79, operate compatibly. Whenever possible, courts will harmonize the provisions of related statutes so as to give each one effect within a consistent scheme. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hampe, </em>419 Mass. 514, 518 (1995), and cases cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b714-6\"> At the time of the trial, no reported Massachusetts decision had addressed the defendant\u2019s statutory contention that the 2003 addition of the per se violation would render blood alcohol tests results inadmissible as references to ultimate criminal liability. The omission of a novel theory does not typically constitute performance below the level of the ordinary fallible lawyer. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Norman, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 82, 86-87, <em>S.C., </em>406 Mass. 1001 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b716-7\"> By this evaluation, we do not impute any fault to the witnesses. The subtleties of hearsay standards are difficult for even experienced attorneys.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b716-8\"> This straightforward formulation of the prejudicial error standard is the equivalent of the more convoluted expression also originating in <em>Kotteakos </em>v. <em>United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 764-765 (1946), and imported into Massachusetts case law through <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peruzzi, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 437, 445 (1983), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass, at 353: \u201cBut if one cannot say, with fair assurance, after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error, it is impossible to conclude that substantial rights were not affected.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b717-7\"> The Commonwealth contends that Sherry Goss was the only 911 caller to report an erratic driver in a silver Mercedes-Benz sedan on Route 3 South. However, the record casts doubt upon that assumption. Crespi and Waples both testified that they received multiple dispatches originated by 911 telephone calls from individuals located between the towns of Braintree and Hanover.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
