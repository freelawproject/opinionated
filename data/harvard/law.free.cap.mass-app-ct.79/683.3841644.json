Doe argues that the board\u2019s final classification hearing was improper because the hearing was conducted (1) while Doe was incarcerated, and (2) by way of video conferencing. As such, Doe contends that the final classification hearing violated the regulatory and statutory authority of the administrative agency and his due process rights. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\"><em>Background. </em>The following facts are taken from the hearing examiner\u2019s decision in the board\u2019s final classification of Doe. At the time of the hearing officer\u2019s decision on November 21, 2008, Doe was a forty-six year old male incarcerated at the Massachusetts Treatment Center in Bridgewater. The plaintiff\u2019s criminal record is extensive. Since 1983, the plaintiff has been convicted of four separate sex offenses and a number of other nonsexual crimes, several of which were violent.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">In 1983, Doe pulled his pants down, took his penis in his hand, and touched a woman previously unknown to Doe on her buttocks while riding in a Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority train. Doe was subsequently convicted of indecent assault and battery on a person over fourteen, in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13H. He received a two-year sentence with eight months to be served and the balance suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">On July 25, 1985, while on community supervision for an unrelated offense, Doe unzipped his pants, pulled down his seven year old niece\u2019s underpants, and sat her upon his lap. As a result, Doe was convicted of indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen years old, in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B, and received a two and one-half year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">On April 9, 1991, Doe was convicted of a third offense of indecent assault and battery, for which he received another two and one-half year sentence. The record lacks any evidence related to the circumstances of this offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-10\">Doe\u2019s most recent sexual offense occurred on October 18, 2002. On that date, Doe entered the home of a woman he had known for six years and crawled into bed with her. Doe removed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>his shirt, hugged the victim, and fondled her buttocks. When the victim realized the man was not her husband, she began to scream and struggle. At this point, Doe covered her mouth with his hand, held her down, and threatened to kill her if she did not stop screaming. As a result of this conduct, Doe was convicted of the following: indecent assault and battery on a person age fourteen or over, in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13H, for which he received a two and one-half year sentence; threatening to commit a crime, to wit, murder, in violation of G. L. c. 275, \u00a7 2, for which he received a six-month concurrent sentence; and unarmed burglary and assault, in violation of G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 15, for which he received a ten-year probationary term from and after his incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">In addition to these sex offenses, Doe has other criminal convictions. In 1981, Doe was convicted of larceny of a motor vehicle. In 1986, he was convicted of receiving stolen property. Two years later, in 1988, Doe was convicted of both assault and battery and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon. One year later, Doe initially received a continuance without a finding on a charge of assault and battery; he then violated probation, was convicted on the charge, and was committed for six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">In 1994, Doe was convicted of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon and received a five- to seven-year split sentence with three years committed. This conviction was the result of a brutal beating by Doe of his then girlfriend, whereby Doe beat his girlfriend unconscious, continued beating her when she regained consciousness, and threatened to kill her several different times.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">Most recently, Doe was convicted of assault and battery on a correction officer and threatening to commit a crime in 2006 while incarcerated for his 2002 sexual offenses. Consequently, Doe was sentenced to two and one-half years for the assault and battery offense and a six-month concurrent sentence for his threat to commit a crime conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">While incarcerated on or about April 22, 2008, the board notified Doe that he was required to register as a level three sex offender, pursuant to G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K(2). Doe subsequently requested and was granted a de novo hearing, which took place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>on November 7, 2008. This hearing took place while Doe was incarcerated. Further, the hearing was conducted by way of video conference; the board\u2019s attorney and the hearing examiner participated in the hearing from the board\u2019s office in Salem, and Doe and his attorney participated from the Old Colony Correctional Center in Bridgewater. Prior to and once again during the hearing, defense counsel objected to the final classification hearing taking place both while the defendant was incarcerated and via video conference. Both objections were overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">At the hearing, neither party offered any witnesses, nor does the record show that Doe testified on his own behalf. Both parties, however, submitted documentary evidence pursuant to the board regulations and guidelines, 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 1.00 et seq. (2004). On November 21, 2008, two weeks after the final classification hearing, the hearing examiner affirmed the board\u2019s classification of Doe as a level three sex offender, in accordance with G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K(2)(c), concluding that Doe \u201cposes a high risk for sex offense recidivism and a high degree of dangerousness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Doe subsequently sought judicial review of the board\u2019s decision in the Superior Court, pursuant to G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178M, and G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. Following a hearing, the Superior Court judge affirmed the board\u2019s decision, concluding that (1) the board\u2019s final classification was supported by substantial evidence; (2) the board\u2019s hearing by way of video conference while Doe was incarcerated was not improper; and (3) active dissemination of Doe\u2019s identifying information did not violate his State or Federal constitutional rights. Doe now appeals the board\u2019s decision to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>The board. </em>The board is an administrative agency charged with \u201cestablish[ing] and maintain[ing] a central computerized registry of all sex offenders required to register pursuant to [G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7] 178C to 178P.\u201d G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178D, as amended by St. 1999, c. 74, \u00a7 2. \u201c[Title] 803 [Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7] 1.00 sets forth the registration and classification procedures and Guidelines the Board uses to determine whether a convicted or adjudicated sex offender may be required to register as a sex offender and, if so, the offender\u2019s level of risk of re-offense and degree of dangerousness posed to the public.\u201d 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.01 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>An individual is required to register as a sex offender if he or she has been convicted or adjudicated of a sex offense, as defined in G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178C; if the offense was of a sexual nature; if the individual lives, works, or is pursuing higher education in the Commonwealth; and if the individual poses a current danger. 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.06(2)(a)-(d) (2004). When the board determines that the above criteria apply, the individual must register as a sex offender. At this point, the board recommends a classification level based upon an individual\u2019s risk of reoffending and degree of dangerousness. A level three classification, the highest level and the level designated to Doe in this case, is appropriate \u201c[wjhere the board determines that the risk of reoffense is high and the degree of dangerousness posed to the public is such that a substantial public safety interest is served by active dissemination.\u201d G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K(2)(c), as amended by St. 1999, c. 74, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The board makes an initial recommendation \u201cregarding the offender\u2019s duty to register and classification level which the sex offender can accept or reject.\u201d 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.01. If the offender accepts the recommendation, it becomes final. Alternatively, the offender can reject the recommendation by requesting a de novo hearing. At such a hearing, the hearing examiner determines, based upon \u201cthe totality of all the relevant evidence introduced at the offender\u2019s individualized hearing,\u201d the offender\u2019s obligation to register and classification level. <em>Ibid. </em>See 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.10(1) (2002). Following the board\u2019s decision, \u201c[a]n offender may seek judicial review . . . of the board\u2019s final classification and registration requirements.\u201d G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178M, as amended by St. 1999, c. 74, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">2. <em>Conducting final classification hearing while sex offender is incarcerated. </em>Doe argues that the board should not have conducted Doe\u2019s final classification hearing while he was incarcerated. Doe contends that holding the hearing while he was incarcerated exceeded the statutory authority of the board and also, inter alia, violated Doe\u2019s procedural due process rights. We disagree. In <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 3974 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>457 Mass. 53 (2010), the Supreme Judicial Court, albeit in dictum, identified the flaws in the argument that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>only the initial classification may occur while the sex offender is incarcerated. The Supreme Judicial Court reasoned: \u201c[T]he board is <em>required </em>to classify incarcerated sex offenders before they are released: The board must begin classification proceedings at least sixty days prior to the offender\u2019s release, G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178L(l)(a), and must classify the offender at least ten days before the offender\u2019s earliest possible release date, G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178E(a). Moreover, the argument [that the board\u2019s authority to classify incarcerated sex offenders is limited to the initial and not the final classification] does not account for the fact that an initial classification becomes \u2018final\u2019 if a sex offender fails to object to it, regardless of whether the offender continues to be incarcerated. G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178L(l)(a) .... That G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178E(a), references the procedures of G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178L, suggests that it also incorporates the latter\u2019s reference to \u2018final\u2019 classifications.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 60-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">The statutory purposes are also promoted by allowing final classifications of sex offenders while they are incarcerated. The sex offender registry law is designed to protect the public from \u201cthe danger of recidivism posed by sex offenders.\u201d St. 1999, c. 74, \u00a7 1. The final identification and classification of such offenders before their release back into the community, and the dissemination, where their classification calls for such dissemination, of information regarding the offender\u2019s identity, offenses, and address, are necessary to accomplish the statutory purposes. See <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 1211 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>447 Mass. 750, 759-760 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Doe also argues that conducting his hearing while he was incarcerated violated his procedural and substantive due process rights. As the hearing officer properly found, Doe\u2019s \u201cdue process rights are secured by the procedural safeguards found in the statute; namely the opportunity to submit evidence; the right to de novo review of the preliminary classification, and the right to Superior Court review of a final decision.\u201d \u201c[Appropriate and adequate safeguards are included in the classification regulations that allow the offender to have a hearing before an impartial hearing examiner for an individualized determination, appointment of counsel if the offender is indigent, entitlement to pre-hearing discovery, the ability to file motions prior to or during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>the hearing, and the opportunity to review the detailed, written final classification decision based on a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 3844 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>447 Mass. 768, 776 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">There is also no substantive due process violation here. See <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 972 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>428 Mass. 90, 102 (1998); <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 1211 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>447 Mass, at 760-761. The liberty and privacy interests affected by Doe\u2019s classification as a level three sex offender are weighty but they have not been deemed fundamental rights, and the State has a legitimate and compelling interest in protecting the public from harm from sex offenders. <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 972 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., supra </em>at 103 n.13. <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 1211 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., supra </em>at 760. <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 3844 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>447 Mass, at 775-776. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em>441 Mass. 157, 164 (2004) (examining due process rights for civil commitment of sexually dangerous persons). As explained above, the final classification of the sex offenders, and the dissemination of information to the public regarding level three offenders such as Doe,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> prior to their release from incarceration serves that purpose. See <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 3844 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., supra </em>at 775-776. Accordingly, Doe\u2019s substantive due process argument must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">We also briefly address and reject Doe\u2019s subsidiary arguments related to classifying him while incarcerated. He claims that he was prejudiced because 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.40 (2004) lists numerous factors that guide the hearing examiner and that several of these relate only to released offenders, thereby suggesting he must be released so that these factors may be considered. The hearing officer is, however, only required to consider applicable factors, and not all factors are applicable to all offenders. See 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.22(3) (2002) <em>(\u201cWhere applicable, </em>the Hearing Examiner shall apply such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>facts to the statutory factors as are set forth in [G.L.] c. 6, \u00a7 178[K][l][a] through [1]\u201d [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">Doe also contends that his right to call witnesses under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11(3), was prejudiced because the security requirements imposed on visitors to Department of Corrections facilities would have a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on his ability to call witnesses. He never sought to call any witnesses, however, and he does not explain how or why any potential witnesses he might have called were discouraged from testifying on his behalf because the hearing was held while he was incarcerated. Finally, he contends that because he poses no risk while incarcerated, there is no need to classify him while incarcerated. Doe\u2019s argument, however, ignores the obvious problem that if he is not classified while incarcerated, he may pose a danger upon release prior to being classified.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">3. <em>Conducting hearing by way of video conference. </em>Doe contends that the board\u2019s final classification was improper because the hearing was conducted via video conference, with Doe and his counsel participating remotely from a separate location from the hearing examiner and counsel for the board. Specifically, Doe argues that conducting a final classification hearing by way of video conference exceeded the board\u2019s regulatory and statutory authority and violated Doe\u2019s State and Federal due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">As an initial matter, we note that the board\u2019s enabling legislation and companion regulations do not expressly permit or prohibit classification hearings to be conducted via video conference. They do, however, provide for significant flexibility of procedures. The enabling statute provides: \u201cIf an offender requests a hearing . . . , the chair may appoint ... a hearing officer to conduct the hearing, according to the standard rules of adjudicatory procedure or other rules which the board may promulgate.\u201d See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178L(2), inserted by St. 1999, c. 74, \u00a7 2. The regulations further state: \u201cthe [board] may . . . develop, implement, and/or amend its policies, procedures, and protocols.\u201d 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.01. More particularly, the board is authorized to determine \u201cthe date, time and place of the hearing,\u201d 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.09(1) (2004), and the hearing examiner is given the express power to \u201cgovern the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>conduct of every phase of the hearing, including, but not limited to, the interpretation and construction of 803 [Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7] 1.00.\u201d 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.15 (2002). Additionally, \u201c[i]t is a recognized principle of administrative law that an agency may adopt policies through adjudication as well as through rulemaking. . . . \u2018[T]he choice made between proceeding by general rule or by individual, <em>ad hoc </em>litigation is one that lies primarily in the informed discretion of the administrative agency.\u2019 \u201d <em>Arthurs </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>383 Mass. 299, 312-313 (1981), quoting from <em>SEC </em>v. <em>Chenery Corp., </em>332 U.S. 194, 203 (1947). Here the hearing officer chose to exercise the substantial procedural powers delegated to him by statute and regulation to proceed by way of video conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Doe argues, nonetheless, that the regulations implicitly require an offender\u2019s \u201cphysical presence\u201d at a final classification hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We discern no such implied requirement. The board\u2019s regulations are more open-ended and more focused on what happens if an offender fails to appear at or attend a scheduled proceeding. For example, the \u201c[f]allure of the sex offender to appear at the scheduled hearing without good cause shown shall result in the waiver of the right to hearing.\u201d 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.13(2) (2002). Also for good cause shown, the board may reschedule the hearing at the request of the offender or his representative. The factors the board takes into account in making that determination include \u201c[t]he sex offender\u2019s ability to anticipate the circumstances which resulted in his inability to appear\u201d and \u201c[djelay by the sex offender in notifying the Board of his inability to attend the hearing.\u201d 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.12(2)(b)-(c) (2002). Given the flexible procedures set out in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>the regulations and statute, and the express powers given to the hearing officer regarding the conduct of the proceedings, and notwithstanding the consequences resulting from the sex offender\u2019s failure to appear at or attend a scheduled hearing, we do not read the regulations as requiring his physical presence at the hearing as opposed to participation by way of video conference. Accordingly, conducting final classification hearings remotely is not inconsistent with the board\u2019s enabling statute and companion regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Although the board\u2019s ability to conduct hearings by way of video conference is not statutorily precluded, we must determine whether remote participation in a sex offender\u2019s classification hearing violates Doe\u2019s State and Federal due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">\u201c[D]ue process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.\u201d <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 481 (1972). We consider three factors in determining whether Doe has been afforded sufficient due process: \u201cFirst, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government\u2019s interest, including ... the fiscal and administrative burdens [involved].\u201d <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 335 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">\u201cConsidering the first and second factors of the test, the plaintiff\u2019s interest in this case is weighty, and the risks associated with an erroneous classification would result in the dissemination of his registration information to the public. However, the plaintiff\u2019s interests must, with appropriate safeguards, be weighed against the board\u2019s interests in protecting the public.\u201d <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 3844 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>447 Mass, at 775-776. Generally, the board\u2019s regulations \u201censure adequate procedural safeguards and do not violate constitutional due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 777. As the Superior Court judge explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-8\">\u201cDoe received notice of the hearing, and an opportunity to be heard. . . . The hearing occurred before an impartial hearing examiner, and Doe was appointed counsel, had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>ability to (and did) file motions prior to and during the hearing, was entitled to (and received) pretrial discovery, and had the opportunity to review the detailed, written final classification decision. ... In addition, Doe \u2018was accorded several opportunities to challenge the classification decision\u2019 <em>[ibid.] </em>by requesting a de novo hearing and subsequently appealing the Examiner\u2019s decision to the Superior Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Doe, however, argues that he was prejudiced because he could not effectively present and receive evidence during his classification hearing specifically because of video conferencing. Doe relies upon the requirements that \u201c[n]o evidence shall be considered unless it is presented at the hearing\u201d and that \u201c[a] copy of any written submissions shall be offered immediately to all Parties.\u201d 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 1.19(2), 1.20 (2002). When read in conjunction with the requirements regarding discovery in the board\u2019s regulations, we conclude that Doe was not deprived of his ability to present and receive evidence at his hearing. The board\u2019s regulations require that the board and a sex offender and his or her counsel disclose any documents that either party \u201cintend[s] to introduce into evidence ... at least ten business days prior to the scheduled hearing date.\u201d 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.18(2) (2002). According to the hearing examiner, \u201c[t]he evidence presented in this particular case by the Board consisted solely of documentary evidence . . . provided to [Doe] well in advance of his hearing.\u201d Thus, we agree with hearing examiner that \u201c[t]he fact that the hearing was conducted via video conference did not have any effect on his ability to evaluate the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Doe also argues that he was prejudiced because he could not effectively examine and cross-examine witnesses in a hearing conducted via video conference. Doe suffered no such prejudice. As an initial matter, we note that Doe or his counsel would have had the opportunity, as the board found, to \u201cvisually and audibly observe the witness and to cross-examine him.\u201d See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>45 F.3d 837, 843-844 (4th Cir. 1995) (\u201cOf course, the video conference procedure does not preclude the respondent from confronting and conducting relevant cross-examination of the witnesses. . . . The only question is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>extent to which the video conferencing procedure preserves the essence of these rights sufficiently so as to conform with the strictures of due process\u201d). Moreover, insofar as Doe analogizes his rights to cross-examine witnesses in a board hearing to the right of confrontation afforded in a criminal proceeding, Doe\u2019s reliance is misplaced. Sex offender registration and classification is not a criminal proceeding, and therefore, Doe had no right to confront witnesses at his hearing under either the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution or art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Given, </em>441 Mass. 741, 746 n.8 (2004) (concluding that there is no right to confront witnesses in hearing to civilly commit sex offender as a sexually dangerous person). Ultimately, Doe\u2019s argument concerning his diminished ability to examine and cross-examine witnesses at his hearing must necessarily fail because neither he nor the board called any witnesses at the hearing. Accordingly, Doe cannot successfully demonstrate he was harmed in any way by the effect of video conferencing on his ability to examine and cross-examine witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Similarly, Doe\u2019s argument that he was denied due process because the hearing examiner must make credibility determinations based on remote testimony observed on a video screen must also fail. As explained above, the hearing examiner would have been able to visually and audibly evaluate the witness. Although we recognize that video conferencing \u201cis not the same as actual presence, and it is to be expected that the ability to observe demeanor . . . may be lessened in a particular case by video conferencing,\u201d there is no indication that this difference was meaningful here. <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Logan, </em>38 F. Supp. 2d 463, 467 (W.D. Va. 1999). Most importantly, absent any witness testimony at Doe\u2019s hearing, the hearing examiner was not required to make any credibility determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Finally, we address the third <em>Mathews </em>factor weighed in determining the sufficiency of due process, \u201cthe Government\u2019s interest, including ... the fiscal and administrative burdens [that the additional or substitute procedures would entail].\u201d <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 3844 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>447 Mass, at 775, quoting from <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. at 335. When reviewing an agency decision, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>we \u201cgive due weight to the experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge of the agency, as well as to the discretionary authority conferred upon it.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7). Accordingly, we acknowledge the hearing examiner\u2019s finding, particularly given the absence of any conflicting evidence, that conducting hearings remotely conserves agency resources<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and increases its productivity: \u201cThe video conference hearings eliminate the travel expenses incurred by the hearing examiner and the Board\u2019s attorney when traveling to the various hearing sites spread throughout eastern and western Massachusetts. Moreover, video conference hearings increase the productivity of the hearing examiner and Board\u2019s attorney by eliminating the time lost to travel.\u201d Given the number of registration and classification proceedings, and the critical importance of timely completion of these proceedings, these benefits are significant. See <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldrige, supra </em>at 348 (\u201cthe [government\u2019s interest, and hence that of the public, in conserving scarce fiscal and administrative resources is a factor that must be weighed\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>45 F.3d at 847 (\u201cfiscal and administrative concerns are properly taken into account\u201d in allowing video conferencing of civil commitment proceedings). Accordingly, the government\u2019s interest in conducting hearings remotely is significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Balancing each of the <em>Mathews </em>factors discussed above, we conclude that the board\u2019s classification procedures here complied with due process despite being conducted via video conference. Although there were significant liberty and privacy interests at stake, the Commonwealth established that the procedures utilized were sufficient to minimize the risk of the erroneous deprivation of those rights. Additionally, the Commonwealth\u2019s financial and administrative interests in utilizing video conferencing justified their use in these proceedings. Finally, there has been no showing that proceeding via video conferencing in any way increased the likelihood of an erroneous classification in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The board\u2019s conducting Doe\u2019s final classification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>hearing both while Doe was incarcerated and via video conference did not violate any of Doe\u2019s constitutional or statutory rights. Accordingly, the board\u2019s decision classifying Doe as a level three sex offender is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b725-7\"> Doe was a level three sex offender, thus requiring public dissemination by the appropriate police department of relevant information, including his name, home and work addresses, offenses for which he was convicted, and his photograph.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b727-6\"> Doe cites four Federal circuit court cases holding that video conferencing does not satisfy a requirement that an individual be \u201cpresent.\u201d <em>Valenzuela-Gonzalez </em>v. <em>United States Dist. Ct. for the Dist. of Ariz., </em>915 F.2d 1276, 1280 (9th Cir. 1990). <em>United States </em>v. Navarro, 169 F.3d 228, 239 (5th Cir. 1999). <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>248 F.3d 300, 302-303 (4th Cir. 2001). <em>United States </em>v. <em>Torres-Palma, </em>290 F.3d 1244, 1248 (10th Cir. 2002). Doe\u2019s reliance on these cases fails for two reasons. First, the board\u2019s regulations do not require \u201cpresence\u201d; rather, they merely require that the sex offender appear at the hearing. Moreover, these cases hold that the use of video conferencing is inappropriate for criminal arraignments and sentencing, which, unlike Doe\u2019s classification as a sex offender, are governed by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b731-7\"> The hearing examiner found that, while there are some expenses associated with the technology, \u201cthe Board believes that the savings will be greater than these costs.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
