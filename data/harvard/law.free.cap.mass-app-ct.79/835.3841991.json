L. c. 90, \u00a7 24G(a); and (2) failing to operate a motor vehicle within marked lanes, G. L. c. 89, \u00a7 4A. The indictments arose out of a fatal accident that occurred in Adams. After a trial before a Superior Court judge sitting without a jury, the defendant was found guilty on both indictments.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">On appeal, the defendant claims that two Superior Court judges, one the motion judge, the other the trial judge, erred in denying his <em>Daubert-Lanigan </em>motion<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to exclude the testimony of the Commonwealth\u2019s accident reconstruction expert as to the cause and location of the accident. The defendant also argues that the trial judge erred in (1) denying his motion for required finding of not guilty, and (2) admitting consciousness of guilt evidence regarding his failure to appear on a date previously scheduled for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">1. <em>The </em>Daubert-Lanigan <em>motion. </em>Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion in limine to preclude the Commonwealth from introducing in evidence the opinion of its accident reconstruction expert, State Trooper David Sanford. Trooper Sanford opined that while driving north on North Summer Street in Adams, the defendant left his lane of travel, crossed over a double yellow line, went into the southbound lane, and struck a motorcycle, resulting in the death of the motorcycle operator. The defendant\u2019s expert disagreed, asserting that the decedent, traveling in the southbound lane, crossed the double yellow line into oncoming traffic and struck the defendant\u2019s vehicle in the northbound lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">In the motion, the defendant claimed that Trooper Sanford\u2019s opinion was not reliable because he failed to utilize any scientific methods, analysis, or mathematical calculations in forming his opinion that the collision occurred in the southbound lane. Therefore, according to the defendant, Trooper Sanford\u2019s testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>mony did not meet the standards of admissibility set forth in <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrill Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579 (1993) <em>(Daubert), </em>and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanigan, </em>419 Mass. 15 (1994) <em>(Lanigan). </em>An affidavit from the defendant\u2019s accident reconstruction expert accompanied the motion. The defendant requested an evidentiary hearing. In response to the motion, the Commonwealth submitted Trooper Sanford\u2019s collision reconstruction report (report).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">The defendant does not challenge the science of accident reconstruction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rather, he claims that the motion judge and the trial judge erred by failing to determine whether Trooper Sanford, in reaching his opinion, correctly applied the science of accident reconstruction to the particular facts in this case in a reliable manner. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>445 Mass. 626, 645-648 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">At the motion hearing, after reading Trooper Sanford\u2019s report and listening to the arguments of counsel, the judge decided not to hold an evidentiary hearing and ruled that Trooper Sanford\u2019s opinion was admissible at trial because there was a factual basis for his opinion, and it was therefore reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-9\">At trial, the defendant moved for reconsideration of his <em>Daubert-Lanigan </em>motion by the trial judge (who was not the motion judge). The trial judge refused to consider the motion but offered to send it to the motion judge for his reconsideration. At that point, the defendant withdrew his motion. The trial judge stated he would consider the admissibility of Trooper Sanford\u2019s opinion testimony after he had testified. The defendant agreed to that procedure. At the conclusion of Trooper Sanford\u2019s testimony, the defendant moved to strike, claiming that the factual basis of the opinion was unreliable. The trial judge denied the motion, and the defendant claims error.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-10\">Prior to the admission of scientific or technical evidence, a \u201cjudge must first rule on any challenge to the validity of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>process or theory underlying a proffered [scientific or technical] opinion. \u2018This entails a preliminary assessment of whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid and of whether that reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the facts in issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lanigan, </em>419 Mass. at 26, quoting from <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 592-593. See <em>Kumho Tire Co. </em>v. <em>Carmichael, </em>526 U.S. 137, 141 (1999) <em>(Daubert </em>applies to testimony of engineers and other experts who are not scientists). In acting as gatekeeper, the judge may, but is not required to, hold an evidentiary hearing. <em>Palandjian </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>446 Mass. 100, 111 (2006). We review the claimed errors under the abuse of discretion standard, see <em>Canavan\u2019s Case, </em>432 Mass. 304, 311-312 (2000), addressing the claims of error at each stage of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">a. <em>The evidence at the motion hearing. </em>The record before the motion judge consisted of Trooper Sanford\u2019s report. We summarize its contents. Trooper Sanford was dispatched to the accident scene shortly after the accident. Upon arrival at the scene, the trooper observed the defendant\u2019s vehicle and the decedent\u2019s motorcycle in the southbound lane, against another vehicle parked at the southbound curb. According to the report, at the time of the collision, the decedent was ejected from his motorcycle, struck the defendant\u2019s vehicle\u2019s windshield with his head, then traveled over that vehicle and fell to the road behind the defendant\u2019s vehicle in the southbound lane. Trooper Sanford observed gouge marks,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>scratches, and scuff marks\u00ae in the southbound lane. The trooper ordered photographs to be taken and later made measurements at the scene. He also read witnesses\u2019 statements, including one from a witness who stated that he observed the defendant\u2019s vehicle cross the center line just before the collision. The report concluded with Trooper Sanford\u2019s opinion that \u201cthis collision was caused by the failure of [the defendant] to stay within marked lanes. All the pavement evidence, scratches, gouges and scuff marks were in the southbound lane. A witness observed [the defendant\u2019s vehicle] cross <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>the centerline. Further, medical evidence indicates that the [defendant] was operating under the influence of intoxicating liquor: 0.24% BAG.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">It is clear that Trooper Sanford\u2019s conclusions were based, in large measure, on the observations he made at the accident scene. The defendant argues that observations are not enough, and that Trooper Sanford should have utilized scientific methods, analysis, or mathematical calculations in forming his opinion. The defendant failed to argue why, in this particular instance, it was necessary for the trooper to employ such devices.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We conclude that the motion judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion without an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">b. <em>Trooper Sanford\u2019s testimony at trial. </em>The defendant further claims that the trial judge erred when he did not conduct a <em>Daubert-Lanigan </em>hearing at trial. We reject the defendant\u2019s claim and conclude that once a judge has decided a <em>Daubert-Lanigan </em>motion before trial, the trial judge is not required to conduct another hearing on the motion, even if the trial judge was not the judge who had ruled earlier on the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">We recognize, however, that the motion judge\u2019s ruling was not final, and it is clear that the defendant could still challenge Trooper Sanford\u2019s opinion before the trier of fact, here the trial judge. See <em>Higgins </em>v. <em>Delta Elevator Serv. Corp., </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 643, 648 (1998). In that regard, \u201c[vigorous cross-examination, presentation of contrary evidence, and careful instruction on the burden of proof are the traditional and appropriate means of attacking shaky but admissible evidence.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">At trial, Trooper Sanford testified in accord with his report. Further, he stated that he measured the gouge marks he observed in the southbound lane and they matched marks he found on the undercarriage of the defendant\u2019s vehicle. On cross-examination, he testified that he did not perform any empirical mathematical equations and did not make any momentum calculations: \u201c[b]ecause [of] the relative size of the two vehicle[s], the car is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>much heavier than the motorcycle and throws the mathematical calculation off.\u201d The fact that Trooper Sanford did not perform certain tests goes to the weight of his testimony, not its admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">Richard Montefusco, an accident reconstruction expert, testified for the defense. He first examined the accident scene on May 4, 2007, over nine months after the accident. Montefusco did not see gouge marks on the road, and he challenged Trooper Sanford\u2019s testimony that the marks in the road that he observed were gouge marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">Montefusco testified that the debris in the roadway, including glass in the northbound lane, indicated that the collision had actually occurred in the northbound lane rather than the southbound lane. According to Montefusco, and relying on the \u201ctumble equation\u201d as it applied to the glass found in the northbound lane, the collision took place further south than Trooper Sanford claimed. Montefusco admitted, however, that the \u201ctumble equation\u201d was only applicable for such things as tumbling cars and bodies, not sliding objects such as shards of glass.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">At trial, Trooper Sanford\u2019s testimony was the subject of vigorous cross-examination and was disputed by contrary evidence. The trial judge did not abuse his discretion in allowing in evidence Trooper Sanford\u2019s opinion testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">3. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>The defendant claims that the trial judge erred in denying his motion for a required finding of not guilty. According to the defendant, the Commonwealth failed to prove \u201cthat the consumption of alcohol diminished the defendant\u2019s capacity to operate a motor vehicle safely causing him to act recklessly or negligently so as to endanger the lives and safety of the public.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">In reviewing the denial of a motion for a required finding of not guilty, we must determine \u201cwhether the evidence, in its light most favorable to the Commonwealth ... is sufficient ... to permit the [fact finder] to infer the existence of the essential elements of the crime charged [beyond a reasonable doubt . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>676-677 (1979), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sandler, </em>368 Mass. 729, 740 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-4\">We summarize the evidence. On July 23, 2006, the defendant left his apartment at about 11:00 p.m., because he was upset with his upstairs neighbor for loud parties that kept his daughter awake. At the time he left his apartment, he had consumed seven beers. He went to a bar in Adams. After leaving the bar shortly before 12:00 a.m., the defendant drove north on North Summer Street in Adams. That street, a public way, is divided by a double yellow line. At the same time, the decedent was riding his motorcycle south on North Summer Street. The decedent had been drinking, and although his blood alcohol level was 0.29 percent at the time of the accident, his driving did not appear to be impaired. As the vehicles approached each other, the defendant was seen talking on a cellular telephone. Moments before the accident, the defendant\u2019s vehicle was observed straddling the double yellow line with one set of wheels on the west side of the yellow line and one set of wheels on the east side of the line. The vehicles collided, and the decedent was thrown into the air and over the defendant\u2019s vehicle. His helmet was embedded in the windshield of the defendant\u2019s vehicle. The decedent was pronounced dead at the scene. As we have stated, Trooper Sanford testified that it was his opinion that the defendant\u2019s vehicle failed to stay in the northbound lane, crossed over the double yellow line, and struck the decedent\u2019s motorcycle in the southbound lane.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Based on the evidence, the trial judge did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">3. <em>Consciousness of guilt. </em>On the first day of trial, the Commonwealth filed a motion that it be allowed to use the defendant\u2019s default on the initial trial date as evidence of consciousness of guilt. The trial judge allowed the motion over the defendant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">The Commonwealth acknowledges that a default that is entered because a defendant fails to appear on a scheduled trial date may be properly considered as consciousness of guilt only if the defendant received notice of the trial date. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hightower, </em>400 Mass. 267, 269 (1987). Here, the Commonwealth did not present any testimony as to the question of notice but, rather, relied on the docket. The docket does show that the defendant was originally held on $30,000 cash or $300,000 surety when he was arraigned on September 13, 2006. The bail was lowered to $10,000 cash or surety on November 13, 2006, and the defendant posted bail on December 19, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">There is nothing in the docket between December 19, 2006, and March 20, 2008, that demonstrates that a trial date had been scheduled and that the defendant had notice of that date. It was error to admit the evidence, but the error was not prejudicial in the circumstances of this case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vinnie, </em>428 Mass. 161, 163, cert, denied, 525 U.S. 1007 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b872-8\"> The defendant was sentenced on the first indictment to six to seven years at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Cedar Junction.

None of the cited testimony was before the motion judge, and we do not consider it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b876-10\"> After the accident, the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol level was determined to be 0.24 percent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b877-7\"> In the defendant\u2019s brief, appellate counsel ignores the requirement that the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and summarizes the defendant\u2019s evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
