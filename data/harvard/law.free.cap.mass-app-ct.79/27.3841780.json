Elizabeth Hebert, who many years earlier had been a tenured faculty member at the college, received an initial interview for the position. However, she did not advance to the final round, and the college eventually hired one of the three candidates who did. Based on a grievance that Hebert\u2019s union, Massachusetts Teachers Association/Massachusetts Community College Council/National Education Association (union), pressed on her behalf, an arbitrator ruled that the college violated its collective bargaining agreement by choosing its preferred candidate over Hebert. He ordered the college to appoint Hebert to the posted position with full back pay, or to pay broadscale damages on an ongoing basis. A Superior Court judge vacated the arbitrator\u2019s award, and the union seeks to have it reinstated on appeal. We agree with the judge that the arbitrator exceeded his authority in some respects, but we conclude that the case must be remanded for additional proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\"><em>Background.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Hebert has a \u201cmaster\u2019s degree in food and nutrition.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In 1981, she began working as a \u201cprogram coordinator\u201d in the dietetic technology program at the college. She was promoted to assistant professor in 1986, and she obtained tenure in 1988. In May of 1989, the college eliminated the entire dietetic technology program because of severe budgetary issues, and Hebert therefore lost her position. The college offered her a \u201cretraining sabbatical\u201d designed to qualify her for a position in the biology department. She initially accepted that offer but eventually decided that she did not want to leave the nutrition field. Therefore, she resigned her position at the college.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, at many points over the ensuing years she taught courses at the college as an adjunct professor.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">On January 6, 2006, the college posted the assistant professor position in nutrition. The posting listed various \u201crequired\u201d and \u201cpreferred\u201d qualifications. Among the required qualifications was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>that the candidate have a \u201c[m]aster\u2019s degree in Nutrition or closely related field.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Hebert applied for the posted position, and she was among the five candidates asked to make presentations to the search committee. The committee recommended three finalists, including Hebert. In the committee\u2019s report, the chair had particularly positive things to say about Hebert\u2019s candidacy, referring to her as \u201cexceeding] all candidates [in the pool] in required and preferred job qualifications.\u201d However, the college decided not to hire from the existing pool. Instead, it reposted the position on December 21, 2006. Although the new posting was slightly modified, it continued to list having a master\u2019s degree as a \u201crequired\u201d qualification. The membership of the search committee had changed in the intervening months; for example, the chair, who had been a booster of Hebert\u2019s in the earlier process, no longer was on the search committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Hebert reapplied, and, as before, made the search committee\u2019s initial cut and was brought in for an interview. The reconstituted search committee asked each candidate a set series of questions, which was a different format than had been used in the earlier search. Hebert found the process \u201cvery strange,\u201d and she acknowledged to the arbitrator that it \u201cthrew her a bit.\u201d She did not advance further in the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">The search committee chose three finalists, including Clement Ameho, who held a Ph.D. in nutrition from Tufts University; Laura Hutchinson, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Massachusetts who had completed her course work and comprehensive examinations, but had not yet finished her doctoral dissertation; and Kim Teupker, who held a master\u2019s degree in nutrition and who \u2014 in the arbitrator\u2019s words \u2014 had \u201cprofessional and teaching experience similar to Hebert\u2019s.\u201d The college eventually hired Hutchinson for the position.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">On May 18, 2007, the day that Hebert learned that she was not a finalist, she filed a grievance claiming that the college had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>violated the collective bargaining agreement then in effect by having \u201cacted in an arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable manner in failing to offer her a second interview.\u201d After the college denied the grievance on multiple grounds and mediation proved unsuccessful, the union requested that the dispute be arbitrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The assigned arbitrator held a hearing on November 20, 2008, and he ruled in Hebert\u2019s favor by a decision dated March 2, 2009. With the college having completed its hiring process after Hebert had filed her grievance, the arbitrator framed the issues before him as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\">\u201cIs the grievance of Elizabeth Hebert arbitrable?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-7\">\u201cIf so, did the College violate the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement by failing to appoint the grievant to a full-time faculty position in the Nutrition Department?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-8\">\u201cIf so, what shall be the remedy?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">The arbitrator determined that the grievance was arbitrable, because, having lost her teaching position two decades earlier, Hebert was a \u201cretrenched\u201d union member who enjoyed certain preferences under the collective bargaining agreement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> **He concluded that Hebert no longer was entitled to some of these preferences, either because of the sheer passage of time or because she had not followed required notification procedures in the interim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">However, the arbitrator found that Hebert still was entitled to a preference with regard to article XVI of the collective bargain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>ing agreement, the general provision governing the \u201cfilling of vacancies.\u201d Section 16.02 of the collective bargaining agreement requires the college president or designee to fill any vacancies with unit members within the college \u201cwhen in the professional judgment of the President of the College or designee such unit members are the best-qualified applicants.\u201d It further states that retrenched unit members must be given first preference \u201c[i]f the President of the College or designee determines that two (2) or more applicants are equally best qualified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A_T\">After reviewing their respective qualifications, the arbitrator found Hebert better qualified than Hutchinson, and \u201c[a]t the very least, Hebert should have been found [by the college] to be equally qualified as Hutchinson.\u201d Indeed, he determined that Hutchinson was per se unqualified given that, although she had completed her doctoral course work and examinations, she did not possess a master\u2019s degree. Based on this, the arbitrator concluded that, in choosing Hutchinson over Hebert, the college failed to give Hebert preference as a \u201cretrenched faculty member\u201d and thereby violated the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">As to remedy, the arbitrator ordered the college to hire Hebert for the posted position (plus back pay). Recognizing doubt as to whether he could order the college to hire Hebert, the arbitrator further ordered that, in the event that his preferred remedy was struck, the college must pay Hebert the full salary of the position for as long as that job continued to exist. A Superior Court judge summarily vacated this award, stating: \u201cHebert is not entitled to reinstatement and not entitled to retrenchment. Where it is clear that the arbitrator exceeded his authority, and [his award] is against public policy, his decision must be VACATED.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A2j\"><em>Discussion. Scope of review and the principle of nondelega-bility. </em>Judicial review of arbitration awards is extremely limited. We must accept an arbitrator\u2019s factual findings and legal conclusions regardless of their validity. <em>Plymouth-Carver Regional Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>J. Farmer &amp; Co., </em>407 Mass. 1006, 1007 (1990) (\u201cAbsent fraud, errors of law or fact are not sufficient grounds for setting aside an award\u201d). \u201cHowever, the question whether an arbitrator exceeded his or her authority is always subject to judicial review.\u201d <em>Board of Higher Educ. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Teachers Assn., NEA, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 42,47 (2004), citing <em>School Comm. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number><em>of W. Springfield </em>v. <em>Korbut, </em>373 Mass. 788, 792 (1977). See G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11(a)(3), inserted by St. 1959, c. 546, \u00a7 1 (requiring judge to vacate arbitrators\u2019 awards if \u201cthe arbitrators exceeded their powers or rendered an award requiring a person to commit an act or engage in conduct prohibited by state or federal law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">An arbitrator exceeds his authority when he intrudes upon decisions that cannot be delegated, but that are instead left by statute to the exclusive managerial control of designated public officials. <em>Higher Educ. Coordinating Council/Roxbury Community College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Teachers\u2019 Assn./Mass. Community College Council, </em>423 Mass. 23, 27-31 (1996) (hereinafter <em>Roxbury Community College). </em>\u201cThis gloss on public sector collective bargaining statutes is deemed necessary in order that the collective actions of public employees do not distort the normal political process for controlling public policy.\u201d <em>Boston Teachers Union, Local 66 </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Boston, </em>386 Mass. 197, 211 (1982). However, the principle of nondelegability is to be applied only so far as is necessary to preserve the college\u2019s discretion to carry out its statutory mandates. Thus, although the principle applies to the administration of community colleges, \u201cunless the arbitrator\u2019s decision infringed on an area of educational policy reserved for the exclusive judgment of the administrators of the college, it cannot be disturbed.\u201d <em>Roxbury Community College, supra </em>at 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Section 22 of G. L. c. 15A, inserted by St. 1991, c. 142, \u00a7 7, specifically delegates to the community college administrators the responsibility to \u201cappoint, transfer, dismiss, promote and award tenure to all personnel of said institution.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Few issues are as central to setting educational policy as choosing which faculty members to hire or promote. See <em>id. </em>at 28 (\u201cIt has been observed that \u2018[t]he success of a school system depends largely on the character and the ability of the teachers. Unless a school committee has authority to employ and discharge teachers it would be difficult to perform properly its duty of managing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>school system\u2019 \u201d), quoting from <em>Davis </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Somerville, </em>307 Mass. 354, 362 (1940). Not surprisingly, the Supreme Judicial Court long has recognized that \u201cspecific appointment determinations\u201d cannot be delegated to an arbitrator. <em>School Comm, of Holbrook </em>v. <em>Holbrook Educ. Assn., </em>395 Mass. 651, 655 (1985), quoting from <em>Boston Teachers Union, Local 66 </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Boston, supra. </em>See <em>School Comm. of Boston </em>v. <em>Boston Teachers Union, Local 66, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 903, 904 (1987) (recognizing that school committee\u2019s duty \u201cto ascertain the qualifications of teachers to be appointed to positions\u201d is \u201cnondelegable\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">These principles apply with at least equal force in the context of higher education. <em>Roxbury Community College, supra </em>at 31.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The need for college administrators to be able to exercise judgment in conducting faculty searches is reinforced by the discretionary nature of evaluating the candidates. Hiring faculty, like granting tenure, \u201cnecessarily hinge[s] on subjective [judgments] regarding the applicant\u2019s academic excellence, teaching ability, creativity, contributions to the university community, rapport with students and colleagues, and other factors that are not susceptible of quantitative measurement.\u201d <em>Berkowitz </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 262, 269 (2003), quoting from <em>Kumar </em>v. <em>Trustees, Univ. of Mass., 11A </em>F.2d 1, 12 (1st Cir. 1985), cert, denied, 475 U.S. 1097 (1986) (Campbell, C.J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">While a college cannot delegate specific appointment decisions, it can bind itself to the process that is to be used in making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>such decisions, including the criteria by which the candidates will be judged. See, e.g., <em>School Comm. of Holbrook, supra </em>(\u201cbargained-for procedures governing the appointment and reappointment of teachers, such as posting and evaluation requirements, are specifically enforceable\u201d); <em>School Comm. of New Bedford </em>v. <em>New Bedford Educators Assn., 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 793, 798 (1980) (same principle). Sorting out when arbitrators tread into the forbidden realm of nondelegable decision-making, or are instead properly enforcing agreed-to procedures, requires nuanced analysis on a case-by-case basis. See, e.g., <em>School Comm, of Boston </em>v. <em>Boston Teachers Union, Local 66, Am. Fedn. of Teachers (AFL-CIO), </em>372 Mass. 605, 614 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\"><em>Liability. </em>Following these principles, we conclude that it is beyond the authority of an arbitrator to question the judgment that a college administration exercises in evaluating candidates for a faculty appointment, regardless of whether the applicable collective bargaining agreement can be interpreted as subjecting such issues to arbitration.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Put differently, whether a college administration erred in exercising its judgment as to which candidate was best qualified is not an arbitrable issue. See <em>Department of State Police </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Org. of State Engrs. &amp; Scientists, </em>456 Mass. 450, 455-461 (2010) (absent alleged procedural violation or discrimination based on membership in constitutionally protected class, State police colonel\u2019s decision to terminate chemist was not arbitrable).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> If an arbitrator were allowed to overturn a college administration\u2019s discretionary judgments on how to rank job candidates, then, absent proof of fraud, we would be compelled to let the arbitrator\u2019s decision stand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>regardless of the reason, if any reason at all, the arbitrator gave for finding an abuse of discretion. This would render the arbitrator the ultimate decision maker on faculty hiring decisions, a result that is plainly inconsistent with G. L. c. 15A, \u00a7 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">Accordingly, to the extent that the arbitrator here substituted his judgment for that of the college administration in making his own evaluation of the job candidates, that decision cannot stand. We are not done, however, because the union argues that the arbitrator\u2019s decision can be sustained without intruding upon matters of judgment. Specifically, it contends that the college was not free to choose Hutchinson over Hebert because Hutchinson was per se unqualified for the posted position given that she lacked a master\u2019s degree (a \u201crequired\u201d qualification, as propounded by the college). See <em>School Comm. of New </em>Bedford, 9 Mass. App. Ct. at 798 (arbitrator\u2019s review of whether school committee hired candidate who did not meet posted minimum job requirements, including that candidate possess master\u2019s degree, does \u201cnot impermissibly limit the committee\u2019s discretion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">The college counters that the arbitrator\u2019s reasoning lacks an appreciation for how the academic world weighs such credentials. It suggests that being a doctoral candidate with \u201call but dissertation\u201d (ABD) status is generally considered to provide higher rank than having a mere master\u2019s degree, and that its judgment in this regard cannot be second-guessed. This argument is not without some force. However, we ultimately conclude that, having drafted its posting expressly to <em>require </em>that candidates have a master\u2019s degree, the college was not free to determine that a candidate who had obtained neither a master\u2019s degree nor a higher degree nevertheless possessed \u201cbetter\u201d credentials than one with a master\u2019s degree.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We note that the college easily could have written its job posting so as to require a \u201cmaster\u2019s degree or equivalent,\u201d a phrase that the college used in the collective bargaining agreement.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Having established the minimum job requirements as it did, the college had a good faith obligation to employ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>them, and it lay within the arbitrator\u2019s purview to determine whether the college had done so. <em>School Comm. of Newton </em>v. <em>Newton Sch. Custodians Assn., Local 454, SEIU, </em>438 Mass. 739, 748-749 (2003) (although principal retains \u201cactual, first-line determination of whom to hire,\u201d he is bound to make \u201cgood-faith effort\u201d to apply criteria to which he has agreed). See <em>School Comm, of New Bedford, supra </em>(school committee bound itself to follow its own appointment criteria). In sum, although the arbitrator was without authority to substitute his judgment for that of the college administration, insofar as he ruled that the college violated the collective bargaining agreement by selecting someone who did not meet the minimum requirements set forth in the posting, his ruling cannot be disturbed.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\"><em>Remedy. </em>It does not follow, however, that the arbitrator then could appoint Hebert an assistant professor against the wishes of the college administration. The cases consistently recognize that arbitrators do not have authority to grant such relief, because it would directly intrude upon the appointment authority left to the exclusive purview of the college administration. See, e.g., <em>School Comm, of Holbrook, </em>395 Mass, at 655 (even where arbitrator\u2019s ruling that school committee violated collective bargaining agreement by not appointing grievant to posted position, arbitrator had no authority to compel appointment).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The interference with the college administration\u2019s prerogative is especially pronounced, given that \u2014 even without Hutchinson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>considered eligible for the posted search \u2014 there was at least one other candidate in the mix who did meet the minimum requirements and whom the college administration determined was better qualified than Hebert.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> But even if there were no alternative candidates available, the college administration would remain free to pass over the entire pool of eligible candidates (as it already once did) and either to repost the position or to leave it vacant.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">What relief then is appropriate to remedy the procedural violation that occurred? As the college acknowledged at oral argument, if it erred by hiring someone who did not meet the posted job requirements, then the obvious way to address the problem directly would be to start the process again. <em>Boston, Boston Pub. Library </em>v. <em>Professional Staff Assn., </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 105, 111-113 (2004) (where library selected candidate who did not meet minimum posted requirements, remedy was to vacate selection and allow reposting). A new search would give all potential job applicants a fair opportunity to apply (thus mooting the procedural violation), while preserving to the college administration its exclusive authority to determine the hiring needs of the college and to make specific appointment decisions.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">However, reposting makes sense only if the college intends to retain the position, something that cannot be determined based on the current record.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Moreover, although the union would be entitled to have the position reposted if the college intends to fill it, we are hesitant to assume that \u2014 even in that scenario \u2014 reposting would necessarily be in the union\u2019s (or Hebert\u2019s) interest.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We need not resolve those questions, but simply direct that, in the event the college intends to maintain the contested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>position, the union is entitled to have it reposted, using whichever criteria the college administration determines best serve the college\u2019s needs, consistent with its statutory mandates.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">The question remains whether Hebert should be entitled to any damages. As the Supreme Judicial Court often has recognized, \u201cA[n] award of damages \u2018is separable\u2019 from an arbitrator\u2019s mistaken conclusion that a particular decision by [school administrators] is arbitrable.\u201d <em>Roxbury Community College, </em>423 Mass, at 33, quoting from <em>School Comm. of Holbrook, </em>395 Mass, at 657. Therefore, \u201cit [is] within [the arbitrator\u2019s] power to award damages for the college\u2019s violation of the agreement, so long as the damages were in an amount that would not \u2018have the effect of compelling reinstatement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The damages that the arbitrator issued here plainly run afoul of this last proviso. Indeed, the arbitrator recognized that his award could coerce the college to appoint Hebert because doing so would \u201cresult[] in the College actually getting something for the money it will otherwise have to spend for a purely monetary remedy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Although full-scale damages plainly exceed the arbitrator\u2019s authority, this does not rule out the possibility of Hebert obtaining more limited damages. <em>School Comm. of Holbrook, supra </em>at 657-658 (award of one-year\u2019s back pay upheld). What, if any, damages might be appropriate is, at this point, far from obvious given that the collective bargaining agreement expressly limits the compensation that an arbitrator can award for a breach of the agreement to \u201cactual damages directly attributable to such breach.\u201d Nevertheless, under the cases, the question of damages is one for the arbitrator to resolve so long as he does not exceed his authority. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>In light of the foregoing, we reverse the judgment vacating the arbitrator\u2019s award. A new judgment shall enter reversing so much of the arbitrator\u2019s award as ordered that Hebert be appointed with full back pay and benefits, or that she receive full pay for each year the position exists. The new judgment also should remand the case to the arbitrator for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b64-7\"> The facts are taken from the arbitrator\u2019s findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b64-8\"> The arbitrator\u2019s decision does not identify at which university Hebert earned her master\u2019s degree, and nothing elsewhere in the record reveals this.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b64-9\"> As the arbitrator noted, there is a confusing paper trail as to whether Hebert\u2019s resignation became effective in December of 1989 or October of 1990. Nothing turns on this fact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b65-9\"> According to a document included in the record appendix, the college offered the position to Hutchinson only after Ameho turned it down. The arbitrator does not mention that document, which was filed in Superior Court as an attachment to the college\u2019s complaint for modification of the arbitration award, and it is not clear whether the document, or the underlying facts suggested by it, were before him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b66-11\"> The collective bargaining agreement defined \u201cretrenchment\u201d as \u201cthe discontinued employment of a unit member prior to the expiration of that unit member\u2019s term of appointment through no fault or delinquency of that unit member, pursuant to Article XIX [the provisions applicable to retrenchment].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b66-14\"> Article XIX prohibits the college from filling a retrenched member\u2019s position with someone else. That prohibition lasts for a period of four years, and even if the posted position were considered the same as the one from which Hebert was laid off, almost two decades had elapsed in the interim. Different sections of article XIX provide a retrenched unit member with fairly strong preferences for being \u201crecalled]\u201d for other positions at the college. The arbitrator concluded that Hebert was not eligible for these preferences because she had not complied with annual notification requirements that he concluded were prerequisites to being put on the \u201crecall list.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b68-7\"> Section 22 delegates such decisions to the respective college\u2019s board of trustees, although \u2014 as was the case here \u2014 the decisions are in practice carried out by the college\u2019s president and his delegees subject to the board of trustees\u2019 review.

However, the court ruled that the principles of nondelegability recognized as applying to public elementary and secondary schools applied at the college level; indeed, the court observed that the statutory language delegating management authority to college administrations was \u201cmore emphatic and detailed\u201d than the comparable language applicable to public elementary and secondary schools. <em>Id. </em>at 29.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b70-6\"> The nondelegability doctrine renders interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement beside the point. Nevertheless, we note that the terms of the agreement easily can be read as congruent with the nondelegability doctrine.

Whatever the precise norms of the academic world with respect to whether ABD status would ordinarily be considered superior to having a master\u2019s degree, it is appropriate to hold the college to the requirements it posted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b71-7\"> Compare <em>Boston, Boston Pub.
