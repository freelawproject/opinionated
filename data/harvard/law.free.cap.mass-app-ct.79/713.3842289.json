Michael Woodside, appeals from a Probate and Family Court judgment of divorce nisi allowing the mother, Sharry A. Woodside, to remove the parties\u2019 two minor children to Maine and ordering him to pay alimony to the mother. The parties were divorced on March 12, 2009, and a \u201cBifurcated Judgment of Divorce Nisi\u201d (first judgment), dated March 12,2009, incorporated the parties\u2019 agreement as to custody and visitation of the children. On the same date, a temporary order entered ordering the parties to comply with the terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>the agreement. Issues of property division and support were reserved for trial. The mother subsequently filed a complaint for removal, which was tried, by agreement, with the property and support issues. A second \u201cBifurcated Judgment of Divorce\u201d (second judgment), dated August 24, 2009, amended the first judgment by allowing the mother\u2019s petition for removal, and ordered a division of property and the father to pay weekly alimony and child support. Both the first and second judgments were entered on October 9, 2009. The father appeals from the second judgment insofar as it allows removal of the children and awards alimony. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\"><em>Background. </em>The parties were married on April 23, 1993, in Antigua and lived in Florida and Texas before settling in Massachusetts in August, 2003. The parties have two daughters, the first bom on January 27, 2000, and the second bom on May 5, 2005. The parties lived together in the marital home until the time of their separation in April, 2008; the children remained with the mother in the marital home when the parties separated.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">In April, 2008, in response to comments made by the children, the mother became concerned that father was possibly engaging in inappropriate sexual behavior with the parties\u2019 children. Later that month, she obtained a temporary restraining order, subsequently extended for one year, ordering the father to vacate the marital home. The Department of Social Services<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Department) concluded after investigation that \u201cthe allegations are unsupported as the children did not disclose any sexual abuse or inappropriate actions\u201d by the father. The Pepperell police department also filed an incident report, following an attempt to investigate the hard drive of the father\u2019s computer, that noted that sexual assault related charges may follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">The father filed for divorce in May, 2008, and in June, 2008, the parties agreed to a schedule whereby the father would have supervised visitation with the children one weeknight evening and one weekend day each week. In August, 2008, the mother agreed to allow the father unsupervised visitation with the children, pending the results of a report from the guardian ad litem (GAL) appointed to investigate the issue. The GAL report, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>submitted to the Probate and Family Court in February, 2009, concluded that there was no need for supervised visitation but acknowledged that the mother\u2019s concerns were understandable, given the appearance of \u201csuspicious or at least questionable\u201d actions by the father.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Judgment proceeded in two stages. The first judgment, dated March 12, 2009, incorporated the parties\u2019 separation agreement and provided for joint legal custody and that \u201cthe children shall reside primarily with the wife.\u201d The parenting schedule afforded the father visitation two weeknights each week, alternating weekends, alternate holidays, and two weeks of vacation time.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">The parties agreed to proceed to trial on issues of property division and support. The mother subsequently filed a complaint for authorization to remove the children from the Commonwealth to Maine, which was consolidated with the remaining matters. Following trial, the judge found that the mother proved by a preponderance of the evidence that she had a good faith reason for the requested move to Maine and that such a move would be in the children\u2019s best interests. The second judgment, dated August 24, 2009, allowed the mother to remove the children to Maine and ordered the father to make a weekly family support payment of $900, of which $500 was designated as alimony and $400 as child support in order to provide the father some tax relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Removal standard. </em>The father challenges the removal order on several grounds. First, he asserts, it was error to apply the \u201creal advantage\u201d test, articulated in <em>Yannas </em>v. <em>Frondistou-Yannas, </em>395 Mass. 704, 710-712 (1985), because the mother was not the sole physical custodian of the couple\u2019s children. He further claims that, even assuming the real advantage test was the correct standard, the judge improperly concluded that the mother demonstrated a good faith reason for the move and that she was not motivated by a desire to deprive the father of his relationship with the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">We turn first to the father\u2019s claim that the real advantage test is inapposite in a situation where neither party is specifically designated as having \u201csole physical custody\u201d of the children. The removal of children of divorced parents from the Commonwealth is governed by G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 30, which requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>the consent of both parents \u201cunless the court upon cause shown otherwise orders.\u201d G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 30. That phrase has been interpreted to mean that removal must be in the child\u2019s best interests. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>458 Mass. 540, 546 (2010), citing <em>Yannas, supra </em>at 711. The statute is intended to \u201cpreserve the rights of the noncustodial parent and the child to maintain and develop their familiar relationships, while balancing those rights with the right of the custodial parent to seek a better life for himself or herself.\u201d <em>Wakefield </em>v. <em>Hegarty, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 772, 775 (2006), citing <em>Yannas, supra </em>at 712.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">Removal petitions are evaluated under one of two analyses. When a parent with sole physical custody of the child seeks to relocate the child outside the Commonwealth over the objection of the noncustodial parent, the real advantage test articulated in <em>Yannas, supra </em>at 710-712, applies. That test is distinguished by its sensitivity to the reality that, due to the responsibilities of sole physical custody and caretaking, \u201cthe best interests of a child are so interwoven with the well-being of the custodial parent, [that] the determination of the child\u2019s best interest requires that the interests of the custodial parent be taken into account.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 710, quoting from <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Cooper, 99 </em>N.J. 42, 54 (1984). See <em>Altomare </em>v. <em>Altomare, </em>77 Mass. App. Ct. 601, 603-604 (2010). The judge must first consider whether the custodial parent is able to demonstrate \u201ca good, sincere reason for wanting to remove to another jurisdiction\u201d and \u201cthe presence or absence of a motive to deprive the noncustodial parent of reasonable visitation.\u201d <em>Yannas, supra </em>at 711. If the custodial parent sustains that burden, the second prong of consideration is whether the move is in the best interests of the child. The judge must consider \u201cwhether the quality of the child\u2019s life may be improved by the change (including any improvement flowing from an improvement in the quality of the custodial parent\u2019s life), the possible adverse effect of the elimination or curtailment of the child\u2019s association with the noncustodial parent, and the extent to which moving or not moving will affect the emotional, physical, or developmental needs of the child.\u201d <em>Allomare, supra, </em>quoting from <em>Pizzino </em>v. <em>Miller, 67 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 865, 870-871 (2006). \u201cNo single factor is determinative.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>McDonald, supra </em>at 547, citing <em>Yannas, supra </em>at 711-712.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>If the parent seeking removal from the Commonwealth, however, shares physical custody with the other parent, \u201c[t]he advantage to the moving parent becomes merely a relevant factor in the over-all inquiry of what is in the child\u2019s best interests.\u201d <em>Wakefield </em>v. <em>Hegarty, supra </em>at 776, citing <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>447 Mass. 177, 185-186 (2006). Where custody is shared between parents, the analysis does not privilege the interests of one parent because \u201cthe fortune of simply one custodial parent [is not] so tightly interwoven with that of the child; both parents have equal rights and responsibilities with respect to the child[].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 184-185.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">While we acknowledge that \u201c[h]ow a custody arrangement is categorically defined will trigger which of the two models is implicated,\u201d <em>Altomare, supra </em>at 605, the differences between the two approaches reflect consequences of functional divisions in caregiving and parental responsibilities. See <em>ibid, </em>(\u201cit is appropriate that the decisional calculus consider the functional responsibilities and involvement of each parent\u201d). The primary consideration in both tests remains whether the proposed move is in the best interests of the child. See <em>Prenaveau </em>v. <em>Prenaveau, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 131, 139 (2009). Although the presence of a categorical custodial determination will trigger one of the two approaches, nothing in our case law requires that either analysis be employed solely where the parents have adopted a particular custodial label. Where, as here, the parties have eschewed traditional custodial terminology, the judge must make \u201ca factual inquiry\u201d to determine the approximate custodial arrangement and then apply the corresponding test. <em>Altomare, supra </em>at 606. See <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>Virusso, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 326, 327-330 (2007) (applying <em>Yannas </em>where the party seeking to move was the child\u2019s \u201cprimary care parent\u201d); <em>Prenaveau, supra </em>at 140 (approving the use of <em>Mason </em>analysis where \u201cthe co-parenting arrangement. . . does not fit neatly into the traditional taxonomy, [but] it can perhaps best be understood as an attempt at approximating joint custody\u201d). Cf. American Law Institute, Principles of the Law of Family Dissolution: Analysis and Recommendations \u00a7 2.17(4)(a), at 400 (2002) (\u201cThe court should allow a parent who has been exercising the clear majority of custodial responsibility to relocate with the child if that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>parent shows that the relocation is for a valid purpose, in good faith, and to a location that is reasonable in light of the purpose\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">In the instant case, the judge found that the mother \u201chas been and continues to be the primary caregiver for the [parties\u2019] children.\u201d The parenting schedule incorporated into the first judgment, in effect at the time of trial on the mother\u2019s complaint for removal and which the father does not challenge, provided that the children would live with the mother, subject to scheduled visitation with the father; the children spent nights with the father only on alternating weekends and during two nonconsecutive weeks of summer vacation. The judge found that despite the parental rights available to him, the father essentially chose to defer major parenting tasks and decisions to the mother during the marriage and following the separation. No significance attaches to the absence of custodial language in the separation agreement where the functional arrangements agreed on by the parties confer on the mother primary responsibility for the children.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In sum, the judge\u2019s finding that the mother was the primary caregiver was amply supported by the evidence, and the judge did not abuse her discretion by applying the <em>Yannas </em>real advantage test. See <em>Wakefield </em>v. <em>Hegarty, 67 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 776-777.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Having determined that the judge applied the correct test, we address the father\u2019s argument that the judge improperly concluded that the mother had a good faith reason for the requested move and was not motivated by a desire to deprive the father of his relationship with the children. The first prong of the real advantage test focuses \u201con the reasoning of the custodial parent.\u201d <em>Dickenson </em>v. Cogswell, 66 Mass. App. Ct. 442, 448 (2006). The judge acknowledged that the GAL concluded that the mother\u2019s job prospects in Maine \u201cwere speculative at best,\u201d but found that she would benefit from the opportunity for accelerated job training opportunities and the potential for higher future earnings. The judge also found that, in addition to employment prospects, the mother\u2019s request was motivated by a desire to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>close to family members in Maine. The judge concluded that the mother\u2019s quality of life would be improved by having the support of nearby relatives who could assist her with childcare. The mother therefore has demonstrated by sufficient evidence that the move is of \u201creal advantage\u201d to her. <em>Cartledge </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 577, 580 (2006). See <em>Aktomare, </em>77 Mass. App. Ct. at 607-608 (\u201cRelocating in order to avoid painful emotional encounters and to develop emotional support is a sincere reason\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">The judge further found, supported by evidence in the record, that the mother was not motivated by an intent to deprive the father of his relationship with their two daughters. Although the restraining order prohibited the father from contacting his children for a period of time, the judge concluded that the mother acted out of a good faith concern for the safety of the children. The mother has also been reliable and supportive of the father\u2019s visitation with the children. She voluntarily agreed to end supervised visitation following the investigation by the Department, and offered the father increased visitation time with the children on weekends and during vacations should the children be allowed to move to Maine. There was no error in the judge\u2019s finding that the mother had established a good faith, sincere reason for desiring the move.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">In addition, there was no error in the judge\u2019s consideration of the best interests of the children and her conclusion that removal would have a positive impact on their emotional, physical, and developmental needs. \u201cAt this second stage \u2018[ejvery person, parent and child, has an interest to be considered. The judicial safeguard of those interests lies in careful and clear fact-finding ....\u2019\u201d <em>Wakefield </em>v. <em>Hegarty, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. at 776, citing <em>Yannas, </em>395 Mass. at 712. \u201cAssuming the judge\u2019s findings are not clearly erroneous, we review [the judge\u2019s] determination of the best interests of the children only for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>447 Mass. at 184, citing <em>White </em>v. <em>Laingor, </em>434 Mass. 64, 68 (2001). The judge based her conclusion in part on her findings that the move would result in an improvement in the mother\u2019s quality of life that in turn would benefit the children, and that the proximity to the mother\u2019s family members, who could assist in caretaking, would also benefit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>the children. See <em>Wakefield </em>v. <em>Hegarty, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. at 777-778. The judge also considered the impact of removal on the children\u2019s relationship with the father and the deleterious effects of increased travel, and adjusted the visitation schedule to increase the children\u2019s time spent with the father during the weekends, summer, and other school vacations, as well as to limit the travel time between the parties\u2019 homes. See <em>Cartledge </em>v. <em>Evans, supra </em>at 581 (\u201cdisruption in visitation with the noncustodial parent cannot be controlling or no removal petition would ever be allowed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">2. <em>Alimony award. </em>Applying the child support guidelines, the judge concluded in her findings that a weekly child support payment of $647 was \u201csuggested,\u201d but ordered the father to make weekly payments totaling $900, of which $400 was designated child support and $500 alimony. The judge noted in her findings that this division was intended to be of financial benefit to the father: \u201cIn order to provide the father some tax relief especially during this time when the mother has little or no taxable income, the Court has allocated the majority of this payment as alimony and given the father the right to claim both children as dependents.\u201d See Child Support Guidelines \u00a7 II.A (effective January 1, 2009). The total amount, the judge found, constituted approximately thirty-six percent of the father\u2019s total income. Father challenges the award<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on the grounds that it forces him to spend more than his income and that the judge did not properly account for the mother\u2019s ability to earn income as a massage therapist.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">The award of alimony is governed by G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, inserted by St. 1974, c. 565, which requires consideration of certain mandatory factors: \u201cthe length of the marriage, the conduct of the parties during the marriage, the age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate, liabilities and needs of each of the parties and the opportunity of each for future acquisition of capital assets and income.\u201d See <em>Cherrington </em>v. <em>Cherrington, </em>404 Mass. 267, 271 (1989). The judge may also consider \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>contribution of each of the parties in the acquisition, preservation or appreciation in value of their respective estates and the contribution of each of the parties as a homemaker to the family unit.\u201d G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, as amended by St. 1977, c. 467. Within these statutory constraints, a judge has broad discretion when making an award. <em>Drapek </em>v. <em>Drapek, </em>399 Mass. 240, 243 (1987). We will only overturn an award on appeal if it is \u201cplainly wrong and excessive.\u201d <em>Heins </em>v. <em>Ledis, </em>422 Mass. 477, 481 (1996), quoting from <em>Pare </em>v. <em>Pare, </em>409 Mass. 292, 296 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">The judge made numerous findings, supported by the record, regarding the statutory considerations. The parties were married for about sixteen years (a medium- to long-term marriage) and enjoyed a middle-class station in life while married. Although both parties contributed to the marital enterprise, the mother was the primary caregiver to the children while the father was the primary wage-earner, working, as he still does, as a software engineer. The mother requires assistance in meeting her weekly expenses for herself and the parties\u2019 children, and the father does not need such assistance and has the ability to contribute to the expenses of the mother and the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Regarding the mother\u2019s earning capacity, the judge found that the mother, who worked as a massage therapist in the early years of the parties\u2019 marriage, had not worked in such a capacity in many years and had not contacted the licensing board of Massachusetts to determine whether she could become licensed in this state through a \u201cgrandfathering\u201d of her previous licenses in Florida and Texas. At the time of trial, she was earning approximately $50 to $70 per week from part-time employment as a medical transcriptionist in training. The judge concluded that the mother\u2019s plans to continue with training could in time lead to higher income, thereby reducing her need for alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">\u201c[T]he statutory authority of a court to award alimony continues to be grounded in the recipient spouse\u2019s need for support and the supporting spouse\u2019s ability to pay.\u201d <em>Gottsegen </em>v. <em>Gott-segen, </em>397 Mass. 617, 624 (1986). In light of the significant period of time since the mother last practiced as a massage therapist, during which she was the primary caretaker for the parties\u2019 children,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the fact she is licensed in neither Mas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>sachusetts nor Maine, the judge was not obligated to attribute to the mother earnings she could potentially have as a massage therapist. See <em>Pierce </em>v. Pierce, 455 Mass. 286, 297 (2009) (\u201cA judge ... is not obligated to use a party\u2019s potential earning capacity as the measure of the party\u2019s ability to pay\u201d). See also Kindregan &amp; Inker, Family Law &amp; Practice \u00a7 38.3, at 624 (3d ed. 2002) (\u201cWhen a spouse\u2019s employment prospects are limited, and the other has an income-producing occupation, other factors being also considered, the court may be more inclined to grant alimony\u201d). The judge\u2019s consideration of mother\u2019s present earning capacity and financial need was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">We also find no merit in the father\u2019s claim that the judge \u201cexceeded [her] authority by basing the Father\u2019s present alimony award on an uncertain future event: the sale of the marital home.\u201d Father argues that, pending an unknown future sale of the marital home, the judgment required him to live on deficit spending. See <em>Schuler </em>v. <em>Schuler, </em>382 Mass. 366, 375 (1981) (\u201cwe do not hold that a support provider would have to deplete his total liquid or other assets in an effort to meet his support obligations\u201d). Thus, the father asserts that the alimony order within the second judgment must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">The total support award did not exceed father\u2019s income at the time of trial, as demonstrated by the income and expenses claimed on his financial statement. The judge found that \u201c[subtracting his weekly living expenses . . . , the father has a weekly disposable income of $1461.12.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Father argues that his expenses have since increased because he moved into the marital home, vacated when the mother and children moved to Maine, and he is now solely responsible for the carrying costs of the home, pending sale, causing him to incur a net weekly deficit of approximately $226.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">The judge found that the father\u2019s weekly credit card payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>of $534.40 would presumably be discharged upon the sale of the marital home. We note that, independent of the sale of the home, the father\u2019s credit card debt, repaid at this weekly rate, would have been discharged approximately six and one-half months after trial (in February, 2010). Moreover, the record is devoid of any order requiring the father to repay the credit card debt at the weekly sum of $534.40. Rather, it appears from the record that the father chose the payment amount in order to repay the credit card debt in a short period of time. Therefore, any temporary deficit spending would have been created by the father, and could be eliminated by simply reducing the amount of such payments. Were those payments reduced in an amount that would eliminate weekly deficit spending, on the record before us, the credit card debt would have been paid approximately eleven months from the date the judgment was entered.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">In sum, the award of alimony was properly grounded in appropriate considerations of the statutory factors, and we discern no error with the alimony award.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">So much of the bifurcated judgment of divorce dated August 24, 2009, as allows the mother\u2019s petition to remove the children to Maine and orders the father to pay weekly alimony in the amount of five hundred dollars is affirmed.
