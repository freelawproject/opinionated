The Commonwealth Employment Relations Board (board) ruled that the CJAM\u2019s unilateral decision to hire nonunion per diem court officers for service in the Superior Court in Suffolk County, without negotiation with the relevant court officers\u2019 union of the consequences of that action, constituted a prohibited labor practice. The board ordered that the CJAM engage in remedial bargaining and \u201c[m]ake whole affected employees for any [resulting] loss of wages and benefits.\u201d For the following reasons, we reverse the decision and order of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">The material facts are undisputed. The CJAM and the Suffolk County Superior Court Officers Association (SCSCOA) submitted agreed exhibits and stipulated information to the board.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Neither side has challenged any element of the board\u2019s resulting findings. We summarize the material facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\"><em>Background. </em>1. <em>Court officers\u2019 duties. </em>The essential duties of court officers in all departments of the Trial Court include, but are not limited to, the provision of security for the public, jurors, parties, witnesses, attorneys, judges, court personnel, and prisoners, in the courtroom and in other designated areas of the courthouse; maintenance of order and response to disruptive events in the courtroom; custody, care, escort, and documentation of prisoners within the courthouse; confinement or release of defendants at the direction of the court; location and direction of trial participants; and the communication of information of court procedures to the public, litigants, witnesses, attorneys, jurors, and citizens summoned for jury service. In accordance with G. L. c. 211B, \u00a7 9A, all court officers of the departments of the Trial Court are employees of the CJAM.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The public employee labor relations statute, G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 3, as amended by St. 1978, c. 478, \u00a7 76, at all relevant times <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>authorized three bargaining units for court officers: one for court officers in the Superior Court in Suffolk County (\u201cSuffolk Superior Court\u201d or \u201cSuffolk\u201d); one for the officers in the Superior Court in Middlesex County (\u201cMiddlesex Superior Court\u201d or \u201cMiddlesex\u201d); and one for all remaining court officers of the Trial Court throughout the Commonwealth (the general unit). In 1978, the Labor Relations Commission<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> certified SCSCOA as the exclusive collective bargaining unit for the Suffolk officers and the two respective separate units for the Middlesex officers and the remaining Statewide officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The CJAM\u2019s director of security has overseen the assignment of officers throughout the Trial Court. The assignment process has traditionally accommodated the felt needs of the system. If a particular court lacked an officer or more by reason of illness, disability, or vacation, the director has reassigned officers from other courts or departments to fill the absence even if the absent officer was a member of a separate bargaining unit. In addition, the CJAM assigned certain officers to work for extended periods in courts in which members of their respective bargaining units did not regularly work. As of the end of December, 2001, ten members of SCSCOA and eight members of the Middlesex Superior Court officers\u2019 bargaining unit had worked for years in courts served by members of the general bargaining unit; and for a number of years four members of the general unit had worked in the Middlesex Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">2. <em>Retirement incentive legislation. </em>As we shall discuss below, in 1992, the Supreme Judicial Court had authorized the CJAM to hire and deploy officers to combat a security crisis in the Trial Court. In response to a fiscal crisis, the Legislature on December 29, 2001, enacted an early retirement incentive program for CJAM employees. St. 2001, c. 218. To qualify for an expanded retirement allowance, employees had to submit applications between January 2 and January 23, 2002, for retirement effective no later than February 1, 2002. St. 2001, c. 218, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3. Nine SCSCOA officers submitted applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">The sudden loss of officers in Suffolk Superior Court created <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>a dangerous shortfall. On January 31, 2002, counsel for SC-SCOA efficiently summarized it in the following passages of a letter to the CJAM\u2019s director of security:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-6\">\u201cAs you are aware, this office represents the Suffolk County Superior Court Officers Association. As you also know, over the past several years the number of court officers in the Suffolk Superior Court has been reduced significantly. Even so, as of 1999 there were 55 court officers in the Suffolk Superior Court. Since that time, through attrition, the number has been reduced to 47.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-8\">\u201cNow, as a result of the early retirement incentive there will be a reduction of an additional 9 employees effective Monday, February 4, 2002. This will leave only 38 court officers to cover all the judicial sessions of the Suffolk Superior Court. This is extremely inadequate and will create an unsafe environment. With this small number of court officers the existing court officers will not be able to provide the level of security that is expected and needed by the public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-9\">\u201cThe Union is of course extremely concerned about the depletion in its numbers and the potential of creating a truly unsafe environment at the courthouse. In the wake of the need for additional security after the events of September 11, 2001, it will be impossible to provide the needed level of security with only 38 court officers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-10\">\u201cThe Union therefore demands that the 6 [ric] Suffolk County Superior Court officers who are currently assigned to courts outside the Suffolk County Superior Court be immediately returned to work at the Suffolk Superior Court. In addition, other action must be taken to quickly replace the court officers who are leaving. This is a crisis and it must be addressed without delay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-12\">\u201cWe appreciate your immediate attention to this matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-13\">The CJAM and the union worked out several measures to address the staffing shortage. In April of 2002, the president of SCSCOA and the CJAM\u2019s directors of security and of human resources agreed that the seven SCSCOA members still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>temporarily assigned to other court locations would return to their permanent positions at Suffolk Superior Court. Those officers did return to Suffolk, but over the ensuing four or five months four of them informed the SCSCOA president of their desire to return to their alternate court locations. During the fall of 2002 or early winter of 2003, the union proposed to the CJAM an arrangement in which those four would return to the prior locations and four members of the general bargaining unit would replace them in Suffolk. In March of 2003, that accommodation went into effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Budgetary constraints frustrated the CJAM\u2019s intention to hire additional officers in January of 2003. Instead, as authorized by G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 91(h), he planned to employ a limited number of retired court officers on a per diem basis to relieve the shortage of officers throughout the Trial Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> SCSCOA objected to that plan upon the ground that its collective bargaining agreement (covering the period of July 1, 2000, through June 30, 2003) contained no reference to the use of retirees. The union proposed that regular SCSCOA officers perform extra duties until the budget enabled additional full-time hires; or that the CJAM transfer officers from the general bargaining unit to Suffolk and replace those transferees with per diem retirees.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The resulting discussion proved inconclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">In or about March, 2003, the CJAM employed retirees to work in trial courts covered by the general bargaining unit and, for the first time, in Suffolk Superior Court. As of mid-April, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>three retirees were engaged in the Suffolk sessions at the rate of one to three days per week. They were performing the same functions as full-time SCSCOA members.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">3. <em>Board proceedings. </em>In June, 2003, SCSCOA filed charges with the board\u2019s predecessor Labor Relations Commission (see note 2, <em>supra). </em>The union alleged specifically that the CJAM had committed a prohibited practice in violation of G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 10(a)(1) and (5),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> by the decisions, made without impact bargaining, (1) to hire nonbargaining unit personnel to work as court officers, and (2) to transfer bargaining unit work to those personnel (the retirees).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">By a decision in January of 2009, the board reasoned that the existent collective bargaining agreement between the CJAM and SCSCOA contained no reference to the use of per diem workers; that their employment \u201chad an impact on SCSCOA bargaining unit members\u2019 terms and conditions of employment, by, among other things, causing them to lose the opportunity to work extra hours to complete the tasks performed by the per diem court officers\u201d; that the use of the retirees constituted the prohibited transfer of bargaining unit work to nonunit personnel so that, even if that measure did not inflict any reduction in SC-SCOA positions, it nonetheless \u201cconstitute[d] a detriment to the bargaining unit because it [could] result in an eventual elimination of the bargaining unit through gradual erosion of bargaining unit duties.\u201d The board regarded the CJAM\u2019s \u201cunilateral action\u201d as a prohibited \u201c[r]efus[al] to bargain collectively in good faith with the exclusive representative\u201d of the affected employees, within the meaning of G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 10(a)(5), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>and thereby as an interference with or restraint upon \u201cany employee in the exercise of any [statutory] right\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 10(a)(1). By remedial orders, it directed the CJAM to bargain over the impacts of the employment of the retirees upon the terms and conditions of the regular officers and to compensate any affected regular officers for loss of wages and benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">In accordance with G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 11(0, the CJAM has timely sought judicial review of the board\u2019s decision and order by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\"><em>Analysis. </em>1. <em>Standard of review. </em>Section 11(0, as appearing in St. 2007, c. 145, \u00a7 7, directs us \u201cinsofar as applicable\u201d to conduct review under the standards of the Administrative Procedure Act, G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. Consequently we examine the entire administrative record with appropriate deference to the board\u2019s \u201cspecialized knowledge and expertise, and to its interpretation of the applicable statutory provisions.\u201d <em>Worcester </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>438 Mass. 177, 180 (2002). As always, however, deference does not permit abdication of judicial supervision. See, e.g., <em>Nuclear Metals, Inc. </em>v. <em>Low-Level Radioactive Waste Mgmt. Bd., </em>421 Mass. 196, 211 (1995). And interpretation of a statutory scheme remains ultimately a matter of law for the court. See <em>Onex Communications Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>457 Mass. 419, 424 (2010). In this instance we must determine whether the board\u2019s decision constitutes (1) an error of law within the meaning of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(c), because it violates public policy, see, e.g., <em>Secretary ofAdmn. &amp; Fin. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>434 Mass. 340, 342-343, 345 (2001); (2) action arbitrary, capricious, or abusive of discretion within the meaning of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(g); or (3) a determination unsupported by substantial evidence within the meaning of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">2. <em>The public policy limitation upon collective bargaining. </em>The right of Massachusetts public employees to collective bargaining of the wages, hours, standards of productivity and performance, and other terms and conditions of their employment constitutes a \u201cstrong public policy\u201d for the achievement of fair working arrangements and the orderly provision of societal services. <em>School Comm. of Pittsfield </em>v. <em>United Educators of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number><em>Pittsfield, </em>438 Mass. 753, 761-762 (2003). See G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7\u00a7 2 (right to organize), 5 (powers and duties of the bargaining unit), and 6 (right to negotiate).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">At the same time, the public interest can impose a necessary limitation upon the collective bargaining process. The governmental employer is not free to bargain away certain elements of its nondelegable authority and responsibility to act for the public health, safety, and welfare. \u201cWhile this principle may be raised in varied contexts \u2014 in unfair labor practice proceedings . . . in actions to stay arbitration ... or ... in actions to vacate or confirm arbitral awards \u2014 the analysis to be utilized is essentially the same in all instances: whether the ingredient of public policy in the issue subject to dispute is so comparatively heavy that collective bargaining, and even voluntary arbitration, on the subject is, <em>as a matter of law, </em>to be denied effect\u201d (emphasis supplied) (footnotes omitted). <em>School Comm. of Boston </em>v. <em>Boston Teachers Union, Local 66, </em>378 Mass. 65, 70-71 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">One purpose of the principle is the retention of public policy making in the hands of governmental employers accountable directly or indirectly through \u201cthe normal political process,\u201d and the prevention of the devolution of policy making to the narrower perspective and accountability of interest group bargaining. <em>Id. </em>at 71 &amp; n.13.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">The characterization of a subject as a collectively bargainable term and condition of employment, on the one hand, or as a non-negotiable subject of exclusive managerial prerogative, on the other, can be difficult because many decisions of the public employer include both a managerial function and an effect upon the terms and conditions of the employees\u2019 work. The character <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>of a disputed subject or \u201cingredient\u201d can depend upon the inherent or traditional nature of the function (e.g., hiring and supervision are managerial, wages and hours are bargainable), its possible constitutional nature, or the legislative terms of its delegation. These criteria can define the \u201cdominant\u201d character of a disputed subject as bargainable or nondelegable. See <em>Chief Justice for Admn. &amp; Mgmt. of the Trial Ct. </em>v. <em>Office &amp; Professional Employees Intl. Union, Local 6, </em>441 Mass. 620, 628-629 (2004) (inferring from a blend of statutory provisions the CJAM\u2019s exclusive managerial prerogative over assignment and temporary transfer of court reporters and its compatibility with certain collective bargaining terms); <em>Somerville </em>v. <em>Somerville Mun. Employees Assn., </em>451 Mass. 493, 497-500 (2008) (clear and specific statutory conferral of appointment authority upon mayors excluded it from collective bargaining). See generally <em>Board of Educ. of the Woodstown-Pilesgrove Regional Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>Woodstown-Pilesgrove Regional Educ. Assn., </em>81 N.J. 582, 588-591 (1980) (comprehensive discussion).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">3. <em>Authority of CJAM. </em>Multiple sources of law invest the CJAM with broad authority over the employment of Trial Court personnel. General Laws c. 21 IB, \u00a7 9A, provides, \u201cAll court officers appointed at any time ... to any department of the trial court shall be employees of the chief justice for administration and management who shall have the authority to appoint, dismiss, define the duties of, assign, transfer and discipline said court officers within the trial court departments as he deems necessary for the administration of justice and for <em>public </em>safety\u201d (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">In September of 1992, the Justices of the Supreme Judicial Court enlarged upon that authority. In response to a growing concern about security in the buildings of the Trial Court, the Justices issued an \u201cOrder Relative to the Safety and Security of the Facilities of the Trial Court.\u201d Its relevant language included the following paragraphs.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>\u201cWHEREAS, the Justices of the Supreme Judicial Court have determined that the security crisis described by the Chief Administrative Justice [now the CJAM] endangers the safety and security of Trial Court judges and employees and members of the public who use Trial Court facilities, and substantially interferes with the judicial branch\u2019s ability to fulfill its constitutional duty to administer the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and of the United States of America:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-5\">\u201cThe Justices of the Supreme Judicial Court, pursuant to their constitutional, statutory, and inherent powers of general superintendence of all the courts of the Commonwealth, including the specific provisions of G. L. c. 21 IB, \u00a7 9, HEREBY DECLARE a state-wide security emergency in the courts of the Commonwealth and HEREBY ORDER that [the] Chief Administrative Justice . . . immediately assume exclusive authority for the hiring, deployment, and management of all court officers in the Trial Court. This order shall remain in effect until further notice. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The order has remained in force to the present.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Additionally, article XVI of the 2000-2003 collective bargaining agreement between the CJAM and SCSCOA identified certain \u201c [management [r]ights . . . vested exclusively in the Employer.\u201d These included \u201cthe contracting out, or the discontinuation of services, positions or programs in whole or in part; . . . assignment, direction and transfer of personnel; . . . [and] whatever actions may be deemed necessary to carry out [the CJAM\u2019s] responsibilities in situations of emergency.\u201d Article XXI of the agreement reiterated the CJAM\u2019s right to \u201ccontract[] out\u201d for services deemed necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">4. <em>The character of the CJAM\u2019s decisions. </em>The board concluded that the assignment of the three retirees to the Suffolk Superior Court sessions comprised a mandatory bargainable term or condition of employment requiring negotiation about its impact before the assignment. For several reasons that position is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">Preliminarily we observe that this case does not present the collision of a collective bargaining term favorable to the union <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>with a statutory authorization favorable to the employer. The 2000-2003 agreement between the CJAM and SCSCOA makes no reference to the use of per diem retirees.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Rather, the board reasoned that the general duty of bargaining prescribed by G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 5, and 6, overrode the specific delegations of G. L. c. 21 IB, \u00a7 9A, the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s ongoing 1992 order, and articles XVI and XXI of the 2000-2003 collective bargaining agreement.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The strength, specificity, and sources of those authorizations defeat that rationalization. The Justices of the Supreme Judicial Court acted \u201cpursuant to their constitutional, statutory, and inherent powers of general superintendence of all courts of the Commonwealth.\u201d By G. L. c. 211B, \u00a7 9A, the Legislature confirmed the power to assign and transfer court officers as the CJAM \u201cdeems necessary for the administration of justice <em>and for public safety </em>\u201d (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In apparent recognition of such authority and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>responsibility, the 2000-2003 agreement acknowledged the CJAM\u2019s discretion to assign and transfer personnel, and even to \u201ccontract[] out\u201d necessary services. The first two delegations came with particularity from the constitutional bodies answerable directly or indirectly through proper political process for the public interest. See <em>School Comm, of Boston </em>v. <em>Boston Teachers Union, Local 66, </em>378 Mass, at 71. The third one came from the collective bargaining negotiators themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Finally, the comparative weight or dominant character of the public interest at stake is compelling. That interest is the security and safety of the trial courtroom. Obviously, the courtroom serves as the venue and symbol of the administration of justice. The fulfillment of the most fundamental constitutional powers, duties, rights, and policies relies upon its security. A brief and obvious catalogue must include the general entitlement of the citizenry to legal rights and recourse, art. 11 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights; the right to jury trial in civil cases, art. 15; the right to a fair and impartial judiciary, art. 29; the aggregate criminal procedural rights to present evidence, to confront adverse witnesses, to receive effective assistance of counsel, to be judged by an impartial jury of peers, to receive a trial speedy and public, to remain silent, and to be free of excessive bail, fines, and cruel and unusual punishment, arts. 12 and 26, and the Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments to the United States Constitution applied through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; and the right of the public and the press to be present at the civil and criminal proceedings in the courtroom implied from the First and Fourteenth Amendments. See <em>Richmond Newspapers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>448 U.S. 555, 575-580 (1980); <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Ct., </em>457 U.S. 596, 604-606 (1982). To these we might add the sense of security trusted by the citizens coming forward as witnesses and jurors. Finally, the essential courtroom functionaries, including the session clerks, reporters, and court officers themselves, must have a safe workplace. The gravity of these interests renders the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>subject of courtroom security a nonbargainable power and duty of the government.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The board\u2019s contrary order violates public policy and constitutes an error of law within the meaning of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">5. <em>Impact bargaining. </em>The board contends that, even if the substance of the decision to employ the retirees were not bargainable, the CJAM bore a statutory duty of preliminary negotiation about the consequences or impacts of their assignment upon SCSCOA members and the SCSCOA unit. In <em>Chief Justice for Admn. &amp; Mgmt. of the Trial Ct. </em>v. <em>Office &amp; Professional Employees Intl. Union, Local 6, </em>441 Mass. at 629, the court noted that the CJAM could, by collective bargaining, bind himself to a preliminary or ancillary process \u201cprecedent to the making of [a nondelegable] decision\u201d to transfer court reporters. <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>School Comm. of Danvers </em>v. <em>Tyman, </em>372 Mass. 106, 113 (1977). The freedom to assume such ancillary requirements for assignment decisions over nonjudical personnel for general administrative purposes under G. L. c. 21 IB, \u00a7 9(xxii), does not logically or practically extend to assignment decisions delegated by the Supreme Judicial Court and the Legislature specifically for maintenance of public safety in the courtroom. The more urgent nature of the second purpose need not await the delay or complications of prior negotiations. The CJAM is entitled and required to act swiftly and flexibly to assure courtroom safety.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Nor do the circumstances of this case support a claim for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>subsequent or postdecision bargaining. The board\u2019s findings of impacts receive no support from the record. It conceded \u201cthat no bargaining unit members lost work as a result\u201d of the use of retirees, but nonetheless concluded that SCSCOA members \u201clost the opportunity to perform the bargaining unit work performed by the per diems\u201d and that the transfer of bargaining unit work to nonunit personnel could set in motion \u201can eventual elimination of the bargaining unit through gradual erosion of bargaining unit duties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">No evidence, let alone substantial evidence, supports those determinations. The record indicates that employment and assignment of retirees on the prescribed part-time scale resulted from a shortage of necessary full-time officers and not from the transfer of any work from available regulars to invading per diems. If the retirees had not performed their work, it would have gone undone. The board cannot simultaneously find that \u201cno bargaining unit members lost work\u201d performed by the per diems and order that the CJAM \u201c[m]ake whole affected employees for any loss of wages and benefits suffered as a result of the CJAM\u2019s unlawful actions.\u201d Nor does any evidence support its notion that the use of the three retirees began a process of \u201cerosion\u201d and \u201ceventual elimination\u201d of the regular court officers\u2019 union by loss of work and membership displacement.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">In short, the board cannot conjure up hypothetical detriments as a justification for purposeless impact bargaining. Its determination upon this subject lacks the support of substantial evidence within the meaning of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(e), and constitutes arbitrary and capricious action within the meaning of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number><em>Conclusion. </em>The determination of proper security for the Commonwealth\u2019s trial courtrooms is not a collectively bargain-able subject. The Supreme Judicial Court and the Legislature have committed it to the nondelegable authority of the CJAM. The CJAM does not bear a duty to engage in collective impact bargaining before the employment and assignment of court officers for security purposes. We express no view whether courthouse security decisions are categorically exempt from all subsequent impact bargaining. The circumstances of this case revealed no impacts warranting such bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">\n<em>Decision and order of the Commonwealth Employment Relations Board reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b411-7\"> Since the beginning of litigation in June of 2003, the National Association of Governmental Employees (NAGE) has succeeded SCSCOA as the bargaining representative of the employees.

L. c. 150E, \u00a7 10(a)(1) and (5).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b420-15\"> The 1992 enactment of \u00a7 9A articulated the purposes of \u201cthe administration of justice\u201d and \u201cpublic safety\u201d as underlying the authority of assignment and transfer of court officers. The earlier provision of G. L. c. 21 IB, \u00a7 9, as appearing in St. 1978, c. 478, \u00a7 110, without specifying a purpose, enabled the CJAM to transfer nonjudicial employees within limitations of reasonable distance. See note 7, <em>supra. </em>In <em>Chief Justice for Admn. &amp; Mgmt. of the Trial Ct. </em>v. <em>Office &amp; Professional Employees Intl. Union, Local 6, </em>441 Mass. at 630 n.17, the court referred to the authority of \u00a7 9(xxii), then existing since 1992 and specifying the purpose of the proper administration of justice, as the \u201ccritically important management prerogative of deciding which courts are understaffed and which have available resources that could be used to staff them,\u201d and observed that the CJAM had not relinquished that power in the pertinent collective bargaining agreement. The broader language of \u00a7 9A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>encompassing the purposes of <em>both </em>\u201cthe administration of justice\u201d and \u201cpublic safety\u201d without limitations of procedure or duration necessarily conveys authority even deeper than a \u201ccritically important management prerogative,\u201d authority of an inalienable, nonbargainable character.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b422-7\"> In its brief in this court, the board has not recognized the distinctive character of the courtroom:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-8\">\u201cThat the workplace at issue is a courtroom rather than a factory floor is beside the point, given that the Legislature through Chapter 150E requires collective bargaining for the Commonwealth\u2019s courthouses.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b422-9\"> For example, multiple criminal sessions hosting trials of high publicity, tension, numerous witnesses, emotional spectators, and lengthy duration can challenge or tax the resources of the Trial Court, especially in times of manpower shortage. The CJAM requires the freedom to deploy court officersf to the points of need without delay and without burdensome consequences at later moments when his needs may be equally serious. The immediate availability of retirees provides assistance to less urgent sessions and frees up regular officers for the more demanding ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">Here, the board appears to assume that retirees were displacing regular offi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>cers in their main function: presence in the courtroom. No evidence supports that assumption. The record supports the inference that the regulars were working at maximum levels and that the retirees were supplemental, not substitutional.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b423-7\"> Any alleged loss of work or unit erosion in Suffolk Superior Court would result at least in part from the conduct of SCSCOA members. When the unit called upon the CJAM for help in January of 2002 (by counsel\u2019s letter), the CJAM brought the seven detached court officers back to the county in the spring. Then, when four of them preferred to return to their out-of-county locations, the SCSCOA president and the CJAM arranged as an accommodation to replace them with four members of the general bargaining unit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
