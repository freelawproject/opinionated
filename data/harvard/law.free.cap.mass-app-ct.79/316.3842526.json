The police entered the residence and saw an empty gun holster on the kitchen floor. At that point, the defendant entered the kitchen from the living room and the child said, \u201cHe pushed Mommy into the wall. He had a gun.\u201d The defendant identified himself as a police officer and stated that he was unarmed. One of the responding police officers ushered him outside. Another officer, accompanied by the mother, the girl, and her seven year old brother, then went upstairs. In the hall, the officer observed a foot-wide indentation in the wall about three feet up from the floor. In the pocket of a jacket hanging in an upstairs bedroom closet, the officer located a Smith &amp; Wesson .38 caliber handgun. The unloaded gun did not have a trigger lock and was not secured in a locked container. Also in the same pocket was hollow point .38 caliber ammunition.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The defendant was convicted after a jury trial of improper storage of a firearm, G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131L(\u00ab) (firearm storage statute or statute).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On appeal, he (a) challenges the constitutionality of the firearm storage statute; (b) contends that there was insufficient evidence that he did not \u201ccontrol\u201d the firearm for purposes of the statute; and (c) contends that admission of the child\u2019s statement without her live testimony at trial violated his right of confrontation under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>1. <em>Firearm storage statute. </em>Relying on <em>District of Columbia </em>v. <em>Heller, </em>554 U.S. 570 (2008), the defendant argues that our firearm storage statute violates the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To the extent that the defendant challenges the constitutionality of the statute on its face, his argument fails in light of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Runyan, </em>456 Mass. 230 (2010). <em>Runyan </em>concluded that our firearm storage statute meaningfully and substantially differs from the statutory provision at issue in <em>Heller </em>because it does not require an individual \u201cto secure or render inoperable a firearm while the individual carries it or while it remains otherwise under the individual\u2019s control.\u201d <em>Runyan, supra </em>at 236. As a result, our statute does not, on its face, unconstitutionally interfere with an individual\u2019s ability to rely on a gun for lawful self-defense. <em>Id. </em>at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">What remains of the defendant\u2019s Second Amendment challenge, therefore, is to determine whether any constitutional concern is raised by the statute\u2019s application to the defendant on the facts of this case. We are confident that no such concern exists. There is nothing in the record to suggest that the statute\u2019s requirements interfered to any degree with the defendant\u2019s right to lawful self-defense. See <em>Heller, supra </em>at 628. To the contrary, the evidence showed that the defendant had stored the gun in a closet upstairs while he was downstairs without immediate access to it. The statute\u2019s storage requirements placed no meaningful restraint on the defendant\u2019s ability to use the gun in lawful self-defense if for no other reason than that he himself placed it where it could not be quickly reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">2. <em>Sufficiency of evidence of \u201ccontrol\u201d. </em>The firearm storage statute applies to weapons when they are neither carried nor under the control of their owner or other authorized user. See note 2, <em>supra. </em>The defendant does not contend that he was carrying the gun within the meaning of the statute at the time of the offense.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He does, however, argue that the Commonwealth failed to prove that the gun was not under his \u201ccontrol.\u201d We must assess, therefore, the meaning of that term for purposes of the gun storage statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>\u201cControl\u201d is not defined by the statute, and we have found no case construing the term in this context. Ordinary rules of statutory construction lead to the conclusion that \u201ccontrol\u201d is not synonymous with the term \u201ccarried.\u201d Otherwise, there would have been no need for the Legislature to have used both terms in the statute. See, e.g., <em>Kobrin </em>v. <em>Gastfriend, </em>443 Mass. 327, 332 (2005), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Authy., </em>352 Mass. 617, 618 (1967) (\u201c[n]one of the words of a statute is to be regarded as superfluous\u201d). \u201cCarried\u201d is also undefined by the statute, but at a minimum it requires actual physical possession. What else might be required is a question left for another day, although we note that in the related context of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(a), \u201ccarrying\u201d requires nontemporary physical possession together with movement. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Osborne, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 657, 658-659 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">While a gun for purposes of the firearm storage statute need not necessarily be in the actual physical possession of its owner or authorized user in order to be under that individual\u2019s \u201ccontrol,\u201d it must be readily at hand. The statute is part of an over-all scheme of gun control legislation designed \u201cto prevent the temptation and the ability to use firearms to inflict harm, be it negligently or intentionally, on another or on oneself.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 518, 523 (1980). The firearm storage statute itself \u201cis illustrative of the societal concern with weapons reaching the hands of unauthorized users.\u201d <em>Jupin </em>v. <em>Kask, </em>447 Mass. 141, 154 (2006). Understanding that the purpose of the statute is to guard against the use of firearms by unauthorized, incompetent, or irresponsible persons, it becomes clear that a firearm is within the \u201ccontrol\u201d of its owner or authorized user only when that person has it sufficiently nearby to prevent immediately its unauthorized use.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Of course, the determination whether a particular firearm is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>under an individual\u2019s control will depend on the facts and circumstances of any given case. Among other things, consideration should be given to the firearm\u2019s location, its proximity to its authorized user or owner, and that person\u2019s ability to reach immediately the gun. It is clear to us that the Commonwealth satisfied its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the gun was not under the defendant\u2019s control in this case. The gun was stored in the pocket of a jacket hanging in an upstairs closet. The defendant was downstairs. The gun was out of its holster, which was lying on the kitchen floor. Children were present, including a young boy who at times was closer to the gun than was the defendant. The jury had more than sufficient evidence upon which to find that the gun was not within the defendant\u2019s control.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">3. <em>Sixth Amendment. </em>The defendant argues that the admission of the child\u2019s statement, \u201cHe pushed Mommy into the wall. He had a gun,\u201d violated his right to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The confrontation clause applies to witnesses who \u201cbear testimony\u201d against the accused, regardless of whether their statements are admissible under the rules of evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 50-51 (2004). \u201c \u2018Testimony\u2019 ... is typically \u2018[a] solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, quoting from 2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1828).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The child\u2019s statement here was made spontaneously, without police questioning, as the officers walked into a volatile and unstable scene of domestic disturbance. There is nothing to suggest that the statement was made for any purpose other than to secure aid, let alone that the five year old child had in mind that the statement would or could be used to prove some fact at a future criminal trial. The statement, accordingly, was not testimonial for purposes of the Sixth Amendment. See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 822 (2006) (\u201c[statements are non-testimonial when made in the course of police interrogation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency\u201d); <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>131 S. Ct. 1143,1156 (2011) (\u201cTo determine whether the \u2018primary purpose\u2019 of an interrogation is \u2018to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency,\u2019 which would render the resulting statements nontestimonial, we objectively evaluate the circumstances in which the encounter occurs and the statements and actions of the parties\u201d [citation omitted]); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonsalves, </em>445 Mass. 1, 9-10 (2005), cert, denied, 548 U.S. 926 (2006) (statements are not \u201ctestimonial\u201d if made in response to questioning \u201cto secure a volatile scene or to establish the need for or provide medical care\u201d [footnote omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">We note further that, even assuming arguendo that the statement was testimonial, any error in its admission was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The defendant himself admitted to owning the gun; the child\u2019s statement added nothing else that bore on the charge of violating the firearm storage statute. And, although the statement did bear on the crimes of assault and battery, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A(a), and witness intimidation, G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B, the defendant was acquitted of both charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">For the reasons set out above, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b353-7\"> No information was conveyed before the caller hung up, and the call thus generated especial alarm.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b353-8\"> General Laws, c. 140, \u00a7 131L(a), inserted by St. 1998, c. 180, \u00a7 47, states: \u201cIt shall be unlawful to store or keep any firearm, rifle or shotgun including, but not limited to, large capacity weapons, or machine gun in any place unless such weapon is secured in a locked container or equipped with a tamper-resistant mechanical lock or other safety device, properly engaged so as to render such weapon inoperable by any person other than the owner or other lawfully authorized user.
