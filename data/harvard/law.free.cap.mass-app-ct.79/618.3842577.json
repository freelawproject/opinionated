L. c. 265, \u00a7 43(a) (statute).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He appeals from that judgment, claiming the judge erred in denying his motions to suppress evidence and for a required finding of not guilty. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-16\"><em>Background. </em>We summarize the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>51 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>Mass. App. Ct. 99, 100 (2001). Robert Nazarro, the director of treatment at the Counseling and Psychotherapy Center (CPC), treated the defendant from December, 2006, to August, 2008. Over an eight-month period in 2009, the corporate offices of CPC began to receive anonymous mailings. The mailings, which ultimately numbered twenty-five, contained a variety of materials: numerous highlighted newspaper articles, including several critical of sex offender treatment programs, internal CPC memo-randa, a poster visually depicting numerous sexual positions, and a receipt for CPC services. The enclosed materials also contained handwritten notes generally critical of CPC,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as well as more particularized, threatening comments such as, \u201cWE \u2018C\u2019 \u2018U\u2019 \u20182\u2019 ALKN\u201d and \u201cLOOK OVER YOUR SHOULDERS 4 LIFE.\u201d Numerous documents were signed with the acronym \u201cALKN\u201d or \u201cAMLKN.\u201d Officer Michael Tetrault of the Needham police department testified at trial that the acronym \u201cAMLKN\u201d stood for \u201cAll Mighty Latin King Nation\u201d and referred to a primarily Hispanic gang active in Fall River.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">The executive director of CPC, Dennis McNamara, routinely opened all mail sent to the CPC corporate offices. Though initially unable to discern the origin or the targeted individual recipient of the mailings, McNamara uncovered the defendant\u2019s identity after investigating the CPC receipt received on September 26, 2009. On the evening of October 1, 2009, CPC informed Nazarro of the correspondence. Nazarro was immediately concerned and contacted the police. Upon reviewing the mailings the following morning, Nazarro was \u201c[s]hocked, scared, [and] panicked\u201d at their contents, which included several references to his home address and license plate number \u2014 neither of which had been made available to his clients. Nazarro testified that these personal details, coupled with the threatening comments in several of the mailings, left him \u201cparanoid\u201d and \u201cfearful.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">In response to Nazarro\u2019s concerns, on October 5, 2009, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>Officer Timothy Dooher of the Needham police department took the defendant into custody. During the booking process, Officer Dooher conducted an inventory search to catalogue the defendant\u2019s possessions and ensure that he did not possess contraband. Among other things, the search revealed a highlighter, three highlighted copies of a Boston Herald article, and a list of names, including that of Dennis McNamara.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\"><em>Motion for required finding of not guilty. </em>We review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth to determine whether a rational jury could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979). All that is required is that the evidence, and permissible inferences therefrom,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> be \u201cof sufficient force to bring minds of ordinary intelligence and sagacity to the persuasion of [guilt] beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 676, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>264 Mass. 368, 373 (1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">To support a finding of stalking under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43(a), the Commonwealth must prove that a person \u201c(1) wilfully and maliciously engage[d] in a knowing pattern of conduct or series of acts over a period of time directed at a specific person which seriously alarms or annoys that person and would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress and (2) also makes a threat with the intent to place that person in imminent fear of death or bodily injury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 286, 289 (1999), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kwiatkowski, </em>418 Mass. 543, 547-548 (1994).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In addition, to establish the pattern or series required by the statute, the Commonwealth must prove the defendant committed three or more separate incidents of the proscribed behavior. See <em>Jenkins, supra </em>at 290-291.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>The defendant asserts that the evidence fails to establish a \u201cpattern of conduct or series of acts\u201d that could have affected Nazarro because he was exposed to the mailings in bulk on one sole occasion. He misapprehends the import of the statutory language; the statute requires a series of acts or a pattern of conduct leading to a specified result (alarm or annoyance and substantial emotional distress) \u2014 it does not require each act in the series or pattern to produce the result separately, or to do so on each occasion. The evidence, twenty-five separate mailings over a period of approximately eight months, easily satisfies the Commonwealth\u2019s burden to prove the requisite pattern or series.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">We are similarly unpersuaded by the defendant\u2019s contention that the Commonwealth failed to present sufficient evidence of a targeted threat. We acknowledge that generalized complaints about the workings of a department or organization, however bizarre or even ominous in tone, would not satisfy the requirements of the statute. Here, however, the mailings were sufficiently focused on Nazarro, and sufficiently explicit in the threatening nature of their message, to satisfy the Commonwealth\u2019s burden. The jury could infer a threat intended to put Nazarro in imminent fear of death or bodily injury from the defendant\u2019s repeated invocation of the Latin King gang and his statement, \u201cLOOK OVER YOUR SHOULDERS 4 LIFE.\u201d The overt nature of these threats, coupled with the inclusion of several pieces of Nazarro\u2019s personal information, were more than enough to place a reasonable person in imminent fear of death or bodily harm and induce him to suffer substantial emotional distress. We view the mailings in their entirety, noting that wording, which considered alone might be relatively innocuous, can generate alarm when received and interpreted in the context of accompanying explicit and targeted messages.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>In this respect, as with assault in general, the totality of the defendant\u2019s behavior must be considered. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>407 Mass. 340, 349 (1990) (in prosecution for assault, court will look to the actions and words of the defendant, not standing alone or in a vacuum, but in light of attendant circumstances); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Matsos, </em>421 Mass. 391, 394 (1995) (threat element required for stalking conviction closely approximates common-law definition of assault).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\"><em>Motion to suppress. </em>The police officer who assisted at the defendant\u2019s booking conducted a patfrisk pursuant to the police department\u2019s written policy. The officer was entitled to remove and unfold papers found on the defendant; he was not required to ignore materials that obviously related to the charges underlying the arrest. While the police may not \u201chunt for information by sifting and reading materials taken from an arrestee,\u201d they \u201care not required to blind themselves to information appearing on a paper or card that declares its nature to anyone at sight.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sullo, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 766, 770 (1989). \u201c[I]t is not realistic to expect the officer to forget what he has seen; and no purpose is served by requiring him to do so.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vuthy Seng, </em>436 Mass. 537, 551 (2002) (noting legal distinction between merely observing bank\u2019s name and logo on a bank card during an inventory search, and recording account numbers for use in further investigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b654-17\"> The defendant also was charged with a second count of stalking and a single count of distributing obscene matter. Both charges were dismissed upon motions by the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b655-6\"> The handwritten notes included phrases such as \u201cCPC stalks its clients,\u201d \u201cCPC employs predators, stalkers,\u201d \u201cprogram promotes recidivism,\u201d \u201cCPC stalks clients,\u201d \u201cCPC stalkers,\u201d \u201cextortion, racketeering,\u201d and \u201cCPC sends innocent victims to jail.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b655-7\"> Nazarro was particularly troubled by the prolonged duration of the mailings. He felt \u201c[pjanicked, threatened ... to have a series [of mailings], to have a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>time that elapsed, to know that [the defendant\u2019s actions had] gone on for months and to extents that if this is what [he] was seeing, what was [he] not seeing . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b656-9\"> The Commonwealth may rely on circumstantial evidence, and inferences drawn \u201cneed only be \u2018reasonable and possible,\u2019 not necessary.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bacigalupo, </em>455 Mass. 485, 489 (2009), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Longo, </em>402 Mass. 482, 487 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b656-10\"> As noted in <em>Jenkins, supra </em>at 288-290, the Legislature amended the statute in 1996 by adopting the language used by the <em>Kwiatkowski </em>court to save the prior version of the statute from constitutional infirmity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b657-6\"> The statute explicitly distinguishes, in the enumeration of the elements that constitute stalking, between the number of communications and the number of overt threats: \u201c[w]hoever (1) willfully and maliciously engages in a knowing <em>pattern of conduct </em>or <em>series of acts </em>over a period of time directed at a specific person which seriously alarms or annoys that person and would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress, and (2) makes <em>a threat </em>with the intent to place the person in imminent fear of death or bodily injury, shall be guilty of the crime of stalking . . .\u201d (emphasis supplied).
