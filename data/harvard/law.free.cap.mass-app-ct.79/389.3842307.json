L. c. 265, \u00a7 13H.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The victim, who was eighty-eight years old and suffering from dementia at the time of trial, did not testify. On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial judge erred by admitting in evidence the victim\u2019s pretrial statements as excited utterances, that the motion judge abused her discretion by denying the defendant\u2019s request for the victim to undergo a psychological examination, and that the trial judge erred by refusing to give a missing witness instruction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">1. <em>Background, </em>a. <em>Motion in limine. </em>Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion in limine to exclude the victim\u2019s out-of-court statements based on his assertions that they did not qualify as excited utterances, that they violated his right to confrontation, and that they were \u201cnot the product of a competent mind.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial judge held a voir dire on the motion, from which the following emerged.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">In April of 2003, the victim became a patient at the Fairlawn Nursing Home (Fairlawn) in Leominster. The victim was an eighty-six year old woman who suffered from \u201c[ejarly dementia\u201d but was \u201calert and oriented with some confusion.\u201d She would tend to become agitated at night because she would want to go outside by herself, but she was not allowed to as Fairlawn was on a busy street. The victim was very mobile, expressed herself well, and spoke in proper context. She was generally responsible for her own care; she fed and dressed herself, and she read books and newspapers on a daily basis. The victim was continent for \u201cthe most part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">On October 13, 2003, Matthew Smith was working the 3:00 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>to 11:00 p.m. shift as a certified nursing assistant (CNA) at Fair-lawn. At approximately 10:30 p.m., Smith was assisting a patient into bed, and he determined that he needed the help of another CNA. Smith began to search for the defendant, who was also employed as a CNA at Fairlawn. While he looked down the hallway, Smith\u2019s attention was drawn to room number twenty-five (room 25) because the door was closed; CNAs were not ordinarily permitted to offer patient care behind closed doors. He went into room number twenty-seven and walked into the bathroom that was shared by room 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">While he looked into room 25 through the slightly opened bathroom door, Smith could hear some talking and saw the victim\u2019s head moving in a \u201cthrusting\u201d motion. The victim was lying across her bed so that her \u201cbuttocks was right up flush with the edge of the bed.\u201d When he further opened the door, Smith saw that someone\u2019s hands were on the victim\u2019s shoulders. At this point, Smith entered room 25, which was \u201ccompletely bright,\u201d and pulled back the privacy curtain that was partially covering the victim\u2019s bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Behind the curtain, Smith saw the defendant standing \u201cflush up against\u201d the victim, between her legs, which were up in the air. The victim was wearing only a shirt and was naked from the waist down. The defendant jumped away from the victim when Smith pulled the curtain back. The defendant\u2019s pants were down in the front, and his penis was exposed. The defendant tucked his penis back into his pants and tied the drawstring. When Smith asked the defendant what he was doing, the defendant replied that he was \u201cwashing\u201d the victim. Smith told the defendant that he \u201cwasn\u2019t washing her; that he was having sex with her.\u201d The defendant replied that Smith was \u201cgross\u201d and \u201csick for assuming that.\u201d The defendant was not holding anything in his hands, and there was no indication that the victim had soiled herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">The victim returned herself to a \u201cregular position in her bed,\u201d and Smith covered her with a blanket. The victim asked Smith, \u201c[W]hy do they keep doing this to her,\u201d and Smith asked, \u201c[Djoing what?\u201d The victim replied, \u201c[Njever mind.\u201d The defendant was still in the room at this point. The victim was pulling the blankets up over herself, and she looked \u201cfrightened\u201d and \u201cvery nervous or scared.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>When Smith left the room, the defendant followed and implored him not to say anything, claiming that \u201cI would never do that. That\u2019s disgusting.\u201d Upon seeing Denise Miller, a nurse supervisor, Smith pulled her aside and asked to speak with her privately. In a copier room, Smith was visibly shaking and crying as he told her what he had just witnessed. This conversation lasted less than five minutes. Immediately after speaking with Smith, Miller went straight to the victim\u2019s room to speak with her to \u201csee if there was justification for what [Smith] was saying,\u201d because she \u201cwasn\u2019t going to jump to conclusions.\u201d Miller wanted to investigate what had occurred and whether the victim required medical services.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Miller asked the victim \u201cif anything had happened that night,\u201d to which the victim replied that \u201che did that test, again.\u201d When Miller asked, \u201c[W]hat test,\u201d the victim stated, \u201c[T]hat test he\u2019s always done. The one I don\u2019t want him to do it, and he doesn\u2019t stop.\u201d When Miller again asked the victim to clarify what test she was referring to, the victim stated, \u201c[T]he test Dr. Radha ordered to check my insides.\u201d When Miller inquired how the defendant did the test, the victim responded that \u201che puts his thing up me.\u201d Miller asked her, \u201c[W]here does he put that thing,\u201d and the victim pointed to her vagina. Miller pointed to her vagina and said, \u201c[D]own there,\u201d and the victim said, \u201c[Y]es, down there.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The victim was upset when she was talking to Miller.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">After speaking with the victim, due to the serious nature of the report, Miller found the charge nurse and brought her back into the victim\u2019s room because she wanted another nurse to hear the allegation. Almost verbatim, the victim repeated for the charge nurse what she had told Miller. When the defendant returned to the room with a face cloth to wash the victim, the victim \u201cbecame visibly upset\u201d and said, \u201c[T]hat\u2019s him, that\u2019s him. He\u2019s the one who does the thing.\u201d Miller took the face cloth from the defendant and told him that she would do it. Miller was concerned that evidence might be washed away. When she examined the victim\u2019s vagina, it was red, but there were no feces on the victim. Following nursing home policy, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Miller contacted the director of nurses and then reported the matter to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">William B. Land, a board certified forensic psychiatrist, testified for the defendant as to his opinion of the victim\u2019s competency at the time of the incident. Dr. Land did not interview the victim, but he did review her medical records from Fairlawn and concluded that she suffered from dementia and short-term and long-term memory problems. Because of her diagnosis,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Dr. Land questioned the victim\u2019s reliability in particular because she had no recollection of the incident the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">b. <em>The Commonwealth\u2019s case. </em>Smith and Miller both testified at trial in substantial conformity with their motion in limine testimony. Miller added that the victim\u2019s long-term memory was good but that her short-term memory \u201cwould be scattered at times.\u201d She also testified that the proper procedure for a patient who had an incontinence accident would be to bring the patient into the bathroom, hand them a face cloth, and let them wash themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Leominster police Officers Ryan Malatos and John Bouchard arrested the defendant and transported him to the Leominster police station, where he was \u201cbooked.\u201d At the police station, the defendant waived his Miranda rights and denied that he had raped anyone. He claimed that the victim had \u201cshit herself\u201d and he was merely cleaning up the mess. Red-faced and nervous, he further claimed that Smith had mistaken a bottle of lotion for his penis.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">A few moments later, the defendant had a change of heart and offered to tell the police \u201cthe truth.\u201d He said that it had been his plan to \u201chav[e] sex\u201d with the victim. The defendant told the officer that he \u201cstuck each hand on either side of her, and he got her ready for sex.\u201d He then spread the victim\u2019s legs apart and put them on the sides of the bed. With his pants down and his penis partially erect, the defendant then realized that what he was doing was wrong. The defendant told the police that it was at this moment of conscience that Smith walked into the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>c. <em>The defense. </em>In his defense, the defendant called Dr. Land, who testified essentially as he had at the motion in limine voir dire. The defendant also offered his own testimony. According to the defendant, the victim was \u201ccombative,\u201d screamed at people, and \u201clike[d] to hit.\u201d On the night of the incident, the defendant reported seeing the victim standing outside her room, not wearing underwear and screaming for help. He explained that he calmed the victim down, brought her into her bathroom, and helped clean the feces off her. The door to the victim\u2019s room was closed because the victim was naked; the defendant\u2019s search for her underwear was unsuccessful. While the defendant was attempting to help the victim lie down on the bed, Smith \u201cjumped\u201d into the room. The defendant denied that his pants were down, that his penis was exposed, or that he touched the victim\u2019s private area. He asked Smith if he was \u201csick\u201d for thinking he was \u201cfucking her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Later, while the defendant was doing paperwork, Miller asked for his assistance in calming down the victim. He testified that the victim was screaming, \u201cmaking like a physical thing with her arms, moving her chair and stuff around,\u201d and was asking to go outside. According to the defendant, the victim asked for Dr. Radha and asked, \u201cWhy does this keep happening to me.\u201d After ten minutes, the victim calmed down and the defendant left the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">After the defendant wrote a report at Miller\u2019s request, the police arrived and arrested him. At the police station, when he was finally told he had been arrested for rape, the defendant \u201cflipped out.\u201d He denied raping the victim and provided the police with his exculpatory version of the incident in which he claimed he had merely cleaned the victim. He also denied that he told Officer Malatos that he wanted to tell \u201cthe truth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">After the defendant\u2019s testimony was completed, the defendant\u2019s counsel informed the judge that the defense wanted to call the victim. Counsel claimed that he had subpoenaed the victim and was told she was not available. The prosecutor had no knowledge of such a subpoena. When counsel could not produce a return of service, the defense rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Excited utterances. </em>The defendant claims that the trial judge abused his discretion by admitting the victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>out-of-court statements as excited utterances, where the foundational requirements were not satisfied and where a determination of the victim\u2019s competency had not been made. He also claims that the admission of the victim\u2019s out-of-court statements violated his right to confrontation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The admissibility of out-of-court statements is reviewed under a two-step inquiry. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Linton, </em>456 Mass. 534, 548 (2010). First, it must be determined whether the statement is admissible under the Massachusetts \u201ccommon law of evidence.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>If the statement is admissible, then the second step is to determine \u201cwhether admission of the statement is prohibited by the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment [to the United States Constitution].\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nesbitt, </em>452 Mass. 236, 243 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">A statement which would otherwise be inadmissible as hearsay may be admitted as an excited utterance if it is made following \u201can occurrence or event sufficiently startling to render inoperative the normal reflective thought processes of the observer,\u201d and the \u201cstatement was a spontaneous reaction to the occurrence or event and not the result of reflective thought.\u201d Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 803(2), at 245 (2011). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Depina, </em>456 Mass. 238, 244-245 (2010); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hartnett, </em>72 Mass. App. Ct. 467, 474 (2008). An excited utterance may properly be made in the form of answers to specific questions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>418 Mass. 76, 81-82 (1994). A judge has broad discretion to determine whether the foundational requirements have been met to qualify a statement as an excited utterance. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiMonte, All </em>Mass. 233, 236 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Here, both Smith and Miller testified to the circumstances immediately following and within minutes of Smith\u2019s observation of the defendant\u2019s sexual assault of the victim. Given that the statements at issue were spoken in the immediate aftermath of the assault, the judge could properly conclude that the victim was still under influence of a startling and traumatic event, and that her statements were not the product of reflective thought. Also, the victim\u2019s statements both characterized and explained the assault. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>437 Mass. 620, 624-627 (2002).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Even though the victim responded \u201cnever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>mind\u201d to Smith\u2019s attempt to clarify what she had said, the evidence permitted the judge to conclude that the victim remained \u201cfrightened,\u201d \u201cvery nervous,\u201d and \u201cscared,\u201d especially given that the defendant was still present in the room at the time. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 756, 761-762 (2002). Because the proper foundation for the statements was established, there was no abuse of discretion in the admission of the victim\u2019s statements to Smith and Miller as excited utterances.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Beyond the foundational requirements, the defendant also claims that it was error to admit the victim\u2019s statements where the trial judge made no finding that the victim was competent at the time she made them. We disagree. The defendant\u2019s claim reads too much into a sentence from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>436 Mass. 252, 255 (2002), where the Supreme Judicial Court wrote that a declarant of an excited utterance, like any other witness, \u201cmust be competent.\u201d While this is undoubtedly true, competency for the purposes of an excited utterance is not the same as that for a witness who testifies at trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tang, </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 53, 64-67 (2006). Competency for a declarant of an excited utterance requires only that the declar-ant\u2019s factual assertion rest on personal knowledge. In other words, the declarant must have had an opportunity to observe the facts contained in the extrajudicial statement. <em>Id. </em>at 64-65. No more is required because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-6\">\u201cthere is a countervailing assurance of reliability in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>excitement of the event[; therefore,] the other aspects of competency are not applied. Thus, an excited utterance is admissible despite the fact that the declarant was a child and would have been incompetent as a witness for that reason, or the declarant was incompetent by virtue of mental illness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 65, quoting from 2 McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 272, at 209-210 (5th ed. 1999). Because the victim had firsthand knowledge of her statements, and the foundational requirements were met, she was sufficiently competent to render admissible excited utterances. The judge did not abuse his discretion by refusing to make further inquiry on competence or to conduct a voir dire on the matter. See <em>id. </em>at 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">b. <em>The confrontation clause. </em>The defendant further claims that the admission of the victim\u2019s excited utterances violated his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. We disagree. The Sixth Amendment imposes \u201ca complete bar to the admission of out-of-court statements that are determined to be testimonial unless (1) the declarant is available at trial or (2) the declarant is formally unavailable to testify and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonsalves, </em>445 Mass. 1, 6 (2005), cert, denied, 548 U.S. 926 (2006), citing <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 68 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">There is a \u201c \u2018two-step procedure for distinguishing testimonial from nontestimonial statements.\u2019 . . . The first step is to determine whether the statements are testimonial per se.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nesbitt, </em>452 Mass, at 243, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burgess, </em>450 Mass. 422, 429 (2008). Statements \u201cmade in response to questioning by law enforcement agents are per se testimonial, except where the questioning is meant to secure a volatile scene or to establish the need for or provide medical care.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nesbitt, </em>452 Mass. at 243, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonsalves, supra </em>at 3. Out-of-court statements made in response \u201c \u2018to questions from people who are <em>not </em>law enforcement agents\u2019 and \u2018statements offered . . . without prompting, regardless of who heard them,\u2019 are not testimonial per se\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nesbitt, </em>452 Mass. at 244, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number><em>Burgess, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Statements that are not testimonial per se must \u201cbe examined to determine if they are nonetheless testimonial in fact by evaluating whether a reasonable person in the declarant\u2019s position would anticipate his statement being used against the accused in investigating and prosecuting a crime.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nesbitt, </em>452 Mass. at 244, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonsalves, supra </em>at 3. Out-of-court statements that are deemed testimonial per se or testimonial in fact are inadmissible unless the declarant is available to testify or the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nesbitt, </em>452 Mass. at 244. Nontestimonial out-of-court statements do not give rise to a right of confrontation and may be admitted \u201cif the admission is consistent with Massachusetts evidence law.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The defendant argues not that the victim\u2019s statements are testimonial per se but rather that they are testimonial in fact. We disagree. The incident at issue took place in a nursing home where the eighty-six year old victim, who suffered from dementia, was a patient. The inquiries made by Smith and Miller, in the informal setting of the victim\u2019s room, were related to medical care even though they were made in an effort to determine what had occurred. The victim\u2019s response, which indicated that the defendant had done \u201cthe test\u201d again, further demonstrates that the victim understood the question to be about her medical condition. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s argument, the focus of the testimonial-in-fact inquiry is not on those who heard the statements but, rather, on an objective view of a reasonable person in the declarant\u2019s position. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gon-salves, supra </em>at 12-13. Thus, the fact that Miller knew she would have to notify the police about the assault does not inform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>the inquiry.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Instead, a reasonable person in the victim\u2019s position would not have anticipated that her statements would be used against the defendant in investigating and prosecuting a crime. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Linton, </em>456 Mass. at 550. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">c. <em>Psychological examination. </em>Prior to trial, the defendant moved pursuant to Mass.R.Crim.P. 14, as amended, 444 Mass. 1501 (2005), to have an expert conduct a psychological examination of the victim. After a hearing, the motion judge denied the motion. On appeal, the defendant claims that the denial of his motion violated his right to confront his accuser. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Jettisoning his reliance on rule 14, the defendant now claims that the motion judge \u201cunquestionably had the authority to order an evaluation\u201d of the victim pursuant to G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 19. Section 19 provides: \u201cIn order to determine the mental condition of any party or witness before any court of the commonwealth, the presiding judge may, in his discretion, request the department [of mental health] to assign a qualified physician or psychologist, who, if assigned shall make such examinations as the judge may deem necessary.\u201d G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 19, inserted by St. 1986, c. 599, \u00a7 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">An examination of the text of \u00a7 19 reveals that there was no abuse of discretion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hiotes, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 255, 256 (2003) (denial of motion made pursuant to G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 19, reviewed for an abuse of discretion). Simply enough, the victim was not a \u201cwitness before any court of the commonwealth.\u201d G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 19. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Widrick, </em>392 Mass. 884, 887-888 (1984) (G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 19, \u201cenhances] a trial judge\u2019s jurisdiction to determine a party\u2019s or a witness\u2019s competency to <em>testify at trial\u201d </em>[emphasis supplied]). That the victim\u2019s nontestimonial out-of-court statements were admitted in evidence as excited utterances does not change that equation. Similarly, the defendant cannot claim that the victim \u201cwas obviously the essential witness\u201d for the Commonwealth and that the Commonwealth, by not calling her, violated his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>right to confrontation. Not only is it the prosecutor\u2019s choice to decide which witnesses are essential to the Commonwealth\u2019s case,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> but the Sixth Amendment is not a freewheeling construct of the defendant\u2019s imagination. Rather, \u201cthe right to confrontation is a <em>trial </em>right, designed to prevent improper restrictions on the types of questions that defense counsel may ask during cross-examination\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. 39, 52 (1987). See <em>Kentucky </em>v. <em>Stincer, </em>482 U.S. 730, 738 n.9 (1987). However, the right to confrontation \u201cdoes not include the power to require the pretrial disclosure of any and all information that might be useful in contradicting unfavorable testimony.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Ritchie, supra </em>at 53. The motion was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">d. <em>Missing witness instruction. </em>Finally, the defendant claims the trial judge erred by refusing to give a missing witness instruction, asserting that the victim was \u201cthe sole alleged victim of the alleged assault\u201d and, as such, the Commonwealth \u201cwould naturally offer her as a witness.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">The decision to provide a missing witness instruction to the jury is \u201cwithin the discretion of the trial judge, and will not be reversed unless the decision was manifestly unreasonable.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saletino, </em>449 Mass. 657, 667 (2007). A missing witness instruction is appropriate when a party \u201c \u2018has knowledge of a person who can be located and brought forward, who is friendly to, or at least not hostilely disposed toward, the party, and who can be expected to give testimony of distinct importance to the case,\u2019 and the party, without explanation, fails to call the person as a witness.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>411 Mass. 279,280 n.l (1991). However, \u201cif the circumstances, considered by ordinary logic and experience, suggest a plausible reason for nonproduction of the witness,\u201d the jury should not be given the instruction. <em>Id. </em>at 282-283.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Here, the trial judge properly denied the defendant\u2019s request for a missing witness instruction. The Commonwealth had a legitimate, plausible reason for not calling the then eighty-eight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>year old victim, who was suffering from moderate to severe dementia. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saletino, supra </em>at 668 (missing witness instruction \u201cshould not be given where the Commonwealth has legitimate tactical reasons for not calling the witness\u201d). In fact, the record shows and all parties agreed that the victim was not competent to testify at trial despite no formal determination of competency. There was neither error nor an abuse of discretion in not giving the instruction.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b426-11\"> The defendant was acquitted of rape.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b426-12\"> The Commonwealth also filed a motion in limine to admit the victim\u2019s statements as excited utterances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b428-7\"> When Miller was questioning the victim, she was not thinking she was going to have to report it to the police, but after she heard what the victim told her, she knew she would have to notify the police.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b429-9\"> Dr. Land explained the three stages of dementia and the symptoms associated with it.
