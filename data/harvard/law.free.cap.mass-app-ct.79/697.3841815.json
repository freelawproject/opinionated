At the time of the accident, Chery was a passenger in a motor vehicle insured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>by the defendant, Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company (Metropolitan). Chery submitted a claim to Metropolitan under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M, for personal injury protection (PIP) benefits requesting payment of her medical bills. When Metropolitan failed to pay the bills within the time prescribed by the statute, Chery brought this action alleging that Metropolitan had violated G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M, by failing to pay PIP benefits (Count I) and G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, by committing unfair insurance settlement practices in violation of G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9)(/) (Count H). See <em>Bolden </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor Caf\u00e9 of Worcester, Inc., </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 56, 59 n.8 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Approximately six months after Chery filed her complaint (and eleven months after she had submitted her claim for PIP benefits), Metropolitan paid the outstanding medical bills and then moved for summary judgment, claiming that because payment had been made in full prior to the entry of judgment, no justiciable controversy existed as to the contract claim under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M, and that Chery was unable to show any actual injury or loss causally related to Metropolitan\u2019s conduct \u2014 an essential element of her c. 93A claim. A judge of the District Court granted Metropolitan\u2019s motion, and the entry of judgment in favor of Metropolitan was affirmed by the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">We review de novo the grant of summary judgment, <em>District Attorney for the N. District </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Wayland, </em>455 Mass. 561, 566 (2009), and determine whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, all material facts have been established and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. <em>Augat, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>410 Mass. 117, 120 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">As to Count I, Metropolitan maintains that because it paid Chery\u2019s bills before trial commenced, Chery has no remedy under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M. See <em>Fascione </em>v. <em>CNA Ins. Cos., </em>435 Mass. 88 (2001). Chery does not argue otherwise but asserts that summary judgment was erroneously granted because a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether all of her bills have been paid. In particular, Chery points to Metropolitan\u2019s refusal to pay a medical bill incurred after Chery filed her complaint. However, the complaint was not amended to include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>a claim for this additional medical expense,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Metropolitan did not consent to the inclusion of the issue pursuant to Mass. R.Civ.P. 15(b), 365 Mass. 761 (1974). We are not obligated, therefore, to address it. See <em>Coombes </em>v. <em>Florio, </em>450 Mass. 182, 186 n.4 (2007) (Ireland, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">As to Count II, it is uncontested that Metropolitan\u2019s failure to promptly settle Chery\u2019s PIP claims violated G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9)(/), and was thus unlawful under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2. See <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>434 Mass. 556, 564 (2001). At issue is Metropolitan\u2019s assertion, accepted by the judge, that despite its violation Chery may not recover under G. L. c. 93A because she is unable to show any injury or loss causally related to the violation. See <em>Hershenow </em>v. <em>Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. of Boston, </em>445 Mass. 790, 798 (2006) (\u201c[A] plaintiff seeking a remedy under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, must demonstrate that even a per se deception caused a loss\u201d). We conclude that, notwithstanding Metropolitan\u2019s ultimate payment of the outstanding bills, Chery has shown, for purposes of surviving summary judgment, an ascertainable loss caused by Metropolitan\u2019s dilatory conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">General Laws c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9), and G. L. c. 93A \u201cwere enacted to encourage the settlement of insurance claims . . . and discourage insurers from forcing claimants into unnecessary litigation to obtain relief.\u201d <em>Clegg </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>424 Mass. 413, 419 (1997). In this case, Metropolitan\u2019s unexplained failure to settle Chery\u2019s claims, well after its liability was reasonably clear, caused her injury by forcing Chery to institute litigation to receive benefits to which she was entitled under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M. See <em>Hershenow </em>v. <em>Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. of Boston, supra </em>at 801, quoting from <em>Aspinall </em>v. <em>Philip Morris Cos., </em>442 Mass. 381, 401 (2004) (causation established where tortfeasor\u2019s conduct \u201ccould reasonably be found to have caused a person to act differently from the way he [or she] otherwise would have acted\u201d). See also <em>Columbia Chiropractic Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Trust Ins. Co., </em>430 Mass. 60, 65 (1999) (unreasonable delay in paying bills submitted under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M, may violate G. L. c. 93A).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Additionally, there is support in the summary judgment record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>for Chery\u2019s claim that Metropolitan\u2019s conduct caused her emotional distress, not only as a result of having to commence litigation but also out of concern for the negative effect her unpaid medical bills might have on her creditworthiness.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Metropolitan\u2019s efforts to discount these allegations as insufficient to establish quantifiable damages for intentional infliction of emotional distress are unavailing. A plaintiff seeking redress under c. 93A is not required to show a quantifiable amount of actual damages as an element of her claim. Rather, a plaintiff is required to show only that she suffered some loss caused by the defendant\u2019s allegedly unlawful conduct. Here, Chery has met this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">That portion of the judgment dismissing Count II of the complaint is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. The judgment is otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b735-7\"> Although Chery moved to amend her complaint, presumably to add a claim based on this subsequent bill, the motion was denied and Chery did not appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b736-7\"> Chery\u2019s affidavit in support of her opposition to the summary judgment motion states, by way of injury, that she has</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-8\">\u201cexperienced a great deal of stress and anxiety with regard to Defendant\u2019s failure to pay my medical bills and their requiring me to file this lawsuit. ... I am obligated to pay attorney fees for all legal work from 93A Demand . . . until this case is concluded. ... I have been concerned that my credit worthiness has been effected [sic] by the Defendant\u2019s failure to pay my medical bills for up until almost one year after I incurred the first bill. I had received many past due notices from my providers during this time. ... I have incurred cost in entry fee in filing this suit, along with service of process and court reporter fees for deposition and attorney fees in my attempt to get the Defendant to pay medical bills. ... I was forced by Defendant\u2019s refusal to pay my bills to file suit.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
