After the city of Boston (city) rejected their transfer requests, they appealed to the Civil Service Commission (commission), claiming that G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 40, inserted by St. 1978, c. 393, \u00a7 11, entitled them to employment with the BPD \u201cwithout loss of seniority, retirement or other rights\u201d because their work had been transferred from the BMPD to the BPD. The commission rejected their appeal, and following an appeal to the Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, judgment entered affirming the commission\u2019s rejection. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The essential facts are that, beginning in 1979, the city maintained two police departments, the BMPD and the BPD. The BMPD performed police functions on all city-owned property. The BPD, which also performed police functions on property the city owned, performed police functions throughout the city as well. The BMPD consisted of two divisions, one of which was armed and the other unarmed, but employees of both divisions were hired by the city\u2019s property and construction management department. BPD hired its own officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Early in 2006, the city decided to abolish the BMPD armed division and to create a unified command structure covering all of its armed police officers. Invoking G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 35, a statute allowing city employees to transfer between \u201cdepartmental units\u201d if the \u201cappointing authorities\u201d for both units agree,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the city gave all members of the BMPD\u2019s armed division the opportunity to apply for transfer to the BPD. Most of the armed BMPD employees applied and, upon successfully completing BPD tests and other screening procedures not challenged here, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>thirty-three were approved for transfer. The plaintiffs, each of whom failed one of the BPD tests or other procedures, were not offered BPD positions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">After learning that their transfer applications had been rejected, the plaintiffs filed a complaint with the commission alleging that G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 40, the pertinent provisions of which are discussed <em>infra, </em>entitled them to employment with the BPD because the city had abolished their BMPD positions and transferred their functions to the BPD.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After a hearing, the commission dismissed the complaint for two reasons. First, the commission held that \u00a7 40 only applied to transfers between positions controlled by the same \u201cappointing authority.\u201d Transfers between positions controlled by different appointing authorities, in the commission\u2019s view, are governed solely and exclusively by G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 35. Second, the commission ruled that transfers pursuant to \u00a7 40 required \u201capproval of the [personnel] administrator,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and it was \u201cinconceivable\u201d that the administrator would have approved any transfers the BPD had rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The plaintiffs sought review of the commission\u2019s decision in Superior Court where, after a hearing, a judge ordered entry of judgment affirming that decision. The plaintiffs now appeal to this court where, in response, the city relies heavily on the commission\u2019s reasoning and approach to the application of G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 40.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">The language of G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 40, provides the appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>starting point for analysis of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims and the city\u2019s response. The language is straightforward and provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-5\">\u201c[i]f the position of a permanent employee is abolished as the result of the transfer of the functions of such position to another department, division, board or commission, such employee may elect to have his name placed on the reemployment list or to be transferred, subject to the approval of the administrator, to a similar position in such department, division, board or commission without loss of seniority, retirement or other rights . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The term \u201cdepartment\u201d as used in G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 40, is not specifically defined in the statute, but the term \u201c [departmental unit\u201d is defined in G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 1, as amended through St. 1998, c. 161, \u00a7 235, as \u201ca board, commission, department, or any division, institutional component, or other component of a department established by law, ordinance, or by-law.\u201d That definition reveals that a \u201cdepartment\u201d is a major organizational unit often containing subunits. See G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 33, inserted by St. 1978, c. 393, \u00a7 11 (dealing with calculation of seniority of employees who have been transferred, inter alia, \u201cfrom one departmental unit to another within the same department in a city or town\u201d). On its face, then, and read in accordance with the meaning of the terms it contains, \u00a7 40 provides that when a permanent employee\u2019s position is abolished because the position\u2019s functions have been transferred from one major organizational unit to another major organizational unit, the employee is entitled to follow the transfer if the personnel administrator approves.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">No one argues that the plaintiffs were not \u201cpermanent employees\u201d or that their positions were not abolished. The city does argue that no substantial evidence before the commission showed that abolition of the plaintiffs\u2019 positions was caused or accompanied by transfer of their functions to the BPD. But the proceedings before the commission did yield substantial evidence that the plaintiffs\u2019 functions were transferred to the BPD, although the commission made no finding on the issue. The evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>included testimony that calls for assistance to the BMPD dispatch center received before the plaintiffs\u2019 positions were abolished were dispatched directly to a BMPD officer. After abolition of the plaintiffs\u2019 positions, the BMPD dispatch center transferred those calls for assistance to a BPD dispatch center, which relayed them to a BPD officer. The same kind of change occurred with respect to alarms the BMPD dispatch center received before the armed positions were abolished. More generally, the record reveals, as noted earlier, that the plaintiffs performed on city-owned property and occasionally elsewhere the same functions BPD officers performed on the same property and throughout the city. Abolition of the plaintiffs\u2019 positions, therefore, necessarily meant that their work would be picked up by BPD officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Despite the existence of substantial evidence supporting the plaintiffs\u2019 position, the commission made no specific findings on the transferred work issue.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Probably the commission believed that findings on the issue were unnecessary because of its view that G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 40, afforded the plaintiffs no relief even if their work had been transferred to the BPD. As the commission saw it, \u00a7 40 applied only to transfers within the same \u201cappointing authority\u201d and the BPD and BMPD were different \u201cappointing authorities.\u201d The basis for the commission\u2019s view is found in the following footnote in its decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-6\">\u201cUnder civil service definitions, an \u2018Appointing Authority\u2019 may have several \u2018departmental units\u2019. The term \u2018departmental unit\u2019 that appears in G. L. c. 31 \u00a7 39[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] is defined at G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 1 as, \u2018a board, commission, department, or any division, institutional component, or other component of a department established by law, ordinance or by-law\u2019. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>Thus \u2018departmental units\u2019, themselves, may have several components. G. L. c. 31 \u00a7 1 defines an \u2018Appointing Authority\u2019 as \u2018any person, board or commission with power to appoint or employ personnel in civil service positions\u2019. Thus, the \u2018departmental units\u2019 of an \u2018Appointing Authority\u2019 are those \u2018department units\u2019 <em>[sic] </em>for which the Appointing Authority has the \u2018power to appoint or employ personnel in civil service positions.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The commission\u2019s interpretation of a statute that operates within its sphere of responsibility is, of course, entitled to deference. <em>Falmouth </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commn., </em>447 Mass. 814, 822 (2006); <em>Provencal </em>v. <em>Commonwealth Health Ins. Connector Authy., </em>456 Mass. 506, 514 (2010). As often noted, though, that deference does not amount to abdication, see, e.g., <em>Duarte </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>451 Mass. 399, 411 (2008), and, in any event, \u201cinterpretation of a statute is [ultimately] a matter for the courts.\u201d <em>Onex Communications Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>457 Mass. 419, 424 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">In this case, the commission used the term \u201cappointing authority\u201d to circumscribe the interdepartmental transfers G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 40, permits because it apparently viewed \u201cdepartmental units\u201d as subdivisions of \u201cappointing authorities.\u201d They are not. The definitions contained in G. L. 31, \u00a7 1, reveal that a \u201cdepartmental unit\u201d is an organizational unit and that an \u201cappointing authority\u201d is a person or entity with the power to make personnel decisions. Many \u201cappointing authorities\u201d can exist within a single department.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">There is, therefore, no basis for using the concept of \u201cappointing authority\u201d to circumscribe the area within which G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 40, operates. Moreover, when the Legislature intended to use that concept as a circumscription, it knew exactly how to do it, as is evident from the language of G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 35:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\">\u201cAny permanent employee in a departmental unit may apply in writing to his appointing authority for transfer to a similar position within such unit, or may apply in writing to the appointing authorities for such unit and for any other departmental unit for transfer to a similar position in such other departmental unit. With the written consent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>such appointing authority or authorities, as the case may be, and with the written consent of the administrator, such person may be so transferred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">See G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 33 (dealing with calculation of seniority of employees transferred to different positions within and without \u201cthe same appointing authority\u201d). No such circumscription appears in \u00a7 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">The city seeks to remedy the weakness in the commission\u2019s analysis by inventing a new definition of \u201cappointing authority.\u201d The plaintiffs, the city says,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-7\">\u201ccould not transfer to the BPD under [G. L.] c. 31, \u00a7 40, because that statute applies only to transfers within a single appointing authority, and the BMPD and the BPD fall under separate appointing authorities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-8\">\u201cThese determinations are required by [G. L.] c. 31, \u00a7 1, which defines an \u2018appointing authority\u2019 as being made up of \u2018departmental units,\u2019 which in turn are defined as \u2018a board, commission, department, or any division, institutional component, or other component of a department 9 99</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">But G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 1, says nothing of the sort. Instead, as the commission correctly stated, the section simply says that an \u201cappointing authority\u201d is \u201cany person, board or commission with power to appoint or employ personnel in civil service positions.\u201d Nothing else in c. 31 limits the force of \u00a7 40 to transfers within the jurisdiction of a single appointing authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">That leaves the commission\u2019s final reason for its decision, i.e., that it is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-12\">\u201cinconceivable that [the personnel administrator], given the powers and responsibilities of a Boston Police Officer, would not first consult with the Boston Police Department prior to granting . . . approval [for any transfer from the BMPD to the BPD]. As such, any transfer request under [G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 40,] would be moot as [the personnel administrator] would not be expected to approve of transfers regarding individuals who had failed a background check, physical abilities test or psychological examination conducted by the [c]ity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Perhaps, but the decision whether to approve a transfer under \u00a7 40 is committed to the personnel administrator, not to forecasters of decisions the administrator never made. Neither the commission nor the city cite any authority for the proposition that the commission can base its decisions on what it assumes the personnel administrator would have done had the personnel administrator been given an opportunity to carry out his or her statutory responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">In sum, if the plaintiffs\u2019 positions were abolished because their work was transferred from the BMPD to the BPD, then the plaintiffs are entitled to be \u201ctransferred, subject to the approval of the administrator, to a similar position in such department, division, board or commission without loss of seniority, retirement or other rights.\u201d G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 40. As noted, there was substantial evidence before the commission that the work of the armed division of the BMPD was transferred but the issue was contested and, given the view it took of the law, the commission never resolved the issue. Because the commission\u2019s interpretation of the law was incorrect, and the record is silent on what the administrator would have done if the commission determined that the work had been transferred, the judgment of the Superior Court is vacated, and the matter is remanded to the commission for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b247-7\"> In pertinent part, G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 35, as amended through St. 1986, c. 557, \u00a7 11, provides that \u201c[a]ny permanent employee in a departmental unit may apply in writing to his appointing authority for transfer to a similar position within such unit, or may apply in writing to the appointing authorities for such unit and for any other departmental unit for transfer to a similar position in such other departmental unit. With the written consent of such appointing authority or authorities, as the case may be, and with the written consent of the [personnel] administrator, such person may be so transferred.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b248-8\"> Eleven of the plaintiffs failed a background check, seven did not pass the physical tests or medical examination, four failed a psychological examination, and four either did not request a transfer or withdrew their transfer applications during the processing period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b248-9\"> The initial complaint raised a variety of claims. Later, however, the complaint was amended to allege that the plaintiffs were entitled to BMPD positions because of the work transfer. The case then proceeded through the hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b248-10\"> The \u201cpersonnel administrator\u201d is \u201cthe personnel administrator of the human resources division within the executive office for administration and finance.\u201d G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 1, as amended through St. 1998, c. 161, \u00a7 234.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b248-11\"> In addition, the city urges that the plaintiffs\u2019 election to have their names placed on the reemployment list governed by G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 35, amounts to a waiver of any right to transfer pursuant to G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 40, they might otherwise have had. It does not appear that the city preserved that argument by raising it before the commission, see <em>Albert </em>v. <em>Municipal Ct. of Boston, </em>388 Mass. 491, 493-494 (1983), nor has the city cited to us any authority supporting its waiver contention. Moreover, neither the statutory language nor the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>statutory scheme considered as a whole evinces a legislative intent to force displaced employees to pick one avenue for possible reemployment to the exclusion of all others.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b250-7\"> In articulating its reasons for concluding that the city had a right to abolish the armed BMPD positions, however, the commission made a number of findings that are consistent with a conclusion that armed BMPD work had been transferred to the BPD for reasons of economy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b250-8\"> General Laws c. 31, \u00a7 39, inserted by St. 1978, c. 393, \u00a7 11, deals with termination of permanent employees \u201cbecause of lack of work or lack of money or abolition of positions\u201d under circumstances where the functions of the position are not transferred to another department. Although the commission focused on G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 40, in the text of its decision, it discussed \u00a7 39 in footnotes apparently because the city took the position that it had abolished the plaintiffs\u2019 positions without transferring their work to the BPD.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
