Defendant challenges the magistrate judge\u2019s authority to enter this order because it does not comply with the procedural requirements set forth in the Magistrate\u2019s Act. Although both parties agree that the magistrate judge\u2019s order does not comply with the Magistrate\u2019s Act, Appellee has filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Because the order is not a final judgment and we lack jurisdiction, we GRANT Appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">The district court referred this case to the magistrate judge for pretrial management pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b). When a district court refers a case to a magistrate judge under \u00a7 636(b), the magistrate judge is permitted \u201cto conduct hearings, including evidentiary hearing, and to submit to a judge of the court proposed findings of fact and recommendations.\u201d \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B). Once the magistrate judge files proposed findings and recommendations, parties have \u201cfourteen days ... [to] file written objections to such proposed findings and recommendations\u201d to the district court. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-12\">The magistrate judge in this case conducted an evidentiary hearing and entered an order granting the petition and committed Defendant to the custody of the United States Attorney General. The parties do not dispute that the magistrate-judge did not submit proposed findings and recommendations to the district court, in violation of \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B). A magistrate judge is only able to enter judgment if both parties consent. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c)(1)(C). The district court did not refer this case to the magistrate judge pursuant to \u00a7 636(b)(1)(C) and it is undisputed that neither party consented to the magistrate at any time thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Under our precedent, \u201cit is well established that a magistrate judge\u2019s order is not \u2018final\u2019 within the meaning of \u00a7 1291 and may not be appealed to this court directly.\u201d <em>Donaldson v. Ducote, </em>373 F.3d 622, 624 (5th Cir.2004); <em>see also Barber v. Shinseki </em>660 F.3d 877, 878-79 (5th Cir.2011). However, \u201cCongress has created a limited exception to this rule\u201d: \u00a7 636(c), under which a district court, with the consent of the parties, may authorize a magistrate judge to enter final judgment in a case and such judgment is appealable to the circuit court directly. <em>Id. </em>\u201cBecause this process requires the parties to waive their constitutional rights to an Article III judge, we have held that a case does not fall within the jurisdictional ambit of \u00a7 636(c) unless the parties\u2019 consent to proceed before a magistrate judge is clear and unambiguous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As stated above, it is undisputed that the parties did not consent to magistrate jurisdiction. Therefore, this case does not fall under \u00a7 636(c) and the magistrate judge\u2019s order is not a final judgment that can be appealed to this court. The district court is the proper court with which to file objections. <em>See </em>\u00a7 636(b)(1)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Because we lack jurisdiction, the motion to dismiss the appeal is GRANTED. Ap-pellee\u2019s alternative motion for extension of time to file a brief is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
