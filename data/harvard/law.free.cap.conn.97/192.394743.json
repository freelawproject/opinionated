The trial court found that for more than a score of years before the bringing of the action, and as far back as the memory of witnesses ran, the driveway had been used continuously, as their own, by the plaintiff and by his predecessors in title, and that such user was adverse. <em>Held </em>that these facts amply justified the conclusion, drawn by the trial court, that the plaintiff had acquired title to the driveway by prescription.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b204-9\">Argued January 4th</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AoYI\">decided February 11th, 1922.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-10\">Suit to restrain the defendants from interfering with the plaintiff in the use of a driveway upon his premises, and for damages, brought to and tried by the Superior Court in Hartford County, <em>Haines, J.; </em>facts found and judgment rendered for the plaintiff, and appeal by the defendant De Feo.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"Alq\">\n<em>No error.</em>\n</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b204-11\"><em>J.
