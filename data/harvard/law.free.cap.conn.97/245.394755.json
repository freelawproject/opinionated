The testator left him surviving his widow Caroline, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>his son Alfred and wife, and their three sons, all of whom resided in Connecticut. After the testator\u2019s .death Alfred and his family became domiciled in Virginia. In 1891 one of Alfred\u2019s sons died intestate, leaving his father as the sole distributee of his estate under the laws of Virginia. Alfred died in 1898, leaving his entire estate to his widow who survived him. In 1900 a second son of Alfred died intestate and without issue, leaving his mother and his surviving brother Robert as distributees of his estate, share and share alike. In 1908 Robert died testate, leaving his entire estate, with some exceptions, to his widow. In 1913 the widow of Alfred, who in the meantime had remarried, died testate leaving the residue of her estate to her brother Robert W. Curtiss of Fairfield, Connecticut, and her stepson, Spottswood Parker, as tenants in common. Finally, the widow of the testator died in 1920, having had the use and possession of the property described in paragraphs two and three of the will since the testator\u2019s death in 1882.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-6\">The defendants Claudia Grimsley, surviving widow of Robert Blakeman, individually and as executrix of the estate of Robert, and the Bridgeport Trust Company, administrator <em>d. </em>6. <em>n. </em>of the estates of the other two deceased grandchildren of the testator, claimed that the remainders to the heirs of Alfred Blakeman in paragraphs two and three of the will were valid, notwithstanding the Connecticut statute of perpetuities which was in force at the testator\u2019s death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-7\">The defendants E.

Blakeman be dead and all of his heirs be dead it is my will that the whole of the estate be left at the disposal of my wife Caroline M. Blakeman. . . .\u201d It must be admitted that the testator did not use the word \u201cheirs\u201d in this paragraph, either in its primary significance or as meaning those who might take Alfred\u2019s estate under our statute of distribution; for Caroline, being the mother of Alfred, is herself included in both of these classes. In order to give any sensible interpretation to the eleventh clause of the will, it is necessary to assume that the testator used the word heirs in that clause either as meaning \u201cissue,\u201d or in the still more restricted sense of \u201cchildren.\u201d Words used more than once in the same instrument are prima facie used in the same sense; and so it is said that the word \u201cheirs\u201d in paragraphs two and three must also be understood as meaning either issue or children; and as between two constructions one of which will defeat the gifts and the other validate them, the latter should be adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">That is true as between two constructions equally consistent with the probable intent of the testator; but the intent of the testator as manifested in the will must control, and we think it is impossible to discover any intent on the part of the testator to limit these remainders to the children of Alfred and to exclude the representatives of a deceased child of Alfred. In the absence of any discoverable intent to so limit the word \u201cheirs,\u201d it must be supposed to have been-used by the testator in the larger sense of \u201cissue,\u201d not only because that is the meaning which remains after eliminating its possible significations of heirs at law and distributees, but also because it is more probable than otherwise that a testator situated as was the decedent, should have intended the remainder to the heirs of his son Alfred to include not only surviving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>children but also representatives of any deceased children. If we suppose, for example, that none of Alfred\u2019s children had survived him, but that one of his sons had left issue him surviving, and if no question of the statute of perpetuities arose, it would be impossible to limit the word heirs so as to exclude such issue. We must therefore hold that the attempted remainders to the heirs of Alfred in paragraphs two and three of the will are void.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">That being so, it is conceded that the personal estate described in paragraphs two and three, being property not otherwise disposed of by the will, passes to the residuary legatees under paragraph nine. <em>Hartford Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Wolcott, </em>85 Conn. 134, 139, 81 Atl. 1057; <em>Bristol </em>v. <em>Bristol, </em>53 Conn. 242, 255, 5 Atl. 687; <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Sears, </em>81 Conn. 34, 47, 70 Atl. 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">The final question is whether the remainder interest in the real estate described in paragraph two also passes to the residuary legatees, or whether it becomes intestate estate. At the common law the personalty described in a lapsed bequest passed under a general residuary clause, but the realty described in a lapsed devise became intestate estate and descended to the heir. That distinction has been adopted in this State. <em>Greene </em>v. <em>Dennis, </em>6 Conn. 293, 305; <em>Brewster </em>v. <em>McCall\u2019s Devisees, </em>15 Conn. 274, 298; <em>Remington </em>v. <em>American Bible Soc., </em>44 Conn. 512, 514. In <em>Giddings </em>v. <em>Giddings, </em>65 Conn. 149, 159, 32 Atl. 334, it is intimated that if the question were a new one in this State it might be difficult to give any reason for such a distinction; and it must be admitted that so far as any discoverable intention of the testator is concerned, it is hard to discriminate between the effect of this residuary clause \u2014 which expressly includes both real and personal estate \u2014 upon the realty and personalty described in paragraph two of the will and disposed of by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>same words of gift. Nevertheless it appears to us that the rule announced in the cases cited has become a rule of property by which we must abide.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The Superior Court is advised that the remainders to the heirs of Alfred in paragraphs two and three of the will are void, that the remainder interest in the personal estate described therein passes under the residuary clause of the will, and that the remainder interest in the realty described in paragraph two is intestate estate of Sylvester Blakeman and is to be distributed accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b263-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
