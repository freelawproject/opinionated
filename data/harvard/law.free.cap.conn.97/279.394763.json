Greenberg <em>vs. </em>Fred C. Riley et al.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b291-9\">Third Judicial District, New Haven,</court>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"AZQ\">January Term, 1922.</p>\n<judges data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b291-10\">Wheeler, C. J., Beach, Curtis, Burpee and Webb, Js.</judges>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b291-11\">In an action by the payee against the indorsers of a note, the defendants alleged that they were accommodation indorsers without consideration, and that upon the maturity of the note the plaintiff agreed to discharge them if they would produce property of the maker, of the value of the note ($250), and that they did produce such property. The plaintiff denied the truth of this defense, and the jury rendered a verdict in his favor. <em>Held </em>that this conclusion was reasonably open to the jury upon the evidence, and therefore the trial judge acted properly in refusing to set aside the verdict.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b291-12\">Whether the provision in \u00a7 4480 of the General Statutes, that the renunciation of the rights of a holder of a negotiable instrument against any party thereto, \u2018\u2018must be in writing,\u201d applies to a discharge of such party by a contract upon consideration, <em>quaere.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b291-13\">The refusal of a trial judge to make a finding is not a subject-matter of appeal; the remedy, provided by General Statutes, \u00a7 5824, is by an application to this court for an order requiring him to make and file such finding.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b291-14\">Argued January 24th</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A4F\">decided February 21st, 1922.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Action by the payee against the indorsers of a promissory note, brought to the City Court of New Haven and tried to the jury before <em>Hoyt, J.; </em>verdict and judgment for the plaintiff for $323, and appeal by the defendants.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AzZ\"><em>No </em>error.</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b292-6\"><em>Joseph Koletsky, </em>for the appellants (defendants).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b292-7\"><em>Frank Kenna, </em>for the appellee (plaintiff).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b292-8\">Curtis, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AUN\">This is an action by the payee of a note against indorsers to recover the amount of the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">The defendants answer by a special defense only. They allege, in effect, that they were accommodation indorsers without consideration, and that when the note became due they entered into an agreement with the plaintiff whereby he agreed to discharge them from liability on the note if they would discover and produce for the plaintiff property of John C. Lounsbury of a value of $250, the amount due on the note; that they thereupon discovered and produced for the plaintiff property of John C. Lounsbury of such value. The plaintiff denied the allegations of this defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">Upon the trial the jury rendered a verdict for the plaintiff. The defendants moved the court to set aside the verdict as against the evidence. This motion the court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">The only reason of appeal that the record brings before us for consideration is the following, found in their appeal filed May 29th, 1920: \u201c1. The court erred in denying the motion to set aside the verdict in this action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-13\">There appears in the record the fact that on May 29th, 1920, the defendants made what they term a request for a finding, and, later, what they term a motion to correct the request for a finding. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>denied the motion and refused to make a finding. The defendants filed their appeal on May 29th, 1920, and also filed an amendment to their reasons of appeal, which was predicated on the charge of the court. No finding having been made as to the charge of the court, the court refused to permit the filing of the amendment to the reasons of appeal. The defendants also filed a supplemental appeal, which they apparently deemed would bring before us the question whether the court erred in not making a finding and allowing additional reasons of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">When a judge refuses to make a finding, such refusal is not a matter that can be remedied by an appeal or set up as a reason of appeal. The statutes provide that in case of the refusal of a judge to make a finding, an application may be made to the Supreme Court of Errors to order the judge to file a finding. General Statutes, \u00a7 5824; <em>Giordano </em>v. <em>Janetto, </em>95 Conn. 690, 112 Atl. 263. Therefore, as stated before, the only reason of appeal before us is that the court erred in denying the motion to set aside the verdict in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">The entire evidence in the case is made a part of the record. We are of the opinion, from an examination and consideration of the entire evidence, that the jury could reasonably have found the issues arising on the special defense and its denial in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">The plaintiff claimed that General Statutes, \u00a7 4480, which provides that the renunciation of the rights of a holder of a negotiable note against any party to the instrument, must be in writing, applies not only to a renunciation without consideration but also to a discharge of such party by contract upon consideration. It is to be observed, in this connection, that \u00a7 4477 provides that a negotiable instrument may be discharged \u201c(4) by any other act which will discharge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>a simple contract for the payment of money.\u201d A number of cases may be found which support this claim of the plaintiff; but Williston, in his work on Contracts, in a note to \u00a7 1833, Yol. 3, states that in his opinion the claim is clearly unsound. No question was raised on the trial as to the admissibility of any evidence produced by the defendants in support of their special defense. While it appears from an examination of the record that the defendants\u2019 evidence was entirely oral, yet, since we are satisfied that the jury could reasonably have found the issues for the plaintiff under the evidence presented, it is not essential in this case to decide the interesting and important question suggested by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<judges id=\"b294-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
