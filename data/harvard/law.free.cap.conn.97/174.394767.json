Buckley.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b186-9\">Third Judicial District, Bridgeport,</court>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"AGO\">October Term, 1921.</p>\n<judges data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b186-10\">Wheeler, C.

In this situation the trial judge charged the jury, as requested by the plaintiff, that one who assents to or acquiesces in the rendition of beneficial services for him by another, is liable to pay what they are reasonably worth; but added, that in order to apply this rule it was necessary \u201c that the plaintiff should show that the services were not included in any arrangement or bargain between other parties. I say' it is necessary that the plaintiff should show it,\u2014 I don\u2019t know whether the burden is on the plaintiff, but it is necessary that it should appear at the end of the case.\u201d <em>Held </em>that inasmuch as the doubt expressed as to the burden of proof touched a vital point in the case, this court could not say that the instruction might not have misled or confused the jury and thus prejudiced the defendant\u2019s defense in this particular.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b187-6\">In reference to the same issue, the court said that if the jury found that these services came in naturally and properly and in a normal way with the bargain that was made with the husband, then it would be understood that they were rendered gratuitously or under circumstances which implied their gratuitous rendition. <em>Held </em>that the use of the word \u201cgratuitously \u201d was not open to criticism as misleading and prejudicial, as urged by the defendant, since it clearly meant that the services were rendered without right or well-founded expectation of compensation other than as incorporated in the farm services paid for under the defendant\u2019s contract with the plaintiff\u2019s husband.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b187-7\">Letters of the defendant addressed to the plaintiff expressing surprise that she should have any claim against him and asking for information, cannot properly be construed as an acknowledgement of a debt due and unpaid by him; and therefore it was error for the trial judge to refer to them as an acknowledgement in his charge.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b187-8\">Such letters are admissible in evidence, however, as part of a series of communications, oral and written, between the parties respecting the plaintiff\u2019s claim.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b187-9\">The plaintiff was permitted to say, in reply to a question upon her redirect examination, that the business of making butter and caring for the chickens and other things was hers (\u201cmine \u201d). <em>Held </em>that this was not objectionable as calling for a conclusion; that the fact lay peculiarly within the knowledge of the witness, and the question was properly admitted.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b187-10\">Submitted on briefs October 28th, 1921</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Arn\">decided January 5th, 1922.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Action to recover for services rendered in making butter and caring for milk on the defendant\u2019s farm, brought to the Superior Court in Fairfield County and tried to the jury before <em>Keeler, </em>verdict for the plaintiff for $1,905, which the court refused to set aside, and from the judgment thereon the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"Arm0\">\n<em>Error, judgment set aside and cause remanded for a new trial.</em>\n</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-6\">The plaintiff was the wife of Clearmont Potts, and they were married in 1869. The defendant owned a large farm at Southport, and in 1905 engaged Potts to manage this farm for definite compensation, and Potts continued to manage the farm until about July, 1920, residing on the farm with his wife. At first there was but one cow on the farm, but the number was steadily increased, and the plaintiff made butter and turned over the proceeds to the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-7\">. It was the claim of the plaintiff that \u201cin 1910 the number of cows had so increased, and the labor in making the butter had become so burdensome, that the plaintiff notified the defendant that she would be no longer responsible for the same, and the defendant promised to pay her for her services, telling her to wait, that good things come slow but she would be fully paid; \u201d and she claimed that under such an arrangement she made and sold butter and cared for the milk from January 1st, 1910, to and including July, 1920, ten years and seven months, and that her services were worth $15 per month, no part of which had been paid. She further claimed that this work was performed by her as a separate and independent business not connected with or proceeding from any business controlled by her- husband.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-8\">The defendant denied that any such agreement had ever been made between them, and claimed that the milk and butter were products of the farm, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>whatever the plaintiff did was part of the services usually rendered by a farmer\u2019s wife and in connection with other farm work to be done by the husband, and that this work was not plaintiff\u2019s separate and independent business. The defendant, in addition to a general denial, pleaded payment by the use of butter and milk, and also pleaded the statute of limitations as to all services rendered prior to August 1st, 1914. The plaintiff replied by a denial of payment and a new promise. These defenses were all in issue upon the trial. The jury rendered a verdict for the plaintiff covering the entire period. Other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b189-6\"><em>William B. Boardman </em>and <em>Jonathan Grout, </em>for the appellant (defendant).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b189-7\"><em>Henry E. Shannon </em>and <em>Frank L. Wilder, </em>for the appellee (plaintiff).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b189-8\">Gager, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1D\">Error is assigned on the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict as against the law and the evidence and the weight of evidence. The record shows that there was a substantial conflict of evidence, and that it was such that the jury might have reasonably and fairly found the issues for the plaintiff. In such case the court could not under our settled rule have granted the motion, and there was no error in the denial complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">Three errors are claimed in the charge: The plaintiff requested the court to charge that \u201cone who assents or acquiesces in the rendition of beneficial services for him by another, is hable to pay what they are reasonably worth.\u201d The court so charged, with the following comment: \u201cBut in order to apply this principle, it is necessary that the plaintiff should show that the services were not included in any arrangement or bargain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>between other parties. I say it is necessary that the plaintiff should show it, \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether the burden is on the plaintiff, but it is necessary that it should appear at the end of the case.\u201d This comment was undoubtedly made in view of the defendant\u2019s claim that plaintiff\u2019s services were rendered as wife of the farmer and not by virtue of any separate arrangement, or as a separate business of hers. What the defendant objects to, conceding the correctness of the general proposition, is that the court, after saying \u201cI say it is necessary that the plaintiff should show it,\u201d interpolated the comment: \u201cI don\u2019t know whether the burden is on the plaintiff, but it is necessary that it should appear at the end of the case.\u201d The court, at the beginning and end of the charge, had correctly stated the rule as to the burden of proof. The defendant complains that here is an incorrect instruction as to this point as to proof of separate business, which was confusing and misleading, and that under the circumstances the court committed a reversible error in saying it did not know whether the burden was on the plaintiff; that the clear effect of this was to counteract the rest of the charge as to burden of proof. The language might very naturally be construed by the jury as a weakening in this particular of the requirement, elsewhere stated, as to a fair preponderance of the evidence. The particular referred to was a vital point, and we cannot say that the distinction apparently drawn, though probably inadvertent, may not have prejudiced the defendant\u2019s defense in this particular, and therefore the charge on this point was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">The court, also referring to the same point as to when the services were rendered, said: \u201cBut if you find, gentlemen, that these services all came in naturally and properly and in a normal way with the bargain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>that was made with the husband, then it would be understood that they were rendered gratuitously or under circumstances which imply the gratuitous rendition of the services.\u201d The defendant claims that the use of the word \u201cgratuitously \u201d was misleading and prejudicial as, in substance, stating that if the plaintiff\u2019s services came naturally, that is, were the incidental services to be expected of the wife of the farmer, then they were rendered gratuitously, whereas, if rendered under husband\u2019s contract as farmer, they were paid for through him, and the jury would be reluctant to find plaintiff\u2019s services were given free. We do not think there is any merit in this claim. Gratuitously, as here used, clearly means without right or well-founded expectation of compensation other than as incorporated in the farm services paid for under the defendant\u2019s contract with the farmer. There was no error in this clause of the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The court had correctly charged as to the effect of acknowledging that a debt was due and unpaid as taking a case out of the statute of limitations, and then continued: \u201cIn considering this point you are to bear in mind, if you bring it into connection with the acknowledgement of the letter, as indicating whether or not there is any promise at all in the letter \u2014 not as taking refuge in the statute of limitations and insisting upon its protection, but as bearing upon the question whether there was any promise at all contained in the letter \u2014 whether or not the fact that the defendant spoke of its not having been presented before does not carry the idea that thereby any promise to pay which otherwise might be inferred from the language, was expressly disaffirmed.\u201d The plaintiff had introduced in evidence three letters from the defendant. The defendant complains that the court erred in construing and declaring the letter or letters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>as an acknowledgment of the debt. No one of the three letters is an acknowledgment of a debt due and unpaid, and it was manifest error so to construe them to the jury. In the letter of July 3d, the defendant wrote as follows: \u201cI was surprised to read in your note of June 29th that the report about a legal suit by you against me was news to you. It should not have been, as it was so reported or intimated by some member of your family. I wish to say that a member of your family has reported to me that you were planning to leave the farm. You intimate in your note that I am your debtor. If so, will you please send me an itemized bill showing the amount I owe. Why has not the claim been presented or referred to before now.\u201d In a letter of July 13th, this: \u201cYour letter of the 12th July at hand this morning and I am sending this to ask that you send me an itemized statement showing the amount of your claim. After all these years it seems strange that you should bring this matter up at this time. Why have you not called my attention to it long ago.\u201d And on July 17th, this: \u201cAs yet you have not as requested rendered me a statement as to the amount of your claim against me. Will you please do so as soon as you can, and oblige.\u201d The utmost that can be claimed for this language is that plaintiff had been making some claim; that the defendant was surprised and wanted information. This is far from acknowledging any debt as due and unpaid, and it was error to so characterize these letters, or any one of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Objection was made as to the three letters above referred to as immaterial and irrelevant. They were admitted as purporting to show that the defendant knew the plaintiff had a claim, and to sustain some statement the plaintiff had previously made, in court. Though the letters were not capable of being construed as an acknowledgment, as the court construed them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>in the part of the charge referred to above, we cannot see why the letters were not admissible as part of the negotiations between the parties about the plaintiff\u2019s claim and were clearly relevant to the question in issue. That an improper use was made of them does not affect their relevancy as part of the series of communications, oral and written, from the whole of which the question of new promise must be determined, and there was no error in admitting them.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The plaintiff had testified fully as to her conversations with the defendant, and as to the work done by her, and the payment by her of the proceeds of the butter and milk to the defendant, both on direct and cross-examination. Upon redirect she was asked: \u201cThis business of making the butter and the care of the chickens and the other things that you did around there yourself, whose business was that? \u201d To which the witness answered \u201cMine.\u201d This was objected to as calling for a conclusion and not the facts from which the jury might draw a conclusion, but the court admitted the question over the objection. Ownership of personal property is ordinarily a question of fact to which a witness may testify; <em>Mathews </em>v. Livingston, 86 Conn. 263, 273, 85 Atl. 529, and cases there cited; and this is so even though the ownership is the very matter in controversy. <em>DeWolf </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>69 N. Y. 621; 22 Corpus Juris, p. 534; <em>Pichler </em>v. <em>Reese, </em>171 N. Y. 577, 64 N. E. 441. See also <em>Jantzen </em>v. <em>Emanuel German Baptist Church, </em>27 Okla. 473, 112 Pac. 1127; Amer. Anno. Cas. 1912C, 659 to, and note on, p. 664. The question called for a fact peculiarly within the knowledge of the witness arid was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">There was error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b193-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
