No error on defendant's bill of exceptions.</em>\n</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s testimony, which the jury accepted, was substantially as follows: He was not a real-estate agent, but a jewelry salesman and an intimate companion of the defendant. The property in question had been rented as a saloon, and in 1919 one Joslin, of the firm of Joslin and Allen, made some inquiry about the premises, and the plaintiff suggested that the firm of Joslin and Allen should buy the property. Joslin said they were ready to offer $50,000 for the premises, and that perhaps the plaintiff, because of his personal relations to the defendant, might be able to bring the firm of Joslin and Allen and the defendant together on a sale. In the attempt to do so the plaintiff asked defendant whether the property was for sale, and stated that he had a customer who would offer $50,000 for it. The defendant declined to sell at that price, and further stated that he desired to give the present tenant, Murphy, the preference. Plaintiff\u2019s testimony as to what was then said runs as follows: \u201cI said, \u2018Get me right, Mr. Hart, I don\u2019t want to interfere with this building if Mr. Murphy wants it.\u2019 I said, \u2018It is simply that I am only interested for what is in it, for the sale of it.\u2019 He says, \u2018I am going to talk it over with Mr. Murphy, anyway.\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, if Mr. Murphy does not want the property will you put a price on it?\u2019 He said, \u2018Why, yes, Andy, I will.\u2019 So as I started to leave him he called me back. He said, \u2018Andy, who wants this property?\u2019 I said, \u2018Mr. Hart, if it would not interfere with the sale of this property any way why I would just as soon tell you. I am only interested in the commission, that is all, I am only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>interested in the commission that is in it.\u2019 He said, \u2018It won\u2019t, if I sell it to your customer I will pay you the commission.\u2019 I says, \u2018All right, it is Joslin and Allen.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-6\">Within a few days the property was sold by defendant to Joslin and Allen, through a real-estate broker, for $25,000 in cash and a purchase-money mortgage of $50,000, without any further notice to or action by the plaintiff, except that he reported back to Joslin and Allen that defendant would not sell for $50,000 and that he intended to give Murphy the preference, and if Murphy did not want it the defendant was going to put a price on it.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b506-7\"><em>William E. Thoms, </em>for the appellant (plaintiff).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b506-8\"><em>Terrence F. Carmody </em>and <em>Maurice T. Healey, Jr., </em>for the appellee (defendant).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b506-9\">Beach, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Avu\">On the plaintiff\u2019s appeal the question is whether the trial judge, who observed the witnesses and the jury, erred in setting the verdict aside, and ordinarily that would depend upon whether the jury might reasonably, upon the evidence, have reached the conclusion which it did. In the present case, however, it appears that the action of the trial judge was not based upon his observation of the witnesses, but for the specific reason, as stated in his memorandum of decision, that the plaintiff was not the procuring cause of the sale. That is true, and if the contract of employment had been in the usual form, the action of the trial judge in setting aside the verdict on that ground would have been entirely correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">The debatable question in the case is created by the plaintiff\u2019s testimony above quoted. In view of the personal relations between the plaintiff and the defendant, there was nothing inherently incredible in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s story, and the jury might reasonably have believed, as they did believe, the plaintiff\u2019s version of the conversation, though it was contradicted and not corroborated. Assuming the plaintiff\u2019s testimony to be true, what is the legal effect of it? The offer which the plaintiff communicated to the defendant was a substantial one and indicated a real desire on the part of his customer to buy the property; and the defendant\u2019s promise to name a price at which he would sell to the plaintiff\u2019s unknown customer, in case Murphy did not want the property, may well be regarded as a conditional acceptance of the plaintiff\u2019s offer to act as a broker, on commission, in attempting to negotiate the sale to that particular customer, at a price to be thereafter named. It turned out that Murphy did not want the property, and so the condition was fulfilled. In addition to that, the defendant\u2019s promise to pay the commission \u201cif I sell it to your customer,\u201d was made in consideration of the disclosure of the customer\u2019s name, and was a promise on good consideration to pay the plaintiff his commission in case the sale to Joslin and Allen was effected without any further assistance from the plaintiff, who had already interested them. The jury must have so regarded it, and we think the court erred in not giving effect to the defendant\u2019s promise to pay the commission in case he sold to the plaintiff\u2019s customer, and in holding that the plaintiff, notwithstanding that promise, was still bound to prove that he was the procuring cause of the final sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The complaint is not as specific as it should be, but the plaintiff\u2019s testimony was admitted without objection, and if there was any variance between the pleading and the proof, a motion to set aside the verdict as against the evidence was not a proper method of attempting to take advantage of such variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Turning now to the defendant\u2019s bill of exceptions to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>the charge. All the exceptions relate, in one form or another, to the supposed failure of the court to specifically charge the jury that in order to entitle the plaintiff to recover he must prove an employment, express or implied, to effect a sale of the property. The court did, however, specifically call the attention of the jury to the allegation in the complaint \u201cthat on or about October 1st, 1919, the defendant employed the plaintiff to sell for him a certain brick block,\u201d etc.; and did charge the jury that the burden rested on the plaintiff to prove the allegations of his complaint. This was enough. The jury must have understood that the plaintiff was bound to prove an employment to sell the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">On the defendant\u2019s bill of exceptions we find nothing erroneous. On the plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the action of the trial court in setting aside the verdict, there is error, and the cause is remanded with directions to enter judgment on the verdict.</p>\n<judges id=\"b508-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred, except Gager, J., who concurred in the result, but died before the opinion was written.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
