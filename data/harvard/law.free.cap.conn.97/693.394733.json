There were some assaults without any finding of substantial injury, and some threats of bodily injury without any finding of even temporary mental suffering caused thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">During the last two years that the parties lived together there are findings of offensive and disgusting conduct, and of insulting and indecent language, on the part of the defendant, including loose charges of adultery. But the record contains no finding as to the effect which this conduct and language had on the plaintiff, except that it has not impaired his health. Nor is it a necessary inference from the finding that the defendant\u2019s conduct and language was \u201cof such a nature as to be intolerable and to render a continuance of the relation by the suffering victim impracticable.\u201d <em>Morehouse </em>v. <em>Morehouse, 70 </em>Conn. 420, 427, 39 Atl. 516; <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>95 Conn. 57, 61, 110 Atl. 455. That is the test of intolerable cruelty which we have adopted. \u201cMere faults of temper and of manner do not constitute such cruelty.\u201d <em>Morehouse </em>v. <em>Morehouse. </em>It is the \u201cunbearable character\u201d of the defendant\u2019s conduct that makes it a ground of divorce. <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>Jacobs. </em>Whether it is or is not unbearable must in each case depend on its effect, physical or mental, or both, upon the victim; and this record is fatally defective for lack of any finding on that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">We repeat, that the findings of specific acts of cruelty are not of such a character as to compel the inference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>of fact that they must have been intolerable to a man of the plaintiff\u2019s age and health. Nor does it appear that the plaintiff is not robust in point of temperament. It is found that the plaintiff twice choked the defendant under more or less provocation, and that the plaintiff and defendant on various occasions cursed and swore at each other, and used obscene language in the presence of each other. These findings do not indicate such a degree of refinement and sensitiveness on the plaintiff\u2019s part as would necessarily unfit him to endure similar outbreaks of temper and manners on the part of the- defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">There is error, and the cause is remanded with direction to set aside the judgment for the plaintiff and to enter judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<judges id=\"b707-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
