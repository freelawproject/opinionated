The facts upon which defendant claimed he was entitled to have the complaint dismissed are similar to those stated in Fisher Malting Co. v. Brown (decided herewith) 87 N. Y. Supp. 37, and it is therefore unnecessary to restate them. In the affidavit of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney used in opposition to the' motion the statement is made that a note of issue was filed on the 22d day of August, 1902, but the fact is not denied that no notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>of trial was served until October, 1903, and until after the motion to dismiss was made. The note of issue filed was ineffectual because the action had not then been noticed for trial. Section 977, Code Civ. Proc. No excuse was given for the delay, except -the bare statement that through \u201cinadvertence\u201d the notice of trial was not sooner served. If the mere statement of \u201cinadvertence\u201d is to be treated as furnishing an adequate excuse for a delay of over three years, then section 822 of the Code of Civil Procedure and rule 36 of the general rules of practice serve little purpose. Such a statement alone furnishes no basis whatever for the exercise of judicial discretion. No excuse for the neglect to prosecute the action was given by plaintiff, and for the reasons stated in the opinion delivered in Fisher Malting Co.-v. Brown, above cited, the motion to dismiss the complaint should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-3\">It follows, therefore, that the order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to dismiss granted, with costs of the action and $10 costs of the motion. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
