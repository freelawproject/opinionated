It appeared from the testimony that the plaintiff was driving a beer wagon northward along the east side of Third avenue; that as he approached iooth street, he saw a car coming southward about ioist street; that he had occasion then to drive across the track to the west side of the street; that he looked again as he started to cross, and saw that the approaching car was about in the middle of the block. Plaintiff thought that he had plenty of time to cross, made the attempt, but the car struck the wagon just back of the front wheel. He was thrown to the pavement, and sustained quite_ severe injuries. The defendant, on the other hand, claimed, and gave\" evidence tending to support the claim, that as the car was approaching the plaintiff, he, without any notice of intention so to do, turned and drove onto the track immediately in front of the south-bound car, and when the car was in such close proximity to him that it was impossible to avert the collision. These several claims were supported by witnesses upon either side, and we have little hesitancy in reaching the conclusion that the evidence was of such a character as justified the submission of the questions involved to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">We are, however, required to reverse the judgment for a fatal error committed in the charge. Upon'the subject of care to be exercised by the motorman in the management and operation of the car the court charged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-8\">\u201cIt was the duty of the defendant\u2019s agents or servants in charge of this car to use reasonable care in going along the street, and it was the duty of the motorman to stop the car, and avoid this collision, provided he had time and opportunity so to do. It was his duty to use care at all times in passing along this street, and if you find that he did use all the care that was required of him, and all the care that he could use at the time, then your verdict will be for the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">The defendant excepted to the charge that it was the duty of the motorman to use all the care that he could use. In ruling upon the exception, the court stated, \u201cThat does not state the language that I used, but it calls my attention to what you mean.\u201d It is evident, therefore, that the court fully understood the particular point to which the defendant directed its attention. The obligation resting upon the defendant was to exercise that degree of care which a person of ordinary prudence exercising reasonable care would use under similar circumstances. The defendant was not called upon to exercise all the care that he could exercise at the particular time. Such rule would impose the duty of extraordinary precaution, and substitute a more rigid rule of responsi- \u2022 bility than the law requires of the defendant in the operation of its cars. In Lewis v. L. I. R. Co., 162 N. Y. 52, 56 N. E. 548, the charge was that, if the engineer of the train, which came in contact with a vehicle at a road crossing, \u201comitted to do' any act which might'have prevented the collision,\u201d the defendant was guilty of negligence. This was held error, for the reason that it imposed a more enlarged obligation upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>the defendant than the law required. In Leonard v. Collins, 70 N. Y. 90, the charge was that, if the defendant could do \u201canything that could have prevented the accident,\u201d he' was guilty of negligence, and such charge was held to be error. In Reardon v. Third Ave. R. Co., 24 App. Div. 163, 48 N. Y. Supp. 1005, in charging upon the subject of the care required in the management of vehicles by each party, the court said: \u201cThey were bound to use the same degree of care, the same degree of prudence. Each was bound to \"look out for, and, if possible, prevent, any accident.\u201d This charge was held to be error calling for the reversal of the judgment which had been obtained in plaintiff\u2019s favor, although the charge as made bore as heavily upon the plaintiff as upon the defendant. Such consideration, however, did not mitigate the wrong which had been done to the defendant, as it enlarged his responsibility for his acts beyond what the law required. These authorities are directly in point upon the question involved, and are decisive in showing that error was committed in the charge. This error was not cured by the subsequent charge of the court that, \u201cif the motorman of the defendant\u2019s car, while operating his car with ordinary care, stopped his car as soon as he discovered that the plaintiff was about to drive in front of his car, defendant is entitled to a verdict.\u201d Such charge would have cured the previous error if it had been, made without qualification. The-court, however, said in answer to this request, \u201cI charge that in connection with the charge already made.\u201d The effect of this was to leave the charge as originally made to stand, and subjected the defendant to the ruling that it was required to exercise all the care that could be used at the time. Such was the rule of liability upon which the case went to the jury, and, as it imposed a higher degree of care upon the defendant than the law imposed, it was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Eor this reason the judgment and order should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
