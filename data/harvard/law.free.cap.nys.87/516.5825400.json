All the meetings of the corporation, however, have been held in the city and county of New York, and Smith has heretofore voted on the stock standing in his name as trustee of the plaintiff in the city of New York. It would, seem that neither the plaintiff nor the defendant Smith could maintain an action against the defendant company, a foreign corporation, in the Supreme Court of this state, as, by section 1780 of the Code of Civil Procedure, an action against a foreign corporation can be maintained by a nonresident of the state only when the action is brought to recover damages for the breach of a contract made within the state or relating to property situated within the state at the time of the making thereof, or where it is brought to recover real property situated within the state or a chattel which is replevied within the state, or where the cause of action arose within the state. The plaintiff, however, has a right to resort to the courts of this state to enforce any cause of action, or to obtain any relief to which he is entitled as against the defendant Smith. The order appealed from provides that the defendant Smith, \u201cboth personally and by agent, representative, or proxy of his, be, and he hereby is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>enjoined and restrained, during the pendency of this action, from voting upon the 103,000 shares of the common and the 4,120 shares of the preferred stock of the defendant corporation in the complaint referred to, or upon any of them, to the exclusion of this .plaintiff, at. any meeting of the shareholders of the defendant corporation; that the said defendant Smith, both personally and by any agent, representative, or proxy of his, be, and he hereby is, restrained and enjoined, during the pendency of this action, from selling, assigning, transferring, pledging, or otherwise disposing of the said shares, or any of them, except only as may be mutually agreed upon by the said de- \u2022 fendant Smith and this plaintiff; and that the defendant corporation be, and it hereby is, enjoined and restrained, during the pendency\u2019 of this action, from accepting or recognizing as valid any vote, offered by the said Smith upon the said shares of stock or any- of them, except only as may be mutually agreed , upon by the said defendant Smith and this plaintiff.\u201d No answer was interposed by either of the defendants, nor does the corporation appear or appeal from the order granting the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">As this court has no\" jurisdiction over the defendant company, a foreign corporation, this injunction, so far as it restrains the corporation, was not justified. We think, however, that a case was made out which justified the court in restraining the defendant Smith, until final judgment, from selling, assigning, or-transferring the said stock standing in his name and in which the plaintiff claims an interest, and from voting upon the stock, against the wishes of the plaintiff, in such a way as to imperil the plaintiff\u2019s' interest if it should be finally determined that he is entitled to an interest in the stock. In the affidavit submitted in opposition to the motion, the defendant Smith claimed that by virtue of the various transactions between himself and the plaintiff he has become the absolute owner of the stock and entitled to undisturbed dominion over it. That question is to be determined upon the \"trial of the action, and the order appealed from maintains the existing situation until the real ownership of the stock can be determined upon the trial. The stock stands in the name of Smith as trustee for the plaintiff. Upon the face of the transaction, it would appear that the plaintiff, as the cestui que trust, would be entitled to have a voice in the disposition of this stock. The defendant is an Arizona corporation, but it is alleged, and not disputed, that all the meetings of the directors and stockholders are held in the city of New York. It is apparent that, if Smith could dispose of this stock pending the trial of the action, a judgment in favor of the plaintiff, if one should be obtained, would be valueless, as a person purchasing the stock from Smith would probably acquire such a title as against the plaintiff as would render it difficult, if not impossible, for the plain-: tiff to follow the stock and impress it with the trust in his favor. As the corporation does not meet in the state of Arizona, and as Smith is not there, or subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of that state, it would be a denial of justice, while entertaining the plaintiff\u2019s application to compel Smith to recognize his interest in the stock, to allow him meantime so to act in relation to the stock as to prevent the plaintiff from obtaining any benefit from the judgment if one should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>obtained. Until the question as to the real ownership of this stock is determined, we think the court below was justified in preserving the existing situation, so that any relief to which the plaintiff may be ultimately shown to be entitled can be awarded him, and the judgment enforced in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">If the corporation had appealed, we should have been required to modify the order appealed from, so far as the corporation is enjoined; but as there is no appeal by the corporation, it does not appear that the provision enjoining it affects Smith, and we would not be justified in modifying the, order, so far as it affects the corporation, on his appeal. It follows that the order appealed from is affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
