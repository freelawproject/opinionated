The building has three stores on the ground floor, and above these stores are apartments. At the rear there are four balconies, running entirely across the building, and on a level with the several floors. From each of\u2019 these balconies there is a single stairway leading to the balcony above, and these stairways were used by the tenants of the several apartments i\u00f1 reaching a common cellar and yard. The plaintiff\u2019s theory, and the one which must have been accepted by the jury, was that these several balconies, which were not partitioned, and the single stairway leading to them, and thence to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>yard and basement, were retained in the custody and control of the defendant for the common use of all of the tenants, and that the defendant therefore owed the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, who was one of such tenants, the duty of ordinary care in the construction, care, and maintenance of such balconies. The defendant, on the other hand, insists that only the balconies in the immediate rear of the several apartments, or at- least in the case of the store in the rear of which the accident occurred, belonged to the tenant, and that, as the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was injured through the falling of the railing in the rear of one Friedman\u2019s store, the defendant owed her no duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">We think the facts and circumstances, in connection with the evidence of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, are sufficient to support the view taken by the jury, and that the defendant did oyre the plaintiff\u2019s intestate the duty of exercising ordinary care in making the balcony in the rear of Friedman\u2019s store reasonably safe for the purpose for which it was intended. Certainly, if there was need of the railing in the first instance, the defendant owed it to the common tenants of the building to see that it was maintained in a reasonably safe condition, or at least to exercise a reasonable degree of care to this end.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The evidence shows that on the 2d day of January, 1903, at about 10:30 a. m., Mrs. Clarke, plaintiff\u2019s intestate\", who lived-with her husband and children upon the second floor of this building, immediately over the store of Mr. Friedman, came down the common stairway to the balcony in the rear of the Friedman store; that she passed along this balcony to near the end of the building, where she leaned over the railing with her hand upon the same, for the purpose of calling to her children, who were in the yard below, and who were quarreling at the time. While in this attitude, the railing fell, and the woman was precipitated to the ground, seven feet below, receiving injuries which resulted in her death soon afterward. While there was some'conflict of evidence, there was enough before the jury for them to find that the railing was rotted to a degree which could hardly have escaped detection if any reasonable effort had been made to determine the safety of this balcony railing. One witness testified that it was so decayed at the point where it joined the upright post that it crumbled in his fingers when he took hold of the wood, and there was no dispute that it was in such a condition that it would not hold nails, and that the nails which had been used were rusted and rotten. There was evidence that this condition had been covered up by the use of paint, and the danger, if it may be presumed to have been known to the intestate, was not of that obvious character which would demand a finding of contributory negligence, although it might warrant the jury in finding that it was such a defect as would be discovered by reasonable inspection on the.part of one owing the duty of reasonable care in maintaining such a railing. The railing being there for the obvious purpose of protecting those who were lawfully using the balconies, plaintiff\u2019s intestate had a right to assume that they were reasonably adapted to that purpose, and whether she was in the exercise of a reasonable degree of care in leaning over this railing without taking the pains to make an examination was clearly a question for the jury. The danger is not shown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>to have been known to her. It is insisted on the part of the defendant that it was not obvious, and' it was therefore for the jury to say whether the leaning upon the railing for the purpose of looking into the yard or under the veranda was within the scope of that reasonable care which the plaintiff\u2019s intestate owed to the defendant in the use of this balcony, as a condition of the plaintiff\u2019s recovery. In other words, the defendant was maintaining a railing around this balcony, and the question presented to the jury was whether the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, in approaching the railing and leaning upon it as she did (she being a woman of about no pounds weight), exercised that degree of care which the obvious circumstances demanded\u2014whether she had a right to rely upon the safety of the structure to the extent that she obviously did in leaning out over it. The jury has found that she was exercising that reasonable degree of care, and, in the light of common experience as to what men and women do under similar circumstances, and what they might fairly be expected to do, we see no reason for holding that the jury is not justified in its verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The judgment and order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
