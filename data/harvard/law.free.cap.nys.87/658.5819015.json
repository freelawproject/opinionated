He is dishonest, and he will do you if he can\u2019\u2014thereby charging and intending to charge this plaintiff with being dishonest in business transactions, and with having the intent of defrauding the persons with whom plaintiff should do business. That the said words were wholly false and untrue.

The oral accusation of dishonesty set out in the fifth cause of action is not slanderous per se, and no action will lie for the utterance of such a charge by word of mouth unless it relates to the plaintiff in a special character, or occasions special damage. See definition of \u201cslanderous words,\u201d per Andrews, J., in Moore v. Francis, 121 N. Y. 199, 203, 23 N. E. 1127, 8 L. R. A. 214, 18 Am. St. Rep. 810. There is no allegation that the words in question were spoken of the plaintiff in reference to any occupation or business, nor is there any averment that he had any occupation or was engaged in any business. These omissions are fatal to the statement of the cause oil action. \u201cIt is not enough that the words may tend to injure him in his office or calling, unless they are spoken of him in his official or business character;\u201d and this must be supported in the complaint. Van Tassel v. Capron, 1 Denio, 250, 252, 43 Am. Dec. 667. \u201cAny charge of dishonesty against an individual in connection with his business, whereby his character in such business may be injuriously affected, is actionable. If spoken of him individually, and not in connection with his office or business, these words will not be actionable.\u201d Fowles v. Bowen, 30 N. Y. 20, 24. So, also, it is necessary that the complaint, where the cause of action is of this character, shall show that the plaintiff at the time of the alleged slander was engaged in the office or business which he claims was injuriously affected by the utterance of the defamatory words. \u201cWhere an action is brought for words (not actionable in themselves), spoken of a person in a particular calling, or profession, or employment, it must appear that he followed such profession or employment when the words were spoken.\u201d Forward v. Adams, 7 Wend. 204, 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">As to the sixth cause of action, it seems to me clear that the defamatory words therein alleged to have been spoken by the defendant concerning the plaintiff cannot, in any view, be regarded as actionable per se; and there is no averment that they were uttered in reference to the plaintiff\u2019s calling, or that they affected him in his business character.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">I think the demurrer should have been sustained as to both causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-11\">Interlocutory judgment reversed, and demurrer sustained, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
