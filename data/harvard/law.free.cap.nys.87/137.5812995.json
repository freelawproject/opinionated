With respect to the ground of cruel and inhuman treatment, no act of violence is alleged or complained of. The only thing asserted against the defendant is that he has charged his wife at various times, and in the hearing of their infant child and of various other persons, with being unfaithful to him, which he qualifiedly admits by stating that such remarks were not made in the sense that she committed adultery, but that her conversation and consortation with other men was such as to compromise both herself and himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">It has been held that the conduct of a husband impugning the chastity of his wife, especially in the presence of their children, shows \u201csuch an utter disregard of all the ordinary feelings and sentiments which should govern the conduct of a husband towards his wife that it was cruel and inhuman treatment in itself, which made it improper for her to live with a man who had proclaimed her\u201d to be a wanton, \u201cwith no evidence whatever to sustain such charges.\u201d Lutz v. Lutz (Sup.) 9 N. Y. Supp. 859. And in Straus v. Straus, 67 Hun, 492, 22 N. Y. Supp. 567, it is said that where a husband cruelly traduces the character of his wife the court can properly protect her by a judgment of separation. So it may be that this action can be maintained on the first ground upon which the separation is sought, but that does not necessarily entitle the plaintiff to the order for alimony and counsel fees which was made in this case. It is provided in that order that not only counsel fees shall be paid to the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys, but the provision for alimony is made conditional upon the plaintiff\u2019s election to quit the residence of her husband; and thus the court has left it to her discretion to say whether she will continue to live with her husband during the pendency of the suit or not, and has given her a right of selection, or, in other words, to determine her own case in that regard; to stay with him if she chooses, or to leave him if she prefers to do so. It is apparent that she is now living with him or at his house, being provided for and supported by him; and according to his affidavit, which is not contradicted, within the limit of his means the provision he makes for her is liberal, and he appears to be a man of ample means. It is not shown that occasion exists for her living elsewhere than in his house, or for having any other provision made for her support than such as is already made. That much of the order, therefore, must be reversed; but, as a separation may be adjudged (doubtful as that appears to be on these papers), I think the order for counsel fee may be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Therefore the order appealed from should be modified by allowing counsel fees, and striking out so much of it as provides for the payment of alimony pendente lite to the plaintiff. No costs to either party of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">O\u2019BRIEN and LAUGHLIN, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">McLAUGHLIN, J. I dissent. Upon the facts set out in this record, I do not think the court should have allowed counsel fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">VAN BRUNT, P. J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
