The plaintiff served a bill of particulars wherein he claimed for compensatory damages $150, punitive damages $75, damages to the cellar door and for the repair of the same $25. The learned Municipal Court justice charged the jury that, if they believed the servants of the defendant \u201cbroke in,\u201d they might award \u201cany sum of damages you believe proper, up to the limit of $250.\u201d The jury returned a verdict of $150. The defendant moved for a new trial under section 254 of the Municipal Court act (Laws 1902, p. 1563, c. 580), and excepted to the denial of that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-18\">I cannot say that the damages are excessive. It is true that the counsel for the appellant states in his points, \u201cAs to the actual damages to the lock and doors, they were merely nominal,\u201d and it is not contended that there was any other injury to the,property of the plaintiff. It is also true that the jury, upon the evidence, could not award punitory damages against this defendant; for there was no proof that it had authorized or ratified its servants\u2019 acts, or that this act of the servants was done after the unfitness of the servants was known to the defendant. Muckle v. Rochester Railway Co., 79 Hun, 32, 38, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>29 N. Y. Supp. 732; Cleghorn v. N. Y. Cen. &amp; H. River R. R. Co., 56 N. Y. 44, 15 Am. Rep. 375. But there remains the question of compensatory damages. Compensatory damages embrace the determination of the extent of the injury, insult, invasion of the privacy, and interference with the comfort of the plaintiff and his family. Woodruff, J., in Ives v. Humphreys, 1 E. D. Smith, 196. Under the circumstances, it strikes me that $150, found by the jury by way of compensation, cannot be said by an appellate court to be excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-3\">The point is made that the defendant is not liable. It is liable if the servants\u2019 acts were commanded or authorized by it. And it is held that \u201cthe authority may be express or implied, and that a previous command may be proved, either by direct evidence or by any legal evidence which will satisfy the jury.\u201d Welsh v. Cochran, 63 N. Y. 181, 184, 20 Am. Rep. 519. There is in evidence an order from the defendant to its servants that they should collect $5.40 or remove the meter, and a return thereon that it had been removed. This was produced by the defendant on the trial, and therefore, presumably, it had been returned to it by its servants. Even though the master had given no explicit directions to break open the door in order to make the removal, a master may be held liable for the acts of a servant within the general scope of his employment, while about his master\u2019s business, even though the act be \u201cnegligent, wanton, or willful.\u201d Grimes v. Young, 51 App. Div. 239, 64 N. Y. Supp. 859, per Willard Bartlett, J., citing Mott v. Consumers\u2019 Ice Co., 73 N. Y. 543; Ochsenbein v. Shapley, 85 N. Y. 214; Burns v. Glens Falls R. R. Co., 4 App. Div. 426, 38 N. Y. Supp. 856; Higgins v. Watervliet Turnpike Co., 46 N. Y. 23, 7 Am. Rep. 293; Meehan v. Morewood, 52 Hun, 566, 5 N. Y. Supp. 710, affirmed 126 N. Y. 667, 27 N. E. 854. Conceding that the transportation corporation law (section 68, c. 566, p. 1149, Laws 1890) gave to the defendant the right of entry, yet the abuse thereof by breaking open the door constituted it a'trespasser ab initio. The Six Carpenters\u2019 Case, 8 Co. 146a; Adams v. Rivers, 11 Barb. 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
