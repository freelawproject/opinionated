The plaintiff testified that on the 4th day of November, 1900, at about half past 6 in the evening, he was a passenger on an east-bound car of the defendant\u2019s railroad on 125th street; that when the car was between Lenox and Fifth avenues he told the conductor to stop at Fifth avenue; that as the car approached the corner he left his seat to get off; that the car stopped at the corner on the westerly side of Fifth avenue as he got on the platform and started to leave the car, and that as he was getting off the car started with a jerk, broke his hold on the cross-bar, and threw him off, inflicting painful injuries. The plaintiff was corroborated by a police officer, who testified that he saw the accident, and at the time the plaintiff attempted to get off the car was standing perfectly still, and, as he was getting off, the car started suddenly and threw him. For the \"defendant the conductor testified that the plaintiff asked him to stop the car at Fifth avenue, and that, as was customary, he stopped on the west crossing, and, after having again started up the car, it was moving very slowly, when the plaintiff asked him to stop; and he said all right, he would stop on the other side, and requested him not to step off until they came to a full stop, but he took no notice; that \u201che had a cane in his hand. He stepped off holding the cane in his right hand, and held on the hand rail with his left, and in doing so the cane tripped him.\u201d Another witness called by the defendant testified that he was standing on the rear of the car, and that after the car stopped on the west side of Fifth avenue it started up again on the signal of the conductor, and was moving slowly across Fifth avenue, when the plaintiff got up from his seat in the car. \u201cI saw him get on the step with the left hand on the stanchion and the right foot extending over the step. He had a cane in the left hand, and he had hold of the rail. * * * He stepped off somehow or other. I believe the cane tripped him.\u201d Another witness testified that he was also on the rear platform,' and the car was going over slowly when Mr. Fox started to get off. \u201cHe used his cane as a support, and had his left hand on the railing on the box of the car. When the conductor saw him going off he told him to wait until he got to the other side of the street, and he didn\u2019t pay any attention to him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b787-12\">With respect to the two versions, therefore, as to the cause of the accident, there was a clean-cut question of fact, and, whether we regard the number of witnesses or the credibility to be attached to their testimony, as weighed in the light pf whether they were or were not disinterested, it cannot be said that the verdict rendered in favor of the defendant was so clearly against the weight of evidence that the learned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>trial judge on this ground would have been justified in setting it aside. Nor do we understand that this was his reason, because this court can examine into the opinion of the trial judge to ascertain the grounds upon which the decision was made. Bryant v. Allen, 54 App. Div. 500, 67 N. Y. Supp. 89; Crossman v. Wyckoff, 64 App. Div. 554, 72 N. Y. Supp. 337. From the opinion of the trial judge it appears that the ver'dict was set aside because of the admission in evidence of the statement of a Dr. Cook, which the trial judge regarded not only as harmful, but as incompetent. We have no reason to differ with this view of the evidence, but, regarded-as harmful1 and incompetent, it remains to determine whether, in view of the manner in which such evidence was treated by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, the exception taken to its admission was available upon the motion to set aside the verdict. The conductor, on cross-examination, testified that he heard a conversation between the plaintiff and a Dr. Cook in reference to the accident, and was then asked: \u201cYou may state the conversation that you heard between Dr. Cook and the plaintiff with reference to the happening of this accident,\u201d whereupon the plaintiff\u2019s counsel said: \u201cI object to it as far as it involves any statement on the part of Dr. Cook. I do not object to his \u201d stating what Mr. Fox said.\u201d An extended colloquy then followed between the court and counsel, and the witness answered, in response to\u00b0 the court\u2019s inquiry, \u201cMr. Fox said nothing on that occasion when Dr. Cook spoke.\u201d Finally the question was asked: \u201cYou may state what conversation, you. heard between Dr. Cook and Mr. Fox in reference'to this accident.\u201d This was objected to as incompetent, and the objection was overruled, and an exception taken. The witness then answered in part as follows: \u201cThis gentleman standing on the sidewalk, looking at the whole affair, said, when asked for his name by Mr. Fox: T refuse to give you my name. It is your own fault. You had no right to step off the car when it was in motion.\u2019 1 Then he said, \u2018You must be one of their shoo-flys or inspectors.\u2019 \u201d After this testimony had been received the court said to plaintiff\u2019s counsel: \u201cIf you want me'to declare this a mistrial, I will, on account of what has been brought out about Dr. Cook\u2019s statement. * * * I leave it to you.\u201d And the plaintiff\u2019s counsel answered, \u201cNo, I would rather have the record stay as it is.\u201d Again, after the defendant had rested, and the plaintiff was giving rebuttal testimony, the court said, \u201cI am going to strike out the evidence of what Dr. Cook said,\u201d and the plaintiff\u2019s counsel stated, \u201cIt is already before the jury, and I submit that I should be allowed to rebut it,\u201d and the court replied, \u201cIf you do not want me to strike it out, very well.\u201d The court, it thus appears, was desirous of protecting fully the plaintiff\u2019s rights, and, as testimony had inadvertently been admitted which the judge regarded as incompetent, he offered to the plaintiff the only remedies that could be offered, namely, \u25a0to strike out the testimony, or, if the plaintiff wished, to declare a mistrial, and thus enable him to go before another jury. Obviously, after, these two offers were made by the court and declined by counsel, the exceptions taken to the rulings of the court were valueless. Having taken the chances of a favorable verdict, and been disappointed, the plaintiff could not, since lie had, in effect, waived the exceptions by rejecting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>the court\u2019s offers, subsequently, upon the ground that the rulings _ to which such exceptions were taken were erroneous, move to set aside the verdict. We think it will be conceded that upon a trial, though a court may commit an error in a ruling, it is entirely competent to cure that error by striking out the testimony\u2014if that is sufficient to remedy the harm done\u2014or by permitting the party against whom the ruling is made to have a new trial. In other words, there is for the trial judge a locus poenitentise, or a right, when the court thinks proper to change its ruling, to call attention to it, as was done by the learned trial judge, and offer to remove any harm or prejudice which the party may have suffered by reason of the ruling. If, upon such option being given to counsel, he sees fit to reject it, and proposes to speculate on the verdict of the jury, he cannot, if disappointed at the o\u00fatcome, then have a new trial. The cases are uniform in holding, that counsel upon the trial can waive the right which he has secured by a proper exception, and that, when once waived, it is gone forever, and hence is not thereafter available upon a motion for a new-trial or to set aside a verdict. Foster v. Tenenbaum, 2 App. Div. 168, 37 N. Y. Supp. 722; Brady v. Nally, 151 N. Y. 258, 45 N. E. 547; Brown v. Mayor, 11 Hun, 23; Ward v. Craig, 87 N. Y. 550; Hopkins v. Clark, 158 N. Y. 299, 53 N. E. 27; Neil v. Thorn, 88 N. Y. 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">We have not overlooked the fact that the learned trial judge in his opinion states that he sets aside the verdict not alone because of the testimony of the conductor as to what Dr. Cook said, but also as a matter of discretion. We concur, however, with the statement in the respondent\u2019s brief that such discretion \u201ccan refer only to the weight of the evidence.\u201d To the subject of the weight of evidence we have already referred, our conclusion being that on this ground the verdict could not properly be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">It follows, therefore, that the order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the verdict reinstated. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
