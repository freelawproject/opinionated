The plaintiff was permitted to amend his complaint, and an adjournment was granted to allow the plaintiff to discover the evidence necessary to support this new allegation. The plaintiff thereupon made application, under the provisions of sections 870, 871, and 872 of the Code of Civil Procedure, for an order directing Abraham M. Morgenroth, Ernest E. W. Schneider, and Henry Herter to submit to an examination before trial; the affidavit of the plaintiff alleging that the testimony of th\u00e9se three men was \u201cmaterial and indispensable to this plaintiff, to enable him to prove the allegation above mentioned,\u201d and that \u201cthe information sought by the plaintiff is peculiarly and entirely within the knowledge of the persons above named, and is not known to the plaintiff,\u201d and \u201cthat it is impossible for the plaintiff in any other way to prove what amounts, if any, were due or to become due at the time.of filing said lien.\u201d The order asked for was granted, and, a motion to vacate the same being made upon the papers, the order was vacated as to Schneider and Herter, who were not parties to the action, but was sustained as to Mr. Morgenroth. It thus appears by the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit that he will be able to prove his case, if he in fact has a case, by the testimony of Schneider and Herter; that the evidence \u201cis peculiarly and entirely within the knowledge of the persons above named,\u201d and the only purpose of this examination appears to be to compel the defendant Morgenroth to disclose to the plaintiff whether or not he has a cause of action. Indeed, plaintiff\u2019s counsel, in support of the order, admits that the object of the examination is a mere fishing expedition, for he says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-10\">\u201cIf the testimony of this defendant should be adverse to plaintiff, then plaintiff should know it in time to hunt up other witnesses and to procure all the evidence of every kind obtainable on the question.\u201d '</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>In Sheehan v. The Albany &amp; B. Turnpike Co. (Sup.) 8 N. Y. Supp. 14, it was said that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-5\">\u201cThe provisions for such examination are not intended to enable a party to discover what his opponent\u2019s testimony will be, so that he may obtain witnesses to contradict it Experience shows that if a party discovers what his opponent\u2019s testimony will be, and has time enough, he is often successful in discovering also witnesses for contradiction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">This court has held that it was not proper, either before or after the commencement of an action, to permit an examination for the purpose of enabling the other party to determine whether he had a cause of action. Matter of Anthony &amp; Co., 42 App. Div. 66, 68, 58 N. Y. Supp. 907; Long Island Bottlers v. Bottling Brewers, 65 App. Div. 459, 72 N. Y. Supp. 976.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">We are clearly of opinion that the plaintiff has not shown a proper case for the examination of a party before trial. \u201cThe practice of examining a party before trial at the instance of the opposite party should be carefully guarded by the court, so that it may not be productive of evil. When it is evident that the party asking for the examination is sufficiently acquainted with the facts of the case to obtain the proof which he needs, and that in fact he desires the examination only to discover to \"what his opponent will testify, then the order should not be granted, or, if it has been granted, should be set aside.\u201d Sheehan v. The Albany &amp; B. Turnpike Co., supra. Two of the witnesses which the plaintiff says are essential to his cause of action are not parties to the suit, and no reason appears why they may not be witnesses upon the trial. We are of opinion that this is not a proper case for the granting of an order compelling the defendant to submit to an examination. The order appealed from should be reversed, and the order directing the examination should be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
