The description of this property in the schedule is as follows: \u201c(1) Item A, $6,000 on Gold and Sterling Silverware, Watches, Jewelry, Wearing Apparel, Furs, Laces, Rugs,\u201d etc., with the following proviso: \u201cThe liability of the corporation to the assured for the loss on jewelry. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>and precious stones, shall not exceed, under policies of this corporation, separately or together, the sum of one thousand dollars of the insurance attaching specifically to Item A.\u201d By a special agreement annexed to this policy it was further provided that the company shall not be liable \u201cfor loss in excess of two hundred and fifty dollars on any one article unless otherwise endorsed on this policy.\u201d It was also stated in the submission that on or about the 6th day of February, 1903, and during the time when the said policy was in force, \u201ca certain jeweled scarf pin, the property of the plaintiff, worth the sum of about five thousand ($5,000) dollars, was taken by burglary, larceny, or theft from the house\u201d specified in the policy, No. 14 East Sixty-Second street, New York City; that the defendant company admits its liability to the plaintiff, under said policy of assurance, in the sum of $250, by reason of the facts stated, but the defendant alleges that it is under no further liability whatsoever; that the plaintiff claims that the defendant company is liable to him under said policy of assurance, by reason of the facts stated, in the sum of $1,000, no part of which has been paid, although demand therefor has been duly made. The plaintiff therefore demands judgment against the defendant in the sum of $1,000, with interest from February 6, 1903. with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-3\">The question thus presented is whether the defendant is liable upon this policy for $250, or $1,000, on account of the loss by the plaintiff of a jeweled scarf pin worth about the sum of $5,000. The defendant had agreed to insure the plaintiff against direct loss by burglary, larceny, or theft to the amount of $6,000 on various articles, including jewelry and precious stones. Then, to limit its liability, it was provided that \u201cthe liability of the corporation to the assured for the loss on jewelry and precious stones, shall not exceed, under policies of this corporation, separately or together, the sum of one thousand dollars of the insurance attaching specifically to Item A.\u201d Whether the words \u201cseparately or together\u201d applied to \u201cjewelry and precious stones,\u201d or \u201cunder policies of this corporation,\u201d is not entirely clear. The corporation had issued but one policy to this plaintiff, but the words of the policy would seem to apply to a case where several policies had been issued. The plaintiff claims that, by reason of the comma after the word \u201ccorporation,\u201d the grammatical construction of the sentence requires that the words \u201cseparately or together\u201d should apply to a loss on jewelry and precious stones, as if the clause read, \u201cThe liability of this corporation to the assured for the loss on jewelry and precious stones, separately or together, shall not exceed, under policies of this corporation, the sum of one thousand dollars.\u201d Yet, assuming that this was the construction to be given to this clause, the policy would seem to place in a separate class \u201cjewelry and precious stones,\u201d and provide that the liability of the corporation for the loss on jewelry and precious stones, separate or together\u2014that is, whether the precious stones were a part of the jewelry or separate therefrom\u2014 was not to exceed $1,000, and this clause then must be read in connection with the special agreement that the corporation shall not be liable \u201cfor loss in excess of two hundred and fifty dollars on any one article unless otherwise endorsed on this policy.\u201d So, assuming that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>the construction should be that claimed by the plaintiff, it would seem that the policy limits the liability of the corporation to the sum of $250 on any one article of jewelry. There seems to be no construction that can be given to this instrument, if force is to be given to both of these clauses, that would impose a liability upon the defendant in excess of $250.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">It follows that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment for $250 and interest from February 6, 1903, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
