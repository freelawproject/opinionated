If he had no such notice or knowledge, ne could not properly be charged with negligence in starting the car. Fremont v. Met. St. Ry. Co., 83 App. Div. 414, 82 N. Y. Supp. 307. The jury probably inferred such knowledge on his part from the fact, testified to by plaintiff, that after she signaled he rang the bell. There may, however, have been some other reason for that. It is not necessary, however, to consider the question whether the proof was sufficient in this regard, b.ecause the judgment must be reversed for an error in the exclusion of testimony. A physician called to give evidence as to the plaintiff\u2019s injuries testified that he refused to come to court as a witness until he had been paid, and that the plaintiff\u2019s attorney sent him a check, whereupon he attended, and did testify. He stated distinctly that he had received money from, plaintiff\u2019s attorney for coming to court in this case. He was then asked how much he had been so paid, and upon objection the question was excluded. This was clearly error. Green v. Met. St. Ry. Co., 60 App. Div. 317, 70 N. Y. Supp. 123; Zimmer v. Third Ave. R. R. Co., 36 App. Div. 273, 55 N. Y. Supp. 314. It cannot be said that the error was not prejudicial. The verdict was not inconsiderable, and the witness had testified with much emphasis as.to the permanent results of the accident, and the weakening effect upon plaintiff\u2019s arm. It is quite rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>sonable to assume that the verdict was enhanced if the jury gave full credence to the evidence. The error was not cured by the instruction upon the subject given to the jury at the end of the charge. Without knowing how much the witness was paid\u2014and, from the-fact that he was paid by check, it may be inferred that it exceeded the statutory 50 cents\u2014the jury had no means of judging to what extent the fee may have affected his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Judgment reversed and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
