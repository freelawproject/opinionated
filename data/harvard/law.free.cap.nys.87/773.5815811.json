See Pen. Code, \u00a7 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-10\">The defendant went to the jury without offering any evidence whatever. The proof in behalf of the prosecution showed that on July 26, 1902, in a room upstairs in a building at Yonkers occupied by'the defendant as a liquor saloon,- pool selling on the horse races at Brighton Beach was going on; that cards were brought from behind a partition in this room and hung on the wall by a man named Cunningham, which cards bore the names of the horses entered for each race, and were consulted by the persons in the room before they made their bets; that for a period of five minutes the defendant was present in the room, talking with Cunningham, while the latter was engaged in hanging up these cards; and that the defendant exercised control over access to this room, having on Friday, July 25, 1902, refused to allow a police officer to enter it, but saying that the officer could do so on the following Monday, adding: \u201cI am through. Mrs. Engle is going to take the room. I am going to hire the rooms to Mrs. Engle.\u201d This was after the policeman had told Canepi that he heard he was running a poolroom, and Canepi had told him that nothing of the sort was going on. The evidence introduced by the people further showed that a telephone found in the poolroom had been placed there upon the application of the defendant. The telephone contracts, which the defendant signed, contained the following words, under the heading, \u201cMatters for Subscribers\u2019 List\u201d: \u201cCanepi, Joseph, Jr. St. James. 12 Palisade Avenue.\u201d The witness who testified to Canepi\u2019s presence with Cunningham in the poolroom received from the hand of an unseen person, behind a partition therein, a ticket as a voucher for the money which he bet on one of the races, and upon the face of this ticket were printed the words \u201cSt. James Club.\u201d Without a further review of the testimony, I think it sufficient to say, so far as the facts are concerned, that this record clearly establishes the defendant\u2019s complicity in the conduct of pool selling upon the premises under his control.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-12\">Some questions of law are raised which it is necessary to notice. The learned counsel for the defendant likens this case to 'that of People v. Shannon, 87 App. Div. 32, 83 N. Y. Supp. 1061, where we reversed a judgment of conviction upon the same indictment. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>defect in that case, however, was the failure to prove Shannon\u2019s presence on any day when pools were sold, although there was evidence that pools were sold on days when the testimony did not show that he was present. The effort there was to establish Shannon\u2019s active participation in the selling of pools, and we held that the trial court erred in refusing to charge the jury that they must not find him guilty unless they found that he was engaged in pool selling on July 26, 1902. Here Canepi was proved to have been present in the poolroom on that date\u2014one important step in the selling of pools being taken in his presence by the person with whom he was conversing at the time\u2014while the other evidence to which reference has been made shows that he was the protector, if not the principal promoter, of the pool-selling business.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Just before-the jury retired, the following colloquy occurred between counsel and the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-6\">\u201cMr. Young: When your honor read the statute in full, you stated the penalty. I ask your honor to charge the jury that under the statute the crime is punishable by fine or imprisonment. Mr. Hunt: Objected to. The Court: I have read the statute. I read the statute that the defendant might be imprisoned in State\u2019s Prison for not exceeding two years, and that he might be fined for an amount not exceeding two thousand dollars. That means from imprisonment of from one to two years\u2014not from one day up\u2014 or it means a fine of from one cent up to two thousand dollars. It cannot be both. (Exception to defendant.) Mr. Hunt: I ask your honor to charge that your statement\u2014having charged on this subject the fine may be from one cent \u2014is no intimation to the jury that your honor will fine one cent The Court: No; I don\u2019t give any intimation to the jury what I will do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">It is not suggested that the final statement of the learned county judge as to the penalty prescribed by law was incorrect, but it is argued that it was error to give the jury any instruction whatever as to the punishment; the idea apparently being that they may have been influenced to convict by the impression that the district attorney would ask for only a light sentence. This view strikes me as rather fanciful. I can hardly see how this jury can have been misguided by being told simply what were the possible consequences of a conviction at their hands. The case is not at all like People v. Chartoff, 72 App. Div. 555, 75 N. Y. Supp. 1088, where the objection to the instruction on the subject of punishment was that it permitted the jury to assume that different and less stringent rules applied to the conduct of a trial for a misdemeanor than to the conduct of trials for offenses which the law punishes more severely. There was no comparison of the sort here, and I cannot assent to the doctrine that it is legal error to tell a jury what the Legislature has put into the statute book in refer\"ence to the punishment of the very crime of which they are called upon to take cognizance.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">I find no errors in this record affecting the substantial rights of the defendant, and therefore conclude that the judgment should be affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
