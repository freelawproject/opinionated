J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANT\">The plaintiff was injured in the daytime while'standing on the pier of Mallory &amp; Co., East river, in the borough of Manhattan, behind a one-horse truck belonging to Charles Burke, which he, the plaintiff, was assisting Burke in unloading. There was evidence tending to establish that his injuries were occasioned by the backing against his truck of a large double truck belonging to the defendants and in charge of one of their drivers. The collision was of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>such force as to break the shafts of the truck which the plaintiff was unloading, to throw down the horse which was harnessed to that truck, and to crush the plaintiff between the truck and some boxes which were piled up about three feet distant. There was evidence tending to establish, further, that at the time of the collision the horse attached to the plaintiff\u2019s truck was standing still.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">The learned trial justice dismissed the complaint at the close of the case on the ground that there was no evidence of defendants\u2019 negligence which would warrant a submission of the question to the jury, saying to the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, \u201cI think you must show some act on the part of the driver that was reckless or negligent, or wanton or wrong in some way, and I do not see that you have shown any.\u201d There being evidence from which the jury might have reasonably inferred that the plaintiff\u2019s horse was standing quietly at the time, and that the collision was consequently the result of an effort on the part of the defendants\u2019 driver to turn or back his truck upon the dock, it was a question of fact whether that result could not have been accomplished in the exercise of ordinary care, without the violent contact which ensued. No' claim was made that there was not ample room for both trucks, or that the defendants\u2019 driver was prevented in any manner from seeing what he was doing. Indeed, that driver presented hi's version of the occurrence, and, assuming that the event as he described it was not a physical impossibility, it certainly raised a clear issue of fact. The plaintiff\u2019s truck was standing east and west, the horse facing westerly, with the truck backed towards the river or easterly end of the pier. The defendants\u2019 driver drove upon the dock from the shore end, and when he reached the neighborhood of the river end he endeavored to turn his horses for the purpose of backing up alongside of the other truck. He testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b961-6\">\u201cAs X turned around, trying to back to Mr. Burke\u2019s truck, backing up\u2014 As I was turning around I hollered, \u2018Hey, there!\u2019 and the horse backed down, and his truck got into mine and crushed alongside of the dock, and I stopped my horse as quick as I could. * * * While I was backing in, Burke\u2019s truck backed up in my way, and I hollered, \u2018Hey there!\u2019 as I was swinging around trying to back in. His truck hit mine. The two trucks collided. Burke\u2019s truck was standing into the river, and the horses standing to the shore, like. The horse was west and the truck was east, That is, the truck was backed up and the horses swung to one side, right alongside of the dock. Just before the accident my truck was just the same thing. * * * When I was backing up, Mr. Burke\u2019s horse backed up and backed into my truck, and the two trucks come together. I was looking back all the time. Burke\u2019s horse was standing still when I started to back up. Up to that time I hadn\u2019t stopped at all. I was trying to get in. I was swinging in to get in position, and Mr. Burke\u2019s horse backed up.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">It is not very clear how, under the circumstances, the horse attached to the truck which the plaintiff was unloading could have backed that truck against the defendants\u2019 truck, but even if the statement of the witness was such as was calculated, if accepted, to exculpate him from the blame and consequent liability with which he would otherwise be chargeable, his credibility was a matter for the consideration of the jury. That the case should have been submitted to the jury for determination has been often decided in controversies involving somewhat similar conditions. See Murphy v.
