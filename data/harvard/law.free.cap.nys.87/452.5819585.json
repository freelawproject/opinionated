The judgment must, however, be reduced. By her summons, the plaintiff sued for $250. By her bill of particulars, she claimed only $240, of which $40 was claimed for items of damage which could not be recovered in this action, and as to which the justice properly refused to receive evidence. She only claimed $200 for such damages as she could properly recover. The justice, doubtless by inadvertence, awarded her the whole sum of $250, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-14\">The judgment as rendered must be reduced by $50, and, as so reduced, affirmed, without costs in this court to either party. All concur:</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
