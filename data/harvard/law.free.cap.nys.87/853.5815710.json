The purchase price is provided to be $25 per acre of a tract described by metes and bounds, its description concluding in these words: \u201cContaining four hundred and ten acres, more or less.\u201d Upon the trial the plaintiff testified that he had \u201ccomputed the number of acres contained in the metes and bounds contained in this agreement, * * * as well as I could from the data I have.\u201d To the question, \u201cHow much is it?\u201d the defendant entered the general objection that it was incompetent, immaterial, and irrelevant, and the court observed that it might be objectionable \u201con the data which he has,\u201d to which the witness volunteered, \u201cWell, I have.\u201d The plaintiff further testified, in answer to his counsel\u2019s questions, and without exception or further objection by the defendant, that it contained about 420 or 430 acres, that the purchase price of 410 acres at $25 per acre was $10,250, and that the interest on that sum at 4 per cent, per annum for three months was $102.50. It appeared that the defendant had failed to pay six installments of $102.50, that sum being the amount of each installment, based upon the 4 per cent, of the purchase price of 410 acres at $25 per acre. The defendant contends upon this appeal that, inasmuch as the agreement to purchase was at a given amount per acre, it was incumbent upon the plaintiff to show how many acres were actually contained in the piece described, and the purchase price determined thus, that the percentage thereof, which was to be the consideration for the option, might be computed therefrom; and he invokes the doctrine that, where no sum is determined upon for the tract as a whole, but it is to be taken at so much an acre, the quantity of actual acreage on the surface of the ground must be correctly ascertained to fix the consideration to be paid. The rule is plainly applicable to the contract' under consideration. The authorities to sustain the contention are so abundant and so firmly establish the rule that more than a citation of them would serve no useful purpose. Wilson v. Randall, 67 N. Y. 338; Witbeck v. Waine, 16 N. Y. 532; Murdock v. Gilchrist, 52 N. Y. 242; Tarbell v. Bowman, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>103 Mass. 341; Cardinal v. Hadley, 158 Mass. 352, 33 N. E. 575, 35 Am. St. Rep. 492; Paine v. Upton, 87 N. Y. 327, 41 Am. Rep. 371; Gallup v. Bernd, 132 N. Y. 370, 30 N. E. 743. The measure of the defendant\u2019s liability was determined not by the number of paper acres, but by the actual acreage. While the description in the agreement seems to be full and complete it is based upon monuments and fixed bounds. The tract is bounded on one side by the lands of the late Dickerson, and a cardinal point in the description is the Woodville road. Although the lines are stated to be of a given length in feet, a survey might easily reveal that a strict measurement of the length of those lines would not accord with Dickerson\u2019s lands or the road. Hence the actual acreage of the tract might be greater or less than 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">The objection we have referred to is held by the plaintiff insufficient to raise this question because of the absence of an exception, and this is true; but the defendant did except to the overruling of his objection \u2014stated to be on the ground that it is a demand for the payment of $102.50, which sum does not appear to be due\u2014to the admission in evidence of a letter from the plaintiff\u2019s agents to the defendant, demanding that sum as quarterly payment under the terms of the contract, and this exception was taken to a ruling of the learned trial court at variance with the correct principles of law applicable to the matter in issue, and thereby the question discussed is raised for our review. The erroneous theory upon which the judgment in plaintiff\u2019s favor was based requires a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">The record presents additional evidence for the reversal of the judgment. The plaintiff was called as a witness, and asked if he had computed the number of acres contained in the metes and bounds as described in the agreement, and upon his affirmative answer was further asked questions to which he replied that the tract contained something over 400\u2014about 420 or 430\u2014acres. No objection was entered. The plaintiff was sufficiently skilled in mathematics correctly to make the computation from the data of the description of the property appearing in the contract. William S. Jones, the only witness called by the defendant, read the description, and was then asked by defendant\u2019s counsel: \u201cNow, have you made a computation of the quantity\u2014of the number of acres\u2014that would be included in those metes and bounds there mentioned?\u201d The plaintiff objected to the question on the ground that it was incompetent, immaterial, and irrelevant, but not on the ground that the witness was incompetent. It was excluded by the court, and the defendant excepted. Under the view I take of the true interpretation of this contract, by virtue of the authorities cited above, the question would have been incompetent and immaterial had it not been for the fact that the plaintiff himself invited and tendered an issue as to the number of paper acres as distinguished from the number'of acres actually existing on \"the surface of the ground. One of the witnesses thought the number of acres appearing, based upon a computation of the metes and bounds of the contract, was more than 410. , It was surely competent for the defendant to show, if he could, and if such was the fact, that the acreage was less than that amount. It is fair to assume that such would have been the nature of the testimony of the witness Jones had he been allowed to answer. Be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>cause at the initiative of the plaintiff the case was tried upon the theory that the paper acreage should govern, he cannot complain- of evidence on the part of the defendant to show less acreage than he himself claimed. Except for one or two phrases in the description' slightly indefinite, such as \u201csoutherly, about three degrees west,\u201d the problem of the computation was accurately solvable by any careful high-school student who understood the principles of trigonometry and possessed tables in trigonometry. At any rate, plaintiff claimed to have made a calculation, and gave his results, and should not have been allowed to prevent the defendant from attempting to show the contrary of what he had proved. The evidence was offered by the defendant for the purpose of traversing an essential point in plaintiff\u2019s case, and its exclusion constituted reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">Inasmuch as the question is likely to arise upon a retrial, it is proper to state that the defendant\u2019s claim of misdescription of plaintiff\u2019s capacity is, in the light of recent decisions, not well taken. Hoffman House v. Foote, 172 N. Y. 348, 65 N. E. 169; Henricus v. Englert, 137 N. Y. 488, 33 N. E. 550.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">Judgment and order of the County Court reversed, and a new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur; BARTLETT and JENKS, JJ., on last ground stated in the opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
