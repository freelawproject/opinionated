Y. Supp. 400. The ground of irregularity specified in the notice of motion is that the judgment is a final one, and could not properly be entered until all the issues in the case had been determined. The judgment, omitting the recitals, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-7\">\u201cIt is ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the demurrer to said reply be, and the same is hereby, overruled, and the plaintiff have, and he is hereby awarded, judgment dismissing second separate defense alleged in the 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, and 13th paragraphs in said answer of the defendant, and that said plaintiff, Frederick J. Maeder, recover of and from the defendant, Adolph Wexler, the sum of $40.34, the costs and disbursements of the trial of said demurrer and issue of law, and that he (said plaintiff) have execution therefor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">The case of Brassington v. Rohrs, 3 Misc. Rep. 258, 22 N. Y. Supp. 761, decided by the General Term of the late Court of Common Pleas, is directly in point. There the plaintiff demurred to one portion of the answer, and, after obtaining judgment in his favor as to that, moved to strike out the rest of the answer as sham, and so disposed of the whole defense. A judgment on the demurrer was entered, which the defendant moved to set aside. In affirming the order denying such motion, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-9\">\u201cNo irregularity was stated in the order to show cause, but the affidavit complained that a final judgment for costs had been entered, which was claimed to have been irregular. The motion was denied. The judgment, as entered, expressly provides that it is an interlocutory judgment, and not a final one. Had it been a final judgment, it would have provided for the recovery of the demand in the complaint. The objection seems to be that costs were taxed and included in this interlocutory judgment, but this is exactly what the Code allows (section 3232). Adams v. Ward, 60 How. Prac. 288. The interlocutory judgment provides for execution for the collection of the costs. This also is authorized. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 779, 3233.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">See, also, Bernheimer v. Hartmayer, 34 Misc. Rep. 346, 69 N. Y. Supp. 816.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">Section 1200 of the Code makes the following definition: <em>\u201cA </em>judgment is either interlocutory, or the final determination of the rights of the parties in the action.\u201d We cannot see any ground for argument that the judgment in this case is the \u201cfinal determination of the rights of the parties in the action.\u201d Their rights, not only upon the complaint itself, but upon the first defense, remain to be determined. As said in Brassington v. Rohrs, supra, had this been a final judgment, it would have provided.for the recovery of the demand in the complaint. The order should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-12\">Order affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
