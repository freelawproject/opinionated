To entitle the plaintiff to recover under the' contract, he must allege and prove that he performed the contract so far as it called upon him to perform it, and the defendant should not be required to specify his evidence by which he expects to disprove the plaintiff\u2019s allegation of performance. For that purpose he will be entitled to use any evidence available, and should not be limited, which would be the effect of requiring him to furnish the particulars asked for.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-16\">Reversed, with $io costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $io costs.
