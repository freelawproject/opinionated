He brought this action to recover damages for the false representations. The defendant corporation answered, denying each and every allegation of the complaint relating to the matters above referred to, and, issue being joined, made a motion for a bill of particulars, which was granted; and the plaintiff was required to furnish such a bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">There are 15 requirements of the order. So much \u00f3f the first as commands the plaintiff to specify what the several statements and representations were that are claimed to be false, and when, where and by whom they were made, whether oral or in writing or otherwise, is correct, but the requirement that the plaintiff annex in writing his documentary evidence was unauthorized. The plaintiff is not obliged in this way to furnish his evidence to his adversary. The second requirement of the order is entirely unnecessary, as it is a repetition of that part of the first, which was correctly made. The third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth requirements are also unnecessary, for what is directed to be stated by them is also included in that part of the first requirement which is retained. The tenth requirement of the order is proper. It refers to the money the plaintiff expended as claimed in the complaint. The eleventh requirement is also proper. It relates to the number of bonds of the railway company the plaintiff claims to have purchased. The twelfth is also proper, as that relates to what moneys were advanced by the plaintiff, and his proof should be limited. The thirteenth requirement is also proper, for it relates directly to the subject of what corporations the plaintiff claims to have financed, and the defendant .should be notified of the details of this, claim, so that it may be able at the trial to meet it.- It is conceded that the fourteenth and fifteenth requirements of the order are proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">The order should therefore be modified in accordance with what is here suggested, and, as thus modified, affirmed, without costs to either party of this appeal. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
