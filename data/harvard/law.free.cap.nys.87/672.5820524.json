It has so often been held that such a defect is fatal to an order of this character that the citation of authorities on the point is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-11\">The respondent objects, however, that this court has no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. The act of the Legislature regulating appeals from the City Court of Yonkers provides that such appeals shall be heard by the County Court of Westchester county where the judgment is rendered or the order appealed from is made in an action in which a recovery of less than $ioo is demanded in the complaint, but, where a recovery of $ioo or more is demanded, such appeals must be taken to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court. Laws 1893, p. 873, c. 416, tit. 9, \u00a7 1. The complaint in the present action was verified on October 27, 1903. The plaintiff therein demands judgment against the defendant for the sum of $99, with interest thereon from November 8, 1902. It will be perceived that this interest at the legal rate would raise the amount which the plaintiff sought to recover at the time the complaint was verified to a sum in excess of $100. I think the demand was therefore sufficient in amount to give this court jurisdiction of the appeal. Order appealed from reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-12\">Order of the City Court of Yonkers reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
