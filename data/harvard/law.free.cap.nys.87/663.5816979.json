The property was conveyed by deed to Cornelius C. Poillon and Richard Poillon as tenants in common on April 4, 1870. Cornelius C. Poillon died on July 11, \u00cd881, leaving a widow' and five children, and leaving a will, by which his executors were given a power of sale of his real and personal estate, \"either for cash, or part on bond and mortgage, as they may, in their \u2022discretion, deem advisable.\u201d The will was admitted to probate July 28, 1881. By the terms of the will the executors were directed to divide the estate into three equal shares, to pay to the widow during life in lieu of dower the income of one of the shares, the principal of such share being devised and bequeathed upon her death to his children, to be divided equally among them, \u201cthe issue of any deceased child or children to take the share which his, her, or their parent would have been entitled to if living.\u201d On February 1, 1882, the widow of Cornelius C. Poillon, his then surviving children, and the executors executed and delivered to Richard Poillon a deed which recites that \u201cwhereas, the said Cornelius Poillon (lately deceased), and the said Richard Poillon, party hereto of the fourth part, were heretofore in the lifetime of the said Cornelius seised as tenants in common of the \u25a0real estate hereinafter described, with other property, and the parties hereto have arranged a division of all said real est\u00e1te held in common, whereby the property hereinafter described belonging toi the said party of the fourth part and the said party of the first part accepts the provision made for her by the will of said Cornelius Poillon) deceased, in lieu of her dower in his real estate,\u201d and in consideration thereof, and of the conveyance by Richard Poillon to the sons of the. deceased of the shares in the real estate which had been set -off to them in the division, grants and conveys to him the premises in question. Richard Poillon died on July 14, 1891, but the widow of Cornelius C. is still living.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The title of'the purchaser would apparently depend upon the sufficiency of this deed to convey in fee the interest of the decedent and his heirs. \u2019 It cannot be regarded as a proper exercise of the power of sale conferred by the will, for no saleihas taken place within the meaning and intent of that provision, and as a conveyance of the interests of the heirs it is subject to the obvious objection that it .cannot dispose of the future rights of issue .of the testator\u2019s children in whom interests may vest at the death of the widow after the death during her lifetime of their parent. The shares of the children, even if vested, are still subject to be divested on the contingency suggested. Lyons, v. Ostrander, 167 N. Y. 135, 60 N. E. 334. The plaintiffs meet the objection by the assertion that the real estate in question is partnership property, having been'purchased with partnership funds by Cornelius C. Poillon and Richard Poillon, as members of the firm of C. &amp; R. Poillon, and consequently is to be treated as personal, estate. This assertion was contained in an affidavit made by one of the executors of the deceased on the motion made by the purchaser to be relieved of his purchase, and after the order was made granting such relief formal declarations to the effect that the property was partnership property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>were executed, acknowledged, and recorded by the surviving executor of Richard Poillon and the widow, executors, and surviving children of Cornelius C. Poillon; and thereupon the motion to vacate the prior order 'was made, which second motion resulted in the order appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">In the absence of an agreement, express or implied, between the partners to the contrary, partnership real estate is to be deemed in equity as changed into personalty only to the extent necessary for the purposes of partnership equities; and its general character as realty continues with all the incidents of that species of property between the partners themselves, and also between a surviving partner and the real and personal representatives of a deceased partner, except that each share is impressed with an implied trust for the performance of partnership obligations. Darrow v. Calkins, 154 N. Y. 503, 49 N. E. 61, 48 L. R. A. 299, 61 Am. St. Rep. 637. Assuming, however, that the affidavit and declarations referred to tend to' establish an \u201cout and out\u201d conversion of the realty into personalty, there is no adjudication to that effect which would be binding upon a future claimant under the will of Cornelius C. Poillon. The declarations referred to would not be competent evidence against such claimant. Hutchins v. Hutchins, 98 N. Y. 56; Williams v. Williams, 142 N. Y. 156, 36 N. E. 1053. The purchaser or his grantees would be compelled to' resort to parol proof in the defense of their title if assailed, and it is settled that when the title to real property depends upon questions of fact, and resort must be had to parol evidence, a purchaser will not be compelled to perform his contract. Irving v. Campbell, 121 N. Y. 353, 24 N. E. 821, 8 L. R. A. 620; Holly v. Hirsch, 135 N. Y. 590, 32 N. E. 709; Heller v. Cohen, 154 N. Y. 299, 48 N. E. 527.
