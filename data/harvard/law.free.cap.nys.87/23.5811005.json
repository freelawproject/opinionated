He is therefore a party aggrieved, and consequently possesses sufficient interest to enable him to appeal. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 1294, 2568; Matter of Stapleton, 71 App. Div. 1, 75 N. Y. Supp. 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-23\">The contestant was a beneficiary in a previous will executed by the testatrix about two weeks before the instrument propounded. It was stipulated upon the hearing before the surrogate that this will was destroyed. If purposely destroyed by the testatrix, and she was competent at the time of its destruction, the respondent has no standing in court, for his sole interest and right to attack the will in controversy depend upon the validity and existence of the antecedent will. If it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>should appear upon a new trial that this interest had been obliterated, the respondent ought not to be permitted tp continue this contest.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The attesting witnesses and Mr. Chapin, the draftsman who prepared the will, show that the requirements pertaining to the execution of wills were complied with, and that the testatrix at the time of its execution was competent to dispose of her property by will, and was free from any restraint. The testimony of Dr. York, her attending physician, does not seriously impugn her testamentary capacity. At least, there is sufficient doubt as to the correctness of the conclusion reached by the learned surrogate, so that we deem it proper to direct a trial by jury of the material questions of fact involved. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 2588.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">The decree of the Surrogate\u2019s Court is therefore reversed, with costs to the appellant to abide the event, and to be paid out of the estate of the decedent, and a new trial ordered at a trial term of the Supreme Court of the county of Erie. The questions of fact to be submitted to and disposed of by the jury, and the form of the order to be settled by and before Mr. Justice SPRING on two days\u2019 notice. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
