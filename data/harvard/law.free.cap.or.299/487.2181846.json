Many of the changes expand the role of crime victims in the criminal justice process. One provision increases victims\u2019 rights to compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Petitioner Lang, individually and in his capacity as Chair of the Criminal Justice Committee of the Portland Chapter of the National Lawyers Guild, moved to consolidate these ballot title challenges and intervened in the proceeding brought by petitioner Kouns. Kouns is a chief petitioner of the proposed initiative measure and intervened in Lang\u2019s proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The Attorney General filed the following ballot title with the Secretary of State:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\">\u201cREVISES MANY CRIMINAL LAWS CONCERNING VICTIMS\u2019 RIGHTS, EVIDENCE, SENTENCING, PAROLE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-8\">\u201cQUESTION: Shall crime victims\u2019 rights and role in criminal justice process be expanded, and changes made in prosecution, evidence, sentencing, parole?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-9\">\u201cEXPLANATION: Protects victims from pretrial contact by criminal defendant. Bars excluding victim from courtroom during trial. Gives victim role in trial scheduling, sentencing, parole. Requires joint trial of jointly charged defendants unless \u2018clearly inappropriate.\u2019 Limits merger of sentences for multiple crimes. Sets consecutive sentences rules. Gives state and defendant same number of jury challenges. Expands cross-examination on witness\u2019s prior convictions. Expands victims\u2019 compensation rights. Requires that parole last for term of entire sentence. Makes other changes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">Petitioner Lang challenges the ballot title as insufficient and unfair in four ways. He contends it fails adequately to inform the voters of the true purpose of the proposed measure, which he asserts is to expand prosecutorial power and discretion, and to restrict the statutory and constitutional rights of accused persons. He further contends that the phrase \u201cvictims\u2019 rights\u201d in the Caption and Question is biased, value-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>laden, inflammatory and, therefore, unfair. He asserts that the Explanation fails to state concisely, accurately and impartially the chief purpose of the measure, because it fails to mention an important section, the broad definition of \u201cvictim.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Finally, petitioner Lang argues that the Explanation does not comply with the standard of minimum readability because the phrase \u201cmerger of sentences\u201d will not be understood by the average voter and because the term \u201cvictim\u201d connotes something different to voters than the definition contained in this initiative measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Petitioner Lang offers the following alternative ballot title:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\"><em>\u201cCAPTION: </em>RESTRICTS CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS IN TRIAL, EVIDENCE, SENTENCING, PAROLE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\"><em>\u201cQUESTION: </em>Shall constitutional and statutory rights be restricted and prosecutor\u2019s power and victim\u2019s role be expanded in the criminal justice process?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-7\"><em>\u201cEXPLANATION: </em>Restricts criminally accused\u2019s ability to defend by reducing access to witnesses. Gives complaining witness role in trial scheduling, sentencing, parole. Exempts complaining witness from exclusion during other trial testimony. Restricts right to individual trial. Doubles number of prosecutor\u2019s jury challanges [sic], expands impeachment and ability to use irrelevant evidence. Expands complaintant\u2019s [sic] compensation rights. Allows multiple convictions for single incident and provides for increasing consecutive sentences. Requires that parole lasts entire term of sentence. Expands victim definition.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Petitioner Kouns challenges the ballot title for different reasons. He argues that the Caption is insufficient and unfair in that (1) it is not phrased in the words by which the measure is commonly referred; and (2) it incorrectly states that the measure \u201crevises,\u201d rather than \u201ccreates or establishes\u201d new rights for victims. Petitioner Kouns does not object to the Question prepared by the Attorney General. He contends that the Explanation is incomplete because it states neither that the initiative would allow the victim\u2019s photograph in a homicide trial, nor that the initiative defines \u201cvictim.\u201d He also objects because the final sentence does not say that the \u201cother changes\u201d are \u201call related to victims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">Petitioner Kouns offers the following alternative Captions and Explanation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\">\u201cTHE VICTIMS\u2019 RIGHTS INITIATIVE \u201cOR</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">\u201cCREATES VICTIMS\u2019 RIGHTS; REVISES CRIMINAL LAWS CONCERNING EVIDENCE, SENTENCING, PAROLE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">\u201cOR</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-8\">\u201cCREATES NEW VICTIMS\u2019 RIGHTS; REVISES CRIMINAL PROCEDURE, EVIDENCE, SENTENCING, PAROLE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-9\">\u201cEXPLANATION: Protects victims from pretrial contact by criminal defendant. Allows victim in courtroom during trial. Gives victim role in trial scheduling, sentencing, parole. Requires joint trial of jointly charged defendants unless \u2018clearly inappropriate.\u2019 Regulates multiple and consecutive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>sentences. Gives state and defendant same number of jury challenges. Equalizes cross-examination on witnesses\u2019 prior convictions. Expands victims\u2019 compensation rights. Extends parole, parolee to pay costs. Allows victim\u2019s photograph in homicide trial. Defines \u2018victim.\u2019 Makes other victim related changes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">In response to these two petitions, the Attorney General concedes that the Explanation in the original ballot title was deficient in failing to refer to the measure\u2019s broad definition of \u201cvictim.\u201d While contending that the Caption and Question are fair and sufficient, the Attorney General offers the following alternative Explanation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-5\">\u201cEXPLANATION: Protects victims from pretrial contact by criminal defendant. Bars excluding victim from courtroom during trial. Gives victim role in trial scheduling, sentencing, parole. Requires joint trial of jointly charged defendants unless \u2018clearly inappropriate.\u2019 Limits sentence merger for multiple crimes. Sets consecutive sentences rules. Gives state, defendant same number of jury challenges. Expands witness\u2019s prior conviction cross-examination. Expands victims\u2019 compensation rights. Requires that parole last entire term of sentence. Defines \u2018victim\u2019 broadly. Makes other changes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">THE CAPTION</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">ORS 250.035(1) (a) requires that a ballot title include a \u201ccaption of not more than 10 words by which the measure is commonly referred * * Petitioner Kouns argues that this initiative measure is commonly referred to as the \u201cvictims\u2019 rights initiative,\u201d and the Caption should so read.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">The Attorney General concedes that the measure is commonly referred to as the \u201cvictims\u2019 rights initiative\u201d by its sponsors and the news media, and that this is the name by which the measure\u2019s predecessor (Ballot Measure #8 in the General Election of November 6,1984) came to be commonly referred. The Attorney General argues, however, that such Caption would be insufficient and unfair because it does not sufficiently serve the identifying purpose of the Caption under ORS 250.035(1) (a), and because it amounts to an argument in favor of the measure. The Attorney General cites <em>Marr v. Thornton, </em>237 Or 503, 392 P2d 458 (1964), where \u201c \u2018Right-to-work\u2019 Constitutional Amendment\u201d was disapproved because it was a slogan amounting to an argument for the measure and was likely to create prejudice, and <em>Allied Truck Owners v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number><em>Hoss, </em>139 Or 686, 11 P2d 960 (1932), where \u201cThe Highway Protection Bill\u201d was disapproved because the word \u201cprotection\u201d was possibly argumentative.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">Each part of a ballot title must be sufficient and fair. ORS 250.085(1). We agree with the Attorney General that petitioner Kouns\u2019 suggestion would be insufficient and unfair because the measure includes many provisions which are unrelated to \u201cvictims.\u201d Of the 15 substantive provisions, at least one-third are unrelated to victims. Of the remaining two-thirds, some relate to victims only tangentially. Furthermore, not all the provisions that relate to victims\u2019 participation in the criminal justice process can be properly characterized as creating \u201crights\u201d for victims. Thus, while this measure may be commonly referred to as the \u201cvictims\u2019 rights initiative,\u201d such Caption, without more, would mislead the voters because the measure includes significant substantive provisions unrelated to victims or victims\u2019 \u201crights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Petitioner Lang objects to the use of the phrase \u201cvictims\u2019 rights\u201d as biased, value-laden and inflammatory. While this phrase does not fully describe the initiative measure, the measure does provide an expanded role for crime victims in several respects. Therefore, the use of the phrase \u201cvictims\u2019 rights,\u201d in the context of the entire Caption and in consideration of the statutory word limitation, is adequately descriptive and not inflammatory or unfair. We conclude that the Caption prepared by the Attorney General is sufficient and fair. ORS 250.085(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">THE QUESTION</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">ORS 250.035(l)(b) requires that the Question be \u201cnot more than 20 words which plainly states the purpose of the measure * * Petitioner Lang\u2019s views about the <em>effects </em>of this measure, <em>e.g., </em>increasing prosecutorial power and limiting the rights of accused persons, arguably may be accurate, but the Question proposed by the Attorney General is an impartial, concise and accurate statement of the <em>purpose </em>of the measure. ORS 250.035(1)(b) and 250.039. As discussed above, the phrase \u201cvictims\u2019 rights,\u201d while not descriptive of the entire measure, is neither inflammatory nor unfair. We conclude that the Question provided by the Attorney General is fair and sufficient. ORS 250.085(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>THE EXPLANATION</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">ORS 250.035(1)(c) requires that a ballot title include a \u201cconcise and impartial statement of not more than 75 words of the chief purpose of the measure.\u201d As noted above, in response to these two petitions, the Attorney General conceded that the Explanation was deficient in failing to mention the broad definition of \u201cvictim\u201d included in this measure. Thus, the language \u201cDefines \u2018victim\u2019 broadly\u201d was included in the Attorney General\u2019s alternative Explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Petitioner Lang objected to the readability of the phrase \u201cmerger of sentences,\u201d asserting that it would not be understood by the average voter. That phrase has been changed to \u201csentence merger,\u201d and in the context of the entire Explanation, we find that it complies with the standard of minimum readability \u201cto the fullest extent practicable consistent with the requirements of impartiality, conciseness, and accuracy.\u201d ORS 250.039. The phrase is not so difficult that voters will be confused or misinformed.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">We have considered the other objections made by both petitioners and conclude that the suggested alternative Explanation by the Attorney General is fair, sufficient and reasonably understandable in light of the statutory word limitation and the complexity of the subject matter. ORS 250.085.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">We thus certify to the Secretary of State the following ballot title. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>prior conviction cross-examination. Expands victims\u2019 compensation rights. Requires that parole last entire term of sentence. Defines \u2018victim\u2019 broadly.
