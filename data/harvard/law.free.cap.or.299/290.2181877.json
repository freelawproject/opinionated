In each case the claimant had voluntarily left the labor force at the time the prior condition worsened and surgery became necessary. In each case the claimant had not left work because of the aggravation of the prior injury.

ORS 656.273(1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In each case the employer accepted responsibility for payment of necessary medical services but denied responsibility for the payment of compensation for TTD because the claimant was no longer in the labor market by the time the claimant applied for compensation for TTD.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">In each case the claimant requested a hearing on the denial, and the referee ordered the employer to pay compensation for TTD.

SAIF, </em>298 Or 405, 692 P2d 606 (1984), holds that a worker must \u201cleave work\u201d in order to be entitled to compensation for TTD and, therefore, because these claimants were not working when their conditions worsened to the point of unemployability, they are not entitled to compensation for \u201closs of wages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The claimants argue that under ORS 656.273(1), because their respective conditions have worsened since their last awards of compensation, they are entitled to additional compensation, and because it is undisputed that their surgeries will result in a period of complete inability to work, they are entitled to compensation for TTD. They assert that the language of ORS 656.210(1) so commands:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">\u201cWhen the total disability is only temporary, the worker shall receive during the period of that total disability compensation * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Law does not contain a definition of \u201ctotal disability\u201d or of \u201ctemporary total disability.\u201d The law does contain a definition of \u201cpermanent total disability\u201d in ORS 656.206(1) (a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-8\">\u201c \u2018Permanent total disability\u2019 means the loss, including preexisting disability, of use or function of any scheduled or unscheduled portion of the body which permanently incapacitates the worker from regularly performing work at a gainful and suitable occupation. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>As part of the explanation of \u201cpermanent total disability,\u201d ORS 656.206(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-4\">\u201cThe worker has the burden of proving permanent total disability status and must establish that the worker is willing to seek regular gainful employment and that the worker has made reasonable efforts to obtain such employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">ORS 656.210(1) uses the term \u201cthe total disability\u201d but does not specifically instruct the reader where the referent for the term is to be found. The use of the definite article leads us to conclude that the term speaks to \u201ctotal disability\u201d as used elsewhere in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The present Workers\u2019 Compensation Law derives from Oregon Laws 1913, chapter 112, and section 21 thereof fixed the schedule of compensation to be paid under the law. Subsection 21(b) defined \u201cpermanent total disability\u201d and the amounts to be paid for such disability. Subsection 21(c) specified that if the worker died during \u201csuch period of total disability\u201d beneficiaries were to recover certain compensation. Subsection 21(d) pronounced that when \u201cthe total disability\u201d was only temporary, the worker was to receive benefits that were calculated on the basis of the schedule set forth in subsection 21(b) relating to permanent total disability. That history and the continued juxtaposition of these provisions cause us to conclude that the most likely referent is for \u201cthe total disability\u201d now to be found in ORS 656.206(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\"> We construe \u201cthe total disability\u201d used in ORS 656.210(1) to mean the loss, including preexisting disability, of use or function of any scheduled or unscheduled portion of the body which incapacitates the worker from regularly performing work at a gainful and suitable occupation. Total disability describes the extent of disability that a worker may suffer. \u201cPermanent\u201d or \u201ctemporary\u201d describes duration, not the extent, of disability. If the total disability is permanent, payment of compensation is made according to ORS 656.206; if the disability is temporary, payment is made according to ORS 656.210. In either case, benefits for total disability are only available where the requisite incapacity to work exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">The employers argue that <em>Bono v. SAIF, supra, </em>holds that to be entitled to compensation for TTD one must leave work. In that case a worker sought \u201cinterim compensation\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>under ORS 656.262 (4)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and our decision in <em>Jones v. Emanuel Hospital, </em>280 Or 147, 570 P2d 70 (1977). As noted in <em>Bono, </em>the term \u201cinterim compensation\u201d is one coined by this court in <em>Jones. See Bono v. SAIF, </em>298 Or at 407 n 1. In <em>Bono </em>we observed that interim compensation is related to compensation for TTD in that the rates of compensation are similarly calculated. Noting that ORS 656.210(3)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> requires that a worker must leave work to trigger payment of compensation, we then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-4\">\u201c* * * The payment of temporary total disability benefits is based in part upon whether the injured worker \u2018leaves work.\u2019 ORS 656.210(3). Interim compensation is based on temporary total disability benefits. Thus, we hold that in order to receive interim compensation, a subject worker must have left work as that phrase is used in ORS 656.210(3). * * *\u201d 298 Or at 410.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The holding in that case is simply that a worker cannot receive interim compensation during a period of time in which the worker is actually working. There is nothing in that holding from which we desire to retreat; there is nothing in that holding which governs the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">The entire scheme of Workers\u2019 Compensation Law is to compensate <em>workers, </em>who are active in the labor market, for wages lost because of inability (or reduced capacity) to work as a result of a compensable injury and to pay for medical expenses incurred in treatment of injury. The name of the act itself, proclaimed by ORS 656.001, indicates who is to be covered \u2014 \u201cworkers.\u201d \u201cWorker\u201d is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-7\">\u201c* * * any perS0Ilj including a minor whether lawfully or unlawfully employed, <em>who engages to furnish services for a </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number><em>remuneration, </em>subject to the direction and control of an employer and includes salaried, elected and appointed officials of the state, state agencies, counties, cities, school districts and other public corporations, but does not include any person whose services are performed as an inmate or ward of a state institution.\u201d ORS 656.005(28) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">There is not one word in the statute that refers to a person who no longer engages in furnishing services for remuneration. Certainly, one who retires voluntarily from the work force is no longer a \u201cworker\u201d as defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The stated policy of the legislature is set out in ORS 656.012 and includes a declaration of the objectives of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law. ORS 656.012(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-6\">\u201c* * * [T]he objectives of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law are declared to be as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-7\">(a) To provide, regardless of fault, sure, prompt and complete medical treatment for injured workers and fair, adequate and reasonable income benefits to injured workers and their dependents;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-8\">(b) To provide a fair and just administrative system for delivery of medical and financial benefits to injured workers that reduces litigation and eliminates the adversary nature of the compensation proceedings, to the greatest extent practicable;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-9\">(c) <em>To restore the injured worker physically and economically to a self-sufficient status </em>in an expeditious manner and to the greatest extent practicable; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-10\">(d) To encourage maximum employer implementation of accident study, analysis and prevention programs to reduce the economic loss and human suffering caused by industrial accidents.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">The thrust of the act is to restore injured workers to employment status, and the act also provides coverage for those apprenticing or training for work. <em>See </em>ORS 656.138(1).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>That the legislature intended workers\u2019 compensation benefits to provide wage replacement is made clearer by the statutes providing for compensation for injured workers or their beneficiaries. ORS 656.204(2) states that \u201c[i]f death results from the accidental injury, payments * * * shall be paid in an amount equal to 4.35 times 50 percent of the average weekly wage to the surviving spouse until remarriage.\u201d Thus, death benefit compensation is based on wage replacement.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Under ORS 656.206(2), the formula for calculating permanent total disability benefits is based on wage replacement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-5\">\u201c(2) (a) When permanent total disability results from the injury, the worker shall receive during the period of that disability compensation benefits equal to 66-2/3 percent of wages not to exceed 100 percent of the average weekly wage nor less than the amount of 90 percent of wages a week or the amount of $50, whichever amount is lesser.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-6\">\u201c(b) In addition, the worker shall receive $5 per week for each additional beneficiary not to exceed five. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">The calculation of TTD benefits under ORS 656.210(1) is also based upon wage replacement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-8\">\u201cWhen the total disability is only temporary, the worker shall receive during the period of that total disability compensation equal to 66-2/3 percent of wages * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">ORS 656.268(1), which sets forth the procedure for determining awards for permanent disability, emphasizes that \u201c[o]ne purpose of this chapter is to restore the injured worker as soon as possible and as near as possible to a condition of self support and maintenance as an able-bodied worker.\u201d As we have noted, a worker is one who engages in furnishing services for remuneration.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-10\">ORS 656.287(1) provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-11\">\u201cWhere there is an issue regarding loss of earning capacity, reports from vocational consultants in governmental agencies or private vocational consultants <em>regarding job opportunities, the fitness of claimant to perform certain jobs, wage levels, or other information relating to claimant\u2019s employability </em>shall be admitted into evidence at compensation hearings * * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Additionally, Oregon Laws 1981, chapter 535, section 2, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-4\">\u201c(1) The insurer or self-insured employer of an injured worker shall be responsible for contacting the worker within five days after:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-5\">(a) Receipt of a medical report which indicates that the worker may be unable to return to work for a period of 21 days or longer; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">(b) The worker has been off work for more than 21 consecutive days since the date of injury,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\">and <em>shall assist the worker in returning to the workforce </em>for a gradual, intermittent or immediate return to regular, modified or other available employment. Each insurer and self-insured employer shall maintain records of such contacts and assistance in such manner as the department, by rule, may prescribe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-8\">\u201c(2) The insurer or self-insured employer <em>shall assist the worker in returning to the worker\u2019s previous employment. </em>If the worker is not able to return to the previous employment, the insurer <em>or </em>self-insured employer <em>shall assist the worker in obtaining similar or suitable employment.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-9\">\u201c(3) Assistance under this section shall include, but not be limited to use of the insurer\u2019s or self-insured employer\u2019s placement and rehabilitation resources, job search, on-the-job placement and contracting with the Vocational Rehabilitation Division of the Department of Human Resources or with suitable private rehabilitation services for the purpose of reemploying the worker at a position or a wage as close as possible to the worker\u2019s occupation or employment at the time of injury. All vocational assistance services provided to injured workers shall be in accordance with rules prescribed by the director.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">Although this section was not operative until July 1,1984, Or Laws 1981, ch 535, \u00a7 26(2), its adoption by the 1981 legislature is an indication of the legislature\u2019s construction of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">Finally, of greatest significance is ORS 656.325(5), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-12\">\u201cNotwithstanding ORS 656.268, an insurer or self-insured employer shall cease making payments pursuant to ORS 656.210 and shall commence making payment of such amounts as are due pursuant to ORS 656.212 <em>when an injured, worker refuses wage earning employment </em>prior to claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>determination and the worker\u2019s attending physician, after being notified by the employer of the specific duties to be performed by the injured worker, agrees that the injured worker is capable of performing the employment offered.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">As applied to aggravation claims, this statute dictates that a worker receiving TTD benefits must not refuse wage earning employment prior to the aggravation claim determination if the worker is capable of working. Thus, a claimant who has retired from the labor market cannot qualify for TTD benefits because of the claimant\u2019s decision to refuse further wage earning employment. Further, ORS 656.206(3) requires a worker seeking permanent total disability compensation to prove a willingness to seek regular employment and to make reasonable efforts to obtain such employment. Surely, if a worker claiming permanent total disability status must demonstrate a willingness to work, a claimant seeking compensation for aggravation of a pre-existing injury must similarly prove a willingness to seek work in order to obtain TTD benefits under ORS 656.325(5). Again, we emphasize that \u201ctotal disability\u201d is an inability to <em>work, </em>either temporarily or permanently.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The dissent disagrees with this determination, labeling it \u201cpure <em>ipse dixit.\" </em>This disagreement is based on the 1948 case of <em>Lindeman v. State Indus. Acc. Comm., </em>183 Or 245, 192 P2d 732 (1948), in which this court said in <em>dictum </em>that under the now defunct Oregon Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act \u201cthe loss of capacity to earn is the basis upon which compensation should be based.\u201d 183 Or at 250. The dissent urges us to bow to the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>and to decide the present case under the rationale of <em>Lindeman. </em>Neither the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>nor the application of sound legal reasoning supports the dissent\u2019s view.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The \u201closs of earning capacity\u201d referred to in <em>Lindeman </em>is only a factor used to measure the extent of disability in the determination of benefits for temporary <em>partial </em>disability, ORS 656.212, and permanent <em>partial </em>disability, ORS 656.214. ORS 656.212 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-7\">\u201cWhen the disability is or becomes partial only and is temporary in character, the worker shall receive for a period not exceeding two years that proportion of the payments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>provided for temporary total disability which his loss of earning power at any kind of work bears to his earning power existing at the time of the occurrence of the injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">ORS 656.214(5) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\">\u201cIn all cases of injury resulting in permanent partial disability, * * * the criteria for rating of disability shall be the permanent loss of earning capacity due to the compensable injury. <em>Earning capacity is the ability to obtain and hold gainful employment </em>in the broad field of general occupations, taking into consideration such facts as age, education, training, skills and work experience. * * *\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">This definition does not help the claimants. Earning capacity only goes to the extent of disability. Loss of earning capacity can only be determined in the context of the claimant\u2019s ability to work; it is not, by itself, an independent kind of injury for which compensation is provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\"><em>\u201cIpse dixit\u201d </em>is defined in Black\u2019s as \u201ca bare assertion resting upon the authority of an individual.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 743 (5th ed 1979). Our decision of the present case relies not upon an assertion of any individual, but upon an examination of the legislative statements made in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law as it applies to the instant cases. We decline the opportunity to rely upon prior language of this court laid out in <em>dictum </em>in a case construing a statute which no longer exists. Our present holding that TTD benefits are wage replacement for those persons working or seeking work is based upon our analysis of the pronouncements of the legislature, not upon an engrafting of an earlier questionable pronouncement of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">The legislature adopted the present workers\u2019 compensation scheme after extensive hearings and testimony by representatives of employes, employers and insurance carriers. This resulted in a \u201cstatement * * * by the legislature after an opportunity of the people of this state to present their divers views to the legislature\u201d as is urged by the dissent. Contrary to the view expressed in the dissent, this process has already occurred and the legislation as passed does not provide the relief sought by the present claimants. Comments regarding the wisdom or propriety of that choice, absent any constitutional infirmity, should be addressed to the legislature, not this court. As we have shown, the pronouncements of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>legislature found in the <em>present </em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Law applicable to the <em>present </em>case, are more compelling to our resolution of this case than is <em>dictum </em>from a 37-year-old case decided under a now defunct statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">A claim for temporary total disability benefits in the absence of wage loss seeks a remedy where there is no damage. Non-workers can sustain medical expenses. They cannot lose earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Temporary disability benefits are maintenance benefits intended to provide support and help replace lost income during the healing or recovery process.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Under the circumstances of these consolidated cases, the claimants are not entitled to temporary total disability benefits. The Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b337-7\"> The term \u201ctemporary total disability\u201d is used in ORS 656.210(3) to describe \u201cthe total disability [which] is only temporary\u201d mentioned in ORS 656.210(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b337-8\"> ORS 656.005(8) (b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-9\">\u201cA \u2018disabling compensable injury\u2019 is an injury which entitles the worker to compensation for disability or death.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b337-10\"> ORS 656.273(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-11\">\u201cAfter the last award or arrangement of compensation, an injured worker is entitled to additional compensation, including medical services, for worsened conditions resulting from the original injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b338-9\"> The employer of Brech further contends that the case of <em>Stiennon v.

I further agree that our decision in <em>Bono v. SAIF, </em>298 Or 405, 692 P2d 606 (1984), does not govern the case at bar.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> also agree that if the total disability is permanent, payment is made according to ORS 656.206 and that if the total disability is temporary, payment is made according to ORS 656.210.1 have now listed all that is in the majority opinion with which I can agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">First, I wish to draw attention to the main theme underlying the majority opinion. The rest of the opinion is nothing but an attempt to find an underpinning for the result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>already expressed. The majority states that the \u201cpurpose\u201d of temporary total disability compensation is to replace wages lost by a worker who is still in the labor market. One would expect to find some decision of this court, some words of the statute or some legislative history for that statement. One searches the majority opinion in vain for that support. The statement is pure <em>ipse dixit. </em>If that is legislative policy, the statement should be made by the legislature after an opportunity of the people of this state to present their divers views to the legislature. It surely cannot be a statement by this court, in its infinite wisdom, on the basis of briefs by none but the parties (and their supporters, linked in interest).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">The majority questions the teaching of this court\u2019s pronouncement 35 years ago in <em>Lindeman v. State Indus. Acc. Comm., </em>183 Or 245, 192 P2d 732 (1948), where this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-5\">\u201cThe Oregon Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act provides primarily for three types of compensation to be paid to employees covered by the act (or to their beneficiaries or dependents in case of death) for injuries arising out of and in the course of their employment. They are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\">\u201c(1) Compensation for disability, dependent as to amount upon whether the injury produces a permanent total, a temporary total, or a temporary partial disability. \u00a7\u00a7 102-1756,102-1758, and 102.1759, O.C.L.A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-8\">\u201c(2) Compensation in stipulated amounts for loss of some part of the body, such as an arm, a leg, or an eye, and \u2018other cases of injury resulting in permanent partial disability\u2019. \u00a7 102-1760, O.C.L.A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-9\">\u201c(3) Compensation for death. \u00a7\u00a7 102-1755,102-1757, and 102-1761, O.C.L.A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-10\">\u201cThe statute provides no compensation for physical pain or discomfort. It is limited to the <em>loss of earning ability. The loss of capacity to earn is the basis upon which compensation should be based. Weber v. American Silk Spinning Co., </em>38 R.I. 309, 95 A. 603, Ann. Cas. 1917E 153; <em>Gillen v. Ocean Accident &amp; Guarantee Corp., </em>215 Mass. 96,102 N.E. 346, L.R.A. 1916A 371.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">183 Or at 249-250. Even if it be argued that the quoted material was dictum or the same kind of statement of policy made by the majority in this case, it was a statement that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>governed the trials of some 17 years of workers\u2019 compensation cases. It was a statement embodied in the charges to juries. It was a statement that purported to interpret the statute. It was a statement accepted as a premise both by those in favor of, and those opposed to, the 1965 revision of the law. Regard for the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>should persuade the majority to abandon its holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">In <em>Lindeman </em>this court noted that under \u00a7 102-1752, OCLA, a worker injured on the job was to be compensated for his disability. That section provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-5\">\u201cEvery workman subject to this act while employed by an employer subject to this act who, while so employed, sustains personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment and <em>resulting in his disability </em>* * * shall be entitled to receive from the industrial accident fund * * * the sum or sums hereinafter specified * * (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">A related section, \u00a7 102-1754, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-7\">\u201cIf any workman while he is subject to this act and in the service of an employer * * * shall sustain a personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment caused by violent or external means, he * * * shall receive compensation as hereinafter provided.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">Then followed the sections providing, in order for the calculation of benefits to be paid for death, permanent total disability, death during permanent total disability, temporary total disability, temporary partial disability and permanent partial disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">The majority states that the \u201closs of earning capacity,\u201d to which <em>Lindeman </em>refers, is only a factor with respect to temporary <em>partial </em>disability and permanent <em>partial </em>disability. I respectfully draw the attention of the majority to the language above quoted from <em>Lindeman. </em>The language is not limited to partial disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">The majority states that the statute to which <em>Lindeman </em>spoke \u201cno longer exists\u201d and is \u201cnow defunct.\u201d I invite the majority to compare ORS 656.202 to 656.214 with the sections of Oregon Compiled Laws Annotated to which <em>Lindeman </em>and I have referred, <em>supra. </em>ORS 656.202 provides that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>subject worker who sustains a \u201ccompensable injury\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> shall receive compensation as provided in ORS 656.001 to ORS 656.794. Then follows, in order, just as in Oregon Compiled Laws Annotated, the method of calculating benefits to be paid for death, permanent total disability, death during permanent total disability, temporary total disability, temporary partial disability and permanent partial disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">The majority is considerably taken with the fact that ORS 656.210 bases compensation for temporary total disability on a percentage of wages. Lo and behold! So did that \u201cdefunct\u201d statute, \u00a7 102-1758, OCLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The statutes to which <em>Lindeman </em>spoke seem to be alive and well. The present codification is consonant. A worker is compensated for partial or total disability, temporary or permanent. ORS 656.210 provides explicitly that if the worker\u2019s total disability is only temporary, the worker is to receive a certain percentage of weekly wage \u201cthe worker was receiving at the time of his injury.\u201d The majority simply fails to address the fact that both of the workers with whom we are here concerned were actually working at the time of injury and that ORS 656.210 does no more and no less than to say that a worker who is temporarily totally disabled \u201cshall receive\u201d a percentage of the wage being earned at the time of the injury. No statute concerning temporary total disability states that the worker must \u201cstill be in the labor market\u201d to receive compensation for that condition of unemployability resulting from industrial injury defined by both the majority and this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The majority justifies its usurpation of legislative function by resort to ORS 656.206(3), which requires a worker to prove \u201cthat the worker is willing to seek regular gainful employment and that the worker has made reasonable efforts to obtain such employment\u201d in order to prove \u201cpermanent total disability status.\u201d The majority says that ORS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>656.206(3) is an \u201cexplanation\u201d of permanent total disability. ORS 656.206(3) is nothing more than a statement by the legislature that a worker must satisfy a certain condition precedent to achieve a \u201cstatus\u201d that will allow him to receive the compensation for permanent total disability to which he may be otherwise entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Before turning to the possibility that these workers in the case at bar must satisfy the requirements of ORS 656.206(3), I desire to point out the total want of legislative indication that the subsection is to be considered in connection with compensation for temporary total disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The legislature has given some attention to offsetting certain social security benefits against the amount of compensation for permanent total disability to which a worker might be entitled. In ORS 656.209 the legislature has addressed the case of the worker who is receiving \u201cdisability\u201d benefits from federal social security. Surely when that legislation was considered in 1977 and 1979, it could not have escaped legislative attention that there should be a similar offset for receipt of old age social security benefits by a worker who was permanently totally disabled, but the legislature did not provide for one to lose all or any part of compensation for permanent total disability because one was receiving old age social security benefits and, therefore, not \u201cstill in the labor market.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">If the legislature did not see fit to eliminate compensation for permanent total disability for old age \u201cretirement\u201d benefits, what suggests that the legislature intended to do so for those entitled to temporary total disability compensation by reason of being incapacitated to the extent mentioned at the outset of this opinion?</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Because the majority desires to make ORS 656.206(3) a touchstone for entitlement to compensation for temporary total disability, I believe that the majority must have a longer, harder look at that subsection in order to reach the result that it does here.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">That text requires that a worker must show his willingness and his efforts to find employment to gain the \u201cstatus\u201d of permanent total disability as defined in ORS 656.206(1). When must he show that? He must do so at the time he is seeking adjudgment that he is permanently totally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>disabled. This court has not addressed this condition precedent. The Court of Appeals has. That court has logically reasoned that a worker who is so incapacitated that motivation and seeking work would be \u201cfutile\u201d need not undertake the fruitless task. <em>See, </em>for example, <em>Brech v. SAIF, </em>72 Or App 388, 695 P2d 964 (1985), where the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-4\">\u201cThe second basis for the referee\u2019s denying permanent total disability is claimant\u2019s alleged failure to comply with the requirement of ORS 656.206(3) that a claimant prove \u2018that the worker is willing to seek regular gainful employment and that the worker has made reasonable efforts to obtain such employment.\u2019 Claimant\u2019s failure to seek employment is not unreasonable when, in view of his disabilities, such efforts would be futile. <em>Hanna v. SAIF, </em>65 Or App 649, 654, 672 P2d 67 (1983); <em>Looper v. SAIF, </em>56 Or App 437, 441, 642 P2d 325 (1982). The evidence establishes that claimant cannot perform regular gainful employment; because he is permanently totally disabled from a physical standpoint, it is unnecessary for him to undertake the futile effort of seeking employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">72 Or App at 391.I find it difficult to believe that the majority would quarrel with the line of decisions that the Court of Appeals has developed in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The majority would apply ORS 656.206(3) to entitlement to compensation for temporary total disability. Although I do not believe that is the proper course, I invite the majority to carry its desire to the logical result forecast by the Court of Appeals decisions with respect to entitlement to compensation for permanent total disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">The plain fact of the matter is that both of the claimants at bar will not be able to work at least during the time of surgery. It is during that time that these claimants ask for the compensation for their unemployability. It would be futile indeed for them to seek employment from the hospital bed. That is the time period with which these cases are concerned, not some time either before or after that period in which it is conceded and agreed that they will not be able to work because of worsening of their conditions resulting from their original injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">The majority has taken the policy statement contained in ORS 656.012(2), the definition of \u201cworker\u201d in ORS 656.005(28), ORS 656.287(1), an evidentiary section, and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>section, ORS 656.340, mandating the employer to do certain things, and from that holds that these claimants are not entitled to compensation for a period of time during which their worsened conditions will make them totally disabled, as defined, at least temporarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">As to ORS 656.012(2), I can only again express the idea that a preamble in general terms should not control over explicit textual language found elsewhere in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">As to definition of \u201cworker,\u201d the definition contained in ORS 656.005(28) is obviously for the purpose of triggering coverage under the law. ORS 656.003 explains that the definitions apply except where the context otherwise requires. The word \u201cworker\u201d is used throughout ORS 656.001 to 656.794 in senses that make it perfectly obvious that it is not used to mean one who is working. I am not going to list them all. Some of the sections with which we are here most closely concerned demonstrate the fact. ORS 656.206(2) to (5) speak to a \u201cworker\u201d who is permanently totally disabled. ORS 656.208 concerns the \u201cworker\u201d who dies during the period of permanent total disability. Even ORS 656.210 provides for a \u201cworker\u201d to receive compensation for temporary total disability. One who is totally disabled, permanently or totally, cannot meet the definition given in ORS 656.005(28).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">ORS 656.287(1) does no more than to make admissible certain evidence where there is an issue regarding \u201closs of earning capacity,\u201d something the majority contends is not involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">ORS 656.340 imposes a variety of duties on an employer or its insurer to assist a \u201cworker,\u201d who, incidentally, is obviously not working and, therefore, cannot meet the definition of \u201cworker\u201d in ORS 656.005(28).</p>\n<p id=\"AZv\">The majority finds that \u201cof greatest significance\u201d is ORS 656.325(5), a subsection that entitles an employer to cease paying compensation for temporary total disability and commence paying compensation for temporary partial disability \u201cwhen an injured worker refuses wage earning employment prior to claim determination\u201d if the worker is capable of performing the employment offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>This subsection is not applicable at all. Claim determination for these claimants occurred long ago. There is not one bit of evidence in the record that either of these claimants has been offered, and has refused, wage earning employment. I daresay that no employer of sound mind would offer wage earning employment to one confined to the hospital bed or its equivalent while undergoing or recovering from surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">Under statutory text these workers are entitled to the compensation they here seek. It is a mistake to inject into the statutory scheme the views of the majority of this court as to what the law ought to be, but is not.</p>\n<judges id=\"b353-5\">Campbell, J., joins in this dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b346-12\"> The majority\u2019s quoted material <em>from Bono v.
