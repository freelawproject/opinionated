Thompson\u2019s Shannon\u2019s Code, section 5989. The opinions in both of the above cases so indicate. <em>Parris </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, at page 270, and <em>Railroad </em>v. <em>Flood </em>122 Tenn., at page 78, 113 S.

W., 530, that a judgment rendered upon such a defective warrant would be void where there was no motion in arrest interposed as a test of its sufficiency; nor was it meant to be held that such a warrant is so far void as not to be amendable. It is voidable upon the application of said test.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Deny the writ of <em>certiorari.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
