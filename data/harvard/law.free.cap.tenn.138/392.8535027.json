At'the time she saw this she was twenty-five or thirty steps away from defendant, and was sitting in a buggy with her father, who was the witness first above named. Defendant, testifying in his own behalf, admitted his presence on the particular occasion, but said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-5\">\u201cI did not own \u00e1 pistol at the time, nor had I owned one for twelve months prior thereto. At the time, I was standing and talking to William Striplin and Sam Hughes; I dropped a pint bottle, which I immediately picked up. It was a bottle the State\u2019s witnesses saw, and not a pistol. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The jury, however, who heard the evidence delivered by the witnesses reached the conclusion that it was a pistol the witnesses saw and not a bottle; \u00e1t least we so surmise, since the verdict was, \u2018 \u2018 guilty as charged. \u2019 \u2019 There was no other evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">One of the assignments of error made here is that the trial judge was in error in refusing to charge the jury at defendant\u2019s request as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-8\">\u2018 \u2018 The burden is on the State to prove, beyond ai reasonable doubt, that the pistol alleged to have been carried was not an army or navy pistol carried openly in the hand, and if the proof fails to show that the pistol was not an army or navy pistol, you will acquit the defendant. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>No other complaint is made of the charge, and the one made is not .well founded. The argument made in support of it is that because it was held in <em>Wehunt </em>v. <em>State, 136 </em>Tenn. (9 Thomp.), 223, 188 S. W., 939, that it is necessary for the indictment or presentment to aver that the pistol was not an army or navy pistol carried openly in the hand; therefore the burden was on the State to prove such averment. So much may be conceded to be true, and it is also clear that the request would have been correct if it had not contained the last clause reading:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-4\">\u201cAnd if the proof fails to show that the pistol was not an army or navy pistol, you will acquit the defendant. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">With these words incorporated the request was properly refused. Mere absence of evidence tending to show that the pistol was not an army or navy pistol did not entitle defendant to an acquittal. There ivas no evidence tending to show a carrying of the pistol openly in the hand. \u2022 The undisputed trend of. the evidence was that the pistol was carried in the pocket, and when it fell out was picked up and put back in the pocket. If no pistol was carried openly in the hand, then no army or navy pistol was so carried, and if a pistol was carried in the pocket whether army, or navy, or other kind, it was a violation of the statute if carried with \u00a3 \u00a3 a view of being armed and ready for offense or defense in case of conflict with a citizen. \u201d <em>Moorefield </em>v. <em>State, </em>73 Tenn. (5 Lea), 348; <em>Barton </em>v. <em>State, </em>66 Tenn. (7 Baxt.), 105; <em>Heaton </em>v. <em>State, </em>130 Tenn. (3 Thomp.), 163, 169 S. W., 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">There is no error in the record and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
