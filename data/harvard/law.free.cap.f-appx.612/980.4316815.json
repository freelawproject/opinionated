Lee Fields, a federal prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The district court dismissed the petition because Mr. Fields had previously been denied relief on a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, and he failed to show that he was entitled to pursue his claims under \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause. After a review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-10\">Mr. Fields was convicted in 1995 of conspiracy to possess cocaine and cocaine base with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. The district court sentenced him to a statutorily-mandated term of life imprisonment under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 (b)(l)(A)(iii), because of his crime of conviction and his prior felony drug offenses. We denied Mr. Fields relief on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Caldwell, </em>204 F.3d 1120 (11th Cir.1999) (table decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-11\">In 2000, Mr. Fields filed his first \u00a7 2255 petition, which the district court denied on all grounds. We denied him a certificate of appealability on that petition in 2003. Since that time, Mr. Fields has filed a variety of additional motions in the district and circuit courts seeking relief from his sentence. None of them proved meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-13\">In August of 2010, Mr. Fields filed the instant \u00a7 2241 petition, arguing that he is \u201cinnocent\u201d of his \u201cenhanced life sentence\u201d under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) because (1) during his case, the government filed a defective notice of his prior convictions under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, and (2) the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 is retroactive and no longer requires a mandatory life sentence for defendants with convictions like his. The district court dismissed the \u00a7 2241 petition, finding that Mr. Fields was attacking the validity of his sentence as opposed to the manner of its execution, that he was barred from seeking relief under \u00a7 2255 because it would be a successive motion to vacate, and that he failed to demonstrate that he could pursue his claims under \u00a7 2241 because he had not satisfied the savings clause under \u00a7 2255(e) (i.e., he had not shown that \u00a7 2255 was inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention). Mr. Fields now appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-15\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>See Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000). A federal prisoner must ordinarily bring any collateral attacks on his conviction or sentence under \u00a7 2255. <em>See Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). A federal prisoner, however, may file a habeas petition pursuant to \u00a7 2241 under the limited circumstances stated in \u00a7 2255(e). <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2241(a) &amp; 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-16\">Relief under \u00a7 2241, however, is available only if the prisoner can show that a \u00a7 2255 proceeding is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention,\u201d as required by \u00a7 2255(e). <em>See Bryant v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>738 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>1253, 1256 (11th Cir.2013). This is a jurisdictional matter that must be decided before a court can address the merits of a petitioner\u2019s claims. <em>See id. </em>at 1202.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">\u201cThe existence of the statutory bar on second and successive motions cannot mean that \u00a7 2255 is \u2018inadequate or ineffective\u2019 to test the legality of [the prisoner\u2019s] detention within the meaning of the savings clause.\u201d <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1308 (11th Cir.2011) (en banc). Instead, to show that a prior \u00a7 2255 motion was \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention,\u201d Mr. Fields must show that (1) binding circuit precedent squarely foreclosed his claim during his sentencing, his direct appeal, and his first \u00a7 2255 proceeding; (2) the United States Supreme Court overturned that circuit precedent in a decision issued after his first \u00a7 2255 proceeding; (3) the Supreme Court\u2019s new rule applies retroactively on collateral review; and (4) as a result of the Supreme Court\u2019s new rule, his sentence exceeds the statutory maximum authorized by Congress. <em>See Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1274.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">Mr. Fields argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>DePierre v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2225, 180 L.Ed.2d 114 (2011), and <em>Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>560 U.S. 563, 130 S.Ct. 2577, 177 L.Ed.2d 68 (2010), are retroactive and establish that he was convicted of a now nonexistent offense. We disagree. First, he has not shown that these decisions are retroactive on collateral review. Second, even if they are, he has not demonstrated that they overturned circuit precedent or apply to the facts of his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-9\">In <em>DePierre, </em>the Supreme Court held that the term \u201ccocaine base,\u201d as used in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1), refers not only to crack cocaine, but also to any cocaine in its chemically-basic form. 131 S.Ct. at 2227-28. Thus, the term \u201ccocaine base reaches more broadly\u201d than the term \u201ccrack cocaine\u201d alone. <em>Id. </em>at 2232 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-11\">In <em>Carachuri-Rosendo, </em>the Supreme Court ruled \u2014 in the context of an immigration proceeding \u2014 that an alien\u2019s second or subsequent simple drug possession conviction was not an \u201caggravated felony\u201d conviction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(3), because the simple possession offense had not been enhanced based on the fact of a prior conviction. 560 U.S. at 565, 130 S.Ct. 2577.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-12\">Here, the indictment against Mr. Fields alleged that he distributed \u201ca substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine and cocaine base,\u201d and the evidence at trial showed that his offense involved both powder and crack cocaine. Mr. Fields was convicted of conspiracy to possess cocaine and cocaine base with intent to distribute under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(iii), and he received a sentence of life imprisonment, because he also had been convicted of two prior qualifying drug offenses. In short, <em>DePierre </em>and <em>Carachuri-Rosendo </em>have no impact on Mr. Fields\u2019 conviction or sentence, and these Supreme Court decisions do not entitle him to pursue collateral relief under \u00a7 2241 via the savings clause in \u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-13\">Mr. Fields also argues that the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 applies to his case. In <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012), the Supreme Court held that the Fair Sentencing Act applies to offenders who committed crimes prior the Act\u2019s effective date but were sentenced after that date, even if the sentencing occurred prior to the issuance of the new Sentencing Guidelines based upon the Act. <em>See id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>2385-36. The Fair Sentencing Act took effect on August 3, 2010. <em>See id. </em>at 2326.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">Mr. Fields, however, was sentenced in 1996, well before August of 2010, and the Fair Sentencing Act does not apply to offenders who committed their crimes and were sentenced prior to August 3, 2010. <em>See United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535, 542 (11th Cir.2013); <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 377-78 (11th Cir.2012). Thus, his Fair Sentencing Act claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">Because Mr. Fields has failed to demonstrate that he satisfies \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause, the district court did not err by dismissing his \u00a7 2241 petition for habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
