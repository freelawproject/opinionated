Castro\u2019s motion was based on Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines. We affirm. Castro pleaded guilty to three offenses involving the illegal possession of and dealing in firearms, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(a)(1)(A), 922(g)(8), 924(a)(2), 924(a)(1)(D), three counts of distributing a controlled substance, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and one count of carrying a firearm in relation to drug trafficking, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1). The district court grouped Castro\u2019s offenses involving drug distribution and possessing and distributing firearms, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(a)-(c), and calculated his offense level based on the firearms offenses because they yielded a higher advisory guideline range, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 2K2.1. With an adjusted offense level of 29 and a criminal history of I, Castro faced a sentence between 87 to 108 months of imprisonment and a consecutive sentence of five years for carrying a firearm in relation to a trafficking offense, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). The district court sentenced Castro to 156 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-21\">The district court did not err when it denied Castro\u2019s motion to reduce. Because Castro was sentenced under the guideline for firearm offenses, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, not the drug quantity table, he was ineligible for a reduction of his sentence under Amendment 782. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>see also United States v. Glover, </em>686 F.3d 1203, 1206 (11th Cir.2012). Castro argues that he was entitled to a reduction under the statutory sentencing factors, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), but a district court cannot consider the sentencing factors unless it determines that a defendant is eligible for a sentence reduction. The district court lacked authority to reduce Castro\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-22\">We AFFIRM the denial of Castro\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
