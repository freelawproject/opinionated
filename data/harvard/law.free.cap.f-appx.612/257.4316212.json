Roberson argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he violated the conditions of his supervised release by failing to support his dependents and by associating with three felons.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-24\">A district court may revoke a term of supervised release upon a finding, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant violated a condition of supervised release. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number><em>United States v. Hinson, </em>429 F.3d 114, 118-19 (5th-Cir.2005). We review the district court\u2019s decision to revoke supervised release for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Grandlund, </em>71 F.3d 507, 509 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">At the revocation hearing, Roberson\u2019s probation officer testified that Roberson failed to pay child support with wages that he earned while working for his father. Defense counsel and Roberson conceded that fact. Therefore, the district court\u2019s determination that Roberson violated- his conditions of supervised release by failing to pay child support to his dependents was adequately supported by the record and justifies the revocation. <em>See Hinson, </em>429 F.3d at 118-19; <em>Grandlund, </em>71 F.3d at 509. Because there is an adequate basis for the district court\u2019s revocation based on Roberson\u2019s failure to support his dependents, we need not address his argument regarding the sufficiency of the evidence as to the allegation regarding his associating with felons. <em>See United States v. McCormick, </em>54 F.3d 214, 219 n. 3 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b283-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
