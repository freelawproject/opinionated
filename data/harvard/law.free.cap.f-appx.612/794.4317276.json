California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Shehane has filed a response, seeking appointment of counsel to assist with his <em>Anders </em>response and with the appeal. We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>record reflected therein, as well as She-hane\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, Shehane\u2019s request for appointment of new counsel is DENIED, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b820-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
