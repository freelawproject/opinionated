He argues that the non-guideline sentence, which is above the advisory guidelines range of 10 to 16 months, is unreasonable and greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-19\">Where, as in the instant proceeding, there is no procedural error, this court reviews the sentence for substantive reasonableness under the abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). The specific characterization of the sentence is irrelevant as long as the sentence is reasonable under the totality of the relevant factors in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-20\">In Dominguez\u2019s case, the district court\u2019s reasons for the sentence were fact-specific and consistent with the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006). Although Dominguez argues that the district court placed undue weight on his criminal history, a district court may consider a defendant\u2019s criminal history when imposing a non-guidelines sentence. <em>See Smith, </em>440 F.3d at 709; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.4 (2013). Additionally, while Dominguez contends that the district court failed to properly consider his personal circumstances, there is no requirement that a sentencing court accord personal circumstances dispositive weight. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 807 (5th Cir.2008). Finally, this court has upheld upward departures or variances of similar or greater magnitudes. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>444 F.3d 430, 433, 442 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>417 F.3d 483, 492 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Daughenbaugh, </em>49 F.3d 171, 174-75 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-13\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b260-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
