We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">We reject Gonzalez\u2019s claim that the district court plainly erred by failing to instruct the jury that an agreement with a government agent cannot form the basis for a conspiracy conviction. <em>See Sears v. United States, </em>343 F.2d 139, 142 (5th Cir.1965). Even if a <em>Sears </em>instruction may have been appropriate, we pretermit the question whether the failure to give it was error. <em>See United States v. Delgado, </em>672 F.3d 320, 342 &amp; n. 28 (5th Cir.2012) (en banc); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 525 (5th Cir.2008). If there was error, Gonzalez has not shown that it was \u201creversible plain error.\u201d <em>Delgado, </em>672 F.3d at 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Gonzalez \u201cnever advanced the argument that [he] conspired only with a government agent.\u201d <em>Delgado, </em>672 F.3d at 343. Instead, his argument focused on discrediting the Government\u2019s confidential informant, someone the defense painted as an untrustworthy felon eager to be remunerated by the Government for producing a drug trafficking conviction. Gonzalez\u2019s theory of defense was that there was no conspiracy at all \u2014 that there was only the informant placing and planting ideas in law enforcement agents\u2019 heads. \u201cThus, the lack of a <em>Sears </em>instruction did not impede [Gonzalez\u2019s] defense\u201d and provides no \u201cgrounds for reversal.\u201d <em>Delgado, </em>672 F.3d at 343 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">We reject also Gonzalez\u2019s contention that the district court abused its discretion by propounding a deliberate ignorance instruction. <em>See United States v. Nguyen, </em>493 F.3d 613, 619 (5th Cir.2007). Any error in giving such an instruction is harmless if substantial evidence showing actual knowledge was adduced at trial, as happened in Gonzalez\u2019s case. <em>See United States v. McElwee, </em>646 F.3d 328, 341 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b272-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
