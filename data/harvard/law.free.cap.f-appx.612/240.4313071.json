He argues that the district court erred by determining that his prior conviction for indecent liberties with a child under Code of Virginia \u00a7 18.2-370(A)(3) was a crime of violence meriting a 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. \u201cCrime of violence\u201d under this Guidelines section includes sexual abuse of a minor. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment (n.l(B)(iii)). Because the Guidelines do not further define that offense, the categorical approach requires that we assess whether the elements of the state offense of conviction \u201ccomport with the generic meaning\u201d of sexual abuse of a minor. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>711 F.3d 541, 553 (5th Cir.2013) (en banc), <em>cert. denied,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 512, 187 L.Ed.2d 365 (2013). We conduct a de novo review of this issue. <em>See United States v. Ramos-Sanchez, </em>483 F.3d 400, 402 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">The enhancement was applied based on Chan-Vicente\u2019s prior conviction of the following offense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-15\">A. Any person 18 year of age or over, who, with lascivious intent, knowingly and intentionally commits any of the following acts with any child under the age of 15 years is guilty of a Class 5 felony: ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-16\">(3) Propose that any such child feel or fondle his own sexual or genital parts or the sexual or genital parts of such person or propose that such person feel or fondle the sexual or genital parts of any such child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-17\">VA. CODE ANN. \u00a7 18.2-370(A)(3). Chan-Vicente concedes that his first challenge to this offense being classified as sexual abuse of a minor \u2014 that it does not require a certain age difference between the perpetrator and victim \u2014 is foreclosed. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>711 F.3d at 562 n. 28 (rejecting similar argument because \u201cthe definitions of \u2018sexual abuse of a minor\u2019 in legal and other well-accepted dictionaries do not include such an age-differential requirement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-18\">His remaining contention is that the Virginia offense does not qualify as sexual abuse of a minor because it does not necessarily entail abuse. Chan-Vicente argues that the statute could encompass one teenager proposing \u201cconsensual petting\u201d to another, which he argues would not comport with the ordinary meaning of sexual abuse. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>711 F.3d at 568 (Haynes, J., concurring .in the judgment) (taking the position that a \u201ccommon-sense, \u2018plain-meaning\u2019 understanding of \u2018abuse\u2019 \u201d would not include \u201cotherwise consensual \u2018petting\u2019 between teenagers\u201d). But Chan-Vicente needs to show a \u201crealistic probability\u201d that the statute would be applied in such a manner, and he cites no case showing that it ever has been. <em>See United States v. Carrasco-Tercero, </em>745 F.3d 192, 198 (5th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Chan-Vicente further argues that the Virginia offense applies to some conduct that does not amount to sexual abuse because it' does not require a sexual act in the presence of the child. Our case law has not, however, recognized such a requirement. <em>United States v. Cortez-Cortez, </em>770 F.3d 355, 358 (5th Cir.2014), confirmed that this court \u201chas established a per se rule that gratifying or arousing one\u2019s sexual desires in the presence of a child is abusive,\u201d but did not say that in-person conduct is necessary for an offense to constitute sexual abuse of a minor. We have recognized that conduct carrying the potential for psychological harm, without any physical harm, may constitute sexual abuse of a child. <em>See United States v. Ramos-Sanchez, </em>483 F.3d 400, 403 (5th Cir.2007). The statute at issue in <em>Ramos-Sanchez, </em>like the Virginia one at issue here, can be violated without a showing of physical proximity. <em>See id. </em>at 402 (quoting KAN. STAT. ANN. \u00a7 21-3510(a)(1)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The psychological harm we recognized as sufficient in <em>Ramos-Sanchez </em>thus did not depend on physical proximity. Especially in light of modern technology, which has made the internet a common vehicle for sexual abuse of minors, we are not convinced that physical proximity is required' to establish the psychological harm that we have recognized is sufficient to constitute abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">We are therefore not persuaded that the district court erred. The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b267-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b268-6\">. The Kansas statute prohibited \"enticing or soliciting a child 14 or more years of age but less than 16 years of age to commit or to submit to an unlawful sexual act.\u201d <em>See id. </em>It has since been repealed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
