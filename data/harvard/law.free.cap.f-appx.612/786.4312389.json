Montoya-Correa contends that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to address his non-frivolous argument for a guidelines departure based on his connection to the United States. He further asserts that the district court\u2019s barebones invocation of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8553(a) considerations of punishment and deterrence, without discussing their specific application to the present case, failed to provide an adequate explanation of its sentencing decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-21\">Because Montoya-Correa did not object to the reasonableness of his sentence, we review the district court\u2019s sentencing determination for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). . At sentencing, Montoya-Correa argued for a departure from the guidelines range of 10 to 16 months based on his personal and familial connections to the United States. While the district court\u2019s explanation of its within-guidelines sentence was terse and failed to specifically address Montoya-Correa\u2019s arguments for a downward departure, the record reflects that the court listened to those arguments, expressly considered two of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and expressly adopted the findings and reasoning of the presentence report, which contained all of the information about Montoya-Correa\u2019s personal and familial connections to the United States upon which his plea for le-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>nieney was based. Thus, the record makes clear that the district court listened to but rejected Montoya-Correa\u2019s arguments for a downward departure. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356-59, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>see also United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 564 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 525-26 (5th Cir.2008). The district court\u2019s explicit reference to the considerations of punishment and deterrence, in light of the whole record, suffices to \u201creflect adequate consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d at 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">Montoya-Correa fails to demonstrate that the district court committed clear or obvious procedural error. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423. Moreover, he fails to show \u201chow a fuller explanation would have altered his sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Rouland, </em>726 F.3d 728, 733 (5th Cir.2013). Absent such a showing, he cannot demonstrate that the district court\u2019s purported error affected his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 262-63 (5th Cir.2009). To the extent Montoya-Correa argues that <em>Whitelaw </em>was wrongly decided, the argument is unavailing. <em>See United States v. Walker, </em>302 F.3d 322, 325 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b812-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
