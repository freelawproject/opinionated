California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Perez has filed a response in which he challenges his .conviction and sentence. Because the record reflects that Perez knowingly decided not to appeal his conviction, we will not address the issues raised in his response related to his conviction. <em>See United States v. Polanco-Ozorto, </em>772 F.3d 1053, 1054-55 (5th Cir.2014). We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Perez\u2019s response to the extent it addresses sentencing issues. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, Perez\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b262-6\"> Pursuant to 5tii Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
