She was sentenced, <em>inter alia, </em>to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment. In calculating that sentence, the court increased Gonzalez\u2019 advisory Sentencing Guideline offense level by 16, pursuant to Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) (pre-deportation conviction for certain drug-trafficking offenses). The enhancement was based on Gonzalez\u2019 2010 Texas conviction for possession, with intent to deliver, 400 grams or more of cocaine, in violation of Texas Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 481.112(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Although post <em>-Booker, </em>the Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the advisory Guidelines-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, for issues preserved in district court, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">On two bases, Gonzalez contends her \u25a02010 conviction was not a drug-trafficking offense: the conviction could have been imposed for administration of a controlled substance (she concedes this issue is foreclosed and raises it only to preserve it for possible further review); and delivery under \u00a7 481.112(a) encompasses unremuner-ated transfers (as she concedes, this issue is subject only to plain-error review). Our precedent, however, forecloses both issues. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>782 F.3d 198, 204-05 (5th Cir.2015), <em>petition for cert. docketed </em>(23 June 2015) (No. 14-10355); <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Bernal, </em>783 F.3d 1002, 1008 (5th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. docketed </em>(2 July 2015) (No. 15-5047); <em>United States v. Teran-Salas, </em>767 F.3d 453, 460-62 (5th Cir.2014), <em>cert. denied,</em>-U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 1892, 191 L.Ed.2d 767 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b274-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under die limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
