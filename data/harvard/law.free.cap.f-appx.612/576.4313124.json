Joseph argues the district court erred because (1) the two-level enhancement imposed under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(l) for taking the property of a financial institution constituted impermissible double counting, and (2) his sentence was substantively unreasonable. After review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">As Joseph acknowledges in his initial brief, our precedent forecloses Joseph\u2019s double-counting argument. <em>See United States v. Dudley, </em>102 F.3d 1184, 1186-87 (11th Cir.1997) (holding a district court does not err in a bank-robbery case when it imposes a two-level enhancement under \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(l) for taking the property of a financial institution.) The district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Joseph to 46 months of imprisonment. The district court imposed the sentence at the minimum of Joseph\u2019s guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Asante, </em>782 F.3d 639, 648 (11th Cir.2015) (\u201c[W]e ordinarily expect a sentence within the Guidelines ranges to be reasonable.\u201d) (quotation omitted). The district court considered the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). While acknowledging his unique immigration status and medical history, the district court noted those reasons did not justify his commission of six bank robberies.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-15\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Joseph\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b603-11\">. We review de novo claims of double counting under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Webb, </em>665 F.3d 1380, 1382 (11th Cir.2012). We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
