His underlying guilty-plea conviction was for illegally reentering the United States after deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Garcia contends: his sentence is greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); and it reflects a clear error of judgment in balancing those sentencing factors, claiming the court gave undue weight to the need to protect the public based on Garcia\u2019s record of assaulting correctional officers. He maintains: regardless of whether he was dangerous to correctional officers, that finding does not support the court\u2019s inference that an above-Guidelines sentence was needed to protect the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and a <em>properly preserved objection </em>to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the advisory Guidelines-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, for issues preserved in district court, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). As noted, Garcia does not claim procedural error, claiming only that the sentence was substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Although Garcia objected that his sentence was greater than necessary to satisfy the goals of \u00a7 3553(a), the Government asserts his claim should nevertheless be reviewed only for plain error because he failed to state the specific issue on which he bases his challenge. In any event, because his sentence can be affirmed under the usual abuse-of-discretion standard, we need not decide whether the more strict plain-error standard applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">- In reviewing a non-Guidelines sentence for substantive reasonableness, we consider \u201cthe totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the guidelines range, to determine whether as a matter of substance, the sentencing factors in section 3553(a) support the sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Gerezano-Rosales, </em>692 F.3d 393, 400 (5th Cir.2012) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Contrary to Garcia\u2019s claim, the court\u2019s finding an above-Guidelines sentence was necessary to protect the public was not based solely on Garcia\u2019s convictions for assaulting three correctional officers. In addition to those assaults, Garcia had a prior murder conviction, threatened to kill the wife and children of a correctional officer upon release, and illegally reentered the United States merely five days after being deported, following lengthy incarceration. Furthermore, in assessing Garcia\u2019s sentence, the court considered the \u201cnature and circumstances of this particular immigration offense\u201d, Garcia\u2019s \u201chistory and characteristics\u201d, and \u201cthe type of sentences available\u201d, and concluded an upward deviation was warranted to \u201cprotect the public\u201d, to promote respect for the law, to provide a \u201cjust punishment\u201d, and \u201cto afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">Under the totality of the circumstances, including the significant deference given to the court\u2019s consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the court\u2019s reasons for its sentencing decision, Garcia\u2019s challenge fails. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 400-01.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b284-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
