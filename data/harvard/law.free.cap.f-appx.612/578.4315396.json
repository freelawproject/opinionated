Henderson (\u201cPlaintiff\u2019) appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of the Federal Tort Claims Act complaint (DE 1) filed by her late father, Roy Henderson (\u201cHenderson\u201d), against the United States of America and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cDefendants\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court concluded that it did not have subject-matter jurisdiction to hear the case. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-21\">We presume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the complaint and the district court\u2019s order dismissing the case. Essentially, the Plaintiff contends that the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d) negligently disbursed a retroactive benefits payment for her late father to the long-term care facility where he was staying without investigating its fitness to receive the payment. She claims that the disbursement violated several statutory and regulatory provisions governing the selection of legal custodians and fiduciaries for receipt of benefits payments. She implies that, as a result of this negligence, the facility and its administrator made off with the money and then went bankrupt.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>The district court concluded that jurisdiction over the Plaintiffs claim rested exclusively with the VA and the mechanism established by the Veterans Judicial Review Act. That mechanism is as follows: (1) file a claim with the VA\u2019s regional office; (2) appeal an unfavorable decision to the Board of Veterans Appeals; (3) appeal that decision to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims; and, (4) if pure questions of law remain, appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and, ultimately, the Supreme Court. This exclusive procedure pertains to any decision of the VA \u201cunder a law that affects the provision of benefits.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 511(a). The district court interpreted the Plaintiffs complaint as doing nothing more than challenging the proper selection of a legal custodian or fiduciary to receive veterans benefits under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5502 and 5507. ' We agree. We further agree with the district court that this is a decision covered by Section 511(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because that is all the Plaintiff challenges \u2014 the proper selection of a fiduciary \u2014 her challenge is subject to exclusive jurisdiction under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 511(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">We cannot add to the district court\u2019s well-reasoned opinion. The district court\u2019s dismissal of the Plaintiffs complaint for want of subject-matter jurisdiction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b604-15\">. The Plaintiff below and the original Appellant here, Roy E. Henderson, died after the notice of appeal was filed in this case. His executor and personal representative, Plaintiff Ameda L. Henderson, moved for an order substituting her as the Appellant in her capacity as executor of the estate and personal representative of Roy E. Henderson, deceased. This court grant\u00e9d the Plaintiff's motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b605-8\">. The district court properly rejected the Plaintiffs effort to end-run jurisdictional exclusivity by arguing that the VA\u2019s negligent failure to follow its own rules for selecting a fiduciary was actionable in tort. The regulation upon which the Plaintiff relies, 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 13.58, was promulgated under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5502 and 5507, the statutes pertaining to fiduciary selection. Materially, there is no difference between the regulation and the statutes in terms of whether they are \u201cunder a law that affects the provision of benefits.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 511(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
