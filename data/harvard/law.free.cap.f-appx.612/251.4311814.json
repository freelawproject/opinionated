In its response brief, the Government moves to' dismiss this appeal on the basis that Pichardo-Escoto\u2019s notice of appeal was untimely. The record supports the Government\u2019s contention. Pichardo-Escoto submitted his notice of appeal after the deadline and beyond the period during which the district court could have granted him an extension. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(l)(A)(i), (b)(4). Although Rule 4(b) is not jurisdictional, <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>496 F.3d 387, 388-89 (5th Cir.2007), we will not disregard a defendant\u2019s untimeliness after the Government timely objects, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Lister, </em>561 Fed.Appx. 415, 416 (5th Cir.2014) (citing <em>Eberhart v. United States, </em>546 U.S. 12, 18, 126 S.Ct. 403, 163 L.Ed.2d 14 (2005))., The Government\u2019s motion to dismiss was timely. <em>United States v. Hernandez-Gomez, </em>No. 14-41268, 795 F.3d 510, 511, 2015 WL 4666156 *1, 2015 U.S.App. LEXIS 13761 \u2022*2 (5th Cir. Aug. 6, 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-13\">Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss is GRANTED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as untimely.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b278-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
