The court applied an enhanced sentence of 120 months for that conviction, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) and 851 (imposing 10-year minimum term of imprisonment for violation committed after prior, final conviction for felony drug offense), because Harden had a previous state-court felony conviction for possession of cocaine. The eleventh circuit affirmed Harden\u2019s sentence; his subsequent 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, also filed in the Southern District of Georgia, was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-20\">Harden filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition in the Eastern District of Texas, where he is now incarcerated, challenging the applicability of the enhanced sentence. After construing Harden\u2019s petition as a successive unauthorized \u00a7 2255 motion, the court dismissed his claims. Harden contends his state-court conviction does not support the enhanced penalty, and asserts his claim is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-21\">The court\u2019s dismissal of Harden\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition is reviewed <em>de novo. Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 212 .(5th Cir.2000). A \u00a7 2241 petition and a \u00a7 2255 motion \u201care distinct mechanisms for seeking post-conviction relief.\u201d <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 451 (5th Cir.2000). Section 2255 provides for a collateral attack of a federal sentence, while \u00a7 2241 provides for an attack on \u201cthe manner in which a sentence is executed.\u201d <em>Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 425-26 (5th Cir.2005) (internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>quotation marks omitted). The savings clause allows a federal prisoner to proceed under \u00a7 2241 if he can show the remedies provided under \u00a7 2255 are \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 901 (5th Cir.2001). Such a showing requires a claim be \u201cbased on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d that \u201cwas foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904; <em>accord In re Bradford, </em>660 F.3d 226, 230 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Harden\u2019s assertion, based on <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), and <em>Descamps v. United States,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013) fails because these opinions do not concern the enhanced penalties at issue under \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) and 851, and do not show Harden\u2019s sentence was erroneously enhanced. Further, as neither <em>Begay </em>nor <em>Descamps </em>are retroactively applicable Supreme Court decisions indicating Harden was convicted of a nonexistent offense, he may not rely on those cases to satisfy the requirements of <em>Reyes-Requena. See Padilla, </em>416 F.3d at 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b282-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
