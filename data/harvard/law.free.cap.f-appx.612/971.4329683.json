(\u201cStrickland\u201d or \u201cthe Strickland Corporation\u201d). Appellants Strickland, Roy Davis, Voncile Davis, Cindy Taylor, and Melissa Terrell all seek to appeal an order of the bankruptcy court affirming the Final Report of Strickland\u2019s bankruptcy estate trustee, Tazewell T. Shepard, III (the \u201cTrustee\u201d). The district court found appellants\u2019 notices of appeal to be untimely and insufficient, and consequently dismissed them for .lack of jurisdiction. Alternatively, the court also dismissed on the ground of equitable mootness. We disagree that all of the appeal notices were untimely,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but we do agree that they were equitably moot. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-7\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-8\">In April 1996, Strickland entered into a joint venture with Samara Consultant Group (\u201cSamara\u201d) to pursue grain sales in the Republic of Yemen, with the parties agreeing to split evenly any profits resulting from their business endeavors. At some point thereafter, Strickland contracted with the Republic of Yemen for the delivery of grain, which contract the Republic subsequently breached. Despite obtaining an arbitration award in its favor from the Grain and Feed Trade Association in London for $27.1 million, Strickland ultimately settled its claim against the Republic for $16,325 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-10\">Strickland forwarded $1 million of the settlement recovery to Samara. As an equal joint venture partner, Samara felt itself entitled to a greater share, and so filed a breach of contract lawsuit in the Northern District of Alabama in 2002 (the \u201cbreach of contract action\u201d or \u201ccontract action\u201d). Two years later, on April 21, 2004, a jury found in favor of Samara, awarding it $1,075,851.37. Then, upon the recommendation of a magistrate judge, the district court imposed a constructive trust on proceeds Roy Davis had received from Strickland\u2019s settlement with the Republic of Yemen, even though Davis had earlier been dismissed from the contract action, based on a concern that the transfer of funds was potentially fraudulent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-11\">In November 2004, the district court entered a final judgment reflecting the jury\u2019s verdict and pre-judgment interest, which it later amended by consent of the parties. The amended judgment required immediate payment into the court\u2019s registry of $250,000, with the remainder of the judgment due within thirty days. The amended judgment further provided that, upon payment of a 10% supersedeas bond, the judgment\u2019s execution would be automatically stayed pending the outcome of an appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-12\">Roy Davis made the initial $250,000 payment to the district court\u2019s registry but, facing a liquidity crisis, he struggled to pay the remainder and ultimately filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Eventually\u2014 more than two years later \u2014 the parties reached an agreement that required Roy and Voncile Davis to convey to the district court the mortgage on their property, which was worth more than $1.5 million at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-13\">Amid and following the parties\u2019 payment negotiations, a complicated web of appeals, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>remands, and motions occurred, none of which are germane to the present appeal. The important takeaway from the considerable procedural history is that, in the breach of contract action, the district court dissolved the constructive trust placed on assets that Roy Davis had received from the Yemeni settlement, while the underlying judgment against Strickland, against which Davis conveyed to the court $250,000 and a mortgage, remained in place.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\">The next important development came in January 2008, when Strickland filed a Chapter Seven bankruptcy petition (the \u201cChapter Seven case\u201d). Because the breach of contract action was still ongoing, the district court in that case and the bankruptcy court in the Chapter Seven case issued orders noting concurrent jurisdiction over the parties\u2019 claims. Later, in November 2010, the district court in the breach of contract action granted summary judgment in favor of the Trustee \u2014 who had been substituted as the plaintiff upon his appointment as trustee of Strickland\u2019s bankruptcy estate \u2014 and referred the case to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings. The losing parties \u2014 Roy Davis, Voncile Davis, Cindy Taylor, Melissa Terrell (the \u201cDavis defendants\u201d) \u2014 appealed the summary judgment order to this Court, but we dismissed the appeal as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-6\">Thus, when the bankruptcy court received the case with the district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling intact, it ordered the clerk of the district court to \u201cdisburse and remit\u201d to the Trustee the $250,000 deposited into its registry by Roy Davis. The bankruptcy court further ordered that, \u201cin the event of a ruling\u201d by this Court on an intervening motion for reconsideration filed by the Davis defendants, the clerk of the district court must \u201cimmediately transfer and assign to the Trustee the real estate mortgage given by Roy Davis and his wife, Voncile Davis, against their residence in favor of the [district court] in the amount of $1,134,622.33.\u201d We denied the Davis defendants\u2019 motion for reconsideration on September 28, 2011, and the district court conveyed to the Trustee the Davis\u2019s mortgage soon thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-9\">Following a number of hearings regarding attorneys\u2019 fees and the Trustee\u2019s compensation, in March 2012 the Trustee submitted his Final Report to the bankruptcy court. In his report the Trustee (1) proposed to transfer to Samara \u2014 Strickland\u2019s only creditor by virtue of the judgment in the breach of contract action \u2014 the mortgage conveyed to him by Roy and Voncile Davis via the clerk of the district court and (2) requested compensation for his administration of Strickland\u2019s bankruptcy estate. No objections having been filed, the bankruptcy court affirmed the Trustee\u2019s Final Report on May 1, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-10\">But then, on May 10, 2012, Roy Davis\u2014 in both his individual capacity and on behalf of Strickland<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2014 filed a notice of appeal, to the district court, of the bankruptcy court\u2019s May 1 order. Therein, Davis alleged multiple grounds for appeal, including: the right to an automatic stay in the bankruptcy court by virtue of status as a \u201cdefendant in the underlying case\u201d; questions regarding the finality and status of orders and motions before the bankruptcy and district courts; suspicion of a fraud committed on the court by A.M. Samara; and assertions that the \u201csettlement and compromise is unconstitutional\u201d and violates the Patriot Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-11\">The bankruptcy court notified Roy Davis that the May 10 notice of appeal was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>insufficient for (1) lack of a certificate of service, (2) lack of a signature by the movant, and (3) lack of an accompanying \u201cOfficial Form 17[.]\u201d The court allowed Davis fourteen days from entry of the order to correct the deficiencies. On May 29, 2012, Davis submitted three sets of .documents: first, notices of appeal on behalf of Strickland signed <em>pro se </em>by Roy Davis, Voncile Davis, Cindy Taylor, and Melissa Terrell (the \u201cStrickland Notices\u201d); second, notices of appeal for Roy Davis, Voncile Davis, Cindy Taylor, and Melissa Terrell in their individual capacities (the \u201cIndividual Capacity Notices\u201d); and third, certificates of service signed by Roy Davis, Voncile Davis, Cindy Taylor, and Melissa Terrell.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">In an order issued on June 18, 2014, the district court ruled that the Strickland Corporation and Individual Capacity Notices were insufficient. As to the former, the district court observed they were signed by Roy Davis, who is not an attorney.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Reasoning that a corporation cannot proceed <em>pro se, </em>the district court dismissed the Strickland Corporation\u2019s appeal. As to the Individual Capacity Notices, the district court found them to be untimely. Specifically, the court reasoned that the order these individuals sought to appeal was issued on May 1, 2012, but they did not file their notices of appeal Until May 29, 2012. Because this date fell outside the fourteen-day window imposed by Bankruptcy Rule 8002, the court concluded that it could not consider the three appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-5\">As to Roy Davis, the district court concluded that it could not consider his appeal for three reasons. First, Davis failed to file his notice of appeal by May 25, 2012, which the district court calculated to be the deadline, based on the bankruptcy court\u2019s May 11 order giving him fourteen days to do so. Second, Davis did not have a personal financial stake in Strickland\u2019s Chapter Seven proceeding and therefore lacked standing to appeal the bankruptcy court\u2019s May 1 order. And third, the appeal was moot because (1) Samara had foreclosed upon Davis\u2019s property and (2) the bankruptcy plan had been \u201cfully completed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-11\">So concluding it lacked jurisdiction to consider the notices of appeal filed by Strickland, Roy Davis, Voncile Davis, Cindy Taylor, and Melissa Terrell, the district court dismissed them. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-12\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-13\">Whether made by the bankruptcy or district court, we review determinations of law de novo. <em>In re Williams, </em>216 F.3d 1295, 1296 (11th Cir.2000). We likewise. review questions of subject matter jurisdiction de novo. <em>Doe v. Drummond Co., Inc., </em>782 F.3d 576, 593 (11th Cir.2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-14\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-15\">This case requires the Court to evaluate the district court\u2019s treatment of three sets of notices of appeal: first, the Strickland Notices, filed on behalf of the company by Roy Davis, Voncile Davis, Cindy Taylor, and Melissa Terrell; second, the Individual Capacity Notices filed by Roy Davis, Voncile Davis, Cindy Taylor, and Melissa Terrell; and third, to the extent the district court considered it an amended notice filed in response to the bankruptcy court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>May 11, 2012 order, the notice of appeal filed by Roy Davis in his individual capacity (the \u201cRoy Davis Notice\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> All three sets were filed May 29, 2012, and all three seek to challenge the bankruptcy court\u2019s May 1, 2012 order affirming the Trustee\u2019s Final Report and allowing him to recover compensation for administering Strickland\u2019s bankruptcy estate. As explained below, we agree that the appeals should have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-5\">A. Timeliness of the Notices of Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-6\">Appellants proceed <em>pro se. </em>While the Court construes liberally the pleadings of <em>pro se </em>litigants, it does not excuse them from their duty to abide by procedural rules. <em>McNeil v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 106, 113, 113 S.Ct. 1980, 124 L.Ed.2d 21 (1993); <em>Albra v. Advan, Inc., </em>490 F.3d 826, 829 (11th Cir.2007). With certain exceptions inapplicable to this case, Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 8002 requires a notice of appeal to be filed \u201cwithin 14 days after entry of the judgment, order, or decree being appealed.\u201d Fed. R. Bankr.P. 8002(a)(1). Compliance with this timeline is mandatory and jurisdictional: an appellate court lacks authority to consider an untimely notice of appeal. <em>In re Williams, </em>216 F.3d at 1298.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-7\">i. The Individual Capacity Notices Were Not Timely Filed</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-8\">The bankruptcy court entered its order affirming the Trustee\u2019s Final Report and permitting him to receive compensation for his services on May 1, 2012. Voncile Davis, Cindy Taylor, and Melissa Terrell attempted to appeal the court\u2019s decision by filing their Individual Capacity Notices on May 29, 2012. Because this date falls outside of the fourteen-day window imposed by Rule 8002, the Individual Capacity Notices are untimely. Fed.'R. Bankr.P. 8002(a)(1). And because the notices are untimely, the district court correctly determined that it lacked jurisdiction over these appeals and was right to dismiss them. <em>See In re Williams, </em>216 F.3d at 1296-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-11\">ii. The Strickland and Roy Davis Notices Were Timely Filed</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-12\">We conclude, however, that the Strickland and Roy Davis Notices were timely. Strickland and Roy Davis filed their initial notice of appeal on May 10, 2012, which was within fourteen days of the bankruptcy court\u2019s May 1 order. But, as the bankruptcy court pointed out in an order issued on May 11, 2012, their notice was deficient based on a(l) lack of a certificate of service, (2) lack of a signature'by the movant, and (3) lack of an accompanying \u201cOfficial Form 17[.]\u201d Accordingly, the bankruptcy court granted the parties fourteen days to correct the deficiencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-13\">The district court calculated the fourteen days given Strickland and Roy Davis to correct their deficient filings as creating a May 25, 2012 deadline to file these corrected notices of appeal. And if one just counts fourteen days from May 11, then May 25 would appear to be the deadline. Yet, we read Bankruptcy Rule 9006 as extending the deadline beyond May 25. First, the bankruptcy court\u2019s May 11 order imposed a specific time period in which its recipients, Strickland and Roy Davis, were required to act. Because the court served that order by mail, \u201cthree days are added <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>after the prescribed period would otherwise expire[.]\u201d Fed. R. Bankr.P. 9006(f). Thus, if May 26 would be the fourteenth day after issuance of the order, then Rule 9006(f) added three days to that calculation and extended the deadline for Strickland and Roy Davis to amend their notice of appeal to May 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-4\">Second, Rule 9006 provides that a time period specified in a court order \u201ccontinues to run until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.\u201d Fed. R. Bankr.P. 9006(a)(1)(C). Given operation of the three-day rule described above, the period for amendment of the original notice of appeal ended May 28, 2012. But May 28, 2012 was Memorial Day \u2014 a legal holiday. Fed. R. Bankr.P. 9006(a)(6)(A); <em>see </em>2012 Holiday Schedule, United States Office of Personnel Management, <em>available at </em>http://www.opm.gov/ policy-data-oversight/snow-dismissal-procedures/federal-holidays/ (last accessed Apr. 15, 2015). Accordingly, Strickland and Roy Davis had until the end of the day on May 29, 2012 to file their amended notices of appeal. Both complied with this deadline, so the district court erred by concluding that the Roy Davis Notice was untimely, based on a late filing of his amended notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\">B. The District Court Erred in Dismissing Strickland\u2019s Notice</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-6\">So too did the district court err in its treatment of the Strickland Notices. Specifically, the court incorrectly concluded it lacked jurisdiction over Strickland\u2019s appeal because the company submitted its notices of appeal <em>pro se. </em>In the court\u2019s opinion, \u201c[w]ell-settled law holds that a court lacks jurisdiction over a notice of appeal filed on behalf of a corporation by someone other than an attorney.\u201d Not quite.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-11\">Insofar as the district court concluded that corporations cannot proceed <em>pro se </em>but must be represented by counsel, it recited a correct proposition of law. Indeed, this Court has explicitly stated so. <em>Palazzo v. Gulf Oil Corp., </em>764 F.2d 1881, 1385 (11th Cir.1985) (citing <em>Commercial &amp; R.R. Bank of Vicksburg v. Slocomb, </em>39 U.S. 60, 14 Pet. 60, 10 L.Ed. 354 (1840); <em>In re K.M.A., </em>Inc., 652 F.2d 398 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981); and <em>Sw. Exp. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Comm\u2019n, </em>670 F.2d 53 (5th Cir.1982)); <em>see also Rowland v. Cal. Men\u2019s Colony, Unit II Men\u2019s Advisory Council, </em>506 U.S. 194, 201-02, 113 S.Ct. 716, 121 L.Ed.2d 656 (1993) (\u201cIt has been the law for the better part of two centuries ... that a corporation may appear in the federal courts only through licensed counsel.\u201d) and <em>Nat\u2019l Indep. Theatre Exhibitors, Inc. v. Buena Vista Distrib. Co., </em>748 F.2d 602, 609-10 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-12\">That said, the effect of Strickland\u2019s <em>pro se </em>notice of appeal is unclear. Citing an unpublished, and therefore non-prece-dential, case from this Court, <em>Securities &amp; Exchange Commission v. Merchant Capital, LLC, </em>486 Fed.Appx. 93, 94 n. 1 (11th Cir.2012), the district court determined that submission of the Strickland Notices by non-attorneys deprived it of jurisdiction over the appeals. Yet, <em>Merchant Capital </em>notwithstanding, our binding precedent instructs that a court facing such a circumstance should afford a corporation the opportunity to obtain counsel <em>before </em>dismissing its appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Palazzo, </em>764 F.2d at 1386 and <em>In re K.M.A., Inc., </em>652 F.2d at 399. And to the extent that the district court relied on one of our unpublished opinions as persuasive authority, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>note that other unpublished opinions from within this Circuit go the other direction, and require notice to a corporation before dismissing its appeal. <em>See Riggins v. Polk Cnty., </em>602 Fed.Appx. 765, 768-69 (11th Cir.2015); <em>Stirzaker v. Howard, </em>197 Fed.Appx. 852, 853 n. 1 (11th Cir.2006); <em>Fed. Trade Comm\u2019n v. Gem Merch. Corp., </em>1995 WL 623168, at *1 (11th Cir. Sept. 1, 1995). Likewise, our sister circuits also require notice. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Hagerman, </em>549 F.3d 536, 538 (7th Cir.2008) (Posner, J.) (\u201cThe usual course when a litigant not entitled to litigate pro se loses its lawyer in the midst of the case is to give it a reasonable opportunity to find a new one.\u201d); <em>Memon v. Allied Domecq QSR, </em>385 F.3d 871, 873-74 (5th Cir.2004) (\u201cIn virtually every case in which a district court dismissed the claims (or struck the pleadings) of a corporation that appeared without counsel, the court expressly warned the corporation that it must retain counsel or formally ordered it to do so before dismissing the case.\u201d); and <em>United States v. High Country Broad. Co., Inc., </em>3 F.3d 1244, 1245 (9th Cir.1993) (the same).</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-5\">Moreover, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent efforts to clarify its jurisdictional jurisprudence, an argument that a corporation\u2019s faulty submission of a <em>pro se </em>notice of appeal automatically deprives a court of jurisdiction seems questionable. <em>See e.g., Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1377, 1386-88, 188 L.Ed.2d 392 (2014) (clarifying the concept of \u201cprudential standing\u201d); <em>Morrison v. Nat'l Austl. Bank Ltd., </em>561 U.S. 247, 253-54, 130 S.Ct. 2869, 177 L.Ed.2d 535 (2010) (distinguishing between merits questions and questions of jurisdiction); and <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 215-16, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007) (Souter, J., dissenting) (\u201c \u2018Jurisdiction,\u2019 we have warned several times in the last decade, \u2018is a word of many, too many, meanings.\u2019 ... In recent years, however, we have tried to clean up our language[.]\u201d) (internal citations omitted). Indeed, the fact that a court can hold onto a case for whatever period of time it chooses to permit a corporation to retain counsel suggests that a <em>pro se </em>notice of appeal filed by a corporation does <em>not, </em>by itself, rob a court of jurisdiction over the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-8\">In addition, the Supreme Court has stated that \u201c[o]nly Congress may determine a lower federal court\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Kontrick v. Ryan, </em>540 U.S. 443, 452-56, 124 S.Ct. 906, 157 L.Ed.2d 867 (2004) (citing U.S. Const., art. III, \u00a7 1); <em>see also Bowles, </em>551 U.S. at 212, 127 S.Ct. 2360 (\u201cCongress decides what cases the federal courts have jurisdiction to consider\u201d) and <em>In re Indu Craft, Inc., </em>749 F.3d 107, 112-14 (2d Cir.2014) (describing the Supreme Court\u2019s recent consideration of jurisdictional rules and claims-processing rules). Here, the requirement that corporations be represented by counsel is not a creation of Congress, but is rather a judicial interpretation of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1654. <em>See Memon, </em>385 F.3d at 873 n. 4 (\u201c[T]he only authority for dismissing a corporation for failure to retain counsel, absent a court order or local rule, appears to be based on a judicial interpretation of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1654.\u201d). It thus does not implicate a court\u2019s jurisdictional grant from Congress. Put another way, whether a corporation can proceed <em>pro se </em>in a bankruptcy appeal is a far different question from whether the district court possesses jurisdiction over that appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a). <em>See Morrison, </em>561 U.S. at 254, 130 S.Ct. 2869.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-9\">For these reasons, whether the district court possessed the authority to dismiss Strickland\u2019s appeal under some other authority, such as a claims-processing rule or its inherent power to manage the cases before it, Strickland\u2019s <em>pro se </em>notices did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>not deprive the district court of jurisdiction. In any case, the court should have first afforded Strickland the opportunity to retain counsel before dismissing its appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-3\">C. The Court Correctly Dismissed the Appeals as Equitably Moot</p>\n<p id=\"ALPy\">However, notwithstanding the timeliness of the Roy Davis Notice and the notice of the need to retain counsel to which Strickland was entitled, the district court correctly dismissed the parties\u2019 appeals on grounds of equitable mootness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-4\">\u201cThe mootness doctrine, as applied in a bankruptcy proceeding, permits the court[ ] to dismiss an appeal based on its lack of power to rescind certain transactions.\u201d <em>In re Holywell Corp., 911 </em>F.2d 1589, 1543 (11th Cir.1990), <em>overruled on other grounds, </em>503 U.S. 47, 112 S.Ct. 1021, 117 L.Ed.2d 196 (1992). \u201cCentral to a finding of mootness is a determination by an appellate court that it cannot grant effective judicial relief ...

And, would relief affect the re-emergence of the debtor as a revitalized entity?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1068-9\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-10\">As noted above, the district court provided \u00e9quitable mootness as an alternative ground for dismissing the Strickland and Roy Davis Notices. In arriving at that conclusion the court noted that: (1) \u201c[appellants did not file a motion for a stay pending appeal of the order approving the Trustee\u2019s Final Report in the bankruptcy court or in [the district] court\u201d; (2) \u201c[t]he Trustee\u2019s approved distribution plan in the bankruptcy case has not only been substantially consummated\u2014it has been fully completed\u201d; (3) \u201c[a]ll of the Trustee\u2019s planned transfers and distributions were made more than two years ago\u201d; (4) \u201c[a]ny relief the [appellants could receive in [the] appeal would have the effect of frustrating the orderly Chapter 7 liquidation process\u201d and would result in \u201cfurther litigation because the Trustee would [ ] have to recover the property from Samara\u201d; (5) appellants\u2019 efforts to overturn the order distributing Roy and Voncile Davis\u2019s cash and mortgage to Samara have been consistently rejected by federal courts since 2004; and (6) Samara is not a party to the appeal, so it is unclear whether the district court would be Constitutionally permitted to fashion relief for appellants. And while discussed as an alternative ground for dismissal independent of equitable mootness, the district court also noted that the transfer of the Davis\u2019s mortgage to Samara had already occurred, and that Samara had already foreclosed on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-11\">For the same reasons, we agree that the parties\u2019 appeals should be dismissed for equitable mootness. First, and most im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>portantly, the Trustee completed his liquidation and distribution of Strickland\u2019s estate in 2012 and submitted his Request for Discharge that August. On this point, the Trustee conveyed to Samara the mortgage on Roy and Voncile Davis\u2019s property and Samara has completed foreclosure proceedings. Reversal of the bankruptcy court\u2019s confirmation of the Trustee\u2019s Final Report would therefore require an undoing of state foreclosure proceedings and any resulting sales of the property. This would not\u2019only alter the terms of the Trustee\u2019s liquidation and distribution plan, it would gut them entirely. Even if this Court or the district court below could undertake such actions, they would lead to inequitable results given the nearly three-year reliance on the Trustee\u2019s liquidation and distribution of Strickland\u2019s estate by A.M. Samara and other individuals who were not involved in the proceedings below. <em>See Miami Ctr. Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Bank of N.Y., </em>838 F.2d 1547, 1553 (11th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-4\">Second, appellants neither attempted to nor received a stay of the confirmation of the Trustee\u2019s Final Report pending this appeal. While they did move for a stay, pending an interlocutory appeal, they filed this <em>before </em>the bankruptcy court confirmed the Trustee\u2019s Final Report, and that motion was denied. <em>See In re Club Assocs., </em>956 F.2d at 1069-71 (discussing the importance of a stay pending appeal) and <em>In re Kahihikolo, </em>807 F.2d 1540, 1542 (11th Cir.1987) (\u201cThis court has repeatedly held that where a debtor fails to obtain a stay pending appeal of an adverse bankruptcy court order and the creditor subsequently conducts a foreclosure sale, the court of appeals is powerless to grant relief, and the appeal must be dismissed as moot.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-5\">And finally, appellants\u2019 briefs on appeal clearly establish that their opposition to the bankruptcy court\u2019s confirmation of the Trustee\u2019s Final Report arises from a suspected fraud committed on the district court <em>in the breach of contract action, </em>and not from a legitimate objection to the Final Report. Specifically, they claim that A.M. Samara alleged he was a citizen of Egypt but he is actually (1) a Palestinian national, (2) a \u201cmember of Hamas Terrorist Org. and associated with other Terrorist Org. (Documented C.I.A. Data Base)[,]\u201d and (3) a \u201cstateless\u201d individual \u201cunder [the][j]uris-diction [of the] P.L.O. [who] must comply with the \u2018Return to Palestine Policy.\u2019 \u201d As a Palestinian, appellants claim, A.M. Samara was \u201cprohibited from owning property, owning small businesses], [and] owning majority shares in companies], in any Arab League Countries\u201d and therefore must have formed Samara Consultant Group \u201csolely to defraud and or extort money from [companies or people.\u201d Consequently, appellants believe A.M. Samara \u201cnever had [standing [ ]or [s]ubject [m]at-ter to file [a] case in U.S. Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-7\">Leaving aside the merit or lack thereof of these allegations, appellants\u2019 arguments constitute a collateral attack on the jurisdiction of the district court in the breach of contract action. Appellants are attempting to file a belated Rule 60(d) motion under the guise of an appeal. This they cannot do. Such a motion should have been made before the district court in the breach of contract action. It cannot be filed in this Court on appeal of the bankruptcy court\u2019s affirmance of the Trustee\u2019s Final Report: something we earlier told appellants <em>in this very case. </em>That\u2019s not all: appellants <em>have </em>previously presented their attack on the jurisdiction of the district court in the breach of contract action to the courts with authority to adjudicate such claims, and those courts roundly rejected appellants\u2019 arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-8\">Thus, for the above reasons, the appeals of the bankruptcy court\u2019s affirmance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>Trustee\u2019s Final Report are equitably moot and the district court correctly dismissed them. The opinion of the district court is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1062-9\">. As discussed, we agree that four of the notices were untimely.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1063-7\">. Or so it appeared to the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1064-6\">. The court described the Strickland Notices as signed by Roy Davis, alone. Actually, Roy Davis, Voncile Davis, Cindy Taylor, and Melissa Terrell, each, submitted a notice on Strickland\u2019s behalf. This fact does not alter the district court\u2019s or this Court's analysis, though: other than the signatories, none of whom are attorneys, the Strickland Notices are identical.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1065-9\">. We are not totally sold on the argument that Roy Davis filed the May 10, 2012 notice both on behalf of Strickland and also in his individual capacity. Nevertheless, we will give Davis the benefit of the doubt and evaluate his May 29, 2012 notice as both an initial filing and also as an amended notice filed in response to the bankruptcy court's May 11, 2012 order. See <em>supra </em>at note 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1066-7\">. To the extent the bankruptcy court\u2019s May 11 order notified Strickland that its notice of appeal \"must be signed and dated by the movant[,]\u201d such did not suffice to put Strickland on notice that it must be represented by counsel or else suffer dismissal of its appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
