In the complaint, he claimed his incarceration (of a heroin addict) violated the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual pdnishment because the State acted with deliberate indifference. A dismissal for failure to state a claim is reviewed <em>de novo. E.g., Varela v. Gonzales, </em>773 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Aguilar\u2019s contention, that the Attorney General of Texas lacked standing to file the motion to dismiss his complaint, fails because, under Texas law, the Texas Attorney General serves as the common legal representative of State agencies. <em>E.g., Sierra Club v. City of San Antonio, </em>115 F.3d 311, 314 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Aguilar neither recognizes nor challenges the district court\u2019s conclusions that his complaint was barred by the Eleventh Amendment and <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Accordingly, he has abandoned any challenge to those conclusions. <em>E.g., Brinkmann v. Dali. Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Furthermore, Aguilar\u2019s reliance on <em>Robinson v. California, </em>370 U.S. 660, 666-67, 82 S.Ct. 1417, 8 L.Ed.2d 758 (1962), is misplaced because he was not convicted under Texas law based on his use of heroin, but because he possessed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b272-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
