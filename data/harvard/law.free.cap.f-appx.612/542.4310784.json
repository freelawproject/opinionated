BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">A. Conviction and Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">On July 24, 2009, Mitchell pled guilty to: (1) distributing more than five grams of a mixture and substance containing cocaine base, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(l)(B)(iii), and 841(b)(1)(C); (2) being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g) and 924(e); and (3) possessing a firearm in connection with drug trafficking, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)\u00ae. On April 15, 2010, the district court sentenced Mitchell to a total of 240 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">On direct appeal, Mitchell\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). This Court\u2019s review revealed no arguable issues of merit, and thus this Court granted counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and affirmed Mitchell\u2019s convictions and sentence. <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>406 Fed.Appx. 453 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">B. Present \u00a7 2255 Motion to Vacate</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">On August 17, 2011, Mitchell <em>pro se </em>filed the present \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate. Mitchell enumerated several grounds on which he claimed he was being held in violation of the Constitution or federal laws, most of which related to Mitchell\u2019s health at the time he agreed to the plea. Mitchell suffered from kidney failure and alleges that his sickness, in combination with extensive medication, undermined his ability to work with, and understand, his counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-12\">Among the allegations, Mitchell claimed that his counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge the drug quantity amount. Specifically, Mitchell alleged that he would not have pleaded guilty to a larger drug quantity than he actually possessed but for: (1) his medicated state, and (2) counsel\u2019s advice that \u201cthere was a new law coming out that would free [him] from the access charges.\u201d Mitchell attached a two-page conclusion to his \u00a7 2255 form. In this conclusion, he reiterated that his \u201c[c]ounsel advised that based on the new laws Petitioner would not serve much time[,] so [counsel] insisted that I accept the plea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-13\">Separately, on August 29, 2012, Mitchell filed a supplement to his \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate. Within this supplement, Mitchell wrote: \u201c[m]ovant preserves his issue pending the Supreme Court\u2019s consideration of <em>Abbott v. United </em>States....\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-14\">Mitchell\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was assigned to a magistrate judge. On April 8, 2014, the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d) that recommended denying the \u00a7 2255 motion on the merits. The R &amp; R did not address Mitchell\u2019s claim that his decision to plead guilty was based on counsel\u2019s advice that he would not serve \u201cmuch time\u201d based on \u201cnew laws.\u201d Nor did the R &amp; R address whether the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Abbott </em>impacted Mitchell\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. Further, the magistrate judge recommended denying Mitchell a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-15\">Mitchell raised objections to the R &amp; R, but did not specifically argue that the magistrate judge failed to address his ineffective-assistance claim based on the advice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>that, under new laws, Mitchell would not serve much time.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">On May 9, 2014, the district court adopted 'the R &amp; R (with the exception of one portion not relevant to this appeal) and denied Mitchell\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. The district court also denied Mitchell\u2019s application for a COA and motion for leave to proceed on appeal <em>in forma pauperis (\u201cIFF\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Mitchell timely appealed the denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion. He then filed motions to proceed IFP and for a COA with this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">C. Certificate of Appealability</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">On November 3, 2014, a judge of this Court granted a COA on the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-8\">Whether the district court\u2019s failure to address Mitchell\u2019s claim, that his trial .attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel by advising him to plead guilty because he would have his sentence retroactively reduced pursuant to the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372, or a pending U.S. Supreme Court case related to the application of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(i), violated this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 938 (11th Cir.1992) <em>(en banc).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A_j\">A. The <em>Clisby </em>Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">The <em>Clisby </em>rule in our Circuit requires district courts to resolve all claims for relief raised in habeas proceedings, regardless of whether that relief is granted or denied. <em>Clisby, </em>960 F.2d at 935-36 (involving a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition filed by a state prisoner); <em>see Rhode v. United States, </em>583 F.3d 1289, 1291 (11th Cir.2009) (holding that <em>Clisby </em>applies to \u00a7 2255 proceedings).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When a district court does not address all of the claims presented in a motion to vacate, we \u201cwill vacate the district court\u2019s judgment without prejudice and remand the case for consideration of all remaining claims.\u201d <em>Clisby, </em>960 F.2d at 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-13\">A \u201cclaim for relief\u2019 is defined as \u201cany allegation of a constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 936. Ineffective assistance of counsel constitutes a violation of a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights, and is thus a claim of a constitutional violation. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 684-86, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2063-64, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-14\">An unresolved claim constitutes a <em>Clisby </em>error regardless of the reason the claim was not resolved. <em>Puiatti v. McNeil, </em>626 F.3d 1283, 1307 (11th Cir.2010). But a claim must be raised in a way that the district court cannot misunderstand it in order for the district court to resolve it. <em>Smith v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>572 F.3d 1327, 1352 (11th Cir.2009). In <em>Smith, </em>this Court held that a petitioner failed to fairly present a legal argument to the district court when that argument was mentioned in only one sentence of a 116-page habeas petition, without citing any authority, and was not mentioned in a 123-page supporting memorandum of law. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Dupree v. Warden, </em>715 F.3d 1295, 1299 (11th Cir.2013), however, this Court held that \u201ctwo sentences found in the middle of a fifteen-page memorandum attached to [a \u00a7 2254] petition\u201d sufficiently raised an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. Because the district court did not resolve the claim, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Court vacated and remanded as a violation of the <em>Clisby </em>rule. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">After reviewing the record here, we conclude that Mitchell adequately presented the ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim contained in the COA. On his \u00a7 2255 form, he twice claimed that counsel advised him that he would not serve \u201cmuch time\u201d based on \u201cnew laws.\u201d Mitchell\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was not lengthy, consisting of four short paragraphs within the form\u2019s pages and a two-page typed conclusion. Within these pages, he made the \u201cnew laws\u201d claim twice and, whatever its merit, Mitchell raised the claim in a way that the district court could understand it'. So, too, with his clear mention of the potential pending effect of <em>Abbott v. United States. </em>Mitchell\u2019s petition is far closer to the one at issue in <em>Dupree </em>than the one at issue in <em>Smith. See Dupree, </em>715 F.3d at 1299; <em>Smith, </em>572 F.3d at 1352.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Because the district court failed to address his claim that counsel was ineffective for advising him to plead guilty based on new laws that would reduce the amount of time Mitchell may serve, it violated <em>Clisby. Clisby, </em>960 F.2d at 935-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">B. Failure to Object</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">Before concluding, we address one additional point on which <em>Dupree </em>is instructive. In <em>Dupree, </em>as in this case, before the district court denied the motion to vacate, \u201c[t]he magistrate judge did not address the claim, and [petitioner] did not object to the magistrate judge\u2019s failure to address the claim.\u201d 715 F.3d at 1299. At that time, a habeas petitioner\u2019s failure to object to a magistrate judge\u2019s failure to address legal issues did not foreclose a party\u2019s ability to seek <em>de novo </em>review on appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 1299-1300.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">In <em>Dupree, </em>however, this Court proposed that our Circuit \u201cadopt a rule for civil cases that attaches consequences to the failure to object to either factual findings or legal conclusions in a magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1305. Accordingly, this Court adopted a new rule, which took effect on December 1, 2014, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-11\">A party failing to object to a magistrate judge\u2019s findings or recommendations contained in a report and recommendation in accordance with the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1) waives the right to challenge on appeal the district court\u2019s order based on unobjected-to faet\u00fcal and legal conclusions if the party was informed of the time period for objecting and the consequences on appeal for failing to object. In the absence of a proper objection, however, the court may review on appeal for plain error if necessary in the interests of justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-12\">11th Cir. R. 3-1. Additionally, our procedural rules require that the notice given to the parties of the consequences of failing to object to a magistrate judge\u2019s factual and legal conclusions should accompany the R <em>&amp; </em>R. 11th Cir. R. 3-1, IOP 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-13\">Under our current rule, Mitchell would have waived his current objection to the district court\u2019s final order, and we would not need to address the <em>Clisby </em>error. 11th Cir. R. 3-1. But this R &amp; R was issued in April 2014, well before the adoption of the new rule, and Mitchell was not given notice that he needed to object to legal issues in the R &amp; R in order to preserve those issues on appeal. Thus, Mitchell\u2019s failure to object on the specific grounds covered by the COA here does not foreclose his ability to seek <em>de novo </em>review. <em>See Du-pree, </em>715 F.3d at 1299-1300.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-14\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b571-15\">Upon careful review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record on appeal, we vacate the denial of Mitchell\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>remand this case to the district court to address Mitchell\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b569-11\">. 562 U.S. 8, 131 S.Ct. 18, 178 L.Ed.2d 348 (2010).
