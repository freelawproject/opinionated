Now, he reurges the claim we rejected in his first appeal concerning the propriety of the district court\u2019s assessment of a 16-level adjustment to his base offense level in accordance with U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). <em>See United States v. Mazarego-Salazar, </em>590 Fed.Appx. 345, 347 (5th Cir.2014). He argues now, as he did then, that imposition of th\u00e9 disputed adjustment was improper because the documents offered in support of it were insufficient to establish the statutory subsection governing his conviction. <em>See id. </em>He concedes that this argument is barred by the law of the case doctrine and raises it only to preserve it for possible further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">\u201cGenerally, the law of the case doctrine precludes reexamination by the appellate court on a subsequent appeal of an issue of law or fact decided on a previous appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Agofsky, </em>516 F.3d 280, 283 (5th Cir.2008). Mazarego-Salazar\u2019s challenge to his sentence is barred by this doctrine. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b261-14\">Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED; its alternative motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED, and the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b261-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
