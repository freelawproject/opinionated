On appeal, he argues that his sentence exceeds the two-year statutory maximum, because the government neglected to specifically charge in his indictment a violation of \u00a7 1326(b)(2), pursuant to which his sentence was enhanced based on a prior aggravated felony conviction. He concedes that his argument has been \u201crejected\u201d by the Supreme Court in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number><em>v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but notes that he nevertheless is raising the issue to preserve it for future review in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent indications that it may reconsider <em>AImendarez-Toms\u2019s </em>holding. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">We review constitutional sentencing issues <em>de novo. United States v. Steed, </em>548 F.3d 961, 978 (11th Cir.2008). Under \u00a7 1326(a), a two-year maximum sentence applies for an alien who illegally re-enters the United States following removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). Nevertheless, pursuant to \u00a7 1326(b)(2), if an alien\u2019s initial removal was subsequent to an aggravated felony conviction, the applicable maximum sentence is 20 years. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1326(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>the Supreme Court held that, in the context of \u00a7 1326(b)(2)\u2019s penalty provision, a defendant\u2019s prior aggravated felony conviction is merely a sentencing factor that need not be charged in an indictment or proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>523 U.S. at 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219. In <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 .(2000), the Supreme Court subsequently expressed some doubt as to whether <em>Al-mendarez-Toms </em>was correctly decided, but it expressly declined to revisit that earlier decision. <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348. In excepting the <em>Almendarez-Toms </em>holding, the <em>Apprendi </em>Court ruled that \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Thereafter, the Supreme Court revisited the issues underlying <em>Almendarez-Toms </em>and <em>Apprendi, </em>this time dealing with facts that served to impose a statutory minimum sentence. <em>See Alleyne v. United States, </em>570 U.S.-,-, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 2155, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013). In <em>Alleyne, </em>the Court ruled more broadly that \u201c[ajny fact that, by law, increases the penalty for a crime is an \u2018element\u2019 that must be submitted to the jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, because the parties in <em>Alleyne </em>did not address <em>Almen-darez-Torres\u2019s </em>validity, the Court expressly said that it did not revisit that decision. <em>Alleyne, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2160 n. 1. We recently recognized that while there is some tension between <em>Alleyne </em>and <em>Apprendi </em>on the one hand, and <em>Almendarez-Toms </em>on the other, \u201c[njothing in the facts or holding of <em>Alleyne </em>indicates that it eliminated <em>Ap-prendi\u2019s </em>exception for judicial findings of prior convictions that increase a criminal penalty.\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>741 F.3d 1245, 1249-50 (11th Cir.2014). We further recognized that we were not free to overrule <em>Almendarez-Toms, </em>and that, until the Supreme Court overrules that decision, we are bound to follow it. <em>Id. </em>at 1250.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">Here, <em>Almendarez-Toires </em>forecloses the instant sentencing enhancement issue that Gonzalez-Martinez raises on appeal, as he himself concedes in his appellate brief while noting that he is raising the issue to preserve it for future review. <em>Almenda-rez-Toms </em>expressly held that a defendant\u2019s prior aggravated felony conviction is a sentencing factor that need not be charged in an indictment before it can be used to enhance his sentence under \u00a7 1326(b)(2)\u2019s penalty provision. 523 U.S. at 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219. Thus, <em>Almendarez-Toms\u2019s </em>holding precludes Gonzalez-Martinez\u2019s sole claim on appeal that his sentence was unlawful because the government had neglected to specifically charge \u00a7 1326(b)(2) in his indictment. As we\u2019ve said, <em>Almendarez-Toms </em>is binding unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>and until the Supreme Court overrules it. <em>See Hams, </em>741 F.3d at 1249-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
