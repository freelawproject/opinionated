Stoner, Social Security Administration Office Of The General Counsel, Atlanta, GA, Arthur Lee Bentley, III, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Tampa, FL, for Defendant-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b609-6\">Before. JORDAN, JILL PRYOR, and ANDERSON, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b609-7\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">James Hilliard appeals from the district court\u2019s order affirming the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) denial of his applications for a period of disability and disability insurance benefits, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). On appeal, Hilliard argues that the ALJ\u2019s <em>ex parte </em>communication with a medical expert deprived Hilliard of his right to due process and was prejudicial to him because, as a result of the communication, the ALJ gave little weight to Hilliard\u2019s treating physician\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">In Social Security appeals, we review the decision of an ALJ as the Commissioner\u2019s' final decision when the ALJ denies benefits and the Appeals Council denies review of the ALJ\u2019s decision. <em>Doughty v. Apfel, </em>245 F.3d 1274, 1278 (11th Cir.2001). We review the Commissioner\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and consider whether the Commissioner\u2019s factual findings are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Lewis v. Barnhart, </em>285 F.3d 1329, 1330 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-14\">Hilliard\u2019s brief ignores the case law regarding <em>ex parte </em>communications between an ALJ and a medical expert, or <em>ex parte </em>communications of any sort for that matter. Here, as in <em>Avondale Shipyards, Inc. v. Vinson, </em>623 F.2d 1117, 1121-22 (5th Cir.1980),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hilliard was afforded an opportunity to address the <em>ex parte </em>communication, but failed to do so. Moreover, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the communication was improper, it must have prejudiced Hilliard to warrant reversal. <em>Guenther v. Comm\u2019r, </em>889 F.2d 882, 884 (9th Cir.1989). Upon review of the briefs and the record, the Court cannot conclude that any communication between the ALJ and Dr. Hamrick prejudiced Hilliard.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Even completely ignoring Dr. Hamrick\u2019s testimony, the substantial evidence, including Hilli-ard\u2019s own testimony, supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Hilliard was not disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act at any time from the alleged onset date through the date of the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b609-10\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), we adopted as binding precedent all Fifth Circuit decisions issued before October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b609-11\">. The communication apparently involved a recommendation by the medical expert that Hilliard be referred for another psychological exam. Such recommendation was passed on to Hilliard's representative the next day, and the additional exam was subsequently scheduled.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
