CABRANES, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b529-18\">Defendant-appellant Brian S. Browder\u2014 having been convicted of possessing digital images and videos of child pornography, and having served the incarcerary portion of his sentence\u2014appeals from an order finding him in violation of two conditions of his. supervised release. The District-Court (Lawrence J. Vilardo, <em>Judge) </em>found that Browder had violated two special conditions, one requiring that Browder\u2019s computers) be monitored by the United States Probation Office, and the other requiring that Browder attend a mental health treatment program for sex offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-19\">Browder' objected to the Probation Office\u2019s implementation of both conditions. With respect to the computer monitoring violation, Browder believed, and contends on appeal, that the Probation Office\u2019s computer monitoring policy was overreaching. With respect to the treatment violation, Browder refused to sign the relevant treatment agreement because the treatment agreement purported to bar Browder from contacting his own children <em>unless </em>approved by the Probation Office and the treatment providers\u2014a requirement that conflicted with an express condition of supervised release ordered earlier by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>We conclude that Browder\u2019s challenge to the computer monitoring violation is unsuccessful, because the condition, as construed for purposes of this appeal and under our deferential review, is reasonable. But we conclude that Browder\u2019s challenge to the treatment violation has merit. Specifically, it was reasonable for Browder to object to signing a treatment agreement that conflicted with his actual sentence, and he does not appear, based op the record, to have otherwise acted unreasonably with respect to participating in such treatment. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the order in part, with respect to the violation of the computer monitoring condition; REVERSE the order in part, with respect to the violation of the treatment condition; and REMAND the cause tb the District Court for such further proceedings; consistent with this opinion, as may be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">' On October 20, 2010, Browder pleaded guilty, pursuant to an agreement, to one count of possessing child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(b). The factual basis of Browder\u2019s plea agreement provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-6\">On or about October T4,[] 2009, in the Western District of New York, the defendant possessed 462 images of child pornography in a Generic Computer in a black Antee tower. The defendant received and traded these images of child pornography over the internet using- the file sharing programs eMule and eDon-key2000. \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-12\">Some of the child pornography possessed by the defendant depicted prepubescent children younger than 12 years of age.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-13\">The affidavit accompanying the criminal complaint .against Browder attested to, among other things, the following facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Anj\">Forensic analysis also discovered that the defendant had file wiping software and had used an encrypting file system. Also, the user account for the defendant was password protected. The password reminder for the account is \u201cunouwill\u201d and the password is \u201cjerk4awhile,\u201d which was recovered during forensic analysis.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-14\">Judge Richard J. Arcara, to whom the case was originally assigned, sentenced Browder to six-and-a-half years\u2019 imprisonment followed' by :ten years\u2019 supervised release. The terms of Browder\u2019s supervised release included certain special conditions, three of which' are relevant here. The first of these special conditions required Browder to participate in the' Probation Office\u2019s Computer/Internet Monitoring Program.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The second relevant condition required Browder to participate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>in a mental health program for sexual offenders.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> And the third condition barred Browder from having deliberate- contact with minors\u2014excluding his children\u2014unless approved by the Probation Office.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">On December 24,2015, Browder finished his term of imprisonment and his term' of supervised release began. In the time leading up to and shortly after his release, Browder met with his Probation Officer (\u201cUSPO\u201d), Ann Marie Bucholtz, to review the conditions of his supervised release.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At the second, meeting, Browder indicated he wished to use a computer, and USPO Bucholtz arranged for him to bring a laptop to her office so that monitoring software could be installed on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">On March 2, 2016, Browder appeared at USPO Bucholtz\u2019s office with a laptop and was presented with a \u201cComputer Monitoring Program Participant Agreement.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That agreement\u2019s first paragraph provides in relevant part that, \u201cI understand that this agreement is, by reference, part of the order setting conditions of supervision- and that failure to comply with its provisions or the instructions of my officer will be considered a violation of my supervision and may result in adverse action.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Paragraph six of that agreement provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-13\">I agree to allow the U.S. Probation Office to install software/hardware- designed to monitor computer activities on any computer(s)/connected device(s) I own or have access to. I understand that the monitoring device may record any and.all activity on my computer, including the capture of keystrokes, application information, internet use history, email correspondence, and chat conversations.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-14\">Evidently this monitoring would be performed by a third-party private company, Remote.com.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-15\">. Browder objected to this computer monitoring agreement as overbroad and overreaching, expressing concerns, in particular about the monitoring of computer files related to his <em>pro se </em>motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7. 2255, which Browder was working on at that time. He also refused to allow USPO Bucholtz to keep the laptop or say what he would do with it. The Probation Office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>then conducted a search of Browder\u2019s home; no computer was found, but flash drives and SD (storage device) cards were. Browder refused to disclose the whereabouts of the laptop.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">During the same general time period, Browder appeared for at least two sexual offender treatment appointments at Mid-Erie Counseling and Treatment Services. His treatment was terminated, however, because he objected to the treatment agreement\u2019s inclusion of a term that conflicted with his special conditions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> That term provided that Browder would \u201clead a prosocial lifestyle and refrain from any and all willful contact, visitation, letter writing and telephone calls with <em>anyone </em>under the age of 17 years old\u201d\u2014without exception\u2014 \u201cunless approved by my parole or probation officer and the treatment team before I have contact with them.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In a letter dated March 16, 2016\u2014and which was delivered to USPO Bucholtz no later than March 23, 2016\u2014Browder documented his objection, writing as follows, in part,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> to USPO Bucholtz:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-5\">As you are aware, I have objections to Mid-Erie\u2019s \u201ctreatment agreement form\u201d that compel me not to sign. I want to be clear that I have not refused counseling; they refused to modify or allow modification of an overreaching agreement, so I could not sign, so they refused me counseling.... [T]he Restriction grants you authority to deny me any contact with my own children, even by birthday card. The court did not convey that authority to you.,.. I will not be compelled to grant that authority. That was largely why I could not sign... <footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-12\">On March 25, 2016, the Probation Office filed a violation petition alleging violations of the sex offender treatment and computer monitoring conditions. By that time, the case had been transferred from Judge Ar-cara to Judge Vilardo.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> On March 29, 2016; Judge Vilardo granted the Government\u2019s motion to detain Browder. On April 4, 2016, a violation hearing was held, with testimony from USPO Bucholtz. At the hearing\u2019s conclusion, the District Court found that the two violations were proven by a preponderance of the evidence. At sentencing, the District Court imposed a sentence of \u201ctime served\u201d and reinstated the sajne terms (duration and conditions) of supervised release as were already in effect..</p>\n<p id=\"b532-13\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-14\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b532-15\">Among Browder\u2019s arguments on appeal,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the more substantial relate to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>legal validity of the. two special conditions themselves\u2014or, perhaps more precisely, the validity of the Probation Office\u2019s implementation of those conditions. We address his arguments with respect to each condition in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">A. Violation of the Computer Monitoring Condition</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">To begin, we note that, as written, it is not clear what degree of computer monitoring the District Court imposed in this special condition. The condition, originally imposed by Judge Arcara in 2011, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-7\">The defendant shall participate in the Computer/Internet Monitoring Program administered by the U.S. Probation Office. The defendant must provide the U.S. Probation Office advance notification of any computer(s), automated service(s), or connected device(s) that he will use during the-term of supervision. Such computer or computers will be subject to monitoring by the U.S. Probation Office, consistent with' the computer monitoring policy then in effect by the probation office. In accordance with the Second Circuit\u2019s decision, United States v. Lifshitz, 269 [369] F.3d 173 (2d Cir. 2004), at footnote 11, and in light of the changing technology of computer monitoring techniques, <em>the Court finds it prudent to delay the determination of the specific terms of the condition and computer monitoring policy until the defendant\u2019s supervised release commences.</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-11\">Once Browder\u2019s supervised release began in December 2015, however,- there was no \u201cdetermination of the specific terms of the condition.\u201d (Earlier that month, the case had been transferred from Judge Ar-cara to Judge Vilardo.) Nevertheless, all the relevant parties in this case appear to have been operating on the understanding\u2014reasonably, perhaps, given some of the language in the special condition\u2014that, upon his release, Browder-was subject to whatever computer monitoring policy the Probation Office of the Western District of New York had in effect at that time. Indeed, in. this appeal, Browder seems to be challenging the policy of the Probation Office, not the sentence of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-12\">Browder\u2019s principal contention on appeal is, \u201c[i]n short,\u201d that \u201cthe computer monitoring system that the Probation Office sought to implement involved a \u2018greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary for the purposes set forth in seetion[s] 3553(a)(2)(b), (a)(2)(C), and (a)(2)(D) [of Title 18 of the United States Code].\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Browder\u2019s principal argument\u2014which seeks to apply the requirements governing the <em>imposition </em>of sentence by the District Court to the <em>execution </em>of that sentence by the Probation Office\u2014is - thus fundamentally confused. \u201c[T]he \u00e9xtensive \u2018supervision mission\u2019 of federal probation officers includes \u2018executing] the sentence,\u2019 but not imposing it.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> And while the special condition that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>Judge Vilardo originally imposed (unless and until updated and made more specific) may be subject to challenge as an impermissible delegation of judicial authority to the Probation Office,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Browder does not bring, any such challenge here.-Any delegation argument has therefore been waived in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">' In light of the foregoing, we construe the computer monitoring condition as Browder himself does\u2014that is, as having sentenced him to whatever computer monitoring policy was used by the Western District\u2019s Probation Office at his release\u2014 and consider whether that sentence, as effectuated in the Probation Office policy, was unreasonable or an \u201cabuse of discretion.\u201d <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We conclude it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d), the imposition of certain conditions of supervised release is mandatory, but \u201c[district courts also have discretion to impose other, non-mandatory conditions of supervised release,\u201d <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> which are commonly referred to as \u201cspecial conditions.\u201d Such discretion is not unbounded, however.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The United States Sentencing Guidelines provide that a district court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"abn-dedup-0\">may impose other conditions of .supervised release to the extent that such conditions (1) are <em>reasonably related </em>to (A) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of- the defendant; (B) the need for the. sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (C) the need to protect the public from .further crimes of the defendant; and (D) the need to provide the defendant \u25a0 with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, pr other correctional treatment in the most effective manner; and (2) involve no greater deprivation of liberty than, is <em>reasonably necessary </em>.for -the purposes set forth above and are consistent with any pertinent policy statements, issued by the Sentencing Commission.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>With respect to the first, \u201creasonably related\u201d requirement, \u201ca condition may be imposed if it is reasonably related to any one or more of the specified factors.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The second, \u201creasonably necessary\" requirement has a constitutional gloss' in the computer-monitoring context.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">In <em>United States v. </em>Lifshitz,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> we considered a probationer\u2019s Fourth Amendment challenge to a broadly worded computer monitoring condition.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> We explained that the special needs of supervision permit the monitoring of a supervisee\u2019s computer use, but that a \u201cmonitoring condition must be narrowly tailored, and not sweep so broadly as to draw a wide swath of extraneous material into its net.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> When irrelevant data <em>is </em>\u201cinadvertently gathered .;.,: those monitoring compliance should remain conscientiously unaware of that data.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> In other words, while a computer monitoring condition \u201cmust bear \u215b close and substantial relation\u2019 to the government\u2019s interest in pursuing the search,\u201d it need not employ \u201c \u2018the least intrusive means/ \u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> We did not hold that the condition in <em>Lifshitz </em>violated the Fourth Amendment, but we said the condition \u201cmay ... be overbroad\u201d and remanded so the district court could \u201cevaluate the privacy implications of the proposed computer monitoring techniques as well as their efficacy as compared with computer filtering.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> We also suggested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>that where there may be a significant delay before the monitoring condition comes into effect\u2014for example, in the case of supervised release\u2014\u201cit might well be prudent for- the district court to postpone the determination of the supervised release or probation conditions until an appropriate later time, when the district court\u2019s decision could be based on then-existing technological and other considerations.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Viewing the computer monitoring to which Browder is subject in light of the foregoing standards, we conclude it is reasonable. Browder was convicted of possessing over 462 digital images of child pornography that he received (and shared) on internet exchanges, so computer monitoring is \u201creasonably related\u201d to the nature and circumstances of the offense and Browder\u2019s history and characteristics. The monitoring is also \u201creasonably necessary\u201d for the broad sentencing purposes indicated in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.3(b) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including specific deterrence, public protection, and rehabilitation. Notably, there was evidence that Browder had employed computer software that could conceal or erase illicit images. And importantly, USPO Bueholtz testified\u2014and the District Court found\u2014that the third-party monitoring organization, Remote.com, notifies the Probation Office only if it detects \u201ccontraband,\u201d and would not convey any information related to Browder\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. So long as the principal concern is monitoring by the Probation Office\u2014 which, in fact, <em>is </em>Browder\u2019s principal stated concern<footnotemark>34</footnotemark>\u2014this third-party monitoring arrangement helps ensure that the monitoring remains, in the words of <em>Lifshitz, </em>\u201cnarrowly tailored.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Put differently, the monitoring at issue in this particular case is not an unreasonable or excessive deprivation of liberty.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">Accordingly, we conclude that subjecting Browder to the computer monitoring conditions described above was not an abuse of discretion. But to say that a sentence is within the range of reasonable sentences is not, of course, to say that it is the only reasonable sentence. As already explained, while Browder has waived any delegation challenge in this appeal, it is not clear that the <em>District Court </em>ever imposed on Brow-der the specific terms of monitoring re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>fleeted in the Probation Office\u2019s policy. Because we remand as to Browder \u215b mental health treatment condition in any event, we direct the District Court to review the computer monitoring condition of supervised release and to re-state the terms of <em>Browder\u2019s </em>computer monitoring condition with greater specificity.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">B. Violation of the Mental Health Treatment Condition</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Our analysis with respect to the District Court\u2019s finding that Browder violated the mental health treatment condition is more straightforward. The gravamen of Browder\u2019s complaint is simply that the proposed treatment agreement conflicted with his. actual sentence.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> In particular, the original sentence of the District Court included a specific condition prohibiting contact with minors, but it categorically excluded Browder\u2019s children from that prohibition. By contrast, the proposed treatment agreement\u2019s provision regarding contact with minors did <em>not </em>categorically exclude Browder\u2019s children.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">We agree with Browder that the treatment agreement would have subjected him to a more punitive condition governing contact with minors than did the condition to which Browder was actually sentenced by the District Court.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Browder was therefore well within his rights to object to that term of the agreement. Nor do we find that Browder otherwise acted unreasonably with respect to the treatment special condition. Browder made what appears to be a good-faith effort to attend the treatment, appearing at (at least) two sessions. In addition, Browder communicated his objection to the treatment agreement in a written letter to USPO Bucholtz, and his objection was also documented in the treatment facility\u2019s records. Nevertheless, USPO Bucholtz was unable to testify that she had read any of those documents prior to seeking a violation of this condition. Finally, any delay in Browder\u2019s receiving the mental health treatment due to his objection\u2014unlike, arguably, the risks posed by a sex offender\u2019s possession of an unmonitored computer\u2014did not pose the sort of risk that might warrant arrest and imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s finding that Browder violated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>this condition of his release by objecting, reasonably, to the treatment agreement, on the ground that it conflicted with his actual sentence, was an \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d <footnotemark>39</footnotemark>-^-that is,, an error.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">We recognize, of course, that both the no-minors-contact special condition (imposed by the District Court as part of its sentence) and the no-minors-contact term (included in the treatment agreement of Mid-Erie, the Probation Office\u2019s chosen treatment provider) allowed for contacts with minors <em>if approved </em>by the Probation Office. The District Court appears to have placed significant weight on USPO Bu-choltz\u2019s testimony that, if Br\u00fawder had sought permission to contact his daughters, the Probation Office would have approved it; indeed, the District Court noted that, given Browder\u2019s sentence, the Office had no choice but to do so.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Even if that were the case, however, approvals from the Probation Office are insufficient to remedy the issue raised by Browder; First, the treatment agreement actually required the approval not only of the Probation Office, but also of \u201cthe treatment team\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark>\u2014something the District Court did not address and over which it had no direct oversight. Second, and more fundamentally, the District Court misapprehended the relationship between a defendant\u2019s sentence (by a judge) and. its execution (by a probation officer). The key question is not whether permission, if sought, would be granted; it is whether Browder can be required, by the Probation Office or its designee, to ask in the first place. Because such a requirement as to Browder\u2019s children would contradict, rather than execute, Browder\u2019s sentence, the Probation Office was plainly without power to impose it, as Browder correctly argued.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">To summarize, we hold as follows..</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-11\">(1) Browder\u2019s challenge to that part of the District Court\u2019s order finding that he had violated his compute^ monitoring condition is unsuccessful because the condition, as construed for purposes of this appeal and under our deferential review, is reasonable.

The history of this case indicates that our well-meaning suggestion may at times fare better in theory than in fact. At a minimum, rather than delaying imposition of sentence, it may be more practical for a district court to impose the full sentence (including, that is, the specific terms of any computer monitoring or filtering condition) in the first instance. If less invasive means of computer supervision arise, through technological or other innovation, the defendant or the government is free to seek modification of the condition, <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(2) (providing a court \u201cmay modify, reduce, or enlarge the conditions of supervised release, at any time prior to the expiration or termination of the term of supervised release, pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure relating to the modification of probation and the provisions applicable to the initial setting of the terms and conditions of post-release supervision\u201d); Fed.
