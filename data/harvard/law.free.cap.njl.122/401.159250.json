Was this proper?</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">It is argued that there is no direct adjudication by the courts of our state which is determinative of the issue in the ease at bar. Be that as it may, it is, however, well settled that: \u201cThe rules which determine the negligence of conduct threatening harm to another\u2019s interest in the physical condition of land and chattels are the same as those which determine the negligence of conduct which threatens bodily harm.\u201d <em>Restatement of the Law on Torts, Negligence, </em>1934, <em>ch. </em>18 <em>(Harm to Land or </em>Chattels), <em>p. </em>1287, \u00a7 497. And: \u201cThe rules which determine the causal relation between conduct involving an unreasonable risk or harm to the physical condition of another\u2019s lands or chattels which is necessary to make the actor liable for such harm are [again] the same as those which determine the causal relation necessary to make an actor, who by his negligent conduct has subjected himself to liability for the bodily harm of another, liable for such harm.\u201d Section 49, <em>Op. Cit., supra, </em>page 1290.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">In 2 <em>C. J. S., lit. \u201cAdjoining Landowners,\u201d </em>\u00a7 1, the rule of law is stated so: \u201cA landowner must so use his property as not to injure the legal rights of neighbors. * * * and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>must refrain from actively, wrongful, negligent or unskilful acts causing unnecessary injury to adjoining premises.\u201d From this basic principle flows some of the following rules: \"A landowner who maintains or permits the existence of something potentially dangerous to adjoining property must take precaution that no damage ensues.\u201d <em>Op. Cil., supra, </em>\u00a7 43. <em>\u201cA </em>landowner who negligently permits injurious matter to pass from his land onto that of the adjoining proprietor is liable for the damage thereby ensuing. The fact that the injured owner has not erected barriers to protect himself or has not sought to minimize damages does not preclude recovery, although failure to minimize damages may go to the extent of recovery.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">We are, therefore, of the opinion that the law applicable in this type of a case is that the owner of a piece of land in its natural condition is, as a general rule, not accountable for physical results due to extraordinary or even ordinary forces of nature so long as he has not interfered with the natural condition; but when he undertakes to make artificial changes in the land as, for example, by the storing or depositing of movable material on his land which afterward is carried by the ordinary force of nature, the owner becomes liable for his negligence if any. For the test of his liability is negligence. <em>Cf. Brownsey </em>v. <em>General Printing Ink Corp., </em>118 <em>N. J. L. </em>505; 193 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>824; <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Gruskin (Supreme Court of Errors of Connecticut), </em>161 <em>Id. </em>795; <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Readsboro Chair Manufacturing Co. (Supreme Court of Vermont), </em>81 <em>Id. </em>454.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Thus whether defendant, under the stated determinative rules, was negligent as charged, or whether, as defendant argues, the alleged acts of negligence were in fact merely the resultant consequences occasioned exclusively (without active human intervention or neglect, or failure to act) by the violence of nature incapable of being avoided or foreseen, are factors which, if proved, require submission of that proof to the jury (if there be a jury) under proper instructions by the trial judge; and if the cause be tried without a jury, the trial judge is required to determine the issues upon the proofs submitted under the principles of law applicable thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>It was, therefore, under the circumstances exhibited, reversible error for the court to quash the summons and to strike out the state of demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">Accordingly, judgment is reversed. Costs are to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
