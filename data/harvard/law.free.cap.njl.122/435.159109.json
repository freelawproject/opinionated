J. Mis. R. </em>34.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-13\">The statute, <em>R. S. 19 </em>:5-4, provides for a term of office of three years \u201cor until a successor is elected,\u201d and in case of vacancy, howsoever caused, to he filled by the members of the County Committee in the county where the vacancy occurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>We conclude that the voiding of the election of the successor of relator caused a vacancy in the office, <em>B. S. </em>19:3-25; and that relator was thus continued in office until the election of his successor. It further appears, after the said voiding of the election of relator\u2019s successor, that on March 13th, 1939, the members of the County Committee of Hudson county did, in fact, duly elect a successor to fill the vacancy. That election was under the authority of the statute and divested relator of his right to continue to hold over in the \u25a0office.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">The sole meritorious question presented is whether or not the County Committee was within its right in filling this vacancy. Finding that it was, the writ will be discharged, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
