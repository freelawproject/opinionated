JOSEPH JADACH, PLAINTIFF IN ERROR.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b625-5\">Submitted May 2, 1939</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A6\">Decided June 29, 1939.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b625-8\">Before Brogan, Chief Justice, and Justices Donges and Porter.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b625-9\">For the plaintiff in error, <em>Hyman Tulbowitz.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b625-10\">For the defendant in error, <em>Daniel O\u2019Regan </em>and <em>Raymond J.

The trial took place on December 12th, 1938, in the Hudson County Court of Quarter Sessions, and the jury found the plaintiff in error, and the other two defendants, guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-13\">The plaintiff in error asserts that there was no evidence to connect him with the hold-up and that it was error for the trial judge to deny the motion for acquittal at the close of the state\u2019s case. We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-14\">The state proved that one John Elanagan was attending the gasoline station; that three young men drove up in a car bearing the license number H-13412; that Elanagan identified two of the men as Wylot and Giannino, joint defendants with plaintiff in error; that Elanagan was unable to identify the third young man at the driving wheel, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>he kept his face turned from Elanagan. It was established that plaintiff in error, with the other two defendants, rented space in a garage for the identical car used in the hold-up. In a statement to police authorities by plaintiff in error, he said: \u201cThen another night we went out for a ride and when we reached Secaucus we drove into a gasoline station and got some gas and again Wylot and Iggie took the man into the station and came out and got in and told me to drive away, and we drove home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">These circumstances clearly raised a question of fact as to the presence of plaintiff in error at the scene of the holdup in Secaucus and as to his knowing participation therein. He did not testify, nor was there any contradiction of any of the state\u2019s evidence. In the factual situation presented, we conclude that there was a question of fact for the jury\u2019s determination as to the presence and unlawful participation of' plaintiff in error in the alleged offense, and that the motion for acquittal was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Plaintiff in error makes general allegations of error in the admission of evidence and in the refusal to permit some questions on cross-examination. None of the reasons or specifications assigned as error are argued in plaintiff in error\u2019s brief, but we have carefully examined same and conclude that there was no harmful error on the part of the trial judge in his rulings or in his charge to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The conviction and judgment under review will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
