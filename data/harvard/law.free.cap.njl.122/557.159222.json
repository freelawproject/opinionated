L., p. </em>283; <em>Comp. Stat. </em>1910, <em>p. </em>5184; <em>R. S. </em>1937, 40:171-103), the governing body of the city of Newark adopted an ordinance fixing at three years the term of office of the receiver of taxes of the municipality; and on October 16th, 1936, while the ordinance was still in effect, prosecutor was appointed to that office for the term thus prescribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">On May 18th, 1937, the governing body adopted a resolution appointing one Byrne as \u201cActing Receiver of Taxes\u201d of the municipality. On August 18th,. 1937, following the decision of this court in <em>Pellecchia </em>v. Mattia, 118 <em>N. J. L. </em>512, this resolution was rescinded; and it is stipulated that \u201cimmediately thereafter,\u201d the director of revenue and finance of the municipality appointed Byrne \u201cReceiver of Taxes and Acting Receiver of Taxes at a salary of $5,000 per year,\u201d and that the said appointee, as such, exercised and performed \u201cthe same duties and functions and\u201d occupied \u201cthe same offices as\u201d theretofore \u201coccupied by prosecutor in his capacity and office of Receiver of Taxes.\u201d On December 8th, 1937, Byrne was, also by resolution of the governing body, \u201cappointed Acting Treasurer at the salary of $5,000 per year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">On certiorari, this court ruled that, by force of the ordinance adopted on April 3d, 1903, the office of receiver of taxes continued in existence, and that the proceedings adverted to constituted an unlawful removal of prosecutor therefrom before the expiration of his term. <em>Mattia </em>v. <em>Newark </em>119 <em>N. J. L. </em>268.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>Thereafter, on February 23d, 1938, the municipal governing body adopted an ordinance abolishing \u201cthe offices of Receiver of Taxes, Comptroller, Auditor of Accounts and Treasurer,\u201d and providing that \u201call power, authority and duties\u201d theretofore \u201cpertaining to\u201d said offices \u201cshall be exercised and performed by the Director of the Department of Revenue and Finance with such assistance as may he necessary to carry on the duties of said offices;\u201d that the director shall have and possess \u201call the power, authority and rights now or\u201d theretofore \u201cvested in the said Receiver of Taxes, Comptroller, Auditor of Accounts and Treasurer;\u201d and that \u201cthe positions of Acting Receiver of Taxes, Acting Comptroller, Acting Auditor of Accounts and Acting Treasurer be and they are hereby created in the Department of Revenue and Finance to assist the Director of the said Department in the carrying out of the duties of said offices.\u201d This ordinance is now brought up for review on <em>certiorari.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">Conceding that power to abolish the particular office resided in the governing body, the insistence is that the ordinance \u201cwas not passed in good faith, for economic reasons or for promotion of greater efficiency in public service.\u201d The point is well made.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">We are of the view that, as regards prosecutor, the action thus taken was <em>ultra vires </em>the municipality, in that its obvious design was to deprive him of his office in contravention of the provision of the act of 1902, <em>supra, </em>that the incumbent of such office, when the term shall have been fixed in the exercise of the authority therein granted, \u201cshall hold office until the expiration of the term so fixed, unless sooner removed for cause, after a hearing given, upon charges preferred.\u201d It is stipulated that, at the time of the adoption of the challenged ordinance, prosecutor\u2019s term had not expired, and that he had not \u201cbeen removed from office for cause,\u201d in the manner laid down in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">There was a mere colorable abolition of the office. The ordinance provides that the duties of the office shall be performed by an \u201cActing Receiver of Taxes;\u201d and it is stipulated that \u201cthe duties, salary and departments under the supervision of the acting receiver of taxes and even the office space <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>assigned for the use of said acting receiver of taxes are identical to those of the receiver of taxes, which office the prosecutor was appointed to and held, as aforesaid, and that said duties, salary, departments and offices will continue to be the same.\u201d Thus it is that the office continues in existence with a minor variation of title that denotes mere impermanency of tenure without change in the nature or <em>quantum </em>of the duties to be performed by the incumbent. The formal assignment of the duties of the office to the departmental head is of no significance. This function was designed to be supervisory, and plainly existed before under the law. The office has not in fact been abolished; and there is therefore no room for the application of the principle that, regardless of motive, the actual abolition of a wholly useless office will be sustained as in the public interest. <em>Camden </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commission, </em>118 <em>N. J. L. </em>501; <em>Santucci </em>v. Paterson, 113 <em>Id. </em>192; <em>Hunziker </em>v. Kent, 111 <em>Id. </em>565; <em>Womsley </em>v. <em>Jersey </em>City, 61 <em>Id. </em>499; <em>Jacoby </em>v. Carteret, 12 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>199.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">It suffices to add that judicial sanction of the course taken in the instant case would emasculate all such statutory tenure-of-office provisions. And it will not be amiss to add that there is a distinction of substance between abolition of an office and the reduction of salary in a <em>bona fide </em>effort to practice economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">In so far as it purports to abolish the office held by prosecutor, the ordinance is invalid, and judgment is directed accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
