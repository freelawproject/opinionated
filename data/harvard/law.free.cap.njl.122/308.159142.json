The surrounding territory is largely residential. Immediately upon learning, after the grant of the permit, that the design of prosecutor was to devote the proposed building to the conduct of a self-service food market, employing approximately fifty people, neighboring property owners appealed the action thus taken by the building inspector to the board of adjustment. And that body, after hearing, ruled that the zoning ordinance established \u201cminimum requirements * * * for the promotion of the public health, safety', comfort, convenience and general welfare;\u201d that a duty rested upon it, in a case such as this, to \u201cinterpret and apply the provisions of the ordinance so that its general purposes and intent may be realized and substantial justice done;\u201d that the specification of prohibited uses in business zones, contained in section III of the ordinance, \u201cmust be read in the light of the general purposes and intent of the ordinance, that is to lessen congestion in the streets, to promote health, morals and the general welfare, to secure safety from fire and other dangers;\u201d that, while \u201cnot specifically prohibited as a use under section 3 of the ordinance, the food market\u201d to be erected \u201ccomes within ihat class of trades and uses which section 3 excludes from business zones,\u201d notably \u201ccertain businesses employing more than four (4) persons * * *, garages for more than five (5) motor vehicles and motor vehicle service stations \u2014 both being trades inimical to the public health, safety and welfare,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>\u201ccertain amusement businesses which invariably attract crowds;\u201d that the proposed market \u201cis intended to attract a large clientele,\u201d and \u201cis to be erected in a neighborhood devoted to residences of the better type,\u201d at a distance of approximately two hundred and fifty feet from the Central High School, \u201cwhere over three thousand children attend classes daily,\u201d and \u201ca short block away\u201d from \u201cthe fifth most dangerous corner, in point of view of accidents, in the city;\u201d that nine hundred and seventy-five cars pass that intersection per hour, four hundred and fifty-five of which pass the site of the food market, and that the devotion of the property to such use will substantially increase traffic hazards, and also \u201cunfavorably affect the entire neighborhood and those who dwell in it,\u201d and decrease the \u201cvaluation\u201d of neighborhood properties; and that the proposed use \u201cwill not promote the public health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare, but will definitely impair them,\u201d and therefore the building inspector \u201cerred in issuing the permit in question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">The primary question therefore is whether the Board of Adjustment was invested with the authority thus exercised. Prosecutor maintains the negative of this proposition, while defendants insist that it is derived from section IX of the ordinance, conferring upon the board power, \u201cin a specific case, after public notice and hearing, and subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards,\u201d to \u201cdetermine and vary the application of the regulations\u201d therein \u201cestablished in harmony with their general purpose and intent, without changing the boundaries of the respective zones, as follows: * * <em>6. </em>Vary any requirement\u201d of the ordinance \u201cin harmony with its general purposes and intent, so that substantial justice may be done;\u201d and also from section XIY of the ordinance, providing that \u201cin their interpretation and application the provisions\u201d of the ordinance \u201cshall be held to be the minimum requirements adopted for the promotion of the public health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare.\u201d The latter provision in particular was invoked by the board as conferring the power exercised.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">We are of the view that the action thus taken by the board was <em>coram non judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>The ordinance established the zones; and it is provided by section I that \u201cNo building or premises shall be erected, altered or used for any other than a purpose permitted in the. zone in which such building shall bo erected except in conformity with the regulations herein prescribed for the zone in which such building is located.\u201d Section II enumerates the buildings and uses permissible in residence zones. Section III specifies the uses prohibited in business zones. Viewing subdivision 19 thereof in relation to the whole, it plainly evinces an intention to permit the use of premises in such zones for retail store purposes. The character of the detailed prohibitions is clearly indicative of this design. A retail food market, such as that proposed in the instant case, falls into this category. There is revealed no purpose to make such use of premises in a business zone dependent upon either the size of the establishment, the volume of business, or the number of employes. The residential character of the surrounding territory is beside the point. After all, the lands are in an area zoned for business, with certain definite exceptions not embracive of the use under consideration; and there must be uniformity of application. Arbitrary distinctions are inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">Section IX (a-6), <em>supra, </em>does not confer the claimed authority. It merely vests in the board power to \u201cvary any requirement\u201d of the ordinance \u201cin harmony with its general purposes and intent, so that substantial justice may be done.\u201d This does not embrace the broadening of the restrictions laid down in the ordinance. It is expressly provided that \u201cthis authority shall be exercised solely in instances where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter\u201d of the ordinance, and \u201cin a manner to secure the public health, safety and general welfare.\u201d And the associated specifications of power in this section reveal a design to authorize a variance from the requirements of the ordinance in certain cases, not to vest in the board power to enlarge its inhibitions. <em>Lutz </em>v. <em>Kaltenbach, </em>102 <em>N. J. L. </em>718; <em>Losick </em>v. <em>Binda, </em>102 <em>Id. </em>157.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Nor is the authority exercised comprehended by section XIV of the ordinance. It simply provides that, in the inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>pretation and application of the regulations therein prescribed, they \u201cshall be held to be the minimum requirements adopted for the promotion of the public health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare.\u201d Viewed in the light of the explanatory statement of intention embodied in that section, the manifest design was to make clear that, in the interpretation of the ordinance, such regulations were to be regarded as minimum requirements only, and not as an impairment of the greater requirements imposed by \u201cexisting provisions of the law or ordinance,\u201d or \u201crules, regulations or permits previously adopted or issued, or which shall be adopted or issued pursuant to law, relating to the use of buildings or premises,\u201d or \u201cany easements, covenants or other agreements between parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Chapter 274 of the laws of 1928 (incorporated in the Revised Statutes of 1937 as sections 40:55-30, <em>et seq.), </em>adopted pursuant to the zoning amendment of the State Constitution ratified on October 18th, 1927, delimited the essential powers of the local Board of Adjustment in language substantially like that contained in the zoning statute of 1924 <em>(Pamph. L., p. </em>324), and provided that all existing zoning ordinances should \u201cremain in full force and effect, except in so far as they were inconsistent with the provisions\u201d of the act, \u201cuntil they shall have been amended, or repealed by the governing body or board of public works.\u201d And this is what our court of last resort has said respecting the scope of these provisions: \u201cThis court, in <em>H. Krumgold &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Jersey City, ante, p. </em>170, held: \u201cWhere a zoning ordinance is ineffective to deprive an owner of property of his right to use the same for store purposes, no appeal to a board of appeals constituted under said ordinance is necessary as a prerequisite for an application for a writ of <em>mandamus \u2019 </em>And in <em>Losick </em>v. Binda, <em>ante, p. </em>157, we further held that boards, such as boards of adjustment, are created for, and have jurisdiction, only for the purpose of dealing with properties peculiarly situated with reference to zoning requirements and to provide for equitable modifications where it is apparent unnecessary hardship would result to the owner if the provisions of the ordinance were literally enforced, as in <em>Allen </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>v. Paterson, 98 <em>N. J. L. </em>661; <em>affirmed, </em>99 <em>Id. </em>532, and have no authority or jurisdiction to act as an appellate body for the purpose of reviewing the legal or equitable character of the building inspector\u2019s act in allowing or rejecting an application for a building permit, nor to pass upon the question as to whether the provisions of the zoning ordinance are in furtherance of the proper exercise of the police power of the municipality.\u201d <em>Lutz </em>v. <em>Kaltenbach, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The resolution of revocation adopted by the Board of Adjustment is therefore vacated, but without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
