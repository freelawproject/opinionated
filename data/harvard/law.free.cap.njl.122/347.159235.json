In other words, respondent\u2019s claim is that decedent died as the result of an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">The proofs disclose substantially the following facts: Paul Rother, deceased, respondent\u2019s husband, fifty-three years of age and afflicted with a heart condition since 1927, was employed by prosecutor and reported for work at eight a. m., on May 4th, 1936. Prosecutor sent him to a doctor to be, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>and he was, examined. He reported for work about one p. m., of the day of his employment. He was put to work unloading a freight car which contained crates of oranges. More specifically, his work consisted of placing the crates of oranges on a hand truck placed in the freight car and carrying twelve crates; each crate weighed, variously estimated, from sixty to eighty-five pounds. He worked at one end of the freight car and a fellow employe worked at the other end. Another employe pulled the hand trucks out as they were loaded. Some time between one-thirty and one-forty-five p. m., of his first hour of work, a fellow employe saw him lying face down on the floor of the car; no one saw him collapse or fall. He was \u201cbreathing hard in a shivery manner, shaking.\u201d He was taken outside the car for some air but died a few minutes thereafter. Additionally, each party offered medical proof in support of their respective claims as stated in the question requiring discussion in this cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">Upon the proofs so adduced, it was determined in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Bureau that \u201cdecedent\u2019s death was due to his employment. That the unusual effort aggravated the pre-existing condition resulting in his demise.\u201d Accordingly respondent was awarded compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">On appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Hudson county the finding of the bureau, and the award there made, was affirmed. The writ of <em>certiorari </em>seeks to review tire judgment of the Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The proofs in the case at bar are entirely unlike the proofs in <em>Hentz </em>v. <em>Janssen Dairy </em>Corp., 121 <em>N. J. L. </em>161, 166; 1 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>751, which is urged by the prosecutor as dispositive of this cause. In the Hentz case deceased delivered and collected milk bottles; he had been doing that same work for several years. The court concluded that the proofs in that case established, if anything, that \u201cit was simply a case of overwork.\u201d Not so here. On the contrary, the proofs and proper dedueible inferences to be drawn therefrom fully support the finding below, in which we fully concur, that the work which decedent did at the time of his death called for and was giveti \u201cunusual effort.\u201d Erom that unusual effort, came \u201cunusual exertion.\u201d Both factors \u2014 the unusual effort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>and the resultant unusual exertion \u2014 did, indeed, aggravate decedent\u2019s pre-existing condition as a result of which he died of \u201csyncope due to cardiac disease probably myocardial in nature.\u201d Under such circumstances decedent\u2019s death is compensable ; it arose out of and in the course of his employment. We so find.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">We perceive nothing in principle which distinguishes the instant case from the class of cases of which <em>Bernstein Furniture Co. </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>114 <em>N. J. L. </em>500; 177 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>554; <em>affirmed, </em>115 <em>N. J. L. </em>500; 180 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>832, and <em>Schneider </em>v. <em>F. &amp; C. Haerter, </em>119 <em>N. J. L. </em>548; 197 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>281, are typical; they are dispositive of the ease at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The writ is dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
