Wiener.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b571-5\">For the petitioning defendant, <em>Evans, Smith &amp; Evans.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b571-6\">Heher, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4y\">The gravamen of the complaint is the \u201cspeaking and publishing\u201d by defendant Urdang, \u201cacting\u201d as the \u201cagent and servant\u201d of his co-defendant \u2014 it is also alleged that he was the company\u2019s \u201cauthorized agent * * * for the purpose of furthering and fostering sales of cash registers manufactured by\u201d it \u2014 \u201cin the presence and place of business\u201d of others, \u201cincluding certain customers\u201d of plaintiff, of certain \u201cfalse, scandalous and defamatory words of and concerning the plaintiff * * * for the purpose of injuring\u201d him \u201cin his good name, integrity, fame and reputation for honesty and reliability\u201d in his business; and the corporate defendant\u2019s petition for removal, under section 28 of the Federal Judicial Code (28 <em>U. S. C. A., </em>\u00a7 71), is grounded in the claim that the \u201clitigation presents a separable controversy as to\u201d it, and \u201cproperly could be fully determined without the presence of\u201d the individual defendant, and the cause is therefore removable for diversity of citizenship.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">More specifically, it is averred that the complaint does not allege that the corporate defendant authorized the uttering by its co-defendant of the pleaded defamatory words, or that it \u201cratified\u201d his \u201cacts;\u201d that, under the laws of New Jersey, \u201cthe mere fact that a person is employed by another does not furnish any basis to find as a fact that he has implied power to make false and scandalous accusations;\u201d that Urdang, a citizen of New Jersey, \u201cis wrongfully and fraudulently joined as a defendant\u201d with the petitioning defendant \u201cfor the sole purpose of preventing a removal\u201d of the cause to the Federal Court, and such joinder \u201cwas merely a sham or device to prevent an exercise of such a removal by this defendant;\u201d that \u201cplaintiff well knew all along that this defendant was not in any degree whatsoever responsible for the alleged action of the defendant\u201d Urdang, and was \u201cnot guilty of any joint tort and was not present when defendant\u201d Urdang \u201callegedly spoke the false, scandalous and defamatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>words, and that this defendant did no act or deed which caused or contributed to any damage alleged to have been suffered by the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">The rule is invoked that the \u201cpower to make false and slanderous accusations\u201d is not to be implied from the relationship of master and servant (citing <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Crossley, </em>14 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>501; <em>affirmed, </em>117 <em>N. J. L. </em>525); and it is argued that the complaint on its face discloses an \u201cimproper joinder,\u201d and that the allegations of the petition for removal, which \u201cmust be taken by a state court as true,\u201d reveal the joinder as \u201ca sham or fraudulent device to prevent a removal.\u201d I do not yield the argument so made.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Apart from the cited allegations of the complaint, it is pleaded that the utterances complained of \u201cwere false and malicious and were spoken by the said\u201d Ur dang \u201cas the agent and servant of\u201d the corporate defendant, \u201cfor the purpose of so injuring * * * plaintiff in the operation of his said business that it,\u201d the corporate defendant, \u201cwould secure the sales which might otherwise go to its competitor, the said plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">While not phrased with technical nicety, these averments, if established by evidence, are sufficiently broad to sustain a judgment against the corporate defendant for the averred tortious act of its servant. And it was proper to join the master and servant as defendants in the one suit. See <em>Hoboken Printing Co. </em>v. <em>Kahn, </em>59 <em>N. J. L. </em>218; <em>Evening Journal Association </em>v. <em>McDermott, </em>44 <em>Id. </em>430; <em>Brokaw </em>v. <em>New Jersey Railroad and Transportation Co., </em>32 <em>Id. </em>328. The legal sufficiency of the complaint and the procedural propriety of the joinder are questions of state law. <em>Chicago, R. I. and P. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Schwyhart, </em>227 <em>U. S. </em>184; 33 <em>S. Ct. </em>250; 57 <em>L. Ed. </em>473; <em>Chicago, R. I. and P. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Whiteaker, </em>239 <em>U. S. </em>421; 36 <em>S. Ct. </em>152; 60 <em>L. Ed. </em>360; <em>Erie Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Tompkins, </em>304 <em>U. S. </em>64; 58 <em>S. Ct. </em>817; 82 <em>L. Ed. </em>1188. Moreover, the technical sufficiency of the complaint as regards the corporate defendant is a wholly irrelevant inquiry in this proceeding, for it is plainly adequate as to the individual defendant, who is a citizen of the same state as the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>And it is also the settled rule that, where the claim is fraudulent joinder to prevent removal, it is requisite that the petition contain a \u201cstatement of facts rightly engendering\u201d such a conclusion; otherwise, the state court is not ousted of jurisdiction. The bare allegation that the joinder was so motivated does not suffice. The showing must be such \u201cas compels the conclusion that the joinder is without right and made in bad faith;\u201d merely to traverse the allegations of liability is not enough. <em>Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Cockrell, </em>232 <em>U. S. </em>146; 34 <em>S. Ct. </em>278; 58 <em>L. Ed. </em>544; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Republic Iron and Steel Co., </em>257 <em>U. S. </em>92; 42 <em>S. Ct. </em>35; 66 <em>L. Ed. </em>144; <em>Phoenix Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Pechner, </em>95 <em>U. S. </em>183; 24 <em>L. Ed. </em>427; <em>Chicago, R. I. and P. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Dowell, </em>229 <em>U. S. </em>102; 33 <em>S. Ct. </em>684; 57 <em>L. Ed. </em>1090; <em>Chicago, R. I. and P. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Whiteaker, supra; Southern Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Lloyd, </em>239 <em>U. S. </em>496; 36 <em>S. Ct. </em>210; 60 <em>L. Ed. </em>402; <em>George Weston, Ltd., </em>v. <em>New York Central Railroad Co., </em>115 <em>N. J. L. </em>564. See, also, <em>National Condensed Milk Co. </em>v. <em>Brandenburgh, </em>40 <em>Id. </em>111, 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">Where the plaintiff has elected, in good faith, to sue jointly in tort a foreign corporation and its servant whose alleged misconduct caused the injury complained of, there is no separable controversy within the intendment of the removal statute, even though the joinder may be improper. <em>Alabama G. S. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>200 <em>U. S. </em>206; 26 <em>S. Ct. </em>161; 50 <em>L. Ed. </em>441. In <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad Co., </em>169 <em>U. S. </em>92; 18 <em>S. Ct. </em>264; 42 <em>L. Ed. </em>673, Mr. Justice Gray thus stated the rule: \u201cIt is well settled that an action of tort, which might have been brought against many persons or against any one or more of them, and which is brought in a state court against all jointly, contains no separate controversy which will authorize its removal by some of the defendants into the Circuit Court of the United States, even if they file separate answers and set up different defenses from the other defendants, and allege that they are not jointly liable with them, and that their own controversy with the plaintiff is a separate one; for, as this court has often said, ea defendant has no right to say that an action shall be several, which a plaintiff elects to make joint. * * * A separate defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>may defeat a joint recovery, but it cannot deprive a plaintiff of bis right to prosecute his own suit to a final determination in his own way. The cause of action is the subject-matter of the controversy, and that is, for all the purposes of the suit, whatever the plaintiff declares it to be in his pleadings.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Here, the individual defendant is not a \u201cformal or unnecessary\u201d party within the intendment of <em>Salem Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Manufacturers\u2019 Finance </em>Co., 264 <em>U. S. </em>182; 44 <em>S. Ct. </em>266; 68 <em>L. Ed. </em>628. In that ease, the defendant having the same citizenship as the plaintiff was a mere stake-holder; \u201cno cause of action\u201d existed against it, because it had not been determined \u201cwhich of the other parties\u201d was \u201centitled to payment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Motion denied, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
