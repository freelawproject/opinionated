The employe died as the result of a streptococcic infection; and the question for decision is whether his widow, acting for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>herself and the dependent children, has sustained the burden of proving that an abrasion of the outer surface of the nose, through which it is reasonably inferable the lethal germs were introduced, was the result of an accident arising out of and in the course of the employment. <em>R. S. </em>1937, 34:15-1 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">The compensation bureau resolved the issue in favor of the employer, and dismissed the petition. On appeal, the Atlantic Common Pleas made a contrary determination, and accordingly entered judgment for the dependents. The employer sued out a writ of <em>certiorari; </em>and it now becomes our duty to appraise the evidence and determine the fact. <em>Pamph. L. </em>1932, <em>p. </em>38; <em>R. S. </em>1937, 34:15-66; <em>R. S. </em>1937, 2:81-8. See, also, <em>Public Service Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utility Board, </em>84 <em>N. J. L. </em>463; <em>affirmed, </em>87 <em>Id. </em>581; <em>Id. </em>597; same case, <em>Id. </em>705; <em>Erie Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utility Board, </em>85 <em>Id. </em>420; <em>Lighthipe </em>v. <em>Orange, </em>75 <em>Id. </em>365; <em>Van Riper </em>v. <em>North Plainfield, </em>43 <em>Id. </em>349, 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">We are of the view that the dependents have not borne the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that the abrasion was an accidental injury in the statutory sense. The contention is that, on October 22d, 1937, the deceased employe, while operating a lathe at prosecutor\u2019s machine shop during the noon hour (he was also president of the corporation), was struck on the nose by \u201ca piece of flying steel;\u201d and, though there is evidence tending to show that two of his fingers were \u201ccaught in a lathe,\u201d and injured, the proofs do not afford a rational basis for the conclusion that he also suffered the claimed nasal abrasion by accident. As respects cause, there is no discernible relation between the two injuries. There is no presumption of the injury secondly mentioned from the occurrence of the first. The injuries to the fingers were indisputably minor in character. They were not in evidence when the employe entered the hospital on the ensuing October 28th. Of this more hereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The attending physician, summoned on October 26th, testified that he found \u201ca small cut on the left wing of the nose * * * very much inflamed,\u201d and that the patient informed him that, on the prior October 22d, \u201cwhile working <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>on the lathe a piece of steel flew off and struck him in the nose.\u201d As the deputy commissioner ruled, the employe\u2019s version of the cause of the mishap thus given is not competent proof of the asserted fact. <em>Helminsky </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>111 <em>N. J. L. </em>369.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Nor did such proof come from any other source. On the contrary, the physician called in consultation on October 28th, when the illness reached a desperate stage, testified that the patient\u2019s nose \u201cwas one tremendous mass of inflammatory tissue,\u201d and because thereof it was \u201cpretty hard to definitely localize anything on his nose;\u201d that he questioned him, and asked him for \u201ca history;\u201d and that \u201cthe only history\u201d he \u201cgot pertinent to this case was\u201d that \u201che [the patient] had a sore on his nose for a period of a week, which sore he picked and later it became infected.\u201d The patient did not give him \u201ca history of trauma.\u201d He saw \u201cno evidence of injury\u201d to the patient\u2019s fingers, nor was he informed that such an injury had been sustained. While both physicians agreed that \u201cthe history is always necessary,\u201d the attending physician admitted that he did not give the consulting physician \u201ca history of trauma.\u201d His explanation was that the consulting physician \u201cusually takes his own history.\u201d The attending physician also admitted that he gave no \u201chistory\u201d to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">The consulting physician was also permitted, without objection, to read the following from the \u201chistory * * * as to this man\u2019s condition on his admission, given by the man,\u201d contained in the hospital record made under the witness\u2019 \u201cdirection\u201cHistory of present illness: Patient had a sore on end of nose for over a week. About five days ago he picked at it with his fingernails. Subsequently he developed a spreading inflammation and great pain in nose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The evidence of the deceased\u2019s fellow-servants does not suffice to establish the claimed accidental injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">Petitioner\u2019s witness Minuth testified that, when he returned to work after lunch on October 22d, he found that one of Gilbert\u2019s fingers \u201cwas smashed and the other bruised,\u201d and that he \u201chad a small cut on his nose.\u201d Gilbert, \u201clooking at his fingers, told\u201d the witness \u201cto be careful it didn\u2019t happen to\u201d him. Gilbert was at work the next day. The witness was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>confronted with his own signed statement that he \u201cnever saw or heard of\u201d Gilbert \u201cgetting hit on the nose or face while at work here;\u201d and he explained that he signed the statement without reading it, and did not know what he \u201csigned,\u201d although he said further that he told his inquirer he \u201cnever saw it [the accident] and as far as hearing it he [the deceased] didn\u2019t tell me about it but I had saw <em>[sic] </em>the cut on his nose.\u201d Later on, he testified that the statement in writing thus made \u201ccouldn\u2019t be correct,\u201d and that he had not given the information contained therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">This witness did not testify that the \u201csmall scratch\u201d on the end of the nose was not there when he left Gilbert at the lunch hour, although he observed he had not then suffered the injury to his fingers; and it is singular that petitioner\u2019s counsel, though he interrogated the witness as to the condition of the deceased\u2019s fingers at that time, made no such inquiry respecting his nose. And it is to be noted that Gilbert, in the conversation thus related, did not speak of an injury to his nose; he referred only to the injury to his fingers. Minuth\u2019s testimony is not reasonably susceptible of a broader interpretation. It is also to be remarked that traces of the serious finger injury described by this witness could hardly have disappeared within six days; and this reasonably leads to the conclusion that it was sustained long before the day in question. In this connection, Ginther, a co-employe, testified that he last saw the deceased on the Saturday preceding his death, and that the injury to his fingers had occurred a \u201ccouple of weeks before.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Stewart, a fellow-servant called by the employer, testified that he \u201cknew\u201d Gilbert had \u201chad an accident to his face,\u201d but this was not offered as a fact within his personal knowledge. Conccdedly, he did not witness the alleged accident; and he later testified that, while on a sick visit to his home, Gilbert told him that \u201che had a carbuncle on his nose;\u201d there was no mention of an accidental injury. The witness also said that on the day of the alleged accident he did not \u201cobserve any pimple or boil on\u201d Gilbert\u2019s nose.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Speed, another co-employe called by the petitioner, testified that he saw Gilbert \u201con Friday, the same week before he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>was taken sick,\u201d and that \u201che had a couple of fingers that were injured and he had a little scratch on his nose;\u201d but this evidence obviously does not suffice to prove that the \u201clittle scratch\u201d on the nose was the result of an industrial accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">It is a circumstance of no little significance that none of the deceased\u2019s fellow-servants witnessed the claimed mishap, or had his attention called to it by the deceased at the time. In fact, the statements subsequently made by the deceased to his fellow-workers respecting the condition of his nose negative trauma as the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">The evidence given by the widow as to conversations with her husband regarding the cause of the abrasion was plainly inadmissible. The statements alleged to have been made by her husband were not part of the <em>res gestee, </em>and therefore take the classification of hearsay. <em>Slayback Van Order Co. </em>v. <em>Eiben, </em>115 <em>N. J. L. </em>17; <em>Belyus </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, Gaddis &amp; Co., </em>115 <em>Id. </em>43; <em>affirmed, </em>116 <em>Id. </em>92; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Giant Tiger Corp., </em>118 <em>Id. </em>10.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">To find from these circumstances that the deceased\u2019s demise was the result of an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment is to indulge in pure surmise and conjecture. The law places the burden of proof on the petitioner for compensation; and it is not sustained unless the evidence preponderates in favor of the tendered hypothesis. That must be a rational inference, <em>i. e., </em>based upon a preponderance of probabilities according to the common experience of mankind. It is required to be a probable or more probable hypothesis with reference to the possibility of other hypotheses. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad Co., </em>111 <em>N. J. L. </em>487; <em>Kuczynski </em>v. <em>Humphrey, </em>118 <em>Id. </em>321; <em>Manziano </em>v. <em>Public Service Gas Co., </em>92 <em>Id. </em>322.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Moreover, the credibility of the witnesses on the crucial point of inquiry was sharply in issue; and, in the appraisement of the evidence adduced before the bureau, it is to be borne in mind that the deputy commissioner had the distinct advantage of personal observation of the witnesses. The demeanor of the witness is ofttimes a factor of major importance in determining the probative value and weight of his evidence. The tone of voice, the readiness or reluctance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>which questions are answered, his reaction to surprise and unexpected inquiries, his carriage and expression, his seeming interest or lack of it, are all circumstances of consequence known only to the judicial officer in whose presence the witness testifies; and so, there is a natural hesitation on the part of the appellate tribunal, confined as it is to the written word, to disturb factual conclusions of the judicial officer to whom the evidence has been orally presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">The judgment of the Atlantic Common Pleas is accordingly reversed, and the judgment of the Compensation Bureau affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
