The alleged newly discovered evidence had to do with charges of false swearing by certain jurors when examined upon their <em>vow-dire, </em>challenges for bias and prejudice having been interposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-15\">We have examined the proofs submitted and deem the grounds upon which the writ is sought to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>However, an important question is the propriety of reviewing an order denying a new trial by <em>certiorari. </em>Ho precedent is cited for such procedure, prosecutor taking the position that the matter is not reviewable on writ of error and, therefore, it must be reviewable by <em>certiorari.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">We think not. The orders of a court of common law jurisdiction in the exercise of its judicial functions are reviewable by appeal after final judgment, and not by <em>certiorari. Taylor Provision Co. </em>v. <em>Adams Express Co., </em>72 <em>N. J. L. </em>220. Where a court sits as a special statutory tribunal and not in the exercise of its common law jurisdiction, <em>certiorari </em>is a proper remedy. <em>Eder </em>v. <em>Hudson County Circuit Court, </em>104 <em>Id. </em>260. And the proceedings of an inferior tribunal are reviewable on <em>certiorari </em>where it exceeds its jurisdiction. <em>Meller </em>v. <em>Kaighn, </em>89 <em>Id. </em>543; <em>Rutherford National Bank </em>v. <em>McKenzie, </em>120 <em>Id. </em>594. But neither of these elements is present in the case under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">We conclude that the order sought to be brought up, if reviewable at all and to whatever extent reviewable, is reviewable on writ of error and not by <em>certiorari. </em>The application is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
