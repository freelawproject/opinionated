J. L. </em>456.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>The respondent has instituted proceedings under the Eminent Domain statute to acquire for public uses whatever rights the prosecutors had in the premises. Those proceedings are now pending and, we are informed, are nearing completion.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Meanwhile occurred the necessity for the building of the proposed outfall pipe at or near the site of the property of prosecutors, whereon is situated the said chlorinator plant, under the order of the State Department of Health and the adoption of the resolution under attack to effectuate that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">It seems to us that the respondent was under an imperative duty to safeguard the public health by constructing this outfall pipe.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Under the circumstances and the evidence before us, we conclude that the action of the respondent in the adoption of the ordinance has not been shown to have been improper or to have infringed any rights of prosecutors, but on the contrary was well within the sound discretion of the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">The application for the writ is denied, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
