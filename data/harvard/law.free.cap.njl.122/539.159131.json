On April 27th, 1938, pursuant to an order duly entered, a writ of execution issued against defendant\u2019s salary and income under <em>R. S. </em>1937, 2:26-182 <em>el seq., </em>and is still outstanding. On May 16th, 1938, the judgment debtor was adjudged a bankrupt in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The judgment debt was duly scheduled; and, on the ensuing June 1st, an order was entered in the bankruptcy proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>directing, as I understand it (the order has not been introduced into evidence), that the employer \u201cretain\u201d and \u201chold\u201d the prescribed deductions pending determination of the judgment debtor\u2019s right to a discharge. On September 12th, 1938, a decree of discharge was entered; and defendant now maintains that it is embracive of the judgment debt, and that therefore the execution of the judgment should be perpetually restrained and the \u201cmoney accumulated\u201d by the employer under the execution paid to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">On the other hand, plaintiff contends that, while his judgment was a provable debt, the underlying liability falls within the category of a non-dischargeable debt, as defined by section 17 of the Bankruptcy act, as amended by the Chandler act of 1938 (chapter 575, section 17, 52 <em>U. S. Stat. at L. </em>851), in that it arose from a \u201cwillful and malicious\u201d injury to his \u201cproperty,\u201d and was also a \u201cmisappropriation or defalcation while acting * * * in\u201d a \u201cfiduciary capacity.\u201d <em>U. S. C. A., </em>\u00a7 35. I do not entertain this view.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Although the complaint charged, in four counts, that plaintiff \u201cengaged\u201d defendant \u201cas an agent or broker to obtain a workmen\u2019s compensation insurance policy,\u201d and paid to him the fixed premium therefor, and that the policy was later canceled by the insurer \u201cbecause of the defendant\u2019s fraudulent, negligent and improper conduct,\u201d in that he \u201cfailed to deliver\u201d to the insurer the premium so paid, but \u201cconverted\u201d the same \u201cto his own use,\u201d and that defendant \u201cnegligently, improperly, illegally, recklessly, and willfully, failed\u201d to perform a promise subsequently made \u201cto turn the said money over to\u201d the insurer, and \u201cto obtain a re-instatement of the said policy, or to obtain a new policy in another company, the defendant well knowing that the plaintiff relied upon\u201d his \u201cpromise and upon\u201d his \u201crepresentation of possessing the customary care and skill necessary for conducting the business of an insurance agent or broker,\u201d but \u201cfraudulently and willfully misrepresented to the plaintiff,\u201d after the cancellation of the policy, \u201cthat he had obtained\u201d its \u201cre-instatement,\u201d and that plaintiff suffered injury by reason of compensable disability sustained by one of his employes after the cancella<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>tion of the policy, and within the original term thereof, it is established that the sole issue submitted to the jury, apparently with the consent of both parties (there was no exception to the charge), was whether defendant, in the circumstances adduced in evidence, had been guilty of \u201cnegligence\u201d in the transaction made the subject-matter of the complaint. The trial judge ruled that the evidence did not disclose \u201ca case of fraud in the legal sense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Assuming without deciding that the judgment is not <em>res judicata </em>of the nature of plaintiff\u2019s cause of action as one for mere negligence, in that neither fraud nor conversion was an essential element of the judgment, his affidavit submitted on this motion sets forth, in substance, that he engaged defendant to procure an insurance policy of the character mentioned (he had confidence in defendant since he had \u201calways\u201d handled his indemnity insurance business), and, at defendant\u2019s request, \u201cgave him\u201d his \u201ccheck in the sum of $75 as full payment on the said insurance policy for one full year;\u201d that defendant procured the stipulated insurance policy from the Bankers Indemnity Insurance Company; that \u201cseveral months later\u201d plaintiff \u201creceived a cancellation notice\u201d from the insurer advising that the policy \u201cwas going to be canceled\u201d on a day specified for non-payment of the premium; that, upon inquiry, defendant stated there had been \u201can apparent error made by his secretary,\u201d and that the policy \u201cwould not be canceled\u201d by the insurer, \u201cbecause he would take care of the same and see to it that the policy would still be in effect since the full premium due had been paid thereon;\u201d that he relied upon these \u201crepresentations because\u201d of his \u201cgreat confidence\u201d in defendant\u2019s \u201cintegrity and ability,\u201d but that the policy was in fact canceled, in accordance with- the notice, prior to the happening of the compensable injury to his employe for which he was required to render compensation; that defendant \u201cconverted the moneys\u201d thus \u201cgiven to him to his own use;\u201d that, in the circumstances, \u201cthere was a fiduciary relationship existing between\u201d them \u201cby reason of\u201d plaintiff\u2019s \u201cprior business with\u201d defendant \u201cand of the confidence\u201d he \u201cplaced in his ability and honesty;\u201d and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>\u201cdebt is one that arises ont of a willful and malicious conversion as well as fraud in the acceptance of the money by the defendant with intent to use the same for himself and also by reason of the\u201d asserted \u201cfiduciary relationship\u201d between them, \u201cupon which\u201d plaintiff \u201crelied,\u201d and the judgment is therefore of a class not dischargeable in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">Erom the early days of the Federal Bankruptcy law, the bankrupt\u2019s discharge has been given a broad and liberal construction. Exceptions to its operation have been confined to those \u201cplainly expressed;\u201d and the burden is cast upon one asserting the status of a creditor to show that, \u201cbecause of the nature of the claim, failure to give notice, or other statutory reason, the debt sued on was by law excepted from the operation of the discharge.\u201d <em>Kreitlein </em>v. Ferger, 238 <em>U. S. 21; </em>35 <em>S. Ct. </em>685; 59 <em>L. Ed. </em>1184; <em>Gleason </em>v. <em>Thaw, </em>236 <em>U. S. </em>558; 35 <em>S. Ct. </em>287; 59 <em>L. Ed. </em>717; <em>City Hall Building and Loan Association </em>v. <em>Star </em>Corp., 110 <em>N. J. L. </em>570.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Here, the underlying cause of action did not arise from a \u201cwillful and malicious\u201d injury to plaintiff\u2019s \u201cproperty\u201d in the statutory sense; nor did the action proceed to judgment on that theory. As stated, the judgment was founded upon defendant\u2019s mere negligence, without malice; and there is no extraneous proof of an injury within the statutory category. The cause of action thus reduced to judgment, and now sought to be enforced, was not for the conversion of the premium paid, but for defendant\u2019s negligence in the performance of a contractual undertaking to provide such indemnity insurance for the agreed period, more particularly his promise to supply such insurance after the cancellation of the issued policy. The liabilities excepted under this head from the operation of a discharge in bankruptcy relate generally to such as emanate from torts to the person or property, and not to those that are ordinarily grounded in a breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">This particular clause is coupled under the same subdivision number with one excepting from a discharge liabilities for \u201cobtaining property by false pretenses or false representations,\u201d and the rule <em>noscilur a sociis </em>is applicable in the delineation of the legislative intent. The provision takes its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>meaning from the associated words. In <em>Gleason </em>v. <em>Thaw, supra, </em>the Federal Supreme Court said of this clause: \u201cCongress, we think, never intended that property in the paragraph under consideration should include professional services. At most it denotes something subject to ownership, transfer, or exclusive possession and enjoyment, which may be brought within the dominion and control of a court through some recognized process. This is certainly the full extent of the word\u2019s meaning as employed in ordinary speech and business, and the same signficance attaches to it in many carefully prepared writings.\u201d See, also, for the application of the above rule of interpretation, <em>Neal </em>v. <em>Scruggs, </em>95 <em>U. S. </em>704; 24 <em>L. Ed. </em>586.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">And, while conversion constitutes \u201cinjury\u201d to property within the signification of the statute, there must be willfulness and malice to take it out of the operation of the discharge; these are indispensable requisites. <em>McIntyre </em>v. <em>Kavanaugh, </em>242 <em>U. S. </em>138; 37 <em>S. Ct. </em>38; 61 <em>L. Ed. </em>205; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Aetna Acceptance Co., </em>293 <em>U. S. </em>328; 55 <em>S. Ct. </em>151; 79 <em>L. Ed. </em>393; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Garey, </em>267 <em>N. Y. </em>167; 196 <em>N. E. Rep. </em>12; 98 <em>A. L. R. </em>1449; <em>In re Levitan, </em>224 <em>Fed. Rep. </em>241. Something more than mere negligence is required; the lack of care that is so denominated does not connote willfulness or malice within the purview of the statute. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Aetna Acceptance Co., supra; Tinker </em>v. <em>Colwell, </em>193 U. <em>S. </em>473; 24 <em>S. Ct. </em>505; 48 <em>L. Ed. </em>754; <em>Re Greene, </em>87 <em>Fed. Rep. (2d) </em>951; 109 <em>A. L. R. </em>1188; <em>In re Wegner, </em>88 <em>Fed. Rep. (2d) </em>899; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Garey, supra. </em>See, also, 57 <em>A. L. R. </em>153.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Nor is the basic liability classable as a \u201cmisappropriation or defalcation\u201d by defendant \u201cwhile acting in\u201d a \u201cfiduciary capacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">In its essence, the obligation reduced to judgment, as revealed by the proofs submitted on this motion, arose from plaintiff\u2019s reliance, to his injury, upon defendant\u2019s promissory \u201crepresentations\u201d that he would \u201csee to it\u201d that the policy \u201cwould not be cancelled\u201d by the insurer, <em>i. e., </em>a breach of a contractual duty. In an early case, <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Forsyth, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>2 <em>How. </em>202; 11 <em>L. Ed. </em>236, the Federal Supreme Court, in ruling that a factor who receives the money of his principal was not a fiduciary within the intendment of a like provision of the Bankruptcy act, declared: \u201cIf the act embrace such a debt, it will be difficult to limit its application. It must include all debts arising from agencies; and indeed all cases where the law implies an obligation from the trust reposed in the debtor. Such a construction would have left but few debts on which the law could operate. In almost all the commercial transactions of the country, confidence is reposed in the punctuality and integrity of the debtor, and a violation of these is, in a commercial sense, a disregard of a trust. But this is not the relation spoken of in the first section of the act. The cases enumerated, \u2018the defalcation of a public officer/ \u2018executor/ \u2018administrator/ \u2018guardian/ or \u2018trustee/ are not cases of implied, but special trusts, and the \u2018other fiduciary capacity\u2019 mentioned, must mean the same class of trusts. The act speaks of technical trusts, and not those which the law implies from the contract. A factor is not, therefore, within the act.\u201d And in the recent case of <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Aetna Acceptance Co., supra, </em>the same court, in an opinion by Mr. Justice Cardozo, reiterated this interpretation, with the observation that the \u201cprecept\u201d thus laid down \u201chas been applied by this court in varied situations with unbroken continuity.\u201d See, also, <em>Noble </em>v. <em>Hammond, </em>129 <em>U. S. </em>65; 9 <em>S. Ct. </em>235; 32 <em>L. Ed. </em>621; <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>195 <em>U. S. </em>176; 25 <em>S. Ct. </em>9; 49 <em>L. Ed. </em>147; <em>Tindle </em>v. <em>Birkett, </em>205 <em>U. S. </em>183; 27 <em>S. Ct. </em>493; 51 <em>L. Ed. </em>762; <em>In re Harber, </em>9 <em>Fed. Rep. (2d) </em>551; <em>Smith &amp; Wallace Co. </em>v. <em>Lambert, </em>69 <em>N. J. L. </em>487; <em>In re Benoit, </em>194 <em>N. 7. </em>548 ; 87 <em>N. E. Rep. </em>1115.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The rule to show cause is accordingly made absolute, but without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
