He was struck by the vehicle \u2014 owned and operated by one Smith \u2014 at a highway intersection in the city of Paterson. Smith was then in the employ of defendant as a bookkeeper. In the ensuing month of April, Smith negotiated, through his employer\u2019s attorney, a settlement of plaintiff\u2019s claim for damages for the sum of $75, payable \u201cin installments of no less than Ten ($10) Dollars per month.\u201d The terms were reduced to writing. It was further therein provided that, in the event of a default in the payment of a monthly installment as so promised, the plaintiff would be at liberty \u201cto consider the entire balance due and owing,\u201d and bring suit therefor; and that, upon payment of the stipulated sum, plaintiff would execute and deliver a general release to Smith. Smith undertook to turn over \u201cthe first Forty-two ($42.00) Dollars payable under\u201d the agreement to the hospital in which plaintiff was treated for his injuries, in satisfaction of its bill for services.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">There was evidence tending to show that, pursuant to the duties of his employment, Smith was on his way to the local post office to procure defendant\u2019s mail when the collision occurred. And defendant admitted it supplied fuel for his automobile. Smith did not communicate this information to plaintiff in the negotiations that culminated in the settlement ; nor did he so advise his own attorney. Whatever may have been Smith\u2019s understanding of the situation, it is clear that plaintiff was led to believe that Smith was not engaged in his master\u2019s service when he suffered his injuries, and that he therefore had a right of action against him only. And Smith claimed financial incapacity. He had no insurance, and no- means except the salary of $35 per week received from defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">After having paid $40 on' account of the sum provided under this agreement, Smith advised plaintiff that, for lack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>of employment, he could not pay the balance. For the first time he informed plaintiff that he was pursuing his master\u2019s business when the accident happened, and this was followed by the submission of his affidavit purporting the facts touching the asserted relationship of <em>respondeat superior, </em>and, in turn, the execution and delivery by plaintiff to Smith, under date of October 1st, 1937, of a covenant whereby plaintiff obligated himself not to sue Smith \u201cfor or on account of a claim for personal injuries and medical expenses sustained by 'him\u2019 arising out of an accident occurring on February 6th, 1937,\u201d but reserved to himself \u201cthe right and privilege to proceed either in law or in equity, against any other person, firm or corporation for personal injuries and medical expenses sustained by reason of\u201d the mishap.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">Defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict was grounded solely in the claim that plaintiff, by the agreement first made with Smith, \u201cprecluded himself from bringing any action against\u201d defendant, in that it constituted an accord and satisfaction. The learned trial judge adopted this view. We deem it to be erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Conceding it to be the general rule that, to constitute a bar to the original claim, the accord must be fully executed, defendant invokes the principle that, where the agreement of accord and satisfaction exhibits an intent \u201cto accept the new promise as itself a satisfaction of the prior obligation, the satisfaction is complete on the making of the promise,\u201d' \u2014 citing <em>Lorentowicz </em>v. <em>Bowers, </em>91 <em>N. J. L. 225. </em>It is said that this common purpose is revealed in the clause of the agreement providing that, in case of default in the payment of a prescribed monthly installment, plaintiff \u201cshall immediately have the right to consider the balance due and owing and bring suit\u201d therefor. We do not entertain this view. The asserted intent is negatived by the provision binding plaintiff to \u201cexecute to defendant a General Release of all claims and demands and discontinuance of all pending actions,\u201d only in the event of full paj'ment of the stipulated sum. Plaintiff was bound to deliver the release \u201cat such time as the full amount of' Seventy-five ($75.00) Dollars is paid.\u201d See <em>McCoy </em>v. <em>Milbury, </em>87 <em>Id. </em>697.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>Moreover, it was plainly within the competency o\u00ed the parties to abrogate this <em>unexecuted, agreement </em>of settlement for unreality of consent, on the hypothesis either of mutual mistake or the concealment of a material fact, <em>i. e., </em>the relationship imposing upon defendant liability to respond in damages for Smith\u2019s negligence in the operation of the motor vehicle. The concurrence of the defendant in this joint action was not requisite to remove the bar of the original agreement. Defendant\u2019s rights were in nowise prejudiced thereby. The original agreement of settlement was not made for its benefit; nor did it change its position on the faith of it. The doctrine of estoppel is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">The judgment is accordingly reversed, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
