While the complaint charged \u201cwillful and wanton misconduct,\u201d that allegation was abandoned at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The vehicle was owned by the defendant Kantor; and the operator was the defendant G-reenwell, his servant and agent. Concededly, plaintiff\u2019s status was that of a nonpaying \u201cguest;\u201d and defendants pleaded and proved a statute of the State of Florida providing that, \u201cin ease of accident,\u201d a person so situated shall not have a cause of action for damages against the owner or operator of the vehicle, \u201cunless such accident shall have been caused by the gross negligence or willful and wanton misconduct of the owner or operator,\u201d and the injury shall have been the proximate result thereof, \u201cprovided that the question or issue of negligence, gross negligence, and willful or wanton misconduct, and the question of proximate cause, and the issue or question of assumed risk, shall in all such cases be solely for the jury. * * *\u201d <em>Chapter </em>18033 <em>Laws of Florida </em>(1937 <em>Laws, p. </em>671). It was averred in the answer that, in the operation of the vehicle, there was no \u201cviolation\u201d of this enactment. By way of reply, plaintiff interposed a general denial of the allegations of the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Motions for a nonsuit and a directed verdict in favor of defendants were denied; and the issue of gross negligence was submitted to the jury. These motions were grounded in the contentions that there was no evidence of gross negligence, and that, in any event, such delinquency by the operator was not imputable to the owner. There was a verdict for plaintiff; and both defendants appeal from the judgment entered thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">The single question raised by the grounds of appeal is the propriety of the submission to the jury of the issue of <em>gross </em>negligence. There was no evidence as to what constituted \u201cgross\u201d negligence under the law of Florida; and defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>now maintain that the \u201ccommon law doctrine of gross negligence\u201d provided the sole criterion of liability, and that, regardless of the Florida statute adverted to, this particular issue was one of law for the court, unless the evidence afforded a tangible basis for a finding of such misconduct according to the common law standard \u2014 citing <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>North Jersey Street Railway </em>Co., 71 <em>N. J. L. </em>5. We are of the view that in this regard the evidence presented an issue for resolution by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">While proceeding on a straight macadam highway, at least twenty feet wide, with grass-covered shoulders four feet in width on either side, the automobile ran off the road and collided with \u201ca large pine pole,\u201d carrying electric transmission lines, located in a ditch beyond the shoulder at a distance of eight or ten feet from the edge of the road. This pole was \u201cabout two feet\u201d in diameter; and the impact was so violent that the pole \u201cwas pushed clear of its anchorage or broken off. * * * It may have been pushed right out of the ground.\u201d The mishap occurred about ten-thirty p. M. The weather was clear; and the road was dry and free of traffic. The car \u201cwas smashed. The front radiator and left front fender wore all mashed together; the frame was sprung, the axle broken, and wheel and windshield broken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Plaintiff testified that, when the vehicle left the road, its rate of movement was \u201cabout thirty-five or forty miles an hour.\u201d When it was about fifty feet from the pole, she observed that it was headed in that direction. She testified that, perceiving the imminent danger, she inquired of defendant G-reenwell: \u201cMay, what are you doing, can\u2019t you see?\u201d The reply was in the affirmative, but the vehicle continued on with unabated speed until the collision occurred. Apparently, the operator made no effort to change its course. On the way to the hospital, plaintiff asked Miss G-reenwell \u201cwhat\u201d had \u201chappened,\u201d and she answered: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d A day or two later, Miss G-reenwell gave this explanation in response to plaintiff\u2019s further inquiry as to the cause of the accident: \u201cYou see, I remember smoking a cigarette and trying, leaning or attempting to throw, or trying to throw the butt out of the window, and the window was shut and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>\u2022cigarette came back in my face.\u201d This was received as an admission binding upon the defendant Greenwell only. She was not called as a witness by the defense, and so the case was closed without testimony from her as to the cause of the mishap.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Negligence cannot be treated in the abstract. \u201cGross\u201d negligence is a relative term that does not lend itself to precise definition automatically resolving every case. It was introduced into the common law from the civil law; and, on the hypothesis that in a case such as this the duty imposed by the law is to exercise such care as is commensurate with the risk of danger, the modern trend is to reject the common law divisions of negligence into \u201cgross,\u201d \u201cordinary\u201d and \u201cslight,\u201d as having \u201cno distinctive meaning or importance in the law,\u201d and tending to uncertainty and confusion in cases such as this, where the duty claimed to have been breached does not have a statutory or contractual origin. <em>Dudley </em>v. <em>Camden and Philadelphia Ferry Co., </em>42 <em>N. J. L. </em>35, 28; <em>Harber </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>105 <em>Id. </em>213; <em>The Steamboat New World </em>v. <em>King, </em>16 <em>How. </em>469, 474; 13 <em>L. Ed. </em>1019, 1021; <em>Cooley Torts (4th ed.), </em>\u00a7\u00a7 456, 478; 45 <em>C. J. </em>664, 671, 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">At most, the difference between \u201cgross\u201d and \u201cordinary\u201d \u25a0negligence is one of degree rather than of quality. While there is authority for the view that gross negligence is not \u25a0characterized by inadvertence, but connotes \u201csome degree of intent to cause\u201d injury (see cases cited in 20 <em>R. C. L. </em>23), the commonly accepted definition of the term is the want or absence of, or failure to exercise, slight care or diligence. This seems to be the definition at common law. <em>Dudley </em>v. <em>Camden and Philadelphia Ferry Co., supra; </em>45 <em>C. J. </em>667. A distinction of substance has been noted between wanton misconduct and gross negligence. <em>Bordorano </em>v. <em>Senk, </em>109 <em>Conn. </em>428; 147 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>136; <em>In re Greene, </em>87 <em>Fed. Rep. (2d) </em>951. For a different view, see <em>In re Wegner, </em>88 <em>Id. </em>899.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The difference between \u201cgross\u201d and \u201cordinary\u201d negligence \u00a1being one of degree merely, we entertain the view that, under the evidence here adduced, uncontradieted and unexplained .as it was, it was the function of the jury, in a special and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>peculiar sense, to determine the degree of negligence. Under the circumstances, it was reasonably inferable that there was-an absence of \u201cslight care or diligence\u201d in the operation of the vehicle. While plaintiff testified that its speed was thirty-five or forty miles per hour, the indisputable physical evidence tends to show a dangerous rate of movement \u2014 such as would obviously deprive the operator of the control requisite for plaintiff\u2019s safety. Plaintiff had never operated a motor vehicle, and her estimate of speed is to be considered in the light of her inexperience. And the movement of the car after the warning given bjr plaintiff demonstrates the utter absence of thought or effort by the operator directed to the avoidance of the danger foreseen by plaintiff. It is fairly inferable that the warning was timely if slight care for the passenger\u2019s safety had been used. It is therefore unnecessary to invoice the .Florida statute in justification of the submission of this issue to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
