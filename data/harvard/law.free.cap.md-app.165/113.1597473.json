EYLER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">In an action for declaratory and injunctive relief, the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County granted summary judgment in favor of the State Board of Elections (\u201cBoard\u201d), and against the Maryland Green Party (\u201cGreen Party\u201d), ruling that certain statutes in the Maryland Election Code, Md.Code (2002), sections 1-101, 3-504, and 4-102 of the Election Law Article (\u201cEL\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and practices by the Board in implementing them were not unconstitutional under state or federal law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The Green Party appealed the circuit court\u2019s decision to this Court, but the Court of Appeals issued a <em>writ of certiorari </em>on by-pass. The Court of Appeals reversed the entry of summary judgment in favor of the Board, holding that certain of Maryland\u2019s election law statutes, and the application of others by the Board, violated the Maryland Constitution and Declaration of Rights. The case was remanded to the circuit court for entry of a declaratory judgment consistent with the opinion of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Following entry of the new declaratory judgment, the Green Party filed a petition for attorney\u2019s fees and costs under the federal Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Award Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. The circuit court granted the Board\u2019s motion to dismiss the petition, upon a finding that the Green Party was not a prevailing party under section 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">The Green Party noted a timely appeal, presenting six questions for review, which we have combined and re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>phrased:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-4\">I. Did the circuit court err in dismissing the Green Party\u2019s petition for attorney\u2019s fees and costs upon a finding that it was not a prevailing party under section 1988?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-5\">II. Did the circuit court err in failing to consider the petition as to the Green Party\u2019s two related cases?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-6\">III. Did the circuit court err in granting the Board\u2019s motion to enlarge time to respond to, and bifurcate resolution of, the Green Party\u2019s petition?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">For the following reasons, we shall vacate the decision of the circuit court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">The Green Party became qualified as a statutorily recognized political party in Maryland on August 16, 2000. In order to achieve that status, the Green Party was required to obtain at least 10,000 signatures of registered Maryland voters on party-forming petitions. EL \u00a7 4-102.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It did so and submitted the petitions to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>On June 20, 2000, the Green Party nominated one David Gross as its candidate for U.S. Representative from the First Congressional District. As required by EL section 5-703(e), the Gross campaign organized a second petition drive to obtain nominating petitions signed by 1% of registered voters in that congressional district, or 3,411 signatures.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Gross campaign succeeded in obtaining 4,214 signatures and submitted the petitions to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">During its verification process, the Board determined that over 1,000 of the signatures were of residents on the \u201cinactive voter\u201d list. On that basis, it rejected those signatures, leaving the Gross campaign short of the 1% required to appear on the ballot. As a result, Gross was declared ineligible to run as the Green Party\u2019s candidate for U.S. Representative for the First Congressional District.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">On September 5, 2000, in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, the Green Party filed a complaint against the Board for refusing to place Gross on the ballot. It sought declaratory and injunctive relief under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, including a temporary restraining order, arguing that the burden imposed by the 10,000 voter party-forming petitioning requirement, in EL section 4-102, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>and the 1% nominating petition requirement, in EL section 5-703(e), and the Board\u2019s actions in rejecting the signatures of voters on the \u201cinactive voting\u201d list violated its rights under state and federal laws. It based its arguments, <em>inter alia, </em>on the First, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; Article I, sections 1 and 2 of the Maryland Constitution; and Articles 7 and 24 of the Declaration of Rights. It further argued that the petitioning requirements and Board practices violated international law and treaties of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">After a hearing on September 8, 2000, the circuit court denied the Green Party\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order and injunction ordering that Gross\u2019s name be placed on the ballot. The November 7, 2000 election went forward without Gross\u2019s name on the ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The Board proceeded to file a motion to dismiss the Green Party\u2019s complaint, or in the alternative, for summary judgment. On February 28, 2001, the circuit court denied the Board\u2019s motion to dismiss, but granted its motion for summary judgment. In its memorandum opinion, the circuit court ruled that the Green Party had not shown, as a matter of law, that Maryland\u2019s election laws were unconstitutional pursuant to the U.S. Constitution, the Maryland Constitution or Declaration of Rights, and various international treaties.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The circuit court cited to Supreme Court precedent and noted that states are permitted to regulate elections so that order accompanies the democratic process. Administrative convenience is within the state\u2019s regulatory interests, which also include limiting the number of candidates on a ballot and requiring a showing of public support. The court further recognized that those regulatory interests \u201chave supported nominating petition requirements similar to or more stringent than Maryland\u2019s <em>1% </em>requirement\u201d under EL section 5-703(e). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>The court concluded that, because the Supreme Court had upheld more stringent state law requirements, Maryland\u2019s 1% nominating petition requirement was constitutional, as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">The Green Party took an appeal to this Court, but before we considered the case, the Court of Appeals issued a <em>vnit of certiorari </em>on its own motion. In <em>Green Party v. State Board of Elections, </em>377 Md. 127, 832 A.2d 214 (2003), the Court of Appeals reversed the circuit court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and remanded the case for entry of a new declaratory judgment consistent with its opinion. The decision was by a four-member majority, with three members concurring in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The majority, noting that the Green Party had raised numerous issues under federal and state laws, expressly limited its decision to state law grounds under the Maryland Constitution and the Declaration of Rights. It did not decide any of the issues raised under the federal Constitution or federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The majority first addressed the issue of the \u201cinactive\u201d voters whose signatures the Board rejected when verifying Gross\u2019s 1% nominating petition. EL section 3-504 allowed for an \u201cinactive voter\u201d list and sanctioned removal for voters remaining on the list for a specified period of time.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under EL section 1-101, these voters were excluded from categorization as \u201cregistered voters.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, their signatures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>were not counted.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">The majority held that those laws and regulations directly conflicted with Article I, sections 1 and 2 of the Maryland Constitution and Article 7 of the Declaration of Rights, which are the exclusive Maryland authority on \u201cthe qualifications for voters and provide for a single uniform voter registration list which is conclusive evidence of the right to vote.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 145. Additionally, the statutory scheme \u201cunconstitutionally infringe[d] on the right of suffrage guaranteed to all qualified voters by Article I of the Maryland Constitution and Article 7 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The majority then addressed the 1% nominating petition requirement for minor party candidates. It held that the 1% nominating petition requirement \u201cdiscriminate^] against minor political parties in violation of the equal protection component of Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 156-57. It expressly limited its decision to state constitutional law grounds. It noted that, although it was not suggesting that the decision would be different under a federal equal protection analysis, \u201c \u2018the federal and state guarantees of equal protection are obviously independent and capable of divergent application.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 157 (citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The concurring members agreed with the majority\u2019s holding that the \u201cinactive voters\u201d list laws violated the Maryland Constitution. They disagreed with the majority\u2019s holding that the <em>1% </em>nominating petition requirement violated Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. They noted' that \u201cthe equal protection guarantees found in the federal constitution and Maryland\u2019s Declaration of Rights are considered \u2018in pari materia,\u2019 \u201d so that federal caselaw is \u201cinstructive here.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>166 (citing <em>Attorney Gen. v. Waldron, </em>289 Md. 683, 704, 426 A.2d 929 (1981)). They further noted that, in application, the Court of Appeals has consistently interpreted Article 24 to apply in the same manner as the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">The concurring members cited to various federal cases that held petition requirements constitutional, because \u201cthe State has a legitimate interest in regulating the quantity and quality of the candidates who appear on its ballots.\u201d <em>Id. </em>They distinguished the purpose behind the initial party-forming petition requirement for a minor political party from that behind the 1% nominating petition requirement for a minor political party candidate for office, commenting that the majority\u2019s analysis based upon the combination of the two petitioning requirements was in error. For those reasons, the concurring members concluded that Maryland\u2019s 1% nominating petition requirement for minor party candidates was supported by federal equal protection caselaw, and disagreed with the majority\u2019s opinion that it violated Maryland\u2019s state constitutional equal protection guarantee.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">On January 12, 2004, on remand, the circuit court entered a declaratory judgment in favor of the Green Party, in accordance with the opinion of the Court of Appeals. The judgment declared unconstitutional the 1% nominating petition requirement, under Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, and the deprivation of \u201cinactive voters\u201d of their right to vote, under Article I of the Maryland Constitution and Articles 7 and 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Subsequently, on June 15, 2004, the Green Party filed a petition for attorney\u2019s fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. It sought fees and costs incurred in this case and in two related cases, <em>Hufnagel v. State Board of </em>Elections,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number><em>Stysley v. Carroll County Board of </em>Elections.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It sought $355,060 in attorney\u2019s fees and $3,071.31 in costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">The Board filed a motion to enlarge time to oppose the Green Party\u2019s petition and a motion to bifurcate resolution of the Green Party\u2019s petition for separate determinations of whether attorney\u2019s fees and costs should be granted, and if so, in what amount. The Board asserted as its basis for the motion to enlarge time the complexity of the issues and the need for discovery and expert witnesses on the matter, particularly if the motion to bifurcate were denied. The circuit court granted both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The Board then filed a motion to dismiss the Green Party\u2019s petition. The circuit court granted the motion on October 1, 2004. In its memorandum opinion and order, the court articulated the general rule, under section 1988, that prevailing parties ordinarily are entitled to attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The court found that, because the parties in <em>Hufnagel, Stysley, </em>and this case were different and the cases were not consolidated, the plaintiffs in <em>Hufnagel </em>and <em>Stysley </em>were not prevailing parties; therefore, the court refused to consider them in conjunction with the petition in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The court then turned to the issue of whether the Green Party was a prevailing party under section 1988. It recounted the procedural history of the case: that it had decided all of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>the Green Party\u2019s claims, including the federal claims that could support a section 1988 award, adversely to it, on summary judgment; that the Court of Appeals had reversed that judgment, but only on state constitutional grounds, and had remanded the case for entry of a new declaratory judgment consistent with the Court\u2019s opinion; and that, on remand, the Green Party filed its section 1988 petition. The court concluded that, under those circumstances, its original decision on summary judgment that the Green Party had failed, as a matter of law, to make out a federal constitutional claim, was undisturbed. Accordingly, the Green Party was not a prevailing party on its federal constitutional claim and hence did not qualify for an award of fees and costs under section 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">The Green Party filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">We shall include additional facts as necessary to our discussion of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">Section 1988 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-9\">(b) Attorney\u2019s fees</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-10\">In an action or proceeding to enforce a provision of sections 1981, 1981(a), 1982, 1983, 1985, and 1986 of [title 42 of the United States Code] ... the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AS\">The Supreme Court has interpreted this statute to require an award of attorney\u2019s fees to a prevailing party in such an action or proceeding \u201cunless special circumstances would render such an award unjust.\u201d <em>Newman v. Piggie Park Enters., Inc., </em>390 U.S. 400, 402, 88 S.Ct. 964, 19 L.Ed.2d 1263 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">The statute does not address whether a party is a prevailing party, and hence may recover attorney\u2019s fees absent special circumstances, when, in an action alleging a federal constitutional violation <em>and </em>a state law violation, the party prevails only on his state law claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>. Our Court of Appeals addressed this issue in <em>County Executive of Prince George\u2019s County v. Doe, </em>300 Md. 445, 479 A.2d 352 (1984). The plaintiffs brought claims under section 1983 and state law, challenging an executive order promulgated by the defendants. The circuit court enjoined enforcement of the order on state law grounds. It did not decide the federal constitutional claim. On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the circuit court and expressly declined to decide the federal claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">The plaintiffs subsequently filed a motion in the circuit court seeking attorney\u2019s fees under section 1988. The court granted the motion and awarded attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiffs. The defendants noted another appeal, asserting that the plaintiffs were not prevailing parties under section 1988 because they did not prevail on their federal claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The Court of Appeals explained that federal law governs awards of attorney\u2019s fees under section 1988. After discussing federal caselaw on the issue, the Court rejected the defendants\u2019 contention that attorney\u2019s fees could not be awarded to the plaintiffs because they had not prevailed on their federal claim. The Court recognized that the federal courts have construed section 1988 to allow a plaintiff to recover attorney\u2019s fees when he has asserted federal and state law claims for the same relief; has prevailed solely on the state claim, and the federal claim is undecided. <em>Smith v. Robinson, </em>468 U.S. 992, 1006-07 &amp; n. 10, 104 S.Ct. 3457, 82 L.Ed.2d 746 (1984); <em>Maher v. Gagne,, </em>448 U.S. 122, 130-32 &amp; n. 15, 100 S.Ct. 2570, 65 L.Ed.2d 653 (1980). The rationale behind this interpretation is that the prevailing party should be compensated for raising a substantial civil rights issue under section 1983; and it would be unjust to \u201c \u2018penaliz[e] a litigant for the fact that courts are properly reluctant to resolve constitutional questions if a nonconstitutional claim is dispositive.\u2019 \u201d <em>Doe, supra, </em>300 Md. at 457, 479 A.2d 352 (quoting <em>Smith, supra, </em>468 U.S. at 1007, 104 S.Ct. 3457).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The <em>Doe </em>Court further explained that, under <em>Smith, supra, </em>468 U.S. at 1002, 104 S.Ct. 3457, in such an \u201cundecided claim\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>situation, a three-part test applies in determining whether the plaintiff should be awarded attorney\u2019s fees. \u201c[A] fee award pursuant to \u00a7 1988 is appropriate where (1) the \u00a7 1983 claim is sufficiently \u2018substantial\u2019 to support invocation of federal jurisdiction; (2) it arises from the same nucleus of operative facts as the claim on which the plaintiff prevailed; and (3) it is \u2018reasonably related to the plaintiffs ultimate success.\u2019 \u201d <em>Am. Auto. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. Cahill (\u201cAAMA\"), </em>53 F.Supp.2d 174, 179-80 (N.D.N.Y.1999) (quoting <em>Smith, supra, </em>468 U.S. at 1002, 1007).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">The Court in <em>Doe </em>held that the plaintiffs\u2019 section 1983 claim was undecided for purposes of section 1988. It then proceeded to apply the three-part test and concluded that the plaintiffs were not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees because their federal claims were insubstantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">In <em>Bangs v. Town of Wells, </em>834 A.2d 955 (Me.2003), the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine addressed a similar issue. The plaintiffs appealed an adverse zoning board decision to the trial court, under section 1983 and state law. The trial court affirmed the decision, finding against the plaintiffs on the state and federal claims. On appeal, the Supreme Judicial Court reversed, finding in favor of the plaintiffs, solely on the state law ground. It did not address the section 1983 claim. On remand, the plaintiffs filed a petition for attorney\u2019s fees under section 1988, which was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The plaintiffs appealed that decision. The Supreme Judicial Court of Maine reversed. It noted that the three-part test articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Smith v. Robinson </em>applies only when a party has prevailed on a non-federal claim and no judgment was entered on his section 1983 claim. Noting that it expressly avoided deciding the federal constitutional claim because it was unnecessary to do so, the court applied the three-part test, and decided that the plaintiffs were prevailing parties, entitled to attorney\u2019s fees. Implicitly, therefore, the <em>Bangs </em>court held that the plaintiffs\u2019 section 1983 claim was undecided, for purposes of section 1988, when the trial court ruled against the plaintiffs on their federal claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>but the plaintiffs prevailed on appeal on a state court ground, with the section 1983 claim unaddressed at the appellate level.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">Two trial court level cases are instructive. In <em>In re 244.5 Acres of Land, </em>830 A.2d 845 (Del.Super.Ct.2003), the plaintiff filed suit seeking a declaratory judgment that it was not required to observe a setback or, alternatively, was entitled to compensation for an unconstitutional taking. A Delaware trial court granted summary judgment against the plaintiff on both federal and state grounds. On appeal, the appellate court reversed only as to state grounds and did not decide the federal constitutional claim. On remand, the plaintiff filed a petition for attorney\u2019s fees under section 1988. The trial court determined that the section 1983 claim fell into the \u201c \u2018pleaded but undecided\u2019\u201d category. <em>Id. </em>at 847 (citations omitted). Applying the three-part test, it determined that the plaintiff could recover attorney\u2019s fees under section 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">A different result was reached in <em>AAMA, supra. </em>There, the plaintiffs filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York to enjoin enforcement of a New York emission vehicle sales mandate under state law and federal constitutional law. The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss on all counts. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed solely on state law grounds, without addressing the federal issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">On remand, one of the plaintiffs filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees under section 1988. The district court ruled that the federal constitutional claim it had dismissed, and that was not addressed by the appellate court, was \u201cdecided\u201d for purposes of section 1988. It reasoned that to rule otherwise would allow parties to circumvent the general rule prohibiting recovery of attorney\u2019s fees by amending their state law claims to include meritless section 1983 claims; that the law of the case doctrine supported its position; and that any other result would place on the defendant the unfair burden of appealing an issue it had prevailed upon. Ruling in the alternative, the court concluded that, even if the section 1983 claim was \u201cundecided,\u201d the plaintiff was not entitled to fees because, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>under the three-part test, that claim was not reasonably related to the plaintiffs success.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">(i)</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The threshold question in this case is whether the Green Party\u2019s section 1983 claim was decided, for purposes of section 1988, when it was determined adversely by the circuit court on summary judgment but, on appeal, was not addressed in the appellate opinion that reversed only on a state law ground. If (as the Board contends) the federal claim remained \u201cdecided\u201d after the appeal, the Green Party is not a prevailing party and could not recover attorney\u2019s fees under section 1988. If (as the Green Party contends) the federal claim was \u201cundecided\u201d after the appeal, the Green Party could be a prevailing party entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees upon satisfying the three-part test set forth in <em>Smith v. Robinson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">In denying the Green Party\u2019s petition for attorney\u2019s fees under section 1988, the circuit court determined that its ruling granting the Board\u2019s motion for summary judgment on federal constitutional grounds was \u201cdecided\u201d because it was left undisturbed by the Court of Appeals. The Green Party contends this ruling was legally incorrect. Specifically, it argues that, because the Court of Appeals reversed the circuit court\u2019s grant of summary judgment by addressing only state law grounds, the federal claims were no longer decided upon the filing of its fee petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">The Board answers that the circuit court\u2019s ruling was legally correct. Specifically, it argues that the decision of the Court of Appeals to limit its reversal to state law grounds and to decline to address the federal law claims rendered the federal claims still decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">A determination of prevailing party status is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo. Smyth ex rel. Smyth v. Rivero, </em>282 F.3d 268 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">We agree with the Green Party that the reversal by the Court of Appeals rendered the Green Party\u2019s federal section 1983 claim \u201cundecided\u201d for purposes of section 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>The case of <em>Robles v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>302 F.3d 262 (4th Cir.2002), on which the circuit court relied in determining that the Green Party\u2019s section 1983 claim was decided, is inapposite. There, the district court granted summary judgment adverse to the plaintiff on his federal claim. Following a jury verdict in favor of the plaintiff on his state law claim, the district court denied the plaintiff\u2019s petition for attorney\u2019s fees under section 1988. On appeal, the Fourth Circuit not only held that the plaintiffs federal constitutional rights had not been violated but also recognized that, at the moment the plaintiff filed his petition for attorney\u2019s fees, he had lost the federal issue on summary judgment in favor of the defendants. It is clear in <em>Robles </em>that the federal claim was decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">Likewise, <em>County Executive of Prince George\u2019s County v. Doe, supra, </em>also relied upon by the circuit court, is significantly different procedurally from this case. In <em>Doe, </em>the circuit court did not rule at all on the plaintiffs federal claim. On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the circuit court\u2019s judgment, solely on state grounds, and declined to address the federal claim. Clearly, then, when the section 1988 petition later was filed, the federal claim had never been decided by any court at any level, and therefore was undecided. <em>See S.W. Bell Tel. Co. v. City of El Paso, </em>346 F.3d 541 (5th Cir.2003), and <em>Williams v. Hanover Hous. Auth., </em>113 F.3d 1294 (1st Cir.1997) (holding that section 1983 claims were undecided for section 1988 purposes when they were not decided by the district courts initially or the appellate courts on review).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The case at bar is most similar to the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine\u2019s decision in <em>Bangs, supra, </em>in which, after the trial court ruled against the plaintiffs on their federal and state claims, the appellate court reversed on state grounds only, without addressing the federal claims; and, ultimately, the appellate court held that the reversal of the trial court\u2019s judgment rendered the federal claims \u201cundecided.\u201d It also is similar to <em>In re 244.5 Acres, </em>in which, after deciding state and federal claims adversely to the plaintiffs, and then having the appellate court reverse on the state claim only, without decid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>ing the federal claim, the trial court concluded that the federal claim was undecided for purposes of section 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">The <em>AAMA </em>case bears some similarity to this case, but also is distinguishable. There, the district court\u2019s adverse rulings on the federal claims were on non-substantive grounds that were unaffected, and could not be affected, by the appellate court\u2019s reversal on a state ground. The district court\u2019s adverse ruling on the federal due process claim was based on lack of standing, which other Second Circuit precedent had held eliminated the district court\u2019s power to award fees. Its adverse ruling on the federal commerce clause claim was based on <em>res judicata, </em>because the Second Circuit previously had decided the claim in another action. <em>AAMA, supra, </em>58 F.Supp.2d at 181 n. 6.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">In the instant case, the reasons for the grant of summary judgment by the lower court were quite different from the reasons the district court in <em>AAMA </em>resolved the federal claims adversely to the plaintiffs. The circuit court here granted summary judgment because it found that the caselaw did not support the Green Party\u2019s claim under the state or federal constitutions. Such reasons are not in the same vein as those in <em>AAMA, </em>and therefore do not require us to decide this case in the same manner. Additionally, we have found helpful, by analogy, cases that analyze, under the collateral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>estoppel doctrine, whether an issue of fact was \u201cdecided\u201d in prior litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">A central concern in determining whether the doctrine of collateral estoppel will bar subsequent re-litigation of an issue is whether the issue was decided. <em>See Migra v. Warren City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ., </em>465 U.S. 75, 77 n. 1, 104 S.Ct. 892, 79 L.Ed.2d 56 (1984); <em>Kent County Bd. of Educ. v. Bilhrough, </em>309 Md. 487, 489, 525 A.2d 232 (1987). Federal caselaw makes clear the general proposition that, when a lower court decides a case on multiple issues, and an appellate court decides only one issue and disregards the others, collateral estoppel will not bar re-litigation of the unreviewed issues; the doctrine only will apply to bar re-litigation of those issues specifically passed upon by the appellate court. <em>See Dow Chem. v. U.S. EPA, </em>832 F.2d 319, 323 &amp; n. 24 (5th Cir.1987) (noting, \u201c \u2018The federal decisions agree that once an appellate court has affirmed on one ground and passed over another, preclusion does not attach to the ground omitted from its decision.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting 18 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller <em>&amp; </em>Edward H. Cooper, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 4421 (1981)); <em>see also Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. v. Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians, </em>94 F.3d 747, 754 (2d Cir.1996); Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 27 cmt. o (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Two rationales justify this policy. First, as the Court of Appeals explained in <em>Cook v. State, </em>281 Md. 665, 381 A.2d 671 (1978):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-6\">Considerations of fairness would seem to require that a prior determination of fact or mixed law and fact should not normally be treated as final, and hence binding, in a subsequent proceeding against a particular party, where the party against whom preclusion is sought was denied the opportunity, as a matter of law, to have the disputed issue decided by an appellate court on direct review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 675, 381 A.2d 671. Second, the <em>Dow </em>Court explained, \u201cThe rule responds to the fear that the appellate court\u2019s choice of grounds may arbitrarily and unfairly preclude any review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>alternative grounds reached by the district court.\u201d <em>Dow, supra, </em>832 F.2d at 323 n. 25 (quoting Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 4421).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Similarly, these cases justify our conclusion that the Green Party\u2019s federal claims are undecided for purposes of section 1988, because the Court of Appeals \u201cpassed over\u201d those claims. It seems unfair to treat the circuit court\u2019s determination on the federal issues as binding and decided, after the Green Party was denied the opportunity to have those claims decided by the Court of Appeals because of its decision to consider only the state law claims. The Court exercised the restraint generally taken by state courts in choosing not to decide federal issues when state issues are dispositive. That decision, however, unfairly precluded, to the prejudice of the Green Party, its opportunity to have that Court evaluate the decision of the circuit court on the federal claims. The cases and policies surrounding collateral estoppel lend analogous support to our position that the Green Party\u2019s claims are undecided for purposes of section 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Finally, the Board argues that the rationale behind section 1988, providing attorney\u2019s fees in cases where the federal claims are undecided, only applies when the state claim on which the plaintiff has prevailed is statutory, not constitutional. We disagree. The justification for permitting an award of attorney\u2019s fees in section 1988 cases when the plaintiff prevails on a state claim and a federal constitutional claim remains undecided, is \u201cto avoid penalizing a litigant for the fact that courts are properly reluctant to resolve constitutional questions if a nonconstitutional claim is dispositive.\u201d <em>Doe, supra, </em>300 Md. at 457, 479 A.2d 352 (quoting <em>Smith, supra, </em>468 U.S. at 1007, 104 S.Ct. 3457). This policy similarly justifies application of the three-part test when the litigant prevails on a state constitutional claim and the federal constitutional claim remains undecided. Courts generally are as reluctant to decide federal constitutional questions when they can resolve a case on state constitutional grounds as they are to decide federal questions when they can resolve the case on state statutory grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>For these reasons, we hold that, when the Green Party filed its fee petition under section 1988, its section 1983 claim was \u201cundecided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">(ii)</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The Green Party contends that, because its section 1983 claim was undecided, the circuit court should have applied the three-part test of <em>Smith v. Robinson </em>to determine an award of attorney\u2019s fees; and that it satisfies that test. Specifically, it argues that it raised a substantial federal claim of discrimination and burdens on federal constitutional rights, under section 1983; that its section 1983 claim was based on the same core facts as its state claim, namely, the circumstances regarding ballot access for Green Party candidates; and that its section 1983 claim was reasonably related to its ultimate success.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">The Board counters that the Green Party cannot meet the three-part test. It maintains that the Green Party\u2019s section 1983 claim was insubstantial, because it did not have sufficient legal merit; the claim did not arise from a common nucleus of fact because the facts giving rise to liability under state law did not suffice to give rise to liability under federal law; and the factual claim was not reasonably related to the Green Party\u2019s success on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Substantial Federal Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">The parties disagree about the test that applies in determining whether a federal claim is \u201csubstantial\u201d under section 1988. Relying on <em>Doe, Maher, supra, </em>448 U.S. 122, 100 S.Ct. 2570, 65 L.Ed.2d 653, and the seminal case of <em>Hagans v. Lavine, </em>415 U.S. 528, 94 S.Ct. 1372, 39 L.Ed.2d 577 (1974), the Green Party argues that the test for substantiality is whether the issue raised by the federal claim is not wholly insubstantial, plainly insubstantial, or obviously without merit. Relying on <em>Buckhannon Board &amp; Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Department of Health Human Resources, </em>532 U.S. 598, 121 S.Ct. 1835, 149 L.Ed.2d 855 (2001), and other federal cases, the Board argues that the wholly insubstantial test has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>been superseded by a new test, which is whether the federal claim has legal merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">We agree with the Green Party that the wholly insubstantial test enunciated in <em>Hagans, supra, </em>governs a determination of whether a federal claim is substantial for purposes of section 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">In <em>Buckhannon, supra, </em>the Supreme Court limited the catalyst theory, which held that courts could award section 1988 fees based on a private settlement or when the defendant had voluntarily changed his behavior in the absence of a judgment or court ruling. The Court did so because the theory \u201callow[ed] an award where there [was] no judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 605, 121 S.Ct. 1885. The Court explained that was not the type of \u201clegal merit\u201d that it previously had found necessary for an award of attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Id. </em>The Court concluded that \u201clegal merit\u201d includes only \u201cenforceable judgments on the merits and court-ordered consent decrees [because they] create the \u2018material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties\u2019 necessary to permit an award attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 604, 121 S.Ct. 1835 (quoting <em>Texas State Teachers Assn. v. Garland Indep. Sch. Dist, </em>489 U.S. 782, 792-93, 109 S.Ct. 1486, 103 L.Ed.2d 866 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The Court\u2019s discussion makes clear that, in requiring legal merit and rejecting the catalyst theory, it was addressing the third prong of the three-part test, or material alteration of the parties\u2019 legal relationship. It was limiting application of section 1988 by prohibiting an award of attorney\u2019s fees in cases in which a party received the desired result of its litigation through a voluntary change in the defendant\u2019s conduct rather than by a judgment on the merits or court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">In briefly addressing the substantiality issue, in response to the dissent, the <em>Buckhannon </em>Court defined meritless to mean \u201cit will never be determined....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 606, 121 S.Ct. 1835. It determined that the plaintiff was not a prevailing party because, although the defendant voluntarily changed its behavior, the Virginia legislature spoke before the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>could consider the plaintiffs claims, and the court dismissed those claims as moot. The claims were meritless because they would never be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\"><em>Smyth, supra, </em>also relied upon by the Board, similarly involved a meritless claim. In quoting <em>Buckhannon, </em>the Fourth Circuit found that the preliminary injunction granted in that case was not a court order, nor a judgment on the merits as required for prevailing party status. The court of appeals held that, because a legal determination was never and would never be made, the federal claim was meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The Board last cites an unpublished opinion, <em>Voyeur Dorm, L.C. v. City of Tampa, </em>2003 WL 23208270 (11th Cir.2003), and <em>Johnson v. City of Aiken, </em>278 F.3d 333 (4th Cir.2002), for further support. Both cases are inapposite. In <em>Voyeur, </em>the plaintiff prevailed under a state ordinance, but lost on the federal constitutional claim; therefore, he was not a prevailing party and substantiality was not an issue. In <em>Johnson, </em>the issue was the amount of attorney\u2019s fees; the fact that plaintiffs were prevailing parties was not disputed, because they succeeded on their federal and state claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The Board, therefore, has offered no case that changes the substantiality test as set forth in <em>Hagans. </em>Our Court of Appeals in <em>Doe, </em>while not deciding the appropriate standard, noted that the wholly insubstantial test from <em>Hagans </em>is the majority rule, and has been rejected only by one court.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We will, therefore, determine whether the Green Party\u2019s federal constitutional claims were substantial under the <em>Hagans </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">The issue in <em>Hagans </em>was whether the plaintiffs had presented a substantial section 1983 claim, allowing the district court to entertain jurisdiction over their equal protection and state statutory claims under 28 U.S.C. section 1343.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>The Court noted that section 1343 conferred jurisdiction upon the district court to entertain the constitutional claim only if it was of sufficient substance to support federal jurisdiction. If it was sufficient, then the district court could hear the state statutory claim as a matter of pendent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">In determining whether the federal constitutional claim was substantial, the Court noted that federal courts cannot hear cases otherwise within their jurisdiction if they are \u201c \u2018so attenuated and unsubstantial as to be absolutely devoid of merit....\u201d\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 536-37, 94 S.Ct. 1372 (quoting <em>Newburyport Water Co. v. Newburyport, </em>193 U.S. 561, 579, 24 S.Ct. 553, 48 L.Ed. 795 (1904)). The Court further cited to <em>Ex Parte Poresky, </em>290 U.S. 30, 54 S.Ct. 3, 78 L.Ed. 152 (1933), for the proposition that a claim may be insubstantial if \u201cit is \u2018obviously without merit\u2019 or because \u2018its unsoundness so clearly results from the previous decisions of this court as to foreclose the subject and leave no room for the inference that the question sought to be raised can be the subject of controversy.\u2019\u201d <em>Hagans, supra, </em>415 U.S. at 537, 94 S.Ct. 1372 (quoting <em>Poresky, supra,, </em>290 U.S. at 32, 54 S.Ct. 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Elaborating further, the Court defined insubstantial as \u201cwholly insubstantial, obviously frivolous, and obviously without merit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations and quotations omitted). The Court opined that the words wholly and obviously have \u201ccogent legal significance.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-6\">[Tjhose words import that claims are constitutionally insubstanti\u00e1l only if the prior decisions inescapably render the claims frivolous; previous decisions that merely render claims doubtful or questionable merit do not render them insubstantial for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2281. A claim is insubstantial only if \u201cits unsoundness so clearly results from the previous decisions of this court as to foreclose the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>subject and leave no room for the inference that the questions sought to be raised can be the subject of controversy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADk\"><em>Id. </em>at 537-38, 94 S.Ct. 1372 (quoting <em>Poresky, </em>supra, 290 U.S. at 32, 54 S.Ct. 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">We cannot say that the Green Party\u2019s federal claims in this case were wholly insubstantial or obviously frivolous. Even the four-member Court of Appeals majority in the first <em>Green Party </em>appeal was careful to note that it was not suggesting that the Green Party\u2019s claims would fail under the federal Constitution. We have not found any case directly on point or that has' resolved this exact issue so as to foreclose its subject. The Green Party has cited cases that may lend support to its federal claim, which would render the claim substantial for purposes of section 1988. The Board also has cited cases that, even if they render the Green Party\u2019s claims doubtful, which we do not suggest they do, it acknowledges involve petitioning schemes different from Maryland\u2019s double petitioning requirement. Thus, this case is very different from <em>Doe, supra, </em>300 Md. at 461-62, 479 A.2d 352 (holding the plaintiff\u2019s claim was insubstantial under any definition because that exact claim had been addressed and rejected by the Supreme Court). We conclude that under the very broad definition of substantial that applies to this area of the law, the Green Party\u2019s federal claims were substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Common Nucleus of Operative Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The Green Party contends its federal and state claims arose out of a common nucleus of operative fact because both involved discriminatory ballot access practices by the Board that prevented Gross\u2019s name from being placed on the ballot in 2000. The Board answers that the claims did not arise from a common nucleus of operative fact because the legal standards of an equal protection analysis differ between the state and federal constitutions, and the facts that gave rise to liability under the state claim would not suffice under the federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">The Board\u2019s analysis is essentially an extension of its substantiality argument. It does not dispute that the federal and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>state claims both were based on the denial of ballot access to Gross and the Green Party. Instead, the Board argues that the standard for determining whether claims share a common nucleus of fact has been changed from that prescribed by the Supreme Court in <em>United Mine Workers of America v. Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. 715, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966), discussing pendent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">The Board relies upon <em>McClain v. Northwest Community Corrections Center, </em>323 F.Supp.2d 834 (N.D.Ohio 2004), and <em>Gumbhir, supra, </em>in support of its position. Although the court in <em>McClain </em>appeared to base its decision on failure to show a common nucleus of operative fact, it cited to cases wherein the plaintiffs federal claims were decided against it, suggesting that its decision actually was based upon insubstantiality because the plaintiff could not have prevailed on its federal claims. In <em>Gumbhir, </em>the court did not base its decision on a common nucleus of fact, but performed its own federal equal protection analysis in concluding that the federal claim was insubstantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Doe </em>recognized that <em>Gibbs </em>is the leading authority in deciding whether claims share a common nucleus of operative fact, which requires the unresolved federal claim to be'based upon the same facts as the state claim upon which the plaintiff prevailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The Board does not suggest, nor is there room for suggestion, that the Green Party\u2019s federal claims were not based upon the same facts as its state claims. It is evident that both claims were based on exactly the same facts, namely, denial of ballot access to Gross and the Green Party, and therefore the federal claim arose from the same nucleus of operative fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Reasonably Related to Ultimate Success</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">Neither party directly addresses this part of the test in its brief. It has been phrased by the courts in two different ways: (1) as requiring that the federal claim be \u201creasonably related to the plaintiffs ultimate success,\u201d <em>see AAMA, supra, </em>53 F.Supp.2d at 180, and (2) as requiring that the relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>granted to the plaintiff result in a material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties. <em>Bangs, supra, </em>884 A.2d at 958 (citations omitted). We will address both interpretations.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">The district court in <em>AAMA </em>looked to the form of relief that was granted to the plaintiff on its state law claim in comparison to the relief that would have been granted had it prevailed on its federal constitutional claim. The court held that the federal claim was not reasonably related to the plaintiffs success because the injunction that it obtained against the defendant in prevailing on its state law claim was a far narrower form of relief than having the law declared unconstitutional and illegal, which would have resulted had the plaintiff prevailed on its federal claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">In the case at bar, the Green Party received the same relief that would have been granted had it prevailed on its federal constitutional claim \u2014 -the challenged Election Law Article statutes were declared unconstitutional and the Board was prohibited from applying them in a discriminatory manner. For those reasons, the Green Party\u2019s federal claims were reasonably related to its ultimate success.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The <em>Bangs </em>court, relying upon <em>Buekhannon, supra, </em>defined material alteration to require a plaintiff to receive \u201cat least some relief on the merits of his claim.\u201d <em>Bangs, supra, </em>834 A.2d at 958-59. The Green Party did receive relief on the merits of its claim through the opinion of the Court of Appeals, which held Maryland\u2019s double petitioning requirement unconstitutional, and the entry of that order by the circuit court. The relationship of the parties was, therefore, materially altered.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">For those reasons, we hold that the Green Party is a prevailing party for purposes of section 1988, and therefore is entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Accordingly, we shall vacate the judgment of the circuit court and remand the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>for a hearing to determine the amount of the award under section 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The Green Party next contends that the circuit court erred in refusing to consider its petition for attorney\u2019s fees as to the related cases of <em>Hufnagel </em>and <em>Stysley, </em>because those cases involved tasks directly related to the Green Party\u2019s success in the instant case, and the cases share some of the same parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">The Board contends that the circuit court was correct in refusing to consider the Green Party\u2019s petition with respect to the <em>Hufnagel </em>and <em>Stysley </em>cases because the majority of the parties are not the same and are not parties to this case, and the cases were not consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">We agree with the Board\u2019s position, that the Green Party cannot request attorney\u2019s fees for the parties in the two related cases, as they are not parties to this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">The Supreme Court has made clear that, under section 1988, it is the prevailing <em>party </em>that is eligible for attorney\u2019s fees, and not the lawyer. <em>Venegas v. Mitchell, </em>495 U.S. 82, 87, 110 S.Ct. 1679, 109 L.Ed.2d 74 (1990). Further, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, in <em>Rhoads v. FDIC, </em>286 F.Supp.2d 532 (D.Md.2003), in holding that an attorney lacks standing to request attorney\u2019s fees under section 1988, declared that \u201c \u2018a claim for such an award must itself be made by the party rather than the attorney.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 542 (quoting <em>Brown v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>722 F.2d 1009, 1011 (2d Cir.1983)). The <em>Brown </em>court discussed the rationale behind prohibiting attorneys from requesting their own fees, including congressional intent, duty of loyalty concerns, and consistency with the principle that fee awards also cannot be assessed against attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">The Green Party argues that these principles are irrelevant, because it is the Green Party, as the prevailing party, not its attorneys, requesting fees for the work performed in the two related cases. This argument is largely without merit. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number><em>Stysley </em>case does not share any plaintiffs with the case at bar. The <em>Hufnagel </em>case has only two parties in common with the instant case: of the five plaintiffs in <em>Hufnagel, </em>only two were also parties to this case; of the six plaintiffs in this case, four were not parties to <em>Hufnagel. </em>It appears that the attorneys in the instant case are attempting to request their own attorney\u2019s fees for work they performed on the two related cases under the guise of a request by the Green Party. The attorneys lack standing to make such a request in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">Additionally, in the federal cases awarding attorney\u2019s fees to plaintiffs in related cases, the cases were consolidated. <em>See, e.g., NAACP v. Civiletti, </em>609 F.2d 514 (D.C.Cir,1979) (cases consolidated for trial and request of the fee award); <em>Rybicki v. State Bd. of Elections of Ill, </em>584 F.Supp. 849 (N.D.Ill.1984) (cases consolidated for trial and appeal, and each plaintiff separately requested fees); <em>Vaughns v. Bd. of Educ. of Prince George\u2019s County, </em>598 F.Supp. 1262 (D.Md.1984) (each plaintiff separately requested fees and cases were consolidated for appeal). The <em>Hufnagel </em>and <em>Stysley </em>plaintiffs never have requested attorney\u2019s fees in their related cases, nor have the cases ever been consolidated with the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Last, in the <em>Rybicki </em>case, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois addressed the issue of whether a plaintiff may receive a fee award if work performed on his case was a catalyst in obtaining relief in two related cases, which were consolidated for trial. The district court answered that question in the negative, and declined to grant the plaintiff an award of attorney\u2019s fees based on the success of the plaintiffs in the other consolidated cases. Similarly, we will not permit the <em>Hufnagel </em>and <em>Stysley </em>plaintiffs to recover attorney\u2019s fees in this case, claiming that they acted as catalysts to the Green Party\u2019s success.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">For those reasons, we shall hold that the circuit court did not err in refusing to consider the Green Party\u2019s fee petition as to the <em>Hufnagel </em>and <em>Stysley </em>cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">The Green Party last contends that the circuit court erred in granting the Board\u2019s motions to enlarge time to respond to, and to bifurcate resolution of, its petition for attorney\u2019s fees. Specifically, it argues that the Board failed to show cause for its enlargement motion and that the circuit court\u2019s actions resulted in an impermissible lengthening of the proceedings. The Board did not address this issue in its brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">We shall review the circuit court\u2019s grant of the Board\u2019s motions for abuse of discretion. <em>See Myers v. Celotex Corp., </em>88 Md.App. 442, 594 A.2d 1248 (1991); Md. Rule 1-204, 2-502 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Rule 2-502 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">If at any stage of an action a question arises that is within the sole province of the court to decide, whether or not the action is triable by a jury, and if it would be convenient to have the question decided before proceeding further, the court, on motion or on its own initiative, may order that the question be presented for decision in the manner the court deems expedient.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">The circuit court found that it would be most expedient to determine the legal issue of whether the Green Party was a prevailing party before determining the amount of any attorney\u2019s fee award. The amount of the attorney\u2019s fee award hinged on resolution of the legal issue in the Green Party\u2019s favor, thus obviating the need to consider the issue if it determined that the Green Party was not a prevailing party. We do not find that the circuit court abused its discretion in granting the Board\u2019s motion to bifurcate.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">Rule l-204(a) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-10\">Generally. When these rules or an order of court require or allow an act to be done at or within a specified time, the court, on motion of any party and for cause shown, may (1) shorten the period remaining, (2) extend the period if the motion is filed before the expiration of the period originally prescribed or extended by a previous order....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>The Board cited as its basis for requesting an enlargement of time the complexity of the legal and factual disputes in the case and the need for additional discovery and memoranda. In granting the motion, the circuit court found that the Board had shown cause for the extension, and we do not find that the circuit court abused its discretion.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.

Beth Hufnagel was nominated for the office of Comptroller of Maryland in 2002. The Board refused to place her on the ballot for similar reasons as the refusal of Gross.

Also, we do not find persuasive the other stated reasons in <em>AAMA </em>for ruling the decided federal court claims still decided, after reversal on state grounds. The risk that parties will add frivolous section 1983 (or other federal constitutional) claims to their state law claims merely to enable them to seek fees under section 1988 is low because, as we shall explain, a wholly insubstantial federal claim will not support a fee award under section 1988. The law of the case doctrine dictates that a lower court is bound by the decision in the same case made by the appellate court, <em>see Chesley v. Goldstein &amp; Baron, Chtd., </em>145 Md.App. 605, 806 A.2d 296 (2002), <em>aff'd, </em>375 Md. 244, 825 A.2d 985 (2003); it does not mean that decisions made by the lower court and not reviewed by the appellate court, because the appellate court exercised its prerogative to decide the case on another ground, necessarily remain decided. Finally, we see no real threat that parties who have prevailed below will be put in the impossible position of having to appeal from a successful outcome to protect against a possible future award of attorneys' fees, if the lower courts\u2019 determination is reversed on a state law ground.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b157-8\">.
