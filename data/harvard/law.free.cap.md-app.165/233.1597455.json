(\u201cLiberty\u201d), a closely held Maryland corporation, which owns and operates an eight-bed assisted living facility. When Edenbaum, as President of Liberty, relieved Schwarcz of her duties as the facility\u2019s Director of Operations and discontinued her salary, Schwarcz filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, claiming that Edenbaum and Liberty had breached their shareholders\u2019 agreement. Having received neither salary nor profits since her termination, she requested damages and the dissolution of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">Although the circuit court found that Edenbaum had rightfully removed Schwarcz as Director of Operations, it ruled that Schwarcz was, as a shareholder and director, entitled to post-termination salary and profits. Holding both Edenbaum and Liberty liable for those unpaid sums, it entered a judgment in favor of Schwarcz and against Liberty and Edenbaum, in the amount of $89,880.00. But, as for Schwarcz\u2019s request that Liberty be dissolved, it found that Edenbaum\u2019s conduct was not so \u201coppressive\u201d as to justify Liberty\u2019s dissolution and, therefore, denied Schwarcz\u2019s request. Cross-appeals followed, in which Edenbaum and Liberty questioned the court\u2019s award of salary and profits to Schwarcz, and Schwarcz challenged the denial of her dissolution demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">For our review, Edenbaum and Liberty present four issues. Reordered, they are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-11\">I. Whether Schwarcz was entitled to continue receiving her salary after her employment was terminated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>II. Whether the circuit court erred in awarding Schwarcz corporate profits for years in which, appellants claim, there were no such no profits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-4\">III. Whether the circuit court erred in holding Edenbaum personally liable for profits and salary allegedly owed Schwarcz.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\">IV. Whether the circuit court erred in refusing to apply the \u201cavoidable consequences rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">On cross-appeal, Schwarcz presents one question. Reworded, it is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-7\">V. Whether the circuit court abused its discretion in declining to dissolve Liberty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">For the reasons that follow, we shall vacate the judgments of the circuit court awarding Schwarcz salary and profits, vacate the denial of Schwarcz\u2019s request for dissolution, and remand this case to the circuit court for it to clarify its findings as to Liberty\u2019s profits in 2002 and 2003 and to consider dissolution or other less drastic remedies under Md.Code (1975, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-413(b)(2) of the Corporations and Associations Article (\u201cCorps. &amp; Ass\u2019ns\u201d). Having so held, we need not and, therefore, shall not reach the question of whether the circuit court erred in refusing to apply the \u201cavoidable consequences rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">In June 1999, Schwarcz, a geriatric nurse, and Susan FehrSmith, a Maryland businesswoman, formed Liberty Assisted Living, Inc., for the purpose of owning and operating an assisted living facility in Maryland. Fehr-Smith owned two-thirds of the corporation\u2019s stock, while Schwarcz owned one-third. To implement their plans, they converted a house they had purchased into an assisted living facility. But, before the first patient had moved into that facility, Fehr-Smith informed Schwarcz that she wished to sell her interest in the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">Jonathan Edenbaum, who had experience in managing assisted living facilities, emerged as a potential purchaser of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Fehr-Smith\u2019s shares. Between December 2000 and early January 2001, Edenbaum and Schwarcz agreed that they would operate the business on a \u201c50/50 basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">On January 15, 2001, Edenbaum purchased most of FehrSmith\u2019s shares, giving him a 51% interest in Liberty, and Schwarcz purchased Fehr-Smith\u2019s remaining shares, increasing her interest in the corporation to 49%. At that time, Edenbaum and Schwarcz entered into a sparse, one-page agreement, entitled \u201cShareholder\u2019s [sic] Agreement.\u201d That agreement stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">\n<em>Officers and Directors, Corporate Decisions, By-Laws, Charter:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">Jonathan and Klara be [sic] the two directors of the Company. Jonathan will be President, Secretary and Treasurer. Klara will be Vice President. Jonathan will be the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Klara will be the Director of Operations. All shareholder decisions will be made by simple majority; no super-majorities shall be required for any shareholder decision. Jonathan\u2019s vote will be controlling in any business decisions and/or disputes between the parties either as shareholders or directors. No action or vote of the shareholders or directors shall be valid without Jonathan\u2019s consent. The corporate charter and corporate by-laws shall be amended, and are hereby deemed to be amended, to reflect the provisions of the Shareholder\u2019s Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">\n<em>Sala,'ties:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-8\">Jonathan and Klara will receive equal salaries (after bills have been paid for the month) and Jonathan will receive 50% profit and Clara [sic] will receive 50% profit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">Jonathan\u2019s <em>Responsibilities:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-10\">Marketing of the facility and giving tours to prospective clients and their families, business management decisions, in charge of all bills, generate resident bills, oversee all paperwork of resident files, hiring of consultants, keeping house <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>in compliance with state and county regulations. Jonathan will have the final say in all business and corporate decisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">\n<em>Klara\u2019s Responsibilities:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">Cooking and cleaning of the home, patient care, grocery shopping, transportation for residents, laundry and daily house maintenance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\n<em>Joint Responsibilities:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">Resident activities, hiring staff, decision on accepting residents or denying, admission, family interactions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">\n<em>Bank Account and Bills:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-9\">A bank account will be opened in the Company\u2019s name with Jonathan and Klara as joint signatories on the account. Klara may not authorize any vendors or pay any bills without Jonathan\u2019s approval.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">In sum, the parties\u2019 agreement provided that both parties would be directors of the corporation; that Edenbaum would be President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Chief Executive Officer; and that Schwarcz would be Vice President and Director of Operations. It further stated that Edenbaum\u2019s vote would be \u201ccontrolling in any business decisions and/or disputes between the parties either as shareholders or directors\u201d and that Edenbaum would \u201chave the final say in all business and corporate decisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">The agreement also spelled out the parties\u2019 duties and responsibilities. While Edenbaum was responsible for paying \u201call bills,\u201d \u201cgenerat[ing] resident bills,\u201d \u201chiring of consultants,\u201d \u201c[mjarketing of the facility,\u201d making all \u201cbusiness management decisions,\u201d \u201coverseeing] all paperwork of resident files,\u201d \u201cgiving tours to prospective clients and their families,\u201d and \u201ckeeping [the] house in compliance with state and county regulations,\u201d Schwarcz was responsible for the \u201c[c]ooking and cleaning of the home, patient care, grocery shopping, transportation for residents, laundry and daily house maintenance.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>The two shared responsibility for \u201c[rjesident activities, hiring staff ... accepting residents\u201d and \u201cfamily interactions.\u201d And finally, the agreement provided that Edenbaum and Schwarcz would receive \u201cequal salaries\u201d and share equally in the company\u2019s profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">After a few months of operating the business together, Edenbaum grew increasingly dissatisfied with Schwarcz\u2019s performance as Director of Operations and with the behavior of Schwarcz\u2019s adult son, who resided at the facility with her. To end their association, Edenbaum proposed that one of them should purchase the other\u2019s stock. That proposal was followed by a letter dated September 4, 2001, in which Edenbaum presented Schwarcz with three options: either she would purchase his shares in Liberty for $125,000.00 in cash or he would purchase her shares for $65,000.00 in cash, or he would sell his shares to Susan Fehr-Smith and her husband. In the same letter, Edenbaum threatened that, if Schwarcz did not agree to one of the three options, she would be removed from her position as Director of Operations. If that occurred, he warned she would not receive any further salary, only share in the company\u2019s profits, if there were any. The letter apparently did not provoke the desired response. And, three weeks later, as promised, Edenbaum discharged Schwarcz from her position as Director of Operations and discontinued payment of her salary. Almost a year and a half after her termination, in February 2003, Schwarcz filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County against Edenbaum and Liberty, alleging breach of contract. Later, she added a request that Liberty be dissolved because of Edenbaum\u2019s \u201cillegal, oppressive and/or fraudulent\u201d conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\n<em>Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">A bench trial was held in June 2004. At that trial, nine witnesses testified,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but, for the purposes of this appeal, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>are only concerned with the testimony of three: Edenbaum, Schwarcz, and Dennis Colson, an accountant.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">\n<em>Edenbaum\u2019s Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Edenbaum testified that when he first became a co-owner of Liberty, his relationship with Schwarcz \u201cwas good.\u201d But, after several months, their relationship changed. \u201cAll of a sudden she want[ed] weekends off, she want[ed] this, she want[ed] that, she want[ed] hired staff,\u201d he said. She also, according to Edenbaum, \u201cnever\u201d provided him with \u201cany receipts for the petty cash\u201d or the \u201cgrocery shopping,\u201d as he requested. And she bought \u201call sorts of things, crazy kinds of gourmet foods, Hungarian foods for herself and her family and [did] not stick[ ] to the menu.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Despite repeatedly warning Schwarcz to stop \u201ctranscrib[ing] medications from doctors\u2019 orders because she really didn\u2019t know how,\u201d she continued the practice, Edenbaum testified. And, in violation of patient confidentiality, she would, according to Edenbaum, fax \u201cincident reports and various things,\u201d which she composed in Hungarian, to her daughter, who would then translate them into English and fax them back. Edenbaum also expressed his agreement with three other witnesses<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that Schwarcz had been \u201crough\u201d with a patient in the shower, had \u201cpickfed]\u201d another patient \u201cup by a diaper\u201d and had called another patient \u201cugly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">He further testified that Schwarcz\u2019s relationship with the rest of the staff \u201cwas not good.\u201d \u201cShe treated them as slaves,\u201d he explained, frightening and \u201cdemean[ing]\u201d them.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">Moreover, Edenbaum stated that he had had problems with Schwarcz\u2019s adult son, Vincent, who was living at Liberty with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>Schwarcz. According to Edenbaum, Vincent was violent. He \u201cscream[ed]\u201d and \u201cscared\u201d the patients, Edenbaum claimed. When Edenbaum told Vincent he could not drink on the premises, Vincent threatened Edenbaum\u2019s life, and on other occasions \u201ccussed [him] out,\u201d prompting Edenbaum to obtain a \u201cpeace order\u201d in September 2001. \u201cIt was not,\u201d Edenbaum testified, \u201ca peaceful, serene environment, which is what it should be for geriatric patients.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">Edenbaum further testified that, in the years since he became a eo-owner of Liberty, Liberty had had no \u201csignificant cash flow\u201d or profits after all the bills and salaries were paid. In 2001, he and Schwarcz each received approximately $30,000.00 in salary. After Schwarcz\u2019s discharge, Edenbaum received, in 2002, almost $67,000.00. The increase occurred, he explained, because, after he relieved Schwarcz of her position as Director of Operations, he took over her duties and received her salary in addition to his own. As of the date of trial, Edenbaum had received in salary $24,750.00 for 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\n<em>Schwarcz\u2019s Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Schwarcz testified that she had never \u201cdone anything to threaten the safety of any resident\u201d and denied that Edenbaum had ever approached her about her mistreatment of the residents. Furthermore, to her knowledge, no residents had ever complained about her son\u2019s behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Schwarcz stated that, before she was relieved of her duties at Liberty, she and Edenbaum were both receiving salaries of $4000.00 a month, but that she had not received any money, in either salary or profits, from Liberty since her termination. She further testified that Edenbaum had not conducted any shareholders\u2019 or directors\u2019 meetings or provided her with any reports concerning Liberty\u2019s business since her termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">\n<em>Colson\u2019s Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">Dennis Colson, Schwarcz\u2019s accountancy expert, testified regarding Liberty\u2019s tax returns and balance sheets for 2001 through 2003. He stated that, in 2001, Edenbaum\u2019s salary was $35,413.00, and Schwarcz\u2019s was $32,455.00, but after her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>termination, Schwarcz received no salary or profits, while Edenbaum received a salary of $66,500.00 in 2002 and of $60,500.00 in 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">He further testified that, although Liberty had \u201cprofits\u201d of approximately $9,400.00 in 2002 and $13,000.00 in 2003, the deductions it took for depreciation in those years created losses instead of profits. Liberty\u2019s tax returns, he pointed out, showed a $24,420.00 deduction for depreciation in 2002 and a $22,939.00 deduction for depreciation in 2003. Had Liberty not taken the deductions, the tax returns would have shown, he concluded, \u201cprofits\u201d of approximately $9,400.00 in 2002 and $13,000.00 in 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Later, however, Colson qualified his answer, stating that he was talking about \u201ccash flow\u201d and not \u201cprofits.\u201d He also conceded that Liberty\u2019s 2002 balance sheet showed approximately $14,400.00 in mortgage payments that were \u201cnot reflected in the loss number\u201d on the 2002 tax return and that similar mortgage payments in 2003 were \u201cnot reflected in the loss number\u201d on the 2003 tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">\n<em>Circuit Court\u2019s Ruling</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">When the trial concluded, the court ruled that, under the terms of the shareholders\u2019 agreement, Edenbaum had the right to relieve Schwarcz of her responsibilities at Liberty. But it declined to find that the shareholders\u2019 agreement constituted an employment contract, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-8\">I do not find that this shareholders\u2019 agreement constitutes an employment contract. It is an agreement, which was created by two shareholders to this corporation. It provides how those shareholders will be paid. [It] provides that Mr. Edenbaum and Ms. Schwarcz will receive salaries and that Mr. Edenbaum and Ms. Schwarcz will receive 50 percent profit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-9\">So, I do not find that this creates an employment contract or an employment agreement. This is a shareholders\u2019 agreement. And when Mr. Edenbaum made the decision to remove Ms. Schwarcz from the premises and relieve her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>from the responsibilities that she had, that did not relieve Mr. Edenbaum or the corporation of its obligations to pay her as a director of the company under the salaries that had been agreed to in the shareholders\u2019 agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">The court awarded Schwarcz post-termination salary for 2002, 2003, and 2004, as well as the difference between Edenbaum\u2019s salary and hers in 2001. Then, relying on Colson\u2019s testimony, the court found that Liberty had profits in 2002 and 2003 and awarded Schwarcz 50% of what it calculated to be profits of $11,047.00. In total, the court awarded Schwarcz $89,880.00, and held Edenbaum and Liberty jointly and severally liable for that sum. In doing so, the trial judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-5\">I find that Ms. Schwarcz is entitled to judgment. I am going to enter judgment against each of the defendants in this case in the total amount of $89,880.00, which is broken down as follows: 2002 salary, 33,250; 2003 salary, 30,250; 2004 salary, 12,375, and one half of the difference in 2001 is $2,958.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-6\">I am also adding to that the testimony from the accountant, who testified as to what the profits would have been. And Ms. Schwarcz\u2019s 50 percent of the 2002 profits is $4,457; 2003, 50 percent of that profit is $6,500, for a total judgment in favor of the plaintiff against each of the defendants in the amount, jointly and severally, in the amount of $89,880.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Rejecting Schwarcz\u2019s claim that Edenbaum\u2019s conduct was oppressive, the trial judge observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-8\">I am not satisfied that Mr. Edenbaum engaged in oppressive conduct. He has the right under the shareholders\u2019 agreement to do what he did, he made a business decision to do it, and under the shareholders\u2019 agreement, he was in his right to do so ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-9\">Ms. Schwarcz, no longer being a part of having those responsibilities assigned to her, however, is certainly entitled to be paid pursuant to the shareholders\u2019 agreement and it is not \u2014 her interest in the corporation isn\u2019t being divested, she is not being forced out of the corporation, and she is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>still entitled to share in the profits and the salary that is being paid pursuant to the shareholders\u2019 agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">The trial judge then concluded:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-6\">So, I do not see the conduct of Mr. Edenbaum as constituting oppression, so I will not order a dissolution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">The standard of review for a non-jury trial is governed by Maryland Rule 8-131. That rule provides that this Court \u201cwill not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous, and will give due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d Md. Rule 8-131(c). In reviewing the circuit court\u2019s findings, we view the evidence \u201c \u2018in a light most favorable to the prevailing party.\u2019\u201d <em>Gen. Motors Corp. v. Schmitz, </em>362 Md. 229, 234, 764 A.2d 838 (2001)(quoting <em>Ryan v. Thurston, </em>276 Md. 390, 392, 347 A.2d 834 (1975)).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">While the factual determinations of the circuit court are afforded significant deference on review, its legal determinations are not. \u201c \u2018[T]he clearly erroneous standard for appellate review in [Maryland Rule 8-131(c) ] does not apply to a trial court\u2019s determinations of legal questions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ins. Co. of N. Am. v. Miller, </em>362 Md. 361, 372, 765 A.2d 587 (2001)(quoting <em>Heat &amp; Power Corp. v. Air Prods. &amp; Chem. Inc., </em>320 Md. 584, 591, 578 A.2d 1202 (1990)). The appropriate inquiry for such determinations is whether the circuit court was \u201clegally correct.\u201d <em>Md. Envtl. Trust v. Gaynor, </em>140 Md. App. 433, 440, 780 A.2d 1193 (2001), <em>rav\u2019d, on other grounds, </em>370 Md. 89, 803 A.2d 512 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-12\">The circuit court held that the Edenbaum-Schwarcz shareholders\u2019 agreement was a shareholders\u2019 agreement, not an employment contract. Therefore, as either a shareholder or a director (the court was not altogether clear in which capaci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>ty),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Schwarcz was entitled to continue to receive her salary after she was terminated as Director of Operations. Edenbaum and Liberty claim, however, that the shareholders\u2019 agreement was in part an employment agreement, that Schwarcz was receiving her salary, under that agreement, as Director of Operations, and that, once she was lawfully terminated from that position, she was no longer entitled to receive a salary for a position she no longer occupied. We find much merit to their position.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">As noted, Liberty is a closely held corporation. Unlike \u201cclose corporations,\u201d which are defined by statute in Maryland,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a closely held corporation has \u201cno single, generally accepted definition.\u201d <em>Donahue v. Rodd Electrotype Company of New England, </em>367 Mass. 578, 328 N.E.2d 505, 511 (1975). However, closely held corporations commonly possess the following attributes: \u201c(1) a small number of stockholders; (2) no ready market for the corporate stock; and (3) substantial majority stockholder participation in the management, direction and operations of the corporation.\u201d <em>Donahue, </em>328 N.E.2d at 511; <em>see </em>F. Lodge O\u2019Neal &amp; Robert B. Thompson, O\u2019Neal &amp; Thompson\u2019s Close Corporations and LLCs: Law and Practice \u00a7 1:2, 4-5 (3d ed.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>Shareholder agreements of closely held corporations, among other things, usually mandate the structure of the business\u2019s management; name the officers and directors of the corporation; spell out the voting rights of the shareholders; outline when, to whom and under what conditions a shareholder may sell his or her shares; establish a \u201cmethod or formula for fixing the purchase price of shares\u201d; and govern the operation of the enterprise. Kerry M. Lavelle, <em>Drafting Shareholder Agreements for the Closely-Held Business, </em>4 DePaul Bus. L.J. 109, 112-17, 120 (1991); <em>see </em>Harry G. Henn &amp; John R. Alexander, Laws of Corporations, \u00a7 198 (3d ed.1983). Because shareholders\u2019 agreements commonly provide for the corporation to purchase shares when certain events occur (such as death of a shareholder), the corporation itself is usually a party to such an agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">The Edenbaum-Schwarcz shareholders\u2019 agreement was, in one sense, more modest in scope than a typical shareholders\u2019 agreement and, in another sense, more expansive. It did not provide for shareholders\u2019 voting rights, or outline when, to whom and under what conditions a shareholder may sell his or her shares. Nor did it provide a method or formula for fixing the purchase price of shares. But, unlike a pure shareholders\u2019 agreement, it did set forth the positions, duties, and salaries of the corporate officers and employees, that is, the duties of Edenbaum and Schwarcz. Consequently, Edenbaum and Liberty claim that the shareholders\u2019 agreement was not merely a shareholders\u2019 agreement, but an employment agreement as well: one between Schwarcz and the corporation. Although the corporation was not formally named as a party to the agreement, it is Edenbaum\u2019s position that he signed the shareholders\u2019 agreement as an officer, \u201cemploying\u201d Schwarcz as Liberty\u2019s Director of Operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">That a shareholders\u2019 agreement may also constitute an employment agreement has been implicitly recognized by this Court in <em>Goerlich v. Courtney Industries, Inc., </em>84 Md.App. 660, 581 A.2d 825 (1990). In <em>Goerlich, </em>we affirmed the circuit court\u2019s dismissal of a malpractice action brought by a terminated shareholder-employee against the attorney-drafter of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>shareholders\u2019 agreement, which the shareholder-employee had believed provided him with employment for so long as the corporation endured. In doing so, we stated that, because of the indefinite nature of his employment under the shareholders\u2019 agreement, he was at most an employee at-will and could therefore be discharged from his employment at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">Although the court below did not address the question whether Schwarcz was an at-will employee of Liberty, it did state that Edenbaum \u201cwas within his right,\u201d under the shareholders\u2019 agreement, to \u201cremove[ ] Ms. Schwarcz from her responsibilities\u201d as Director of Operations, because Edenbaum had \u201cthe final say,\u201d under that agreement, \u201cin all business and corporate decisions.\u201d In short, Edenbaum had the right, granted him by the shareholders\u2019 agreement, to discharge Schwarcz from her position with the company. To later state, as the circuit court did, that the agreement was not an employment agreement is incongruous. If Schwarcz can be discharged under the terms of an agreement, then whatever that agreement was formally called, it was, in part at least, an employment agreement, because it governed the termination of her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Moreover, the agreement assigned no duties to Schwarcz as a director of the corporation, but it did as Director of Operations. Her responsibilities, as Director of Operations, encompassed all those things that ensured the smooth operation of the facility, including \u201ccooking and cleaning of the home, patient care, grocery shopping, transportation of residents, laundry and daily house maintenance,\u201d as well as duties she shared with Edenbaum, such as \u201cresident activities, hiring staff, decision on accepting residents or denying, admission, family interaction.\u201d Thus, the \u201csalary\u201d she was to receive was clearly intended to compensate for her work in that capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Sehwarcz\u2019s relationship to the corporation, as Director of Operations, fits, of course, the very definition of employment: \u201cEmployment is a relationship created expressly or impliedly by an agreement calling for the employee to perform work under the control of the employer in return for some consider<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>ation by the employer.\u201d Stanley Mazaroff &amp; Todd Horn, Maryland Employment Law \u00a7 3.01(1) (2d ed.2004). To form an employment contract, \u201c[a]t a minimum, the parties must agree to the work to be performed by the employee and the consideration the employer will give in return for this work.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Here, the shareholders\u2019 agreement stated both the work that Schwarcz was to perform, under the control of Edenbaum as Chief Executive Officer, and the consideration she would be paid for that work. As the canons of contract construction require us to ascertain the intent of the contracting parties, <em>Society of Am. Foresters v. Renewable Natural Resources Found., </em>114 Md.App. 224, 234, 689 A.2d 662 (1997), and, in doing so, to interpret a contract as a whole, <em>Sullins v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>340 Md. 503, 508, 667 A.2d 617 (1995), we can reach no other conclusion but that the shareholders\u2019 agreement was also an employment agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Whether it was an at-will agreement, we need not decide, because appellee has not cross-appealed on the grounds that she was wrongfully discharged. Suffice it to say that upon her discharge, unless otherwise provided by contract, she was not entitled to post-termination wages. And, here, the contract did not provide otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Nor was she to receive her salary as a shareholder. The shareholders\u2019 agreement provided that Edenbaum and Schwarcz were to \u201creceive equal salaries\u201d and each would receive 50% of the profits. \u201cSalary\u201d is defined as \u201ca fixed payment at regular intervals for services.\u201d Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary (2d College ed.1984). That the agreement distinguished between \u201csalary\u201d and \u201cprofit\u201d indicates that the intent of the agreement was that the salary was to compensate Edenbaum and Schwarcz for the services they rendered the company, and profits were to compensate them as owners of the corporation. Thus, because there is no dispute that Schwarcz\u2019s employment with Liberty was lawfully terminated, and because the agreement did not provide that she would receive her salary after termination, the circuit court was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>legally incorrect in awarding Schwarcz post-termination salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">[51 Edenbaum and Liberty contend that the circuit court \u201cawarded non-existent profits to Ms. Schwarcz\u201d because, they insist, there were no profits to be awarded. The testimony upon which the court relied, in awarding a portion of the corporate profits, was Dennis Colson\u2019s. While Colson testified that, had Liberty\u2019s tax returns and balance sheets not included depreciation deductions in 2002 and 2003, they would have shown \u201cprofits\u201d of approximately $9,400.00 and $13,000.00, respectively, he admitted on cross-examination that the mortgage payments made by Liberty in 2002 and 2003 were \u201cnot reflected in the loss figures\u201d and those payments erased the \u201cprofits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">It was certainly within the court\u2019s discretion to rely on the first part of Colson\u2019s testimony and not what followed, but the record does not reflect it did. If, in fact, the court did rely on Colson\u2019s testimony in <em>toto, </em>it should have arguably concluded, as Edenbaum and Liberty maintain, that there were no profits to be distributed. Consequently, we must vacate the award of profits and remand the matter to the circuit court on this issue for it to clarify why it held as it did. In other words, did it intentionally or inadvertently not take into account the mortgage payments made by the corporation when it calculated corporate profits?</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">Edenbaum contends that the circuit court erred in holding him personally liable for the salary and profits the court awarded Schwarcz. Because the shareholders\u2019 agreement \u201cdid not involve the parties in their individual capacities\u201d and the \u201crights and duties [provided for in the agreement] all stemmed from the corporation,\u201d Edenbaum claims he could not have \u201cbe[en] held personally liable for his acts as a corporate officer or shareholder,\u201d in the absence of fraud. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Schwarcz did not pursue a fraud claim at trial, there was no basis, he asserts, upon which to hold him personally liable for what were the corporation\u2019s obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Edenbaum and Schwarcz\u2019s agreement was really three agreements in one: two employment agreements, one between Edenbaum and Liberty and the other between Schwarcz and Liberty; and a shareholders\u2019 agreement between Edenbaum and Schwarcz describing the duties, responsibilities, and entitlements of each. Schwarcz sued Edenbaum and the corporation for unpaid salary and profits, both of which were corporate responsibilities. While Schwarcz was working at Liberty, she was an employee of Liberty, not Edenbaum. Her salary was paid by Liberty, not Edenbaum. And the profits, if there were any, were Liberty\u2019s, not Edenbaum\u2019s. In short, paying salary and profits to Schwarcz was the responsibility and obligation of Liberty, not Edenbaum.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Indeed, in the absence of fraud, \u201ca corporate officer is not personally liable on a corporate contract with a third person.\u201d <em>A.B. Corporation v. Futrovsky, </em>259 Md. 65, 79, 267 A.2d 130 (1970). Thus, Edenbaum, as an officer of Liberty, could not be held personally liable for breach of the employment contract between Liberty and Schwarcz, as no claim of fraud was advanced at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">As a director of Liberty, Edenbaum was also shielded from personal liability so long as he was acting in \u201cgood faith,\u201d \u201cin the best interests of the corporation,\u201d and \u201c[w]ith the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances.\u201d Corps. &amp; Ass\u2019ns \u00a7 2-405.1(c);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Md.Code (1973, 1998 RepLVol.), \u00a7 5-417 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCts. &amp; Jud. Proc.\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Schwarcz does not now argue, and the circuit court did not find, that Edenbaum violated the standard of care of a corporate director. In fact, the circuit court found that Edenbaum \u201cwas within his right ... under the terms of the shareholder[s\u2019] agreement\u201d to terminate Schwarcz. Thus, Edenbaum could not be held personally liable as a director.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">Nor could he be held personally liable as a shareholder. The \u201cgeneral rule is that shareholders are not held liable for debts or obligations of the corporation except where it is necessary to prevent fraud or enforce a paramount equity.\u201d <em>Damazo v. Wahby, </em>259 Md. 627, 633, 270 A.2d 814 (1970). As Schwarcz does not claim either \u201cfraud\u201d or invoke \u201cparamount equity,\u201d the circuit court erred in holding Edenbaum personally liable for Schwarcz\u2019s claim for unpaid salary and profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Having concluded that the circuit court was legally incorrect in awarding Schwarcz her salary for the time after she was terminated, we do not reach the question of whether the circuit court erred in refusing to apply the \u201cavoidable consequences rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">\n<em>Cross-Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">In her cross-appeal, Schwarcz contends that the circuit court abused its discretion in dismissing her request for involuntary dissolution of Liberty. The court, she argues, should have granted that request \u201con the ground that Mr. Edenbaum engaged in \u2018oppressive\u2019 conduct\u201d because his conduct \u201csubstantially defeat[ed][her] reasonable expectations as a shareholder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">The standard we apply in reviewing the grant or denial of a petition for involuntary dissolution is whether the circuit court in rendering its decision abused its discretion. <em>Renbaum v. Custom Holding, Inc., </em>386 Md. 28, 43, 871 A.2d 554 (2005). Under that standard, \u201c[w]e will not reverse a ruling ... simply because we would have made a different ruling had we been sitting as trial judges.\u201d <em>Das v. Das, </em>133 Md.App. 1, 16, 754 A.2d 441 (2000). Indeed, under the \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard, we will not vacate a circuit court\u2019s judgment unless \u201c \u2018no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the [trial] court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15, 754 A.2d 441 (quoting <em>North v. North, </em>102 Md.App. 1, 13-14, 648 A.2d 1025 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">Corporations and Associations \u00a7 3-413 sets forth the grounds upon which a stockholder may petition a court to dissolve a corporation. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-10\">(a) Stockholders entitled to cast at least 25 percent of all the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors of a corporation may petition a court of equity to dissolve the corporation on grounds that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>(1) The directors are so divided respecting the management of the corporation\u2019s affairs that the votes required for action by the board cannot be obtained; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-4\">(2) The stockholders are so divided that directors cannot be elected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">(b) Any stockholder entitled to vote in the election of directors of a corporation may petition a court of equity to dissolve the corporation on grounds that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">(1) The stockholders are so divided that they have failed, for a period which includes at least two consecutive annual meeting dates, to elect successors to directors whose terms would have expired on the election and qualification of their successors; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">(2) The acts of the directors or those in control of the corporation are illegal, oppressive, or fraudulent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">(c) Any stockholder or creditor of a corporation other than a railroad corporation may petition a court of equity to dissolve the corporation on grounds that it is unable to meet its debts as they mature in the ordinary course of its business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">Corporations and Associations \u00a7 3-413.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">Because Schwarcz relies solely on Corps. &amp; Ass\u2019ns \u00a7 3-413(b)(2) in claiming that dissolution was warranted because of Edenbaum\u2019s \u201coppressive\u201d conduct, we shall confine our review to that subsection of the statute. It permits \u201c[a]ny stockholder entitled to vote in the election of directors of a corporation\u201d to petition a court to dissolve the corporation on the ground that the \u201cacts of the directors or those in control of the corporation are illegal, oppressive, or fraudulent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">\u201cOppressive\u201d conduct is not defined by the statute. But, as it is singled out as a separate category of conduct justifying corporate dissolution by Corps. <em>&amp; </em>Ass\u2019ns \u00a7 3-413(b)(2), we surmise that it does not necessarily involve \u201cfraudulent\u201d or \u201cillegal\u201d conduct. <em>See White v.

As we shall see, this approach has much to recommend it.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">As' we noted earlier, the typical characteristics of a closely held corporation are: \u201c(1) a small number of stockholders; (2) no ready market for the corporate stock; and (3) substantial majority stockholder participation in the management, direction and operations of the corporation.\u201d <em>Donahue, </em>328 N.E.2d at 511. \u201cAs thus defined, the [closely held] corporation bears striking resemblance to a partnership,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and \u201c[cjommentors and courts have noted that [it] is often little more than an \u2018incorporated\u2019 or \u2018chartered partnership.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 512; <em>see Meiselman, </em>307 S.E.2d at 557; O\u2019Neal <em>&amp; </em>Thompson, Close Corporations and LLCs, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 1:2 at 7-8.</p>\n<p id=\"Ai4\">Furthermore, \u201cit is generally understood that, in addition to supplying capital and labor to a contemplated enterprise and expecting a fair return, parties comprising the ownership of a [closely held] corporation expect to be actively involved in its management and operation.\u201d <em>Balvik, </em>411 N.W.2d at 386. \u201cUnlike the typical shareholder in a publicly held corporation, who may simply be an investor or a speculator and does not desire to assume the responsibilities of management, the shareholder in a [closely held] corporation considers himself or herself as a co-owner of the business and wants the privileges and powers that go with ownership.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Employment by the corporation is one such privilege and often is the shareholder\u2019s main source of income. <em>Id. </em>at 386. Moreover, \u201c \u2018providing for employment may have been the principal reason why the shareholder participated in organizing the corporation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 1 F. O\u2019Neal &amp; R. Thompson, O\u2019Neal\u2019s Close Corporations \u00a7 1.07, 25 (3d ed.1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">But the very nature of a closely held corporation makes it possible for a majority shareholder to \u201cfreeze out\u201d a minority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>shareholder, that is, \u201c \u2018deprive a minority shareholder of her interest in the business or a fair return on her investment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe limited market for stock in a [closely held] corporation and the natural reluctance of potential investors to purchase a noncontrolling interest in a [closely held] corporation that has been marked by dissension can result in a minority shareholder\u2019s interest being held \u2018hostage\u2019 by the controlling interest, and can lead to situations where the majority \u2018freeze out\u2019 minority shareholders by the use of oppressive tactics.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">Because of the \u201cpredicament\u201d a minority shareholder is in when a freeze out occurs, <em>id. </em>at 387, courts have looked at a majority shareholder\u2019s alleged \u201coppressive\u201d conduct, in terms of the \u201c \u2018reasonable expectations\u2019 held by minority shareholders in committing their capital to the particular enterprise.\u201d <em>Matter of Kemp &amp; Beatley, </em>473 N.E.2d at 1179-80.

But, we caution, \u201coppression should be deemed to arise only when the majority conduct substantially defeats expectations that, objectively viewed, were both reasonable under the circumstances and were central to the petitioner\u2019s decision to join the venture.\u201d <em>Matter of Kemp &amp; Beatley, </em>473 N.E.2d at 1179. It \u201cshould not be deemed oppressive simply because the petitioner\u2019s subjective hopes and desires in joining the venture are not fulfilled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That is to say, \u201c[disappointment alone should not necessarily be equated with oppression.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Schwarcz testified that she founded Liberty with FehrSmith with the expectation that she would be employed by the corporation, share in corporate earnings, and have a place in corporate management. And those expectations were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>disturbed, when a substitution of majority shareholders occurred: Edenbaum for Fehr-Smith. Indeed, at that time, her expectations were memorialized in the Edenbaum-Schwarcz shareholders\u2019 agreement, which provided that she would be employed as its Director of Operations with specified duties and at a salary equal to Edenbaum\u2019s. Moreover, as an officer and director of Liberty, she expected to continue to participate in shareholders\u2019 meetings and receive company reports. All that apparently ended when she was terminated from her position as Director of Operations. Her termination substantially defeated her reasonable expectations that she would be employed by the corporation, receive a salary, and take part in its management. That does not mean, however, that the circuit court abused its discretion in failing to proceed with the dissolution of Liberty upon her request.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">\u201cBecause one benefit of a corporation is that it may have a perpetual life,\u201d we are reminded by the Court of Appeals that \u201cthe demise of a corporation is regulated as an extraordinary action under Title 3 of the Article.\u201d <em>Renbaum, </em>386 Md. at 48-49, 871 A.2d 554.

The court ruled as follows, at one point seemingly awarding Schwarcz post-termination salary as a shareholder, at another point making that award to her as corporate director:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-6\">I do not find that this shareholders\u2019 agreement constitutes an employment contract. It is an agreement, which was created by two shareholders to this corporation. It provides how those <em>shareholders will be paid. </em>[It] provides that Mr. Edenbaum and Ms. Schwarcz will receive salaries and that Mr. Edenbaum and Ms. Schwarcz will receive 50 percent profit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-7\">So, I do not find that this creates an employment contract or an employment agreement. This is a shareholders' agreement. And when Mr. Edenbaum made the decision to remove Ms. Schwarcz from the premises and relieve her from the responsibilities that she had, that did not relieve Mr. Edenbaum or the corporation of its obligations to <em>pay her as a director </em>of the company under the salaries that had been agreed to in the shareholders\u2019 agreement.
