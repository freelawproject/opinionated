When the Office of the Zoning Administrator denied that application, appellant took the matter before the City\u2019s Board of Municipal and Zoning Appeals (the \u201cBoard\u201d). There, appellant achieved what, under other circumstances, would have been a victory: Three of the five Board members voted to allow appellant to continue presenting adult entertainment<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014 two did not. Because a supermajority of the Board, that is, four out of its five members, must approve such an application, it was denied. Md.Code (1957, 2003 Repl. Vol), Art. 66B \u00a7 2.08(i)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">Undeterred, appellant filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. When that court affirmed the Board\u2019s decision, appellant noted this appeal, presenting us with this novel question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-10\">When a minority of the voting members of a board prevent a majority of that board\u2019s members from approving a nonconforming use, must the minority issue findings of fact and conclusions of law in support of its decision, as would have been required of the majority had it prevailed?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-11\">Because we conclude that a prevailing minority is required to issue findings of fact and conclusions of law so as to permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>judicial review of its decision and that did not occur here, we shall vacate the judgment of the circuit court and remand this case to that court with instructions that it, in turn, remand this matter to the Board so that the minority of Board members, who disapproved appellant\u2019s application for a nonconforming use, can issue findings of fact and conclusions of law, supporting its successful opposition to appellant\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Appellant\u2019s bar is located at 606-608 West Lexington Street,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a two-story brick building in Baltimore City. Originally owned by S.T.S., Inc., the bar is located in a B-4 zoning district, where, under \u00a7 6-506 of the Baltimore City Zoning Code (2004), a tavern with live entertainment and dancing is a permitted use, but an adult entertainment business is not. Although not permitted in a B-4 zone, it may, nonetheless, exist there as a nonconforming use, but only if it has done so continuously since September 10, 1993. Baltimore City Zoning Code \u00a7 13-609.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And that is precisely what appellant claims. It contends that it has been presenting \u201cadult entertainment\u201d since 1990 and therefore, contrary to what the Board held, is entitled to continue presenting such entertainment as a nonconforming use.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">To fully understand the nature of the nonconforming use requested by appellant, we must briefly review the statutory definitions of the terms, which define that use, namely, \u201cadult entertainment business,\u201d \u201cadult entertainment,\u201d \u201cnudity,\u201d and \u201cpartial nudity.\u201d \u201cAdult entertainment business,\u201d under \u00a7 1-106(b) of the zoning code, \u201cmeans any cabaret, lounge, night club, modeling studio, or other establishment whose major <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>business is offering its customers adult entertainment,\u201d which leads to the question: What is \u201cadult entertainment\u201d? \u201cAdult entertainment means,\u201d among other things, \u201centertainment in which individuals appear for public view in a state of nudity or partial nudity ...\u201d Baltimore City Zoning Code \u00a7 1-106(a)(2)(i).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> And that, in turn, leads to the question: what is \u201cnudity\u201d and \u201cpartial nudity\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">\u201cNudity\u201d means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-6\">(i) the showing of the human male or female genitals, pubic area, or buttocks with less than a fully opaque covering;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-7\">(ii) the showing of the female breast with less than a fully opaque covering over any part below the top of the nipple; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-8\">(iii) the depiction of covered male genitals in a discernibly turgid state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">Baltimore City Zoning Code \u00a7 106(a)(3).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-10\">\u201cPartial nudity\u201d means a state of dress in which opaque clothing covers no more than:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-12\">(i) the human male or female genitals, pubic area, or buttocks;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-13\">(ii) the female breasts below the top of the nipples; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>(iii) portions of the body covered by supporting straps or devices.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">Baltimore City Zoning Code 1 \u2014 106(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Administrative Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">On October 10, 2002, appellant filed an application with the Department of Housing and Community Development to change the existing use of its bar from a \u201ctavern including live entertainment and dancing\u201d to a \u201ctavern including live entertainment and dancing, <em>and adult entertainment.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Because \u201cadult entertainment\u201d is not a permitted use in the zoning district where the bar was located, appellant\u2019s request to present such entertainment was a request for approval of a nonconforming use. Such approval required evidence that the entertainment was \u201cadult,\u201d as defined by Baltimore City Zoning Code \u00a7 l-106(a)(2) and (b)(4), and has been presented, without interruption, since September 10, 1993. <em>See </em>Baltimore City Zoning Code \u00a7 13-609.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">When the Office of the Zoning Administrator denied its application, appellant appealed to the Board. At the ensuing Board hearing, appellant claimed that it, and the previous owner of the bar, S.T.S., Inc., had offered \u201cadult entertainment\u201d weekly since 1990 at the 608 West Lexington Street portion of the property and that they had the permission of the Board of Liquor License Commissioners for Baltimore City (\u201cliquor board\u201d) to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">In support of that claim, appellant introduced a letter dated April 20, 1990, from the Executive Secretary of the liquor board, authorizing \u201clive male or female revue type entertainment one night per week\u201d at 608 West Lexington Street and two of the liquor board\u2019s index card records for the property. One index card stated that, on April 5, 1990, a hearing was held and approval was granted for \u201clive entertainment consisting of male or female revue type entertainment one night a week\u201d at 608 West Lexington Street. The other indicated a transfer of the liquor license, from 608 to 606-608 West Lexington Street, on November 25,1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>In addition to submitting those documents, appellant presented three witnesses: Renold Owens, the past manager and now, with his brother, the current owner of the bar; Carl Scheffel, whose company, S.T.S., Inc., previously owed the bar and is presently appellant\u2019s landlord; and Wayne Jeffries, a current employee of the bar, who has worked there for the past fifteen years. All three witnesses testified that the bar has offered either nudity or partial nudity since at least 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Renold Owens testified that he and his brother, Dana Owens, own the bar, through their corporation, appellant Mombee TLC, Inc.; that they purchased the business from Carl Scheffel\u2019s corporation, S.T.S., Inc., in 1997; that before and after the purchase, he managed the business, first for S.T.S., Inc., and then for his own corporation, Mombee TLC, Inc.; and that the bar has continuously provided adult entertainment since 1990. \u201cI provide male adult entertainment, male dancers, one night and one night we provide female dancers,\u201d Owens said. Describing the format of the entertainment and the dress of the performers, he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-6\">We actually have a show that we put up a stage that\u2019s 18 inches high off the floor, up against the wall. Our clients are usually 3 feet away from the stage and we had dancers to get up and do two numbers each and they usually have topless females, and the guys bottom as well. They wear, I don\u2019t know what you call them the bottom pieces that they wear ... G-string ... type of items, yeah. And they usually \u2014 as I said, they all do two numbers of two songs and that\u2019s basically what, what we have. When you have people actually tip them, they throw dollars onto the stage or whatever.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">The dancers, Owens testified, were topless but always had coverings on the bottom portion of their bodies, a G-string or \u201cbikini bottom of some kind.\u201d Asked whether the dancers ever were ever totally nude or bottomless, Owens stated that, although frowned upon, \u201c[i]t\u2019s allowed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">The bar\u2019s presentation of adult entertainment began, according to Owens, in 1989, with the approval of the liquor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>board. \u201cBack in 1989, we were told,\u201d he testified, \u201cthat we needed to get permission from the Liquor Board in order to do that and we went forward to the Liquor Board ... [We] called and sent a letter asking for permission to come before the Board and they had a hearing and we went for the hearing and they gave us the approval.\u201d The liquor board\u2019s approval was conveyed to them in a letter dated April 20, 1990, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AM9\">As per your request, you are hereby granted permission to furnish your patrons with live male or female revue type entertainment one night per week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-5\">4$4 \u2021 s[5 \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-6\">If permitting this live entertainment causes your place of business to be operated in an improper or disorderly manner, it may be necessary to withdraw this approval at a later date.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">On cross-examination, counsel for the University of Maryland, one of three parties that opposed appellant\u2019s request for a nonconforming use, questioned Owens about his brother\u2019s testimony at an April 21, 2001 liquor board hearing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At that hearing, his brother and co-owner of appellant, testified that the dancers \u201care not showing any body parts, absolutely no personal body parts are shown at our shows ... We know, this [liquor] board has told us, make certain that there is no nudity in any of your shows. We don\u2019t have it.\u201d Asked whether he disagreed with his brother\u2019s statement, Owens responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-8\">Owens: No, I don\u2019t disagree with that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-9\">Counsel: So there\u2019s no nudity on \u2014 in 2001, August, 2001? Owens: August 2001, I don\u2019t understand your question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-10\">What are you \u2014 I don\u2019t understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-11\">Counsel: Well, as we described, as we talked about earlier, in August 2001, you were before the Liquor Board for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>violation. That violation was a violation for having adult entertainment and Mr. [Donald] Owens has testified here that there is no nudity. So do you believe that there was no nudity occurring in August 2001 at Club Bunns?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-5\">Owens: I don\u2019t \u2014 I said that occasionally, if I\u2019m not mistaken, earlier, that sometimes there is nudity. Sometimes\u2014 we prefer that they don\u2019t have the nudity ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-6\">* <em>* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-7\">Counsel: Your brother indicated, he described generally ... how the female revue is done and he says there is no nudity and you say you disagree with that, the female revue at Club Buns does involve nudity?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-8\">Owens: Again, I will reiterate, nudity is allowed. We don\u2019t prefer that they be completely nude.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">Counsel for the University also questioned Owens about a statement made at the same liquor board hearing by his attorney, asserting that \u201cthey [the dancers] have been doing live entertainment, never adult entertainment ... they never had adult entertainment in their business.\u201d Queried as to whether he had corrected or disagreed with his attorney, Owens replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know that I corrected her. I don\u2019t know what the terms may have been used at that time ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">Asked by a Board member to explain the difference between his testimony and his brother\u2019s, Owens stated: \u201cWhen you\u2019re saying nudity I\u2019m thinking of the bottom of the personal parts when I say that.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel took that opportunity to remind the Board that, under the zoning code, \u201cadult entertainment\u201d included \u201cpartial nudity,\u201d and that partial nudity included bikinis.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">The University\u2019s counsel then introduced copies of a permit application, signed by Owens, and filed by appellant on August 23, 2001, the same day as the liquor board hearing. That application sought to change the use of the properties from \u201ctavern\u201d to \u201ctavern including live entertainment and dancing.\u201d On that application, immediately below the handwritten description stating: \u201cUse First and Second Floor as a tavern with live entertainment and dancing,\u201d were the words, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>handwritten block letters, \u201cNO ADULT ENTERTAIN-MEN[T].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">Although no explanation was offered at that time as to the reason for this discrepancy, later, at the hearing before the circuit court, appellant\u2019s counsel denied that appellant had ever disclaimed adult entertainment in their application, explaining: \u201cIf you look at the handwriting, it\u2019s not in the handwriting of the applicant. That \u2018no adult entertainment\u2019 was put there by the zoning officials. And the reason was, is that they knew at that point there had to be a hearing on the adult entertainment issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">When asked whether that application should have indicated adult entertainment as an existing use of the property, Owens responded \u201cno\u201d and appellant\u2019s counsel explained that August 2001 permit application was an immediate and temporary solution and that his client intended to pursue a nonconforming use permit for adult entertainment before the Board:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5b\">The reason that you see this August 2001 use permit application is that there was a glitch in Zoning administration with regard to the consolidation of the buildings and therefore, what we immediately did was get the use permit, both buildings live entertainment, or tavern with live entertainment and dancing. We knew that we had to come for an appeal with regard to the nonconforming use for adult entertainment but we had \u2014 what we wanted to do was rectify immediately what could be rectified downstairs without an appeal. The intention was subsequent to that to pursue the nonconforming use appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-6\">There was no waiver of any rights with regard to the filing of that. It was just made clear on the use application by Zoning administration, we\u2019re not going for the adult entertainment portion at this time, issued [sic] the use permit without it to get that part cleaned up now. Go for the adult entertainment nonconforming use later.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Also introduced was the permit for 606 West Lexington Street, issued three weeks after the August 2001 application, which stated \u201c(USE) USE 1ST AND 2ND FLOOR AS A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>TAVERN WITH LIVE ENTERTAINMENT [sic] AND DANCING NO ADULT ENTERTAINMENT.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Explaining the delay between the 2001 permit and the filing of the October 10, 2002 permit application requesting adult entertainment, Owens stated, \u201cwe were actually getting our finances in order, the legal advice and application to submit to Zoning as well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The second witness presented by appellant was Carl Scheffel, the former owner of the bar and appellant\u2019s current landlord. He testified that, in 1990, when he owned the bar, he began to offer adult entertainment after obtaining verbal approval from the liquor board. Unable to identify who specifically gave that approval, he speculated, \u201cI\u2019d say Mr. Stansbury but I could be incorrect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">As to what \u201cmale or female revue\u201d meant in 1990, Scheffel explained: \u201cMy words, risque dancing, you know, bikinis.\u201d In the early 1990\u2019s, he explained, the dancers wore \u201c[r]isque clothing.\u201d Although he said that he didn\u2019t know if the women were topless, he insisted that the bar presented \u201csemi-naked dancing\u201d and \u201cstrip shows.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">Appellant\u2019s third and final witness was Wayne Jeffries, an employee of the business for over 15 years. He stated that in 1990, \u201cwhen it started, there was like a \u2014 each performance did two numbers. One number was a lip sync and the other number was the dancing ... The dress varied according to the song they were doing. Some was [sic] fully dressed, the guys in suits, sometimes casual wear sportswear, and the women sometimes in evening gowns or a robe or nightgown.\u201d During the performance, the dancers would shed some of their clothes, \u201cdown to bikini draw \u2014 bikinis and the top piece with the string.\u201d He recalled that \u201cthere was something hanging, would hang down, glued ... I think it was glued on there ... breasts,\u201d but \u201c[b]ottoms was [sic] covered.\u201d Jeffries testified that the shows have continued to the present day, on a weekly basis, with a similar format and state of dress.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">Opposing appellant\u2019s request for a nonconforming use permit were the University of Maryland at Baltimore, Westside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Renaissance, Inc., and Lexington Market. Each submitted a letter predicting that the presentation of adult entertainment would adversely affect current plans to revitalize the area; two of the three, the University and Westside Renaissance, presented testimony: Eugene Lockett, a self-described \u201cExecutive Analyst in Real Estate Development at the University of Maryland Baltimore,\u201d testified that the University owns the property adjacent to the \u201cClub Bunns\u201d; that the University intends to develop the property into residential housing for students; and that adult entertainment is \u201csubversive to the whole area.\u201d R. Ron Kreitner of Westside Renaissance agreed. He stated that Westside plans to develop 2000 dwelling units in the area, that the residents they have attracted and those whom they hope to attract are concerned about having adult entertainment in the area and that \u201cadult entertainment\u201d was inconsistent with the community\u2019s development plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">After the hearing ended, the Board \u201cdisapproved\u201d appellant\u2019s application and issued a written decision, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-6\">Three member [sic] of the Board found that the use of only 608 W. Lexington Street one night a week was legally established prior to September 10, 1993 and should be allowed to continue with the condition that the use be restricted to one night a week and only in 608 W. Lexington Street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-7\">Two members of the Board voted to disapprove this appeal. They found that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the non-conforming use was established and that the use complies with the definition of an adult entertainment business under Section 1 \u2014 106(b) of the Zoning Code. Where the Board lacks the concurring vote of four members of the Board in favor of granting a permit, the Application must be disapproved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">Challenging that decision, on February 11, 2004, appellant filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, claiming that \u201cthe Zoning Board err[ed] in failing to make adequate findings of fact and conclusions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>law sufficient to allow meaningful judicial review of its decision[,]\u201d and that it \u201cerr[ed] in finding that petitioner did not establish a non-conforming use of adult entertainment[.]\u201d The circuit court disagreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Affirming the Board\u2019s decision, that court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-5\">I do find that the Zoning Board did, indeed, make a factual finding in this case. They found that there was not a lawful non-conforming use of the property on 606 or 608.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-6\">Now, the court has to, by law, determine whether or not this factual finding is supported by competent, material and substantial evidence in order to, for lack of a better term, affirm it. And the evidence in the entire case, in light of that and the entire record that has been submitted reasonable minds could have reached the same factual conclusions as were reached by the Zoning Board.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">Appellant contends that the failure of the Board\u2019s prevailing minority to issue findings of fact and conclusions of law, in support of their successful opposition to its request for a nonconforming use permit, constituted error. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">Initially, we note that, although this is an appeal from the judgment of the circuit court, affirming the Board\u2019s decision, it is the Board\u2019s decision we review. Consequently, it is the Board\u2019s findings or, in this case, lack of findings which is at issue, not the circuit court\u2019s. <em>Consumer Prot. Div. v. Luskin\u2019s, Inc., </em>120 Md.App. 1, 22, 706 A.2d 102 (1998), <em>rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>353 Md. 335, 726 A.2d 702 (1999). In reviewing the Board\u2019s decision, our role \u201cis precisely the same as that of the circuit court.\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene v. Shrieves, </em>100 Md.App. 283, 303-04, 641 A.2d 899 (1994). Like that court, we are \u201c\u2018limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bd. of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 67-68, 729 A.2d 376 (1999) (quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number><em>United Parcel v. People\u2019s Counsel, </em>336 Md. 569, 576, 650 A.2d 226 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">To make those determinations, we \u201c \u2018must be able to discern from the record the facts found, the law applied and the relationship between the two.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sweeney v. Montgomery County, </em>107 Md.App. 187, 197, 667 A.2d 922 (1995) (quoting <em>Forman v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>332 Md. 201, 221, 630 A.2d 753 (1993)). That requires the Board to \u201cresolve all significant conflicts in the evidence and then chronicle, in the record, full, complete and detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law.\u201d <em>State of Maryland Commission on Human Relations v. Malakoff, </em>273 Md. 214, 229, 329 A.2d 8 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">\u201c \u2018[Findings of fact must be meaningful,\u2019 \u201d the Court of Appeals has warned, \u201c\u2018and cannot simply repeat statutory criteria, broad conclusory statements, or boilerplate resolutions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mehrling v. Nationwide Ins. Co., </em>371 Md. 40, 64, 806 A.2d 662 (2002) (quoting <em>Bucktail, LLC v. County Council of Talbot County, </em>352 Md. 530, 553, 723 A.2d 440 (1999)). The absence of such findings, the Court of Appeals has declared, not only violates the \u201cfundamental right of a party to a proceeding before an administrative agency to be apprised of the facts relied upon by the agency in reaching its decision,\u201d <em>Harford County v. Earl E. Preston, Jr., Inc., </em>322 Md. 493, 505, 588 A.2d 772 (1991), but precludes meaningful judicial review of the agency\u2019s decision. That is why the absence of adequate findings of fact \u201cconstitutes an error of law and renders the Board\u2019s decision arbitrary and capricious.\u201d <em>Bd. of County Commissioners for St. Mary\u2019s County v. Southern Resources Management, Inc., </em>154 Md.App. 10, 36, 837 A.2d 1059 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">For those reasons, no principled legal distinction can be drawn between what is required of a prevailing majority in rendering its decision and that which is required of a prevailing minority in imposing its will. Otherwise, a decision, of which a majority of the Board disapproves, would in effect escape judicial scrutiny while, paradoxically, a decision, of which the entire Board approves, would not. That result of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>course undermines the whole point of judicial review. Therefore, we hold that, just as a prevailing majority must do, a prevailing minority must, after \u201cresolv[ing] all significant conflicts in the evidence,\u201d <em>Malakoff, </em>273 Md. at 229, 329 A.2d 8, issue findings of fact and conclusions of law. In the event there is a conflict between members of the prevailing minority as to the factual findings to be made or the legal conclusions to be drawn, that should not prevent them from stating all joint and individual findings of fact and conclusions of law, which support their common decision to deny an application for a nonconforming use.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">In this case, a majority of Board members, three out of five, \u201cfound that the use of only 608 W[est] Lexington Street one night a week was legally established prior to September 10,1993, and should be allowed to continue ...\u201d Two members disagreed, and because, under Article 66B \u00a7 2.08(1), a super-majority was required for approval,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> they prevailed. As to why two Board members disapproved appellant\u2019s application, the Board\u2019s decision merely states that they believed \u201cthat there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the nonconforming use was established and that the use complie[d] with the definition of an adult entertainment business under Section 1 \u2014 106(b) of the Zoning Code.\u201d No other findings of fact were made, despite conflicting evidence. What is more, the evidence, if viewed in a light most favorably to the appellant, did arguably provide a basis upon which to grant appellant\u2019s application. It suggested that appellant had, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>fact, established a nonconforming use on its premises, dating back to 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">A \u201cnonconforming use,\u201d under \u00a7 13-101, is defined as \u201cany lawfully existing use of a structure that does not conform to the applicable use regulations of the district in which it is located.\u201d Because under the zoning code, \u201c[a]ny adult entertainment business existing on September 10, 1993, is considered a nonconforming use ...,\u201d the facts at issue are: (1) whether appellant conducted an adult entertainment business; (2) whether that business lawfully existed on September 10, 1993; and (3) whether it has continued, without interruption, since that date.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In short, the question is whether appellant has continuously presented nude or partially nude entertainment since September 10, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Three witnesses testified that appellant has presented adult entertainment at Club Bunns, in the form of nude or partially nude live performances, since 1990. As previously introduced, they were: Renold Owens, the past manager and now, with his brother, Dana Owens, the current owners of the bar; Carl Scheffel, whose company, S.T.S., Inc., previously owed the bar and is presently appellant\u2019s landlord; and Wayne Jeffries, a current employee of the bar, who has worked there for the past fifteen years.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Owens testified that the bar began offering adult entertainment business in 1989, consisting of topless dancers wearing \u2022G-strings or \u201cbikini bottom[s] of some kind,\u201d but, on occasion, they were totally nude. Scheffel gave similar testimony. He asserted that the bar began offering adult entertainment no later than 1990. That entertainment, he stated, consisted of \u201crisque dancing,\u201d \u201csemi-naked dancing,\u201d \u201cbikinis,\u201d or \u201cstrip shows.\u201d Jeffries testified in a similar vein. He stated that, since 1990, the bar has offered adult entertainment in which the dancers would shed their clothes down to a bikini, some<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>times with \u201csomething hanging ... down,\u201d \u201cglued on their ... breasts,\u201d while their \u201cbottoms was [sic] covered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Moreover, bikini-clad dancers, appellant maintains, fall within the definition of \u201cadult entertainment.\u201d In support of this proposition, it points to the definition of partial nudity in \u00a7 1-106(a)(4), which states that \u201c[p]artial nudity means a state of dress in which opaque clothing covers no more than: (i) the human male or female genitals, pubic area, or buttocks; (ii) the female breasts below the top of the nipples; and (iii) portions of the body covered by supporting straps or devices.\u201d That definition, it asserts, encompasses the bikini, commonly worn by its dancers.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">In addition to the testimony of these three witnesses, appellant introduced a letter from the liquor board and two of the liquor board\u2019s index card records. The letter, dated April 20, 1990, approved \u201clive male or female revue type entertainment one night per week\u201d at 608 West Lexington Street, which, appellant claims, meant \u201cadult entertainment.\u201d Moreover, the index card record dated April 5, 1990, confirmed that such approval had been granted for 608, and the other index card record, dated November 25, 1991, indicated that the liquor license had been transferred from 608 to \u201c606-608\u201d West Lexington Street. In sum, if viewed in a light most favorable to appellant, the testimony and documentation presented by appellant suggest that, when \u00a7 l-106(a)(4) is construed as appellant proposes, adult entertainment, in the form of at least partial nudity, has been presented by appellant since at least 1990 and has continued uninterrupted to the date of appellant\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">In conflict with this evidence were the statements of Renold Owens\u2019s brother, Dana Owens, and appellant\u2019s attorney at the August 21, 2001 liquor board hearing, as well as appellant\u2019s 2001 use permit application. At that hearing, Dana Owens stated that the dancers at Club Bunns \u201care not showing any body parts, absolutely no personal body parts are shown at our shows,\u201d explaining \u201cthis [liquor] board has told us, make certain that there is no nudity in any of your shows.\u201d \u201cWe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>don\u2019t have it,\u201d he stressed. Also, at that hearing, appellant\u2019s counsel stated, \u201cthey [the dancers] have been doing live entertainment, never adult entertainment ... they [appellant] never had adult entertainment in their business.\u201d Moreover, appellant\u2019s 2001 permit application, requesting a change in the use for 606-608 from \u201ctavern\u201d to \u201ctavern including live entertainment and dancing,\u201d stated, in handwritten block letters, \u201cNO ADULT ENTERTAINMENT],\u201d though appellant claims that that language was added to the application by \u201czoning officials\u201d because \u201cthey knew at that point there had to be a hearing on the adult entertainment issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Yet, despite this evidence, the prevailing minority made no findings as to whom or what it believed, how it interpreted the records presented or the controlling statutes involved. In other words, we do not know whether the minority found the evidence of the establishment of a nonconforming use insufficient because of gaps in the supporting evidence or because it interpreted that evidence differently than the majority did or because it found that evidence either too ambiguous or too incredible to be worthy of belief. Nor do we even know what definition of adult entertainment the minority applied. Without this information, we have no way to ascertain whether the prevailing minority\u2019s decision is the product of error or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Because we are unable to determine, and unwilling to speculate, how the minority reached the result that it did, we must remand this case to the circuit court with the instruction that it, in turn, remand this matter to the Board to give the prevailing minority the opportunity to issue the appropriate findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">JUDGMENT VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO REMAND THE CASE TO THE BALTIMORE CITY BOARD OF MUNICIPAL AND ZONING APPEALS FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b66-12\">. The majority, however, imposed certain conditions on the Club\u2019s presentation of adult entertainment, specifically that it should be \u201crestricted to one night a week and only in 608 W.
