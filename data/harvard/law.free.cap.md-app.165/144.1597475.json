Appellant did prepay the loan, and, under the terms of her agreement, she was charged $9,531.97 for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Appellant filed suit in the Circuit Court for Frederick County, seeking a refund of the penalty and other relief. Upon appellee\u2019s motion,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the circuit court dismissed the complaint. Appellant noted an appeal and presents two questions for our review, which we have consolidated into one:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-7\">Did the circuit court err in concluding that the Note included a prepayment penalty and, therefore, dismissing appellant\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">We shall affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">The Note that appellant signed includes two provisions key to our discussion. First, in paragraph 11, \u201cAPPLICABLE <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>LAW,\u201d the Note states: \u201cThis Note shall be governed by the provisions of Subtitle 10 of Article 12 of the Commercial Law Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland, as amended from time to time, and by federal law.\u201d Second, as we have explained, the Note included an addendum in which the parties agreed upon a prepayment penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Next, there are, basically, just two legal provisions key to our discussion. First, prepayment penalties are prohibited by Md.Code (2005 RepLVoL), Com. Law II \u00a7 12-1009(e),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but that statute \u2014 as a statute \u2014 does not apply to appellee or this loan because it has been preempted by federal law. <em>See </em>12 C.F.R. \u00a7 560.2(b)(5). Second, the applicable federal regulation governing prepayment penalties states: \u201cSubject to the terms of the loan contract, a Federal savings association,\u201d such as appellee, \u201cmay impose a fee for any prepayment of a loan.\u201d 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 560.84.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Appellant argues that her cause of action is based in contract law, not the Commercial Law Article. She argues that the Note incorporated into the parties\u2019 agreement all of Title 12, subtitle 10 of the Commercial Law Article, including \u00a7 12-1009(e)\u2019s proscription of prepayment penalties, converting that proscription from a public law into a term of a private agreement; appellant concedes that \u00a7 12-1009(e), as a statute, is preempted by federal law. She argues that the reference to the Commercial Law Article rendered the parties\u2019 agreement ambiguous, because it incorporated \u00a7 12-1009(e) as a contract term, while the Note also contained a prepayment penalty. Due to this ambiguity, she asserts, the trial judge erred in dismissing her complaint, because a reasonable person could conclude that the parties had agreed that the loan would not include a prepayment penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Appellee offers several bases for affirmance. It presents two arguments under federal preemption principles: first, that the parties could not have incorporated \u00a7 12-1009(e) into their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>agreement, and second, that they did not incorporate that section. But most strenuously, appellee argues that there was no ambiguity in the parties\u2019 agreement: they plainly agreed to a prepayment penalty, notwithstanding the reference to the Commercial Law Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Under Maryland Rule 2 \u2014 322(b)(2), a defendant may seek a dismissal on the ground that the complaint fails \u201cto state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d Md. Rule 2-322(b)(2)(2005). When moving to dismiss, a defendant is asserting that, even if the allegations of the complaint are true, the plaintiff is not entitled to relief as a matter of law. <em>Hrehorovich, M.D. v. Harbor Hosp. Ctr. Inc., et al., </em>93 Md. App. 772, 784, 614 A.2d 1021 (1992). Thus, in considering a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, the circuit court examines only the sufficiency of the pleading. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe grant of a motion to dismiss is proper if the complaint does not disclose, on its face, a legally sufficient cause of action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 785, 614 A.2d 1021 (citation omitted). This Court, therefore, shall assume the truth of all well-pleaded, relevant facts as alleged in appellant\u2019s complaint and all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom. <em>Morris v. Osmose Wood Preserving et al., </em>340 Md. 519, 531, 667 A.2d 624 (1995) (citations omitted). Accordingly, because they were directly taken from appellant\u2019s complaint, we shall assume the truth of the facts set forth above. <em>Lubore v. RPM Assocs., Inc., </em>109 Md.App. 312, 322-23, 674 A.2d 547 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">LEGAL ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AlH\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">We quote appellant\u2019s assignment of error as set forth in her brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-9\">Appellee is a federal savings bank. As a federal savings bank, it\u2019s lending activities are subject to the Home Owners Loan Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1461 et seq., (\u201cHOLA\u201d) and its implementing regulations. Appellee convinced the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>court that it had the right to charge the Appellant a prepayment penalty because federal law allowed it to charge such a fee. Appellant does not dispute that federal law permits inclusion of a prepayment penalty provision in a loan contract. 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 560.84 provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\">Any prepayment on a real estate loan must be applied directly to reduce the principal balance on the loan unless the loan contract or the borrower specifies otherwise. <em>Subject to the terms of the loan contract, </em>a Federal savings association may impose a fee for any prepayment of a loan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">Where the parties part company is whether or not the parties\u2019 contract provided for a prepayment penalty because there are two conflicting provisions in the parties\u2019 contract. One provision allows a prepayment penalty. Another provision adopts Subtitle 10 of Maryland law, which prohibits prepayment penalties. 12-1009(a) and (e). \u201cIt is a basic principle of contract law that, in construing the language of a contract, ambiguities are resolved against the draftsman of the instrument.\u201d (Citation omitted.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-7\">From the foregoing premise, she concludes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-8\">Appellant contends the ambiguity arises from the two conflicting provisions in regard to prepayment penalties should be construed against the Appellee. Therefore, Appellee wrongfully collected a prepayment penalty from Appellant. Therefore, the trial court erred when it dismissed the Appellant\u2019s action to recover the prepayment penalty that she paid to the Appellee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">The parties, in their briefs, discuss extensively whether \u00a7 12-1009(e), as either a statute or a contract term, is preempted by federal law. As we see it, however, this case has little to do with preemption. This is a routine contract case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Appellant contends that the Note is ambiguous. Regarding contract construction, the Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AbE\">Maryland has long adhered to the objective law of contract interpretation and construction ... A court construing an agreement under this test must first determine from the language of the agreement itself what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have meant at the time it was effectuated. In addition, when the language of the contract is plain and unambiguous there is no room for construction, and a court must presume that the parties meant what they expressed. In these circumstances, the true test of what is meant is not what the parties to the contract intended it to mean, but what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have thought it meant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-5\"><em>Wells v. Chevy Chase Bank, FSB, </em>377 Md. 197, 224 n. 12, 832 A.2d 812 (2003). (Quoting <em>Taylor v. NationsBank, </em>365 Md. 166, 178-79, 776 A.2d 645 (2001)). (Citations omitted.) \u201cThe test for ambiguity is whether the terms are reasonably susceptible to two or more meanings.\u201d <em>Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Promenade Towers Mut. Hous. Corp., </em>84 Md.App. 702, 717, 581 A.2d 846 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The Note appellant signed stated, at paragraph 4, \u201cBORROWER\u2019S RIGHT TO PREPAY\u201d: \u201cI have the right to make payments of principal at any time before they are due. A payment of principal only is known as a \u2018prepayment.\u2019 When I make a prepayment, I will tell the Note Holder in writing that I am doing so.\u201d In the very next line, there appears the following instruction: \u201c * See Addendum to Note.\u201d The addendum, of course, was the separately-signed part of the Note in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>which appellant expressly agreed to the prepayment penalty she now contests.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Applying the general principles of contract law quoted above, and as a purely intuitive, common sense matter, we do not see how a reasonable person in the borrower\u2019s shoes could have thought she was not agreeing to a prepayment penalty. Appellant contends that the agreement was rendered ambiguous by the reference to (and incorporation of) Maryland law, which prohibits prepayment penalties, and the reference to federal law, which leaves the matter up to the contracting parties. We, however, do not see either reference as equivocating on appellant\u2019s express agreement to the prepayment penalty addendum. The Note is not, as we see it, ambiguous in the least: very simply, a reasonable person signing that Note, and separately signing its addendum, could not have believed that no prepayment penalty would be collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\"> Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>as appellant contends, that the contract requires interpretation, our conclusion is supported by oft-cited canons of interpretation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-7\">There is a well-established rule of contractual construction that where two provisions of a contract are seemingly in conflict, they must, if possible, be construed to effectuate the intention of the parties as collected from the whole instrument, the subject matter of the agreement, the circumstances surrounding its execution, and its purpose and design. And, if a reconciliation can be effected by a reasonable interpretation, such interpretation should be given to the apparently repugnant provisions, rather than nullify any.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-8\"><em>Chew v. DeVries, </em>240 Md. 216, 220-21, 213 A.2d 742 (1965) (citations omitted). Also, \u201c[wjhere two clauses or parts of a written agreement are apparently in conflict, and one is general in character and the other is specific, the specific stipulation will take precedence over the general, and control it.\u201d <em>Fed. Ins. Co. v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>275 Md. 460, 472, 341 A.2d 399 (1975) (citations omitted). Properly applying these principles to the Note\u2019s prepayment addendum and general incorporation of the Commercial Law Article, one could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>reasonably conclude that appellant did not, in fact, agree to the specifically-expressed and separately-signed prepayment penalty. We could certainly end our discussion here; however, we shall address appellant\u2019s invocation of the holding in <em>Wells </em>in support of her argument that \u00a7 12-1009(e) is not preempted by federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Before engaging in an analysis of <em>Wells, </em>we pause to examine the reach of federal preemption under the OTS regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">MARYLAND AND OTHER STATES\u2019 INTERPRETATION</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">As noted, supra, Section 12-1009(e) of the state\u2019s Commercial Law Article specifically states: \u201cIn connection with any prepayment of any loan by a consumer borrower, the credit grantor may not impose any prepayment charge.\u201d Credit grantor</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-9\">means any individual, corporation, business trust, estate, trust, partnership, association, two or more persons having a joint or common interest, or any other legal or commercial entity making a loan or other extension of credit under this subtitle which is incorporated, chartered, or licensed pursuant to State or federal law, the lending operations of which are subject to supervision, examination, and regulation by a State or federal agency or which is licensed under Title 12, Subtitle 4 of the Financial Institutions Article or is a retailer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">Md.Code (2005 Repl.Vol.), Com.

As Judge Kenney explained in <em>Chaires v.

Section 560.2 provides:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">12 C.F.R. \u00a7 560.2 Applicability of law.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-7\">(a) <em>Occupation of field. </em>Pursuant to sections 4(a) and 5(a) of the HOLA [Homeowners Loan Act], 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1463(a), 1464(a), <em>OTS is authorized to promulgate regulations that preempt state laws affecting the operations of federal savings associations </em>when deemed appropriate to facilitate the safe and sound operation of federal savings associations, to enable federal savings associations to conduct their operations in accordance with the best practices of thrift institutions in the United States, or to further other purposes of the HOLA.

If so, the analysis will end there; the law is preempted. If the law is not covered by paragraph (b), the next question is whether the law affects lending. If it does, then, in accordance with paragraph (a), the presumption arises that the law is preempted. This presumption can be reversed only if the law can clearly be shown to fit within the confines of paragraph (c). For these purposes, paragraph (c) is intended to be interpreted narrowly. Any doubt should be resolved in favor of preemption. (Emphasis added.) 61 Fed. Reg. 50951 at page 50966 (1996).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-5\"><em>Chaires v. Chevy Chase Bank, FSB, </em>131 Md.App. 64, 79-82, 748 A.2d 34 (2000). (Second emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Chief Judge Bell gave further explication on OTS and federal preemption in <em>Wells v. Chevy Chase Bank, FSB, </em>377 Md. 197, 832 A.2d 812 (2003) in stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-7\">The kinds of laws preempted are illustrated in section (b), including those purporting to impose requirements regarding the terms of credit and disclosure and advertising. <em>See </em>12 C.F.R \u00a7 560.2(b)(4) and 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 560.2(b)(9); Section (c) exempts from preemption those state laws that only incidentally affect lending operations or that are consistent with <em>section (a)\u2019 s purpose of \u201cgiv[ing] federal savings associations maximum flexibility to exercise their lending powers in accordance with a uniform federal scheme of regulation.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-8\"><em>Wells v. Chevy Chase Bank, FSB, </em>377 Md. 197, 214, 832 A.2d 812 (2003). (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">Given the facts of each case, the courts reached different conclusions regarding what areas were and were not preempted. In <em>Chaires, </em>we concluded federal law preempted appellants\u2019 claims that Chevy Chase imposed illegal loan fees in excess of state law under the Maryland Secondary Mortgage Loan-Credit Provisions Law. In so finding, we held that, despite appellants\u2019 assertion that Chevy Chase elected to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>governed by Maryland law in letters and loan documents, neither party could make such an election in light of 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 560.2. <em>Chaires, </em>181 Md.App. at 85, 748 A.2d 84. In addition, for federal preemption purposes, a federal bank\u2019s subsidiaries are treated \u201cas equivalent to the institution itself,\u201d emphasizing that if a loan originated with a subsidiary, the subsidiary is ruled by the same federal regulations that control the parent. <em>Id. </em>at 84, 748 A.2d 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">In <em>Wells, </em>the Court held appellants\u2019 cause of action was not preempted where 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 560.2 specifically exempted incidental matters of \u201ccontract and commercial law\u201d from preemption. <em>Wells, </em>377 Md. at 215-16, 832 A.2d 812. Chief Judge Bell identified the critical inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">Whether the appellants\u2019 claims are preempted and whether the appellees contracted to comply with Subtitle 9 are separate and different questions, requiring different analyses. The former is a defense requiring an analysis of federal law and the determination of the impact the relationship of the parties has on the ability of that law to fulfill its intended goal. The latter involves contract interpretation, discerning the parties\u2019 intent, either actual or presumed. Contract interpretation, unlike the question of federal preemption, is a matter of state law. <em>Volt Info. Sciences v. Bd. of Trustees, </em>489 U.S. 468, 474, 109 S.Ct. 1248, 1253, 103 L.Ed.2d 488, 497 (1989) (\u201cthe interpretation of private contracts is ordinarily a question of state law, which this Court does not sit to review\u201d). The appellants point out accurately:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-7\"><em>Federal preemption is a defense that argues that even if \u25a0plaintiffs\u2019 state law contract claims are correct </em>\u2014 i.e. <em>even if Chevy Chase had promised to follow \u201csubtitle 9 of the Maryland Commercial Code\u201d with respect to the notice it would give cardholders of amendments, and even if it broke that promise </em>\u2014 federal <em>law bars those claims. The contract interpretation issue, by contrast, raises the question of whether or not the language of the contract specifying Subtitle 9 requires Che/oy Chase to comply with the credit card amendment provisions of Subtitle 9. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number><em>Wells, </em>377 Md. at 224-25, 832 A.2d 812 (emphasis added and footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-5\">The document at issue in <em>Wells </em>was a credit card agreement between the parties that referenced a notice requirement to Subtitle Nine of the State Commercial Law Article in the event the credit card agreement was amended. <em>Id. </em>at 200, 832 A.2d 812. The Court held, though the parties agreed the lending activities were federally regulated, the reference in the Cardholder Agreement amounted to a contractual relationship between the parties which did not fall within federal preemption, as stated under 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 560.2(c). <em>Wells, </em>377 Md. at 231-32, 832 A.2d 812. In reversing the judgment and remanding for contract construction analysis, the Court distinguished and commented on our analysis in <em>Chaires </em>for \u201cpurporting to decide the issue on preemption grounds,\u201d but instead \u201cdeciding] on contract interpretation principles.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 225, 832 A.2d 812.

Looking to our neighboring states, in <em>Toolan v. Trevose Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n., </em>501 Pa. 477, 462 A.2d 224 (1983), the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held prepayment penalties associated with a residential mortgage was solely under the authority of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the predecessor to OTS, and regulations 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 545.8-5(b) and 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 555.15.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Toolan, </em>501 Pa. at 484, 462 A.2d at 227. As such, Pennsylvania law that prohibited prepayment penalties was preempted. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number><em>Toolan, </em>501 Pa. at 484, 462 A.2d at 227. Also, in the federal Fourth Circuit, examining Virginia law in <em>Nat\u2019l Home Equity Mortgage Ass\u2019n. v. Face, </em>239 F.3d 633 (4th Cir.2001), in relation to the Alternative Mortgage Transaction Parity Act of 1982, the court determined non-federally chartered housing creditors within the state of Virginia, could elect to have their Alternative Mortgage Transactions, or AMTs, governed by federal law. <em>Face, </em>239 F.3d at 635-36. In the event that these housing creditors opted to have their AMTs governed by federal law, federal law imposing prepayment penalties preempted Virginia statutes that restricted the imposition of such penalties. <em>Id. </em>at 639.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>Despite a different set of facts, the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland upheld federal law preemption in <em>Nat. City Bank of Indiana et al., v. Turnbaugh, </em>367 F.Supp.2d 805 (D.Md.2005). The District Court found that national banks and the bank subsidiaries, operate under the authority of the federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. <em>Turnbaugh, </em>367 F.Supp.2d at 812. Consequently, Maryland law that limits the terms on which mortgage lenders can impose prepayment penalties under \u00a7 12-105(b)(4) is preempted by federal laws calling for prepayment fees, even if a national bank subsidiary is headquartered in Maryland. <em>Id. </em>at 813-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">EXEMPTIONS FROM FEDERAL PREEMPTION</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">There are fact-specific cases in which the courts have found state law is exempted from federal law preemption. In the District Court for the District of Maryland, in <em>McKenzie v. Ocwen Federal Bank FSB, </em>306 F.Supp.2d 543 (D.Md.2004), the borrower filed a class action in state court challenging the national bank\u2019s imposition of fees and charges related to inspection. <em>McKenzie, </em>306 F.Supp.2d at 544. The court held the plaintiffs\u2019 action was to be remanded to state court because the federal Homeowner\u2019s Loan Act did not completely preempt plaintiffs\u2019 claim, insofar as the fees at issue were inspection fees, and not fees related to the loan, i.e. late charges, prepayment penalties, overlimit fees. <em>Id. </em>at 545-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">In <em>Livingston v. Vanguard F.S.B., </em>386 Pa.Super. 496, 563 A.2d 175 (1989), the Superior Court of Pennsylvania considered whether the Pennsylvania statute that prohibited prepayment fees on home loans would apply or be preempted if the document at issue was a mobile home installment contract. <em>Livingston, </em>386 Pa.Super. at 499, 563 A.2d at 176. The court held that loans referred to in federal regulations pertaining to home loans did not specifically include mobile home sales or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>lending. <em>Id., </em>386 Pa.Super. at 504, 563 A.2d at 179. Therefore, the court determined the Pennsylvania prepayment fee statute was not preempted by federal law when applied to an installment contract for a mobile home. <em>Id., </em>386 Pa.Super. at 505, 563 A.2d 175, 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Wells, supra, </em>is misplaced. In that case, Wells argued, as does appellant, that the parties\u2019 reference to Maryland law, in the choice-of-law clause of his credit card agreement, incorporated Maryland\u2019s statutory provisions into the agreement, and Wells subsequently brought a breach of contract action against the Bank. <em>Wells, </em>377 Md. at 199-200, 832 A.2d 812. In its defense, the Bank argued that the cause of action was preempted by federal law. <em>Id. </em>at 207-08, 832 A.2d 812. The Court of Appeals defined the issue as \u201cwhether the cause of action, or at least the basis for the claimed breach, is preempted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 215, 832 A.2d 812. The Court did not decide whether, by virtue of the reference to State law, the parties\u2019 agreement was rendered ambiguous, which is precisely the issue appellant has put before us. <em>Id. </em>at 231-32, 832 A.2d 812. Although the <em>Wells </em>Court declined to address that issue, we have no hesitation in agreeing with the circuit court that appellant unambiguously agreed to the prepayment penalty, rendering the preemption arguments of the parties inapplicable to the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">In conclusion, the short answer to appellant\u2019s argument that C.L. \u00a7 12-1009(e) is not preempted is contained in 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 560.34 which provides, <em>inter alia, \u201cSubject to the terms of the loan contract, </em>a Federal savings association may impose a fee for any prepayment of a loan.\u201d As we have concluded, <em>supra, </em>appellant agreed to an express term of the loan contract. Assuming, <em>airguendo, </em>that the facts of the case had required that we resolve a conflict between C.L. \u00a7 12-1009(e) and 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 560.34, we would be guided by the instructions of OTS when promulgating \u00a7 560.2, <em>i.e., </em>\u201c[t]he first step will be to determine whether the type of law in question is listed in paragraph (b). If so, the analysis will end there; the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>law is preempted.\u201d Listed as one of the \u201cIllustrative Examples\u201d under (b) of \u00a7 560.2 is \u201c(5) Loan related fees, including without limitation, initial charges, <em>prepayment penalties, </em>servicing fees, and overlimit fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Notably, under \u00a7 (c), captioned, \u201cState laws that are not preempted,\u201d the Regulation specifically provides that certain state laws are not preempted \u201cto the extent that they only incidentally affect the lending operations of Federal savings associates or are otherwise consistent with the purposes of paragraph (a) of this section.\u201d Included in this list are Contract and commercial law, Real property law, specific Homestead laws, Criminal law and other laws that OTS deems \u201cfurther a vital state interests and only have an incidental effect on lending operations or are not otherwise contrary to the purposes expressed in paragraph (a).\u201d Patently, prepayment penalties are expressly included in the list of state laws preempted by 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 560.2, but are not included in the list of state laws that are not exempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">The <em>Wells </em>Court, in an exhaustive review of prior decisions which have considered the applicability of federal preemption, recognized the distinction drawn by the OTS between state laws subject to preemption and those which are not preempted <footnotemark>8</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>From the foregoing, notwithstanding that the parties present the instant case as a question of federal preemption, it is properly resolved as a matter of contract law. Simply put, appellant agreed, at the inception of the loan transaction, to pay a prepayment penalty should she decide to pay off the loan within five years. Assuming appellant was not in a position to negotiate a mortgage that did not contain a provision for a prepayment penalty, her only recourse was to seek financing elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR FREDERICK COUNTY AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b168-11\">.

Moreover, the suggestion that federal law preempts appellant's cause of action- \u2014 as appellant now describes her cause of action \u2014 is feckless. According to appellant, she is pursuing a claim for breach of contract, arguing that appellee collected a prepayment penalty fee, when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Note stated that none would be collected. As quoted above, the pertinent federal regulation neither prescribes nor prohibits prepayment penalties; it leaves the matter to be decided by the parties and their contract. Taking appellant\u2019s cause of action as she frames it, then, as a breach of contract case, the action is not preempted, but is simply a state law action expressly envisioned by the federal regulatory scheme. <em>Am. Airlines, Inc. v. Wolens, </em>513 U.S. 219, 115 S.Ct. 817, 130 L.Ed.2d 715 (1995).

The term \"interest\u201d as used in 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1463(g) includes any payment compensating a creditor or prospective creditor for an extension of credit, making available of a line of credit, or any default or breach by a borrower of a condition upon which credit was extended. It includes, among other things, the following fees connected with credit extension or availability: numerical periodic rates, late fees, not sufficient funds (NSF) fees, overlimit fees, annual fees, cash advance fees, and membership fees. It does not ordinarily include appraisal fees, premiums and commissions attributable to insurance guaranteeing repayment of any extension of credit, finders\u2019 fees, fees for document preparation or notarization, or fees incurred to obtain credit reports. (b) Authority. A savings association located in a state may charge interest at the maximum rate permitted to any state-chartered or licensed lending institution by the law of that state. If state law permits different interest charges on specified classes of loans, a federal savings association making such loans is subject only to the provisions of state law relating to that class of loans that are material to the determination of the permitted interest.... Except as provided in this paragraph, the applicability of state law to Federal savings associations shall be determined in accordance with \u00a7\u00a7 560.2 of this part. State supervisors determine the degree to which state-chartered savings associations must comply with state laws other than those imposing restrictions on interest, as defined in paragraph (a) of this section.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b180-7\">.

Section 545.8-5(b) also authorizes a Federal association to include a provision in its loan contract with a borrower (who occupies or will occupy tire home securing the mortgage loan) imposing a prepayment penalty at any amount up to, but not exceeding, a specified limit. Thus, in view of the controlling Federal regulation, a Federal association may include a prepayment provision in the loan contract up to the maximum limitation of \u00a7 545.8-5(b) regardless of conflicting State law which sets a lower limit or imposes a different type of prepayment penalty, but it may not charge a prepayment penalty exceeding the limit in \u00a7 545.8-5(b) even if State law allows a higher charge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-9\"><em>Toolan v.
