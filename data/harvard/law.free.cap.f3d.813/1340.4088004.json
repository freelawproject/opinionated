On appeal, Doxie argues that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court improperly grouped his 66 counts under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2 to determine his total offense level. After review, we find no grouping error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Auo\">A. Offense Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-7\">Between 2007 and 2011, Defendant Dox-ie was employed by Ennis Paint as its Corporate Environmental Health and Safety Manager. During this time, Doxie defrauded Ennis Paint by creating and submitting fictitious invoices for environmental work ostensibly performed by a company called Outlook. Unbeknownst to Ennis Paint, Doxie was the owner and sole employee of Outlook, and Outlook had not performed the invoiced work. As a result of Doxie\u2019s actions, Ennis Paint mailed checks totaling $642,196.00 to the address on Outlook\u2019s false invoices, which were then deposited into Outlook\u2019s bank account.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-8\">In addition to the false invoices, Defendant Doxie charged payments to Outlook for work-related expenses totaling $287,466.33 using an employer-issued corporate credit card) even though Outlook had not actually performed any work. Doxie also used his corporate credit cards to pay for his personal expenses, which totaled $80,194.58.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-9\">Meanwhile, for the tax years 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011, Defendant Doxie did not report the income he received from defrauding Ennis Paint on his income tax returns. Consequently, Doxie underpaid his taxes by a total of $299,750.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-11\">In 2014, Doxie pled guilty to 21 counts of mail fraud for the false invoices (Counts 1 to 21), 41 counts of wire fraud for the false credit card charges (Counts 22 to 62), and 4 counts of filing a false tax return for the four tax years (Counts 63 to 66).</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-13\">B. Guidelines Calculations</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-14\">At sentencing, the district court, over Doxie\u2019s objection, grouped the 62 counts of mail fraud and wire fraud together in one group (Group 1) and grouped the 4 counts of filing a false tax return as a second group (Group 2) to determine Doxie\u2019s total offense level under Chapter 3 of the Sentencing Guidelines. In particular, for the fraud offenses in Group 1, the district court calculated a base offense level of 7, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(a)(l); added 16 levels because the loss amount exceeded $1,000,000, but was less than $2,500,000, pursuant to \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(I); and added two levels for abuse of a position of trust, pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.3, which resulted in an adjusted offense level of 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-15\">As to the tax offenses in Group 2, the district court calculated a base offense level of 18, pursuant to \u00a7 2Tl.l(a)(l), because there was a tax loss of more than $200,000, but less than $400,000, and added two levels because the source of the unreported income was from criminal activity, pursuant to \u00a7 2Tl.l(b)(l), for an adjusted offense level of 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-16\">Doxie argued the mail and wire fraud counts in Group 1 should be further grouped with the four tax counts in Group 2 under \u00a7 3D1.2 (c) or (d). The government argued that neither subsection (c) nor (d) of \u00a7 3D1.2 required Doxie\u2019s tax and fraud counts to be grouped together and that grouping was inappropriate here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1343\">*1343</page-number>because the tax and fraud counts involve different types of offense conduct and different societal interests, and thus are not \u201cclosely related.\u201d The district court agreed with the government and concluded that \u201cthe mail and wire fraud counts and the tax failure to report income counts are not grouped\u201d under \u00a7 3D1.2(c) or (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-5\">Then, using Group l\u2019s offense level of 25 because it was the higher offense level, the district court imposed a one-level multi-count increase pursuant to \u00a7 3D1.4, for an combined offense level of 26. The effect of the district court\u2019s grouping decision was to increase Doxie\u2019s offense level by one level and his advisory guidelines range from 46 to 57 months to 51 to 63 months.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1369-6\">After a two-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to \u00a7 3El.l(a), Doxie\u2019s total offense level was 24. With a criminal history category of I, Doxie\u2019s advisory guidelines range was 51 to 63 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-7\">After considering the parties\u2019 arguments, an extended allocution from Doxie, and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court imposed 53-month sentences on Counts 1 through 62 and 36-month sentences on Counts 63 through 66, all to run concurrently, followed by 3 years\u2019 supervised release. Doxie timely appealed his sentence. The only issue on appeal is whether the tax counts should have been grouped with the mail and wire fraud counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-11\">A. Grouping Counts Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-13\">Although the Sentencing Guidelines are now advisory after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court still must calculate the advisory guidelines range correctly.. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). A sentence based on a miscalculated advisory guidelines range is procedurally unreasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1369-14\">In Part D of Chapter 3, the Sentencing Guidelines provide rules for grouping multiple counts together. According to the Introductory Commentary, the underlying goals of Part D are \u201cto provide incremental punishment for significant additional criminal conduct,\u201d and \u201cto limit the significance of the formal charging decision and to prevent multiple punishment for substantially identical offense conduct.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. ch.3, pt. D, introductory cmt. To that end, when a defendant is convicted of multiple counts, the Sentencing Guidelines instruct the district court to group \u201cclosely related\u201d counts of conviction according to the rules in \u00a7 3D1.2 before determining each group\u2019s offense level and the combined offense level for all the counts. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.1; <em>see also United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1344\">*1344</page-number><em>v. Marseille, </em>377 F.3d 1249, 1254 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-4\">Under \u00a7 3D1.2 \u201ccounts are to be grouped together for purposes of calculating the appropriate guideline range whenever they involve \u2018substantially the same harm.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Register, </em>678 F.3d 1262, 1266 (11th Cir.2012) (quoting \u00a7 3D1.2). Section 3D1.2 further provides circumstances in which counts involve substantially the same harm, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1370-5\">(a) When counts involve the same victim and the same act or transaction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1370-6\">(b) When counts involve the same victim and two or more acts or transactions connected by a common criminal objective or constituting part of a common scheme or plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1370-7\">(c) When one of the counts embodies conduct that is treated as a specific offense characteristic in, or other adjustment to, the guideline applicable to another of the counts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIL\">(d) When the offense level is determined largely on the basis of the total amount of harm or loss, the quantity of a substance involved, or some other measure of aggregate harm, or if the offense behavior is ongoing or continuous in nature and the offense guideline is written to cover such behavior.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1370-10\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(a)-(d). \u201cCounts involving different victims (or societal harms in the case of \u2018victimless crimes\u2019) are grouped together only as provided in subsection (c) or (d).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2 cmt. background. Because the \u201cdecision as to whether to group [multiple counts] together may not always be clear cut,\u201d the Background Commentary to \u00a7 3D1.2 instructs courts to \u201clook to the underlying policy of this Part as stated in the Introductory Commentary\u201d when \u201cinterpreting this Part and resolving ambiguities.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1370-11\">On appeal, the parties agree that neither (a) nor (b) of \u00a7 3D1.2 applies because the victim of Doxie\u2019s fraud counts, Ennis Paint, is distinct from the victim of his tax counts, the Internal Revenue Service. Doxie argues, however, that the district court should have grouped his tax counts together with his mail and wire fraud counts under either \u00a7 3D1.2(c) or (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-13\">B. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(c) and (d)</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-14\">Section 3D1.2(c) calls for grouping counts where \u201cconduct that represents a separate count, e.g., bodily injury or obstruction of justice, is also a specific offense characteristic in or other adjustment to another count.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3D1.2 cmt. n.5. Subsection (c) is intended to prevent double counting of offense behavior, but it \u201capplies only if the offenses are closely related.\u201d <em>Id.; see also United States v. Jimenez-Cardenas, </em>684 F.3d 1237, 1239-40 (11th Cir.2012) (concluding that the defendant\u2019s illegal reentry and possession of a firearm counts harmed different societal interests and were not sufficiently closely related to warrant grouping under \u00a7 3D1.2(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-15\">Section 3D1.2(d) calls for grouping of \u201ccrimes where the guidelines are based primarily on quantity or contemplate continuing behavior,\u201d such as property crimes and drug offenses. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2 cmt. n.6. Subsection (d) contains a list of guidelines covering offenses that \u201care to be grouped\u201d and another list of guidelines covering offenses that are explicitly excluded. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3D1.2(d). Included in the first, \u201cto be grouped\u201d list are both \u00a7 2B1.1 and \u00a7 2T1.1, the guidelines applicable to wire and mail fraud and filing a false tax return, respectively. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1370-16\">It is well-settled in this Circuit, however, that \u201cthe \u2018mere listing\u2019 of ... offenses as types that \u2018are to be grouped does not automatically necessitate grouping [under subsection (d)].\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Keen, </em>676 F.3d 981, 998 (11th Cir.2012) (quoting in part <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1345\">*1345</page-number><em>McClendon, </em>195 F.3d 598, 601 (11th Cir.1999)); <em>see also United States v. Harper, </em>972 F.2d 321, 322 (11th Cir.1992). This is because the \u201cautomatic grouping of offenses listed in the first category can detract from the purpose of section 3D1.2\u2014 \u2018to combine offenses involving <em>closely related </em>counts.\u2019\u201d <em>McClendon, </em>195 F.3d at 601 (quoting in part <em>Harper, </em>972 F.2d at 322). Instead, where, as here, the counts involve \u201coffenses to which different offense guidelines apply,\u201d the counts \u201care grouped together under subsection (d) if the offenses are of the same general type and otherwise meet the criteria for grouping under this subsection.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2 cmt. n.6; <em>see also Register, </em>678 F.3d at 1267, <em>McClendon, </em>195 F.3d. at 601-02. Thus, for grouping under subsection (d), \u201cour cases have required that the offenses not only be similar in a general sense but also \u2018closely related\u2019 on the facts of the particular case.\u201d <em>Register, </em>678 F.3d at 1267.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-5\">C. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-6\">We conclude that the district court did not err in refusing to group Doxie\u2019s tax offense counts with his wire and mail fraud counts under either (c) or (d) of \u00a7 3D1.2. We note that the majority of circuits to address this issue have concluded that fraud counts and tax offense counts involving the proceeds of the fraud should not be group together under subsection (c) or (d) of \u00a7 3D1.2. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Vucko, </em>473 F.3d 773, 779-80 (7th Cir.2007) (addressing subsections (c) and (d)); <em>United States v. Martin, </em>363 F.3d 25, 43-44 (1st Cir.2004) (same); <em>United States v. Shevi, </em>345 F.3d 675, 681 (8th Cir.2003) (addressing only subsection (d)); <em>United States v. Peterson, </em>312 F.3d 1300, 1304 (10th Cir.2002) (addressing subsection (c)); <em>Weinberger v. United States, </em>268 F.3d 346, 354-55 (6th Cir.2001) (addressing subsections (c) and (d)); <em>United States v. Lindsay, </em>184 F.3d 1138, 1142-43 (10th Cir.1999) (addressing subsection (d)); <em>United States v. Vitale, </em>159 F.3d 810, 815 (3rd Cir.1998) (addressing subsection (c)); <em>United States v. Seligsohn, </em>981 F.2d 1418, 1425-26 (3d Cir.1992) (addressing subsection (d)). We agree with the majority of circuits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1371-10\">As to subsection (c), Doxie\u2019s mail and wire fraud counts in Group 1 governed his offense level because they produced the highest offense level. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.4 (explaining that the combined offense level is determined by taking the offense level for the group with the highest offense level and increasing it based on a table). Under \u00a7 2B1.1, the mail and wire fraud counts do not have a specific-offense-characteristic increase based on the tax offense conduct. That is, under \u00a7 2B1.1, Doxie\u2019s offense level was not increased because Doxie failed to report his income <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1346\">*1346</page-number>obtained from the mail and wire fraud. <em>See generally </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-4\">As Doxie points out, the guideline for tax offenses, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2T1.1, imposes a two-level specific-offense-charaeteristic increase if the unreported income is from criminal activity. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Tl.l(b)(l) &amp; cmt. n.4. But Doxie\u2019s offense level ultimately was not determined by \u00a7 2T1.1, but by \u00a7 2B1.1, so the specific offense characteristic increase in \u00a7 2T1.1(b)(1) did not increase his sentence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1372-5\">In any event, the specific offense characteristic in \u00a7 2T1.1(b)(1) does not address fraud conduct in particular nor adjust depending on the seriousness of the underlying criminal activity. Instead, the two-level increase applies regardless of the type of criminal activity that resulted in unreported income. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Tl.l(b)(l) &amp; cmt. n.4. The purpose of the two-level increase is not to account for the underlying criminal activity, but rather to adjust for the fact that \u201c[cjriminally derived income is generally difficult to establish,\u201d making the tax loss \u201ctend to be substantially understated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2T1.1 cmt. background. Thus, Doxie\u2019s fraud counts are not \u201cembodie[d]\u201d by the conduct treated as a specific offense characteristic in \u00a7 2Tl.l(b)(l), and grouping the tax and fraud counts separately does not result in double counting. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3D1.2(c) <em>&amp; </em>cmt. n.5.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1372-9\">As for subsection (d) of \u00a7 3D1.2, although both guidelines \u2014 \u00a7 2B1.1 and \u00a7 2T1.1 \u2014 are included in the \u201cto be grouped\u201d list, they are not \u201cof the same general type.\u201d The tax offenses are governed by the Internal Revenue Code in Title 26, rather than the criminal code in Part I of Title 18. Likewise, the offense level for the tax offenses are governed by a different part of the Sentencing Guidelines, Part T rather than Part B. <em>Cf. Register, </em>678 F.3d at 1267 (concluding the defendant\u2019s failure-to-pay-over and filing false returns counts were \u201cof the same general type\u201d in part because they were both governed by the Internal Revenue Code and Part T of the Sentencing Guidelines).</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-10\">Further, the loss for the tax offenses is determined differently under the Guidelines. Specifically, \u00a7 2T1.1 determines the base offense level based on tax losses, not on fraud losses. Also, to the extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1347\">*1347</page-number>\u00a7 2T1.1 accounts for fraud losses, it does so only as a two-level increase, so the fraud losses are not aggregated with the tax losses to set an offense level. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Tl.l(b)(l) (providing for a two-level increase \u201c[i]f the defendant failed to report or to correctly identify the source of income exceeding $10,000 in any year from criminal activity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-5\">Perhaps most important for both subsections (c) and (d) of \u00a7 3D1.2, Doxie\u2019s fraud and tax offenses are not \u201cclosely related\u201d on the facts of this case. Doxie\u2019s tax crimes involved not just different victims, but distinct offense behavior. The circumstances of Doxie\u2019s wire and. mail fraud \u2014 submitting false invoices and making fraudulent credit card charges at his work \u2014 are different in kind from his failure to report all of his income on his federal tax returns. Further, Doxie\u2019s fraud and tax crimes were not interrelated in a way that made them \u201cintegral cogs in continuing [a] scheme.\u201d <em>Cf. United States v. Mullens, </em>65 F.3d 1560, 1564 (11th Cir.1995) (explaining that the defendant\u2019s money laundering of the proceeds of the Ponzi scheme promoted the Ponzi scheme by \u201creturning false profits to some investors and paying expenses to maintain the fagade of success [which in turn] enabled [the defendant] to attract new investors and keep old investors from discovering his deceit\u201d). In fact, the only connection between Doxie\u2019s unreported income and his fraud was that \u201cthe money represented the proceeds of the fraud,\u201d which by itself is insufficient for grouping under \u00a7 3D1.2. <em>See McClendon, </em>195 F.3d at 602 (concluding that money laundering and fraud counts should not be grouped under \u00a7 3D1.2(d) merely because the laundered money was the proceeds of the fraud).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1373-8\">Finally, any ambiguity as to whether to group Doxie\u2019s fraud and tax counts together under \u00a7 3D1.2(c) or (d) is resolved by reference to the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 stated goals for grouping counts. Regardless of how Doxie\u2019s counts are grouped, his offense level ultimately is determined by his wire and mail fraud counts because they produce the highest adjusted offense level (25 as opposed to 20). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.3(a)-(b). Because the Group 1 adjusted offense level of 25 did not include a specific-offense-characteristic increase for Doxie\u2019s tax counts, there was no double counting of Doxie\u2019s tax offense behavior when the district court applied the one-level increase under \u00a7 3D1.4 to determine the combined offense level. By imposing \u00a7 3D1.4\u2019s one-level increase for the four tax counts, the resulting advisory guidelines range furthered the goal of providing \u201cincremental punishment for significant additional criminal conduct.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. ch. 3, pt. D, introductory cmt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-9\">Had the district court done as Doxie urged and placed all 66 counts into one group, there would have been no additional punishment for Doxie\u2019s tax crimes reflected in the advisory guidelines range. In short, the only way to achieve the stated goals of providing incremental punishment for additional crimes while preventing double counting for substantially the same conduct is to refuse to group the tax counts with the wire and mail fraud counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1348\">*1348</page-number>For these reasons, we conclude the district court did not err when it grouped Doxie\u2019s tax counts separately for purposes of calculating his offense level and advisory guidelines range. Accordingly, Doxie has not shown that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1374-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1369-8\">. To determine the combined offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.4, the district court takes the offense level for the group with the highest offense level and increases it based on a table. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D 1.4. In Doxie\u2019s case, to apply the table, the district court combined \"one Unit\u201d for Group 1 to \u201cone-half Unit\u201d for Group 2, for a total of <em>Vfi </em>Units. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D 1.4(a) and (b).

See, e.g., Vucko, </em>473 F.3d at 777; <em>Martin, </em>363 F.3d at 43 n. 31; <em>Peterson, </em>312 F.3d at 1303; <em>Weinberger, </em>268 F.3d at 354; <em>Vitale, </em>159 F.3d at 815.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-8\">The only circuit to conclude that fraud counts and tax offense counts should be grouped together under \u00a7 3D 1.2(d) is the Second Circuit. <em>See United States v. Fitzgerald, </em>232 F.3d 315, 318-21 (2d Cir.2000). Two circuits, the Sixth and the Seventh, have declined to follow <em>Fitzgerald. See Weinberger, </em>268 F.3d at 355 n. 2; <em>Vucko, </em>473 F.3d at 780. And, at least one Second Circuit judge has since suggested that <em>Fitzgerald </em>may be wrongly decided and has called on the Sentencing Commission to \"cut through this morass and tell us in plain English whether it wants tax offenses grouped with the offenses that produced the income on which the taxes were evaded.\u201d <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>291 F.3d 181, 197-98 (2d Cir.2002) (Newman, J, concurring).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1372-6\">. We note that the two-level increase under \u00a7 2T1.1(b)(1) from level 18 to level 20 did not affect the number of Units used to calculate Doxie's combined offense level under \u00a7 3D1.4. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.4(b) (counting as \"one-half Unit any Group that is 5 to 8 levels less serious than the Group with the highest offense level\u201d). Stated another way, if Dox-ie's tax offenses had not involved a failure to report income derived from criminal activity, his Group 2 offense level of 18 still would have resulted in one-half Unit under \u00a7 3D 1.4(b) and his combined offense level would have remained 26 under \u00a7 3D 1.4. This fact distinguishes Doxie\u2019s case from the defendant's in <em>Haltom. See Haltom, </em>113 F.3d at 46-47 &amp; n. 5 (concluding that the defendant\u2019s mail fraud \"counted twice toward his sentence\u201d because \"the enhanced tax evasion count was directly responsible for the ultimate 2-level increase\u201d under \u00a7 3D 1.4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"ALg\">. In 2001, the Sentencing Commission proposed an amendment to the official commentary to \u00a7 2T1.1 that would have called for grouping a tax evasion count with the count charging the offense that provided the income under \u00a7 3D 1.2(c), but that proposed amendment was never promulgated. <em>See </em>Notice of Proposed Amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines, 66 Fed. Reg. 7962, 8004 (Jan. 26, 2001). Notably, the Sentencing Commission has managed to promulgate a similar amendment indicating that money laundering counts are to be grouped with the counts for an underlying offense that generated the laundered funds under \u00a7 3D 1.2(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 634; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2S1.1 cmt. n.6. In light of this history, it appears \"the Sentencing Commission does not support a categorical rule requiring courts to group fraud and tax evasion counts.\u201d <em>Martin, </em>363 F.3d at 44 n. 32.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1373-6\">. Had the district court grouped all 66 counts together in one group under either U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D 1.2(c) or (d) as Doxie urged, the adjusted offense level would have remained 25 under \u00a7 3D1.3(a) or (b). The only difference is there would have been no multi-count enhancement under \u00a7 3D1.4. The total offense level after the acceptance-of-responsibility reduction would have been 23. With a total offense level of 23 and a criminal history category of I, Doxie\u2019s advisory guidelines range would have been 46 to 57 months, instead of the 51 to 63 months used by the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1374-13\">. Doxie's counseled brief states in passing that his sentence is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable, but offers no further argument as to substantive reasonableness. Thus, Doxie has abandoned any argument that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Woods, </em>684 F.3d 1045, 1064 n. 23 (11th Cir.2012) (explaining-that a defendant abandons an issue to which he merely makes a passing reference and fails to develop any argument).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
