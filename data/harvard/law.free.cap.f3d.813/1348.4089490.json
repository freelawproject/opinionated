Longo does not dispute that the Seminole Tribe of Florida owns and operates the Casino under the name \u201cSeminole Indian Casino-Immoka-lee.\u201d The district court dismissed his lawsuit because the Tribe is a federally recognized tribe entitled to sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-17\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint for sovereign immunity.\u201d <em>Contour Spa at the Hard Rock, Inc. v. Seminole Tribe of Fla., </em>692 F.3d 1200, 1203 (11th Cir.2012) (quotation marks omitted). Because federally recognized tribes have sovereign immunity, they generally cannot be sued. <em>Kiowa Tribe of Okla. v. Mfg. Techs., Inc., </em>523 U.S. 751, 754, 118 S.Ct. 1700, 1702, 140 L.Ed.2d 981 (1998).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1375-18\">A list published by the Bureau of Indian Affairs establishes that the Tribe is federally recognized. <em>See </em>Indian Entities Recognized and Eligible to Receive Services from the United, States Bureau of Indian Affairs, 80 Fed. Reg. 1942-02 (Jan. 14, 2015) (listing the Tribe as one that is \u201cfederally acknowledged\u201d and \u201crecognized\u201d by the Bureau).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Bureau promulgated that list under the Federally Recog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1350\">*1350</page-number>nized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994. Pub. L. No. 103-154, \u00a7\u00a7 102(3), 104(a), 108 Stat. 4791 (1994); <em>see also </em>25 U.S.C. \u00a7 479a-1(a). As the title of that act suggests, inclusion on the list means that a tribe is federally recognized. <em>See </em>25 C.F.R. \u00a7 83.1 (2015) (defining \u201c[flederally recognized Indian tribe\u201d as \u201can entity listed on the Department of the Interior\u2019s list under the Federally Recognized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994.... \u201d); <em>see also LaPier v. McCormick, </em>986 F.2d 303, 305 (9th Cir.1993) (\u201cAbsent evidence of its incompleteness, the [Bureau\u2019s] list appears to be the best source to identify federally acknowledged- Indian tribes.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-4\">We must follow the Bureau\u2019s determination about whether an Indian tribe is federally recognized. <em>See United States v. Holliday, </em>70 U.S. (3 Wall.) 407, 419, 18 L.Ed. 182 (1865) (stating that if the \u201cpolitical departments of the government\u201d recognize Indians as a tribe, \u201cthis [C]ourt must do the same\u201d). We therefore hold that the Tribe is a federally recognized Indian tribe entitled to sovereign immunity.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court did not err in dismissing Lon-go\u2019s lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1375-11\">. Congressional authorization or-tribal waiver of immunity may open the way for a lawsuit against a tribe, <em>Kiowa Tribe, </em>523 U.S. at 754, 118 S.Ct. at 1702, but neither occurred here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AJA\">. We take judicial notice of documents published in the Federal Register. <em>See </em>44 U.S.C. \u00a7 1507 (\"The contents of the Federal Register shall be judicially noticed....\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1376-7\">. The Tribe has also filed a motion for \"sanctions and double costs\u201d against Longo and his counsel under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927 on the grounds that Longo's appeal is frivolous. In the exercise of our discretion, that motion is DENIED solely because we have not previously decided in a published decision that the Tribe is federally recognized and entitled to sovereign immunity. This opinion holding that it is serves notice that future claims like this one against the Tribe are likely to be held frivolous.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
