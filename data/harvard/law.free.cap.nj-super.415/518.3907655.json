AHL Services, Inc., </em>396 <em>N.J.Super. </em>486, 508, 935 A.2d 769 (App.Div.2007), <em>certif. denied, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>419, 949 A.2d 847 (2008). In particular, we now decide whether <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:17C-10, commonly known as the 9-1-1 immunity statute, provides immunity to employees of defendant City of Newark\u2019s (City) 9-1-1 emergency communications center for the employees\u2019 bungled response to a call for emergency police assistance. Their negligent mishandling of the call, and failure to properly dispatch police, contributed to the murder of Sohayla Massachi by her former boyfriend. After an Essex County judge denied the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment by concluding that the 9-1-1 statute did not provide immunity, the case proceeded to trial, resulting in a jury award of $5,512,000 to plaintiff, the estate of Sohayla Massachi.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">We now hold that <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:17C-10 does not afford immunity to a 9-1-1 <em>emergency </em>communications <em>center </em>and to its employees for the negligent rendering of 9-1-1 services, including dispatching police to an incorrect location, failing to keep the caller on the line so she could update the 9-1-1 employee on the location of the perpetrator and failing to broadcast an alert to surrounding municipalities. We also reject the City\u2019s claim that the \u201cincreased risk/substantial factor\u201d jury charge was improper. We do, however, agree that the judge\u2019s omission of special jury interrogatories asking the jury to apportion damages had a clear capacity to produce an unjust result. In particular, not asking the jury to determine, in percentages, what portion of the ultimate injury (Massachi\u2019s death) was the result of her pre-existing condition as an abductee, and what portion of the ultimate injury was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>result of the City\u2019s negligent handling of the 9-1-1 call, created reversible error. We therefore reverse the May 22, 2008 order entering judgment in plaintiffs favor and remand for a new trial; however, as the error did not affect the quantum of damages, the retrial shall be limited to liability and proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Although the facts are set forth in considerable detail in our prior opinion, <em>id. </em>at 491-93, 935 A 2d 769, we now briefly recite the pertinent facts, as drawn from the trial record, to provide context for the legal issues we address today. On May 10, 2000, two high school girls saw Christopher Honrath force Massachi, who was screaming and crying for help, into his car. The girls reported the incident and the car\u2019s license plate number to an Argenbright Security (Argenbright) guard who was stationed at the guard booth at the main gate of Seton Hall University (Seton Hall). When the guard stated there was nothing he could do because the incident did not occur on University property, the girls telephoned the South Orange Police Department to report the abduction and provided the license plate number and a description of the car and its occupants.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">At approximately the same time, two off-duty Essex County Sheriffs Officers, Melissa Lester and Elwood Thompson, witnessed Honrath pull Massachi into his ear. Lester called 9-1-1, and the call was routed to the City\u2019s 9-1-1 emergency communications center. Lester provided a description of the incident, the car, and the car\u2019s direction of travel to 9-1-1 operator Debony Venable.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Although Venable was unsure how to handle the call, she consulted a co-worker instead of her supervisor, as was required by police department guidelines. Venable put the information into the 9-1-1 computer system, but failed to note the last known location of Honrath\u2019s car or that the car was in motion; misidentified the car as a Chevrolet Blazer instead of a Plymouth Laser; failed to record the vehicle\u2019s path of travel, which resulted in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>police unit being erroneously dispatched to the original location even though Honrath was already gone; and failed to keep Lester on the line so that Lester would be able to update the responding units on the vehicle\u2019s path of travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Dispatcher George Mike \u201cran\u201d the license plate and printed out the name and address of the vehicle\u2019s owner, Honrath. However, although Mike was required by police procedures to also issue a general alert to all Newark police units and to neighboring municipalities, he failed to do so. Mike also had the capacity to contact Westfield police, where Honrath lived, but did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">A short time later, Westfield police were notified by Gary Powell, who shared a Westfield house with Honrath, that Honrath had pulled a woman into his room and that she was screaming that Honrath had a gun. Westfield police responded to the house, knocked on Honrath\u2019s door, and yelled \u201cpolice.\u201d Two gunshots were then heard from inside Honrath\u2019s room. The officers did not enter the room, but instead waited thirty minutes for the arrival of an Emergency Response Team. The Response Team found Honrath dead and Massachi unconscious with a bullet wound to the head; Massachi was transported to a Newark hospital where she died two days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Disciplinary sanctions were imposed against Venable for her violation of police department policies and procedures in her handling of the 9-1-1 call.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">To place in context the 9-1-1 immunity issue, we first describe the procedural posture of the case at the time we issued our published opinion in 2007. On August 26, 2005, prior to commencement of trial, the judge had granted summary judgment to the City, finding that it was entitled to immunity under a portion of the Tort Claims Act, <em>N.J.S.A. 59:5-4. </em>Plaintiff appealed. We held that the Tort Claims Act did not provide immunity to Newark under these circumstances, reversed the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and remanded plaintiffs claim against Newark for trial. <em>Massachi supra, </em>396 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 507-08, 935 A.2d 769. We did not rule upon Newark\u2019s argument that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>entitled to immunity under the 9-1-1 statute, <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:170-10, as the issue had not been squarely addressed in the Law Division in light of the grant of summary judgment based upon the Tort Claims Act. <em>Id. </em>at 508, 935 A.2d 769. We preserved the issue for remand. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">On April 29, 2008, a few days before the trial was scheduled to commence, the City again moved for dismissal of plaintiffs complaint pursuant to the 9-1-1 immunity statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-10. The City argued that a plain reading of the statute afforded immunity to the City for Venable\u2019s and Mike\u2019s actions in delivering 9-1-1 services unless their actions were wanton, willful, or malicious, which plaintiff had not alleged. Plaintiff opposed the City\u2019s motion, arguing that the 9-1-1 statute provided immunity only for negligence in the mechanical delivery of services and not for Venable\u2019s and Mike\u2019s \u201crendering\u201d of services. The judge denied the City\u2019s motion on procedural grounds, but did find that the City had not provided the court with any precedent, from New Jersey or elsewhere, to support its argument that the City should be afforded immunity under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-10. The case proceeded to trial, resulting in the verdict we have already described.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">The City argues that the Law Division\u2019s denial of its motion for judgment under the 9-1-1 immunity statute was error, because, according to the City, both <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-10(d) and (e) provide immunity for the very type of negligent acts and omissions that Venable and Mike committed. In particular, the City maintains that subsection (d) provides immunity to a public safety answering point<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (PSAP) such as Newark\u2019s 9-1-1 emergency communications center for a wide array of design or mechanical failures at a PSAP and for \u201c <em>\u2018any other aspect of delivering enhanced 9-1-1 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number><em>service, </em>wireless 9-1-1 service or wireless enhanced 9-1-1 service.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:17C-10(d)) (emphasis added). The City relies heavily on the immunity from liability for errors in \u201cdelivering\u201d PSAP services. The City also relies on subsection (e), which immunizes a PSAP for errors committed while providing assistance to any law enforcement officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Plaintiff urges us to reject the City\u2019s subsection (d) argument, contending that the immunity conferred by that subsection is confined to a \u201ctechnical failure of a 9-1-1 call service\u201d such as the \u201cfailure of a 9-1-1 call to connect because of a service provider\u2019s faulty hardware.\u201d Plaintiff also maintains that the City\u2019s subsection (e) argument ascribes functions to a PSAP that it does not actually perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Because the parties\u2019 arguments rely heavily on the legislative history of the statute\u2014from its initial form in 1989 through the 1999 amendments that resulted in the current version\u2014we begin our analysis by turning first to the legislative history of <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:17C-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">\n<em>A The 1989 statute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">The 1989 statute was adopted as part of a comprehensive legislative enactment that created an Emergency Response System in the State of New Jersey. The entire package of bills was the culmination of the work of the Emergency Response System Study Commission (the Commission), which was established in January 1986, by <em>L. </em>1985, c. 542, \u201cto study and make recommendations concerning appropriate legislation to create a Statewide enhanced 9-1-1 emergency telephone system; and to study and make recommendations concerning the emergency response system in the State with a view to improving and facilitating the provisions of emergency service ... and ... remedying defects in the present system.\u201d After holding a series of public hearings, the Commission issued its report, <em>Emergency Response System Study Commission, First Phase Report </em>(Dec. 30, 1986) (Report), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>calling for the creation of an \u201cenhanced\u201d 9-1-1 system,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which had three components: 1) a series of technical recommendations designed to address the \u201coverlap\u201d and \u201cunderlap\u201d problems in the emergency 9-1-1 telephone service that had been in place since 1967; 2) development of a proposed funding source for the new switching equipment that would be required; and 3) recommendations for a package of proposed legislation to implement the enhanced 9-1-1 system.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Notably, although none of the witnesses at any of the three public hearings the Commission conducted in Blackwood, Trenton or Paterson had recommended, or even discussed, providing telephone companies or PSAPs with immunity from liability for negligently handled 9-1-1 calls, the 1986 Report contained a section recommending immunity for any acts or omissions committed while rendering PSAP services. In a section of its Report entitled \u201cLiability of the Telephone Companies and PSAPs,\u201d the Commission recommended:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-7\"><em>No liability would be incurred by any </em>telephone company or PSAP for the release of the information specified in the legislation, including non-published telephone numbers, or <em>for the failure of any equipment or procedure </em>in connection with the enhanced 9-1-1 service. <em>Furthermore, no liability would be incurred by any </em>telephone company or <em>PSAP for any act or omission of an act committed while </em>training for or <em>rendering PSAP services in good faith and in accordance with the legislation.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 21 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">In furtherance of its immunity recommendation, the Commission included proposed legislation immunizing PSAPs for \u201cany act or ... omission of an act committed ... in rendering PSAP services.\u201d The legislation proposed by the Commission was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>No telephone company, public safety answering point, or agents of a telephone company or PSAP, shall be liable to any person who uses the enhanced 9-1-1 service established under this act for release of the information specified in this section, including non-published telephone numbers, or for failure of any equipment or procedure in connection with the enhanced 9-1-1 service or for any act or the omission of an act committed while in the training for or in rendering PSAP services in good faith and in accordance with this act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-4\"><em>[Id. </em>at 31.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The package of bills introduced in the General Assembly and Senate in response to the Commission\u2019s Report contained an immunity section that was identical to the immunity legislation the Commission recommended in its 1986 Report; however, the Sponsor\u2019s Statement made no reference to the immunity provisions. <em>See </em>Sponsor\u2019s Statement, <em>Statement to A.B. No. 1576 </em>(pre-filed for 1988) . Instead, the Sponsor\u2019s Statement was confined to a description of the features of the enhanced 9-1-1 system and the ways in which the new system was superior to the system then in place. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">After introduction, A-1576 was considered by three legislative committees, the Assembly Transportation and Communications Committee, the Assembly Appropriations Committee and the Senate Committee on Revenue, Finance and Appropriations. The legislative history of the proceedings of those three committees includes no reference to the portion of the legislation establishing immunity from liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">When Governor Thomas H. Kean signed A-1576 into law on January 18, 1989, he commented that the legislation establishing the Statewide emergency 9-1-1 telephone system would \u201cgreatly enhance the State\u2019s emergency response capabilities\u201d by establishing a \u201cnetwork of \u2018Public Safety Answering Points\u2019 with specialized computers to receive 911 calls and locate their source. The call will the[n] be routed to the appropriate emergency response agency nearest to the location of the call.\u201d Press Release, Office of the Governor, <em>Press Release for A-135 and A-1576 </em>(Jan. 19, 1989) . The Governor\u2019s Press Release made no mention of the immunity section contained in the legislation. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>The legislation signed into law on January 18,1989 contained an immunity provision later codified as <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-10. The statute provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-6\">a. Whenever possible and practicable, telephone companies shall forward to jurisdictional public safety answering points via enhanced 9-1-1 network features, the telephone number and street address of any telephone used to place a 9-1-1 call. Subscriber information provided in accordance with this section shall be used only for the purpose of responding to emergency calls or for the investigation of false or intentionally misleading reports or incidents requiring emergency service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-7\">b. <em>No </em>telephone company, <em>public safety answering point, </em>agents of, or manufacturer supplying equipment to a telephone company or PSAP, <em>shall be liable to any person who uses the enhanced 9-1-1 service </em>established under this act for release of the information specified in this section, including non-published telephone numbers, or for failure of any equipment or procedure in connection with the enhanced 9-1-1 service or <em>for army act or the omission of any act committed </em>while in the training for or <em>in rendering PSAP services in good faith and in accordance with the act.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-8\"><em>[N.J.SA. </em>52:17C-10 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">As is clear from the version of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-10 that was enacted in 1989, the statute provided three distinct types of immunity: 1) immunity for the release of non-published telephone numbers; 2) immunity for failure of any equipment or procedure used in connection with the enhanced 9-1-1 service; and 3) immunity for any act or omission in rendering PSAP services in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">However, whether intentionally or unintentionally, the 1989 version of the statute conferred immunity from liability only to claims asserted by the \u201cperson who uses the enhanced 9-1-1 service.\u201d Thus, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-10, in its original form, would not have established any immunity from liability if the intended recipient of the 9-1-1 emergency service was not the person who placed the call. That is because the immunity was extended only to claims asserted by the person who actually \u201cuse[d] the enhanced 9-1-1 service established\u201d under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">Consequently, in a situation such as the one presented by this appeal, the immunity section of the statute that existed in 1989 would have provided no benefit to the City of Newark for the claims asserted by the estate of Sohayla Massachi, as it was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>Massachi who made the telephone call to the City\u2019s PSAP. As we have already noted, the person \u201cwho use[d] the enhanced 9-1-1 service\u201d was Melissa Lester, the person who witnessed Massachi\u2019s abduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">\n<em>B. The 1996 amendment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">In 1996, as required by 47 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 332(c), the Legislature amended <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-10 to provide immunity to commercial mobile communications providers similar to the immunity already afforded to telephone companies. The amendment made no revision to the language in subsection (a). The only revision to subsection (b) was the addition of the words \u201cperson providing commercial mobile radio service as defined in 47 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 332(d)\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> after the words \u201cNo telephone company.\u201d As is evident, the 1996 amendment was merely a technical revision to add mobile radio service providers. Thus, the 1996 amendment made no substantive change to the immunity provisions that were already in place.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">\n<em>C. The 1999 amendment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">The 1999 amendments revised five of the sixteen statutes that comprised the 1989 legislation. The statutory amendments added wireless telephone companies to the 9-1-1 network, <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:17C-l(p), -l(q), -l(r), -3, <em>-4; </em>established a permanent Enhanced 9-1-1 Commission and expanded its membership, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-2; and created the present version of <em>N.J.SA </em>52:17C-10. The Legislature\u2019s 1999 amendments to <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:17C-10 deleted subsection (b) and added subsections (c) through (e). The 1999 version of the 9-1-1 immunity statute, which remains operative, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-8\">a. Whenever possible and practicable, telephone companies shall forward to jurisdictional public safety answering points via enhanced 9-1-1 network features, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>the telephone number and street address of any telephone used to place a 9-1-1 call. Subscriber information provided in accordance with this section shall be used only for the purpose of responding to emergency calls or for the investigation of false or intentionally misleading reports of incidents requiring emergency service, b. (Deleted by amendment P.L.1999, c. 125).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-5\">e. No telephone company, person providing commercial mobile radio service as defined in 47 U.S.C.s. 332(d), public safety answering point, or manufacturer supplying equipment to a telephone company, wireless telephone company, or PSAP, or any employee, director, officer, or agent of any such entity, shall be liable for damages to any person who uses or attempts to use the enhanced 9-1-1 service, wireless 9-1-1 service or wireless enhanced 9-1-1 service established under this act for release of the information specified in this section, including non-published telephone numbers. This limitation of liability is inapplicable if such failure resulted from a malicious purpose or a wanton and willful disregard for the safety of persons or property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-6\">d. <em>No </em>telephone company, person providing commercial mobile radio service as defined in 47 U.S.C.s. 332(d), <em>public safety answering point, </em>or manufacturer supplying equipment to a telephone company, wireless telephone company, or PSAP, or any employee, director, officer, or agent of any such entity, <em>shall be liable to any person </em>for civil damages, or subject to criminal prosecution resulting from or caused by any act, failure or omission <em>in the development, design, installation, operation, maintenance, performance or provisioning of any hardware, software, or any other aspect of deliveri,ng enhanced 9-1-1 service, wireless 9-1-1 service or wireless enhanced 9-1-1 service. </em>This limitation of liability is inapplicable if such failure resulted from a malicious purpose or a wanton and willful disregard for the safety of persons or property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-7\">e. <em>No </em>telephone company, person providing commercial mobile radio service as defined in 47 U.S.C.S. 332(d), <em>public safety answering point, </em>or manufacturer supplying equipment to a telephone company, wireless telephone company, or PSAP, or any employee, director, officer, or agent of any such entity, <em>shall be liable to any person </em>for damages resulting from or in connection with such entity\u2019s <em>provision of any lawful assistance to any investigative or law enforcement officer of this State </em>or a political subdivision of this State, of the United States, or of any other state or a political subdivision of such state in connection with any lawful investigation by or other law enforcement activity of the law enforcement officer unless the entity, in providing such assistance, acted in a manner exhibiting wanton and willful disregard for the safety of persons or property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-8\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-10 (emphasis <em>added).]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">The Sponsors\u2019 Statement accompanying the 1999 legislation is significant. After commenting that the 1999 amendments were designed to reestablish the 1986 9-1-1 Commission as a permanent Commission, as required by the Federal Communications Commission, and add wireless telephone providers to the 9-1-1 network, the sponsors commented that the 1999 revisions to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>immunity provisions that had existed since 1989 had another objective, namely: \u201cexpand[ing] [the] limitation of liability.\u201d Sponsors\u2019 Statement, <em>Statement to S.B. No. 1495 </em>(Nov. 16, 1998). The Sponsors\u2019 Statement provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-4\">The bill makes additional changes in existing law in order to recognize the FCC requirement that E9-1-1 service be provided by wireless telephone companies. The bill requires each wireless telephone company providing service within the State to provide wireless enhanced 9-1-1 service pursuant to FCC wireless E9-1-1 requirements and includes wireless telephone companies and wireless enhanced 9-1-1 service in the original legislation. <em>The bill also provides for an expanded limitation of liability for telephone companies, wireless telephone companies and other entities in connection with enhanced 9-1-1 service or wireless enhanced 9-1-1 service and in connection with supplying assistance to investigative or law enforcement officers.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-5\">[.Ibid,]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">After its introduction, S-1495 was reviewed by three legislative committees, the Senate Law and Public Safety Committee, the Assembly Policy and Regulatory Oversight Committee and the Assembly Appropriations Committee. On the immunity issue, both of the Assembly Committee Statements made the same observation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-7\">Finally, the bill alters the existing limitation of liability language to include wireless enhanced 9-1-1 service, except in the event of wanton or willful disregard for the safety of persons or property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-8\">[Assembly Policy &amp; Regulatory Oversight Committee, <em>Statement to Senate, No. H95, </em>1-2 (March 18, 1999); Assembly Appropriations Committee, <em>Statement to Senate, No. U95, </em>1-2 (May 3,1999).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">The Senate Law and Public Safety Committee described the purpose of the 1999 amendment to the immunity provisions somewhat differently:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-10\">The committee also amended the bill by adding a definition of wireless 9-1-1 service, by <em>altering the limitation of liability language to include wireless 9-1-1 service, </em>in addition to enhanced 9-1-1 service and wireless enhanced 9-1-1 service, <em>and by providing that the limitation of liability would be inapplicable in the event of wanton or willful disregard for the safety of persons or property.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-11\">[Senate Law &amp; Public Safety Committee, <em>Statement to Senate, No. U95 with committee amendments, </em>2 (January 25,1999) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-12\">Although we will discuss the significance of the legislative history of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-10 in greater detail later in this opinion, several initial themes are clear: 1) the sponsors of the 1999 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>revision observed that expanding the immunity provisions of the statute was one of two principal purposes underlying the 1999 amendment, the other being the addition of wireless telephone service providers as one of the entities entitled to immunity; 2) the 1999 amendments deleted subsection (b), which was part of the 1989 version of the statute, and which had broadly conferred immunity for acts or omissions in the \u201crendering\u201d of the PSAP services; 3) the 1999 amendments replaced subsection (b) with a more detailed immunity provision describing the circumstances under which immunity would attach; 4) the immunity for PSAPs and providers was broadened in 1999 to include an immunity from criminal liability, rather than merely the civil liability that was included in the 1989 version of the statute; 5) the threshold for forfeiting the benefit of the immunity was changed from acts not committed in \u201cgood faith,\u201d in the 1989 version, to \u201cwanton and willful disregard for the safety of persons or property,\u201d in the 1999 version; and 6) the immunity was broadened in the 1999 amendments so that it now extends to \u201cany person\u201d filing a claim for damages, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-10(d) and (e), rather than merely those persons who seek damages after their own \u201cuse[ ]\u201d of the 9-1-1 system, which is how the immunity was described in the 1989 version of the statute. This last change now entitles a PSAP to assert immunity even if the person who is actually involved in the emergency and in need of the 9-1-1 service is not the same person who, in the 1989 parlance, \u201cuse[d]\u201d the 9-1-1 system by initiating the telephone call.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">The language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:170-10 demonstrates, and the parties do not dispute, that its obvious purpose is to afford immunity for various aspects of providing enhanced 9-1-1 services. Subsection (a) does not itself establish any immunity. Instead it sets the stage for the three subsections that follow by requiring telephone companies to release to PSAPs the telephone number and street address \u201cof any telephone used to place a 9-1-1 call.\u201d Subsection (a) limits the uses to which such subscriber information can be put: \u201cresponding to emergency calls\u201d or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>\u201cinvestigat[ing] ... false or intentionally misleading\u201d 9-1-1 calls. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-10(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">With the stage thus set, the statute proceeds to subsections (c), (d) and (e). In subsection (c), the Legislature has granted immunity to providers of telephone service<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and to PSAPs for the release of the caller\u2019s subscriber information, as described in subsection (a), unless such release of information was for a \u201cmalicious purpose\u201d or done in \u201cwillful disregard for the safety of persons or property.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:17C-10(c). Subsection (c) has no bearing on this appeal and requires no further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Subsection (d), in contrast, is the section upon which the City principally relies. Subsection (d) begins by granting immunity to telephone companies and to PSAPs and to their employees for liability caused by a wide array of technical and mechanical failures. In particular, subsection (d) grants criminal and civil immunity from the consequences of any \u201cact, failure or omission in the development, design, installation, operation, maintenance, performance or provisioning of any hardware [or] software____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-10(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">As is evident from the language it chose, the Legislature sought, at least in this portion of subsection (d), to confer immunity for what can broadly be described as equipment failures or defects in product design. None of the language we have just quoted from subsection (d) is remotely suggestive of a legislative intent to immunize a call taker such as Venable, or a dispatcher such as Mike, from the consequences of their mishandling of a 9-1-1 call. Stated differently, the language we have quoted would not immunize a PSAP from liability for the negligence of the PSAP employees in their response to, and the handling of, an incoming 9-1-1 call, which the City concedes.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>The City argues, however, that the next phrase, which immediately follows the language we have already quoted, does provide such immunity. The phrase upon which the City relies is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\">No ... PSAP ... shall be liable ... for ... <em>any other aspect of delivering enhanced 9-1-1 service, wireless 9-1-1 service or wireless enhanced 9-1-1 service.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-10(d) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">We must decide whether the <em>term \u201cany other </em>aspect of delivering enhanced 9-1-1 service\u201d means the actual handling of the 9-1-1 call, as the City argues, or whether, instead, it merely refers to other, but unnamed, forms of equipment failure similar to those that have already been listed in subsection (d), which is what plaintiff contends.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">The City argues that the term \u201cdelivering\u201d in subsection (d) immunizes a broad spectrum of negligent conduct and that the word\u2019s placement in proximity to language such as \u201cdesign,\u201d \u201cinstallation,\u201d \u201coperation,\u201d \u201cmaintenance\u201d and \u201cprovisioning of ... hardware\u201d\u2014all of which apply merely to the mechanical operation of a PSAP\u2014nonetheless immunizes a PSAP for the negligent \u201cdelivery,\u201d or rendering, of PSAP services.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">At appellate oral argument, we asked the City whether there was any significance to the Legislature\u2019s 1999 substitution of the phrase <em>\u201cdelivering ... </em>9-1-1 service\u201d for the phrase <em>\u201crendering </em>PSAP services,\u201d which appeared in both the 1989 and 1996 versions of the statute. In its post-argument brief,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the City answered in the negative, arguing that none of the versions of the 9-1-1 statute has ever made a distinction between the terms \u201cdelivering\u201d and \u201crendering\u201d of 911 services. The City argues that a review of the statute\u2019s legislative history does not support the contention that immunity is only applicable to individuals and entities responsible for the mechanics of 9-1-1 services, such as hardware, software or computerized release of information.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>The City also maintains that a PSAP employee is not responsible for the mechanical transmission of 9-1-1 information, as distinguished from employees of a telephone or mobile telephone company. Instead, PSAP employees decide which emergency entity should receive the information garnered from a 9-1-1 call. This decision-making duty, according to the City, is encompassed in the \u201cdelivery\u201d of the 9-1-1 services rendered by a PSAP employee. Thus, because the statute\u2019s legislative history does not show any material difference between the terms \u201crendering\u201d and \u201cdelivering,\u201d the City argues that we should \u201capply the plain meaning and logical interpretation of the term \u2018delivery\u2019 to find that N.J.S.A 52:17C-10(d) provides immunity to the City of Newark for the acts or omissions of its PSAP employees, Venable and Mike.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">The City also relies upon subsection (e), urging us to conclude that the subsection\u2019s provision of immunity for a PSAP\u2019s \u201clawful assistance to any investigative or law enforcement officer ... in connection with any [police] investigation\u201d immunizes the City for Venable\u2019s and Mike\u2019s activity. In particular, the City maintains that by dispatching a \u201cwalking unit,\u201d \u201crunning\u201d Honrath\u2019s license plate and \u201cproducing a print-out of the make, model and ownership of the vehicle,\u201d Mike rendered \u201clawful assistance,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-10(e), to police in their investigation of Massachi\u2019s abduction. The same is true, the City maintains, for Venable, who \u201cinputted the information for transmittal to the police,\u201d even though she did so incorrectly.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Plaintiff disagrees and argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">Essentially, subsections (d) and (e) address the technical failure of the 9-1-1 system at different points in time during the process of a 9-1-1 call. Subsection (d) relates to the first part of a 9-1-1 call where the information is being provided to the PSAP and subsection (e) addresses the next step in the 9-1-1 process, where the PSAP may be providing information to police departments or other entities, depending on the nature of the call.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">Plaintiff also maintains that if the immunity provisions of subsections (d) and (e) were meant to be applied to the negligent handling of the 9-1-1 call itself, then there would be no reason to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>include the following entities within those immunity provisions: \u201ctelephone company,\u201d \u201cperson providing commercial mobile radio services,\u201d \u201cmanufacturer supplying equipment to a telephone company,\u201d or \u201cwireless telephone company.\u201d According to plaintiff, \u201cthese entities are included collectively with PSAPs, as the immunity provided under these subsections relates solely to mechanical delivery of the 9-1-1 service, as opposed to the proper processing of the call itself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Plaintiff also argues that the legislative history does not support the expansive reading of subsections (d) and (e) that the City urges. Plaintiff maintains that the legislation must be construed in light of the purposes for which the 1986 Commission\u2019s proposed package of legislation was drafted, which the Commission\u2019s cover letter to Governor Kean described as: to \u201cprovide for a single, universal Statewide 9-1-1 emergency reporting system in New Jersey which will reduce response time to emergencies, thereby saving lives and property.\u201d <em>Report, supra, </em>at i. In the same vein, plaintiff points out that when Governor Kean signed <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-1 to -16 into law in 1989, his News Release described the benefits of the new 9-1-1 emergency system but made no mention of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-10\u2019s immunity provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Plaintiff notes that although subsection (b) of the 1989 version of <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:17C-10 provided expansive immunity for any \u201cact or ... omission ... while ... rendering PSAP services,\u201d that broad immunity was abrogated when the Legislature amended the statute in 1999 and deleted subsection (b). Plaintiff maintains that the 1999 amendments, which resulted in the current version of the statute, were not intended to provide \u201cblanket\u201d immunity. Plaintiff argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-8\">If the Legislature intended such a sweeping expansion of immunity for 9-1-1 operators, then it would have been prominently stated in the legislative history. It is also significant, to the extent that former subsection (b) arguably could have been interpreted as providing immunity in the processing of the 9-1-1 call itself, that subsection was deleted and replaced with subsections (d) and (e).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">Plaintiff also argues that the placement of this statute in an entirely different Title of the statutes than the Tort Claims Act, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number><em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:1-1 to 12-3, is significant. Plaintiff observes that the Tort Claims Act provides specific immunities in the area of police activities and other public entity action and it \u201cdoes not make any sense that subsection (e) of the subject statute buried in Title 52 would provide a greater immunity for police personnel, such as Ms. Venable and dispatcher George Mike, than that provided by Title 59.\u201d According to plaintiff, it is more likely that this immunity provision contained in <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:17C-10(e) was \u201cmeant to apply to similar factual scenarios contemplated by the Tort Claims Act immunity where the various entities would not be responsible for inadequate or faulty equipment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Last, plaintiff maintains that Venable and Mike were acting not only as a PSAP, but also as a \u201cpublic safety agency,\u201d <em>see N.J.S.A </em>52:17C-l(j), for which <em>N.J.S.A </em>52.-17C-10 affords no immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">\u201cOur task in statutory interpretation is to determine and effectuate the Legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>Bosland v.

In determining legislative intent, we remain mindful of the command of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>1:1-1, which requires us, when construing a statute, to give words and phrases \u201ctheir generally accepted meaning\u201d unless doing so is plainly \u201cinconsistent with the manifest intent of the legislature or unless another or different meaning is expressly indicated.\u201d Therefore, we must \u201c \u2018look first to the plain language of the statute, seeking further guidance only to the extent that the Legislature\u2019s intent cannot be derived from the words that it has chosen.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Petition for Referendum, on Trenton Ordinance 09-02, </em>201 <em>N.J. </em>349, 358-59, 990 A.2d 1109 (2010) (quoting <em>Bosland, supra, </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>at 553, 964 A.2d 741).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">As the Court observed in <em>Trenton Ordinance, </em>\u201c \u2018[a] court should not resort to extrinsic interpretative aids when the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, and susceptible to only one interpretation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 359, 990 A.2d 1109 (quoting <em>DiProspero v.

We view the statute as a whole, and do not analyze any one section in isolation. <em>Id. </em>at 359, 990 A.2d 1109.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">With these principles as a backdrop, we turn to the task of interpreting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-10(d) and (e) to determine whether either, or both, subsections immunize the City for Venable\u2019s and Mike\u2019s negligence in their handling of the 9-1-1 call that described Sohayla Massachi\u2019s abduction. In subsection (d), we must determine whether the word \u201cdelivering\u201d contained in the phrase \u201cany other aspect of delivering enhanced 9-1-1 service\u201d is \u201csusceptible to only one interpretation.\u201d <em>Trenton Ordinance, supra, </em>201 <em>N.J. </em>at 359, 990 A.2d 1109 (internal quotation omitted). Specifically, we must determine whether the term has a \u201cgenerally accepted meaning\u201d in the context in which it is used in the statute. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>1:1-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">The word \u201cdelivery\u201d can mean \u201cto send ... to an intended ... destination\u201d as well as \u201cto produce the promised, desired or expected results.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary </em>336 (1985). Thus, as applied to the statute under review, the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>\u201cdelivering\u201d could signify the mechanical transmission of the 9-1-1 call, if the first meaning, urged by plaintiff, is applied. However, if the second meaning, urged by the City is applied, \u201cdelivering\u201d would mean the qualitative manner in which the 9-1-1 calltaker chooses to respond to the call, i.e., the manner in which the 9-1-1 service is rendered by the 9-1-1 calltaker and dispatcher.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">However, we must not view the term \u201cdelivery\u201d in isolation. We must instead consider the entire phrase. The Legislature has conferred immunity for \u201cany other aspect of delivering enhanced 9-1-1 service, wireless 9-1-1 service or wireless enhanced 9-1-1 service.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:17C-10(d). It did not confer immunity for \u201cany other aspect of delivering\u201d PSAP services. We view this distinction as significant. See <em>Bd. of Educ. v. Bd. of School Estimate, </em>95 <em>N.J.Super. </em>284, 287, 230 A.2d 895 (App.Div.1967) (holding \u201cthe difference in the choice of words reflects the intention of the Legislature\u201d). The terms \u201cenhanced 9-1-1 service,\u201d \u201cwireless 9-1-1 service\u201d and \u201cwireless enhanced 9-1-1 service\u201d are all defined so as to apply <em>only </em>to the actual telephone components that constitute the 9-1-1 service and <em>not </em>to the calltakers\u2019 response to the call. <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:170-1 defines \u201cenhanced 9-1-1 service\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-6\">a service consisting of telephone network features and public service answering points provided for users of the public telephone system enabling the users to reach a public sendee answering point by dialing the digits \u201c9-1-1.\u201d The service directs 9-1-1 calls to appropriate public safety answering points by selective routing based on the location from which the call originated and provides for automatic number identification and automatic location identification features!.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AvJX\"><em>\\N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-l(g).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">\u201cWireless 9-1-1 service\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-8\">the service which enables wireless telephone company customers to dial the digits 9-1-1 and be connected to a public safety agency!.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-9\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-l(r).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">\u201cWireless enhanced 9-1-1 service\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-11\">the service required to be provided by a wireless telephone company pursuant to FCC wireless E9-1-1 requirements!.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-12\"><em>[NJ.SA </em>52:17C-l(s).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>The City maintains that none of these functions, selective routing, automatic telephone number identification or automatic location identification, are performed by a PSAP. Therefore, according to the City, the Legislature\u2019s decision to include PSAPs in the list of entities entitled to immunity in subsection (d) would make no sense unless the words \u201cor any other aspect of delivering enhanced 9-1-1 service\u201d were to be construed as affording immunity for the bungled response to a 9-1-1 call. The premise of the City\u2019s argument is flawed because, contrary to the City\u2019s contention, PSAPs do have responsibility for operating and maintaining the actual telephone network. That obligation is imposed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-8(c), which specifically requires \u201c[e]ach entity operating a public safety answering point\u201d to \u201cbe responsible for operating!] and maintaining\u201d the actual 9-1-1 equipment. The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-5\">Each entity operating a public safety answering point shall be responsible for obtaining, operating, and maintaining enhanced 9-1-1 termination equipment. The operations and maintenance of this equipment shall be in accordance with standards set forth by the office <footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>pursuant to section 3 of this act[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-6\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-8(c)J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">Thus, PSAPs play a central role in the mechanical delivery of PSAP services. For that reason, we squarely reject the City\u2019s claims that: \u201c[a] PSAP, unlike a telephone company, does <em>not </em>provide the mechanism for delivery of 911 services\u201d; \u201ca PSAP employee is not responsible for the mechanical transmission of 9-1-1 information, as distinguished from employees of a telephone or mobile company\u201d; and \u201c[i]nstead, PSAP employees [merely] decide what emergency entity should receive the information garnered from a 911 call.\u201d As is evident from the language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-8, the City\u2019s PSAP does far more than merely route the call. The City\u2019s PSAP also \u201coperates] and maintain[s]\u201d the very 9-1-1 equipment that the PSAP uses in receiving and handling the 9-1-1 call.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>No doubt, it was because PSAPs are involved in operating and maintaining the telephone equipment that the Legislature included PSAPs in its listing of parties who are granted immunity in subsection (d) for equipment and maintenance failures. Subsection (d) begins by designating the parties entitled to such immunity and lists them as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-4\">telephone company, person providing commercial mobile radio service as defined in 47 U.S.C.s 332(d), <em>public safety answering point, </em>or manufacturers supplying equipment to a telephone company, wireless telephone company, or PSAP, or any employee, director, officer or agent of any such entity____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-6\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>52:17C-10(d) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">After this listing of parties entitled to immunity, subsection (d) proceeds to a description of the scope of that immunity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWX\">damages ... caused by any act, failure or omission in the development, design, installation, operation, maintenance, performance or provisioning of any hardware, software, or any other aspect of delivering enhanced 9-1-1 service, wireless 9-1-1 service or wireless enhanced 9-1-1 service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-8\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>52:17C-10(d)J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">Thus, when we consider the fact that, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>52.Y7C-8, PSAPs play as much of a role in the mechanical \u201cdelivering\u201d of 9-1-1 services as do the other entities that are listed in subsection (d), it stands to reason that the phrase \u201cor any other aspect of delivering enhanced 9-1-1 service\u201d in subsection (d) would apply with equal force to PSAPs and to the telephone companies and manufacturers that are listed along with PSAPs in that subsection. It also stands to reason that the Legislature would not have ascribed a different meaning to the term \u201cdelivering\u201d when applied to telephone companies and manufacturers, than it applied to PSAPs.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">In particular, telephone companies and manufacturers \u201cdeliver\u201d the 9-1-1 services enumerated in subsection (d) because, in the words of subsection (d), they \u201cdesign, install[], operat[e], [and] maint[ain]\u201d 9-1-1 services. It is those tasks for which they are granted immunity by <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:17C-10(d). But, PSAPs likewise design, install, operate and maintain the telephone equipment, as required by <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:17C-8. Thus, the phrase \u201cor any other aspect of delivering enhanced 9-1-1 service\u201d in subsection (d) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>likely has the same meaning for PSAPs as it does for the other entities listed there. We will not ascribe to the Legislature\u2014 especially in the absence of any legislative history so stating\u2014an intention to have created such a radical shifting of meanings in a single portion of one subsection.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Were we to accept the City\u2019s argument, we would be forced to conclude that the Legislature intended the term \u201cdelivering\u201d in subsection (d) to refer to <em>mechanical delivery </em>of services when the term \u201cdelivering\u201d is applied to telephone companies and manufacturers, but intended the term \u201cdelivering\u201d to mean the actual response to the call when applied to PSAPs. We will not accept such a tortured interpretation of the statute. <em>See State v. Serrone, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>23, 29-30, 468 A.2d 1050 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Moreover, were we to accept the City\u2019s argument that \u201cdelivery\u201d in subsection (d) means only the handling of the call and the dispatching of the needed emergency service\u2014which are functions that are not performed by telephone companies and manufacturers and are only performed by <em>PSAPs\u2014we </em>would be forced to conclude that the phrase \u201cor any other aspect of delivering enhanced 9-1-1 service\u201d only applies to PSAPs even though nothing in the language of subsection (d) remotely suggests an intention to afford different immunities to PSAPs than to the other entities listed there.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">For all of these reasons, we conclude that the phrase \u201cor any other aspect of delivering enhanced 9-1-1 service, wireless 9-1-1 service or wireless enhanced 9-1-1 service\u201d in subsection (d) refers to any other aspect of the very same functions that are described in the phrases that immediately precede it: \u201cthe development, design, installation, operation, maintenance, performance or provisions of any hardware, software.... \u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:17C-10(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">Such a construction of subsection (d) is also consistent with one of the leading canons of statutory construction, <em>ejusdem generis, </em>which specifies that \u201c \u2018where general words follow specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>words in a statutory enumeration, the general words are construed to embrace <em>only objects similar in nature </em>to those objects enumerated by the preceding specific words.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gallenthin Realty Dev., Inc. v. Borough of Paulsboro, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>344, 367, 924 A.2d 447 (2007) (quoting 2A Norman J. Singer, <em>Sutherland Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 47:17 (6th ed. 2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Applying the <em>ejusdem generis </em>canon leads to the conclusion that the phrase \u201cor any other aspect of delivering enhanced 9-1-1 service\u201d in subsection (d) should be interpreted in like fashion as the words that immediately precede it, which are \u201cdevelopment, design, installation, operation, maintenance, performance or provisioning of any hardware[ ] [or] software,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-10(d). All of these words pertain to the mechanical or logistical aspects of delivering 9-1-1 service, and not to the handling of the 9-1-1 call and the dispatching of emergency police, fire or ambulance services.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Thus, under the <em>ejusdem generis </em>canon, the term \u201cdelivery\u201d could only refer to immunity from liability for any mechanical failures in the delivery of a 9-1-1 call, and not to negligence in the actual rendering of the 9-1-1 emergency dispatch service. However, we do not apply a canon of statutory interpretation in a vacuum because our \u201c \u2018primary task ... is to effectuate the legislative intent in light of the language used and the objects sought to be achieved.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bosland, supra, </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>at 554, 964 A.2d 741 (quoting <em>Hoffman, supra, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at 578, 695 A.2d 236) (alteration in original). Therefore, before reaching any final conclusions on the interpretation of subsection (d), we turn to an analysis of the \u201c \u2018objects sought to be achieved,\u2019 \u201d <em>ibid., </em>by the 1999 amendments to <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:170-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">The principal method of ascertaining legislative intent, when the language of the statute is ambiguous, is by analyzing the legislative history. <em>Id. </em>at 553, 964 A.2d 741 As we have already observed, the sponsors, as well as the three Committees that considered the amendments to the immunity legislation, all commented that the 1999 amendment was designed to expand the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>immunity provision. Indeed, the 1999 amendments accomplish the very objectives that the sponsors and the two Committee statements describe\u2014expanding the immunity provisions. The 1999 amendments expanded the immunity provisions in six critical respects. In particular, subsections (d) and (e) of the 1999 amendments: 1) added immunity from criminal liability to supplement the civil liability that was established in 1989; 2) narrowed the conduct that would cause a forfeiture of statutory immunity, by changing lack of \u201cgood faith\u201d in the 1989 version to \u201cact[ing] in a manner exhibiting wanton and willful disregard for the safety of persons or property\u201d in the 1999 amendments; and 3) extended the persons against whom PSAPs, manufacturers and telephone companies can assert the immunity by changing \u201cany person who uses the enhanced 9-1-1 service\u201d in the 1989 version to \u201cany person\u201d in the 1999 amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The 1999 amendments also 4) broadened the type of conduct for which PSAPs and other entities could claim immunity, by changing \u201cfailure of any equipment or procedure\u201d and \u201cact or omission committed while in the training for or in rendering PSAP services\u201d in the 1989 version to \u201cany act, failure or omission in the development, design, installation, operation, maintenance, performance or provisioning of any hardware, software, or any other aspect of delivering enhanced 9-1-1 service, wireless 9-1-1 service or wireless enhanced service\u201d in the 1999 amendments; 5) added the delivery of wireless 9-1-1 services to the types of telephone service for which the immunity applied; and 6) added an entirely new subsection, namely subsection (e), which extends immunity for damages resulting from an \u201centity\u2019s provision of any lawful assistance to any investigative or law enforcement officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">As is evident from the six factors we have identified, the 1999 amendments to <em>N.J.SA </em>52:17C-10 effectuated a wide-ranging expansion of the immunity conferred by <em>N.J.S.A, </em>52:170-10. We therefore do not agree with the City\u2019s argument that interpreting the phrase \u201cor any other aspect of delivering enhanced 9-1-1 service\u201d as meaning only the mechanical delivery of services would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>narrow the immunity that was contained in the 1989 version of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Moreover, if we broaden our inquiry to consider the purposes of the adoption of the 9-1-1 legislation in 1989, our conclusion that the City\u2019s arguments misconstrue subsection (d) becomes even stronger. The Legislature\u2019s objective in enacting the entire package of bills in 1989 was to improve the provision of emergency response service in the State by ehminating the defects in the emergency response system that had existed since 1967. <em>Report, supra, </em>at 4r-7. That objective was accomplished by adding the enhanced 9-1-1 features we have already described. <em>See supra, </em>note 3. The Legislature\u2019s goal of providing enhanced emergency response capability to the citizens of this State would not have been advanced by a statute that immunized municipalities from liability for the mishandling, or the bungling, of an emergency call.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">To the contrary, the purposes the Legislature sought to achieve when it enacted the package of enhanced 9-1-1 service legislation in 1989 would indeed have been undermined by an interpretation of subsection (d) that would immunize PSAPs for their negligent response to 9-1-1 calls. Therefore, we conclude that the \u201c \u2018objects sought to be achieved\u2019\u201d by the legislation, <em>Bosland, supra, </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>at 554, 964 A.2d 741 (quoting <em>Hoffman, supra, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at 564, 695 A.2d 236), support the conclusion that the immunity conferred by subsection (d) for \u201cany other aspect of delivering enhanced 9-1-1 service,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-10(d), is limited to acts or omissions in the mechanical delivery of the call, such as wiring problems, software defects, dropped calls, power outages, switching problems and similar maintenance or operational problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">The City argues that such a construction of subsection (d) would result in a narrowing of the immunity afforded by the 1989 version of the statute, which conferred immunity for \u201cfailure of any equipment or procedure in connection with the enhanced 9-1-1 service\u201d and\u2014more importantly\u2014\u201cfor an act or omission of an act committed <em>... in rendering PSAP services </em>in good faith and in accordance with the act.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-10(b) (repealed by <em>L. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>1999, c. 125.) (emphasis added). The City argues that: the term \u201crendering\u201d included the mechanical delivery of 9-1-1 service <em>and </em>the actual handling of the call and dispatch of emergency services; and that nothing in the legislative history of the 1999 amendments evinces a legislative intent to narrow the broad immunity conferred by the 1989 statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">We agree that the term \u201cany act committed ... in rendering PSAP services\u201d in the repealed subsection (b) of the 1989 statute might theoretically be susceptible of a broader interpretation than \u201cor any other aspect of delivering enhanced 9-1-1 service, wireless 9-1-1 service or wireless 9-1-1 enhanced service,\u201d as subsection (d) now provides. But that is only true if the \u201crendering\u201d language of the 1989 statute is viewed in isolation. If, however, the \u201crendering\u201d language in the 1989 statute is read in conjunction with the balance of subsection (b) of the 1989 version of the statute, and compared to the entirety of the 1999 amendments to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:170-10, it is clear that interpreting subsection (d) in the fashion we have discussed would not narrow the immunity conferred by the statute. We now compare the 1989 and the 1999 versions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:170-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Subsection (b) of the 1989 statute began by immunizing telephone companies, PSAPs and manufacturers for damages caused by the release of information such as non-published telephone numbers. That immunity was carried forward into what is now subsection (c), which affords immunity for the \u201crelease of the information specified in this section, including non-published telephone numbers.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-10(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">The next portion of the former subsection (b) extended immunity \u201cfor failure of any equipment or procedure in connection with the enhanced 9-1-1 service.\u201d That section is the source for the present subsection (d), which likewise affords immunity for negligence in connection with the failure of any equipment or procedure, because it affords immunity in connection with the \u201cdevelopment, design, installation, operation, maintenance, performance or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>provisioning of any hardware, software or any other aspect of delivering enhanced 9-1-1 service____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-10(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">The remaining portion of the former subsection (b)\u2014\u201cin rendering PSAP services in good faith\u201d is the source for the present subsection (e), which affords immunity for assistance provided to law enforcement. While the \u201crendering PSAP services\u201d of the 1989 version is not entirely congruent with the present subsection (e), we would not expect it to be so, or there would have been no need to amend the statute in 1999. Our side-by-side comparison of the 1989 and 1999 versions satisfies us that the \u201crendering PSAP services\u201d language in the 1989 version of subsection (d) has not been narrowed or restricted by the 1999 amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">There is a final reason why we conclude that the immunity conferred by <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:17C-10(d) is limited to negligence in the mechanical aspects of delivering 9-1-1 service. The interpretation urged by the City\u2014that the immunity conferred by subsection (d) broadly extends to a ealltaker\u2019s negligent inputting of data and the dispatcher\u2019s error in the dispatch of police responders\u2014would, if accepted, result in an enormous abridgement of the common law right to seek redress for injury caused by the negligence of others. When two interpretations of a statute are possible, the one that has the lesser impact on the common law right to seek redress through the courts is the interpretation we should generally adopt because \u201c \u2018a statute in derogation of the common law\u2019 \u201d must be \u201c \u2018strictly construed,\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Estate of Cosman, </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>664, 671, 475 A.2d 659 (App.Div.1984) (quoting <em>Dacunzo n Edgye, </em>19 <em>N.J. </em>443, 451, 117 A.2d 508 (1955)), unless the Legislature plainly intended a broader scope. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">For all of these reasons, we hold that the immunity <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:17C-10(d) affords PSAPs and their employees is limited to negligence in the mechanical delivery of 9-1-1 services, such as errors or omissions in the operation, maintenance, design or performance of the 9-1-1 telephone equipment. The immunity afforded by subsection (d) does not extend to the conduct at issue here, namely, the bungled response to an incoming 9-1-1 call.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>We turn next to the interpretation of subsection (e). The text of subsection (e) provides immunity to PSAPs for negligence in the \u201cprovision of any lawful assistance to any investigative or law enforcement officer ... in connection with any lawful investigation ... or other law enforcement activity____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-10(e). Such \u201cassistance\u201d could include responding to a police request that additional police units be dispatched, that an ambulance be sent to the scene, that a warrant check be performed or that a license plate be \u201crun\u201d to determine to whom a car is registered. Subsection (e) is obviously intended to immunize PSAPs for any negligence in rendering such assistance to police once police have commenced an investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">Such an interpretation of subsection (e) is congruent with the Sponsors\u2019 Statement that the 1999 amendments \u201cprovide[d] for an expanded limitation of liability for telephone companies ... and other entities ... in connection with supplying assistance to ... law enforcement officers.\u201d Sponsors\u2019 Statement, <em>Statement to S.B. No. 11/.95 </em>(Nov. 16, 1998). Prior to the 1999 amendments, immunity was provided only in connection with liability for release of unpublished telephone numbers, equipment failures and the \u201crendering\u201d of PSAP services. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-10(b) (repealed by <em>L. </em>1999, c. 125). The 1989 version of the statute would not have included immunity for any negligence in assisting law enforcement in any investigation. Thus, the 1999 amendment to the statute, which added subsection (e), represents an \u201cexpanding\u201d of the immunity provisions of the statute, exactly as the sponsors commented. We therefore conclude that in the absence of the \u201cwanton\u201d behavior that leads to a forfeiture of immunity, subsection (e) immunizes a PSAP and its employees from negligence in the assistance provided by the PSAP to law enforcement in connection with any lawful police activity or law enforcement investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">We turn now to the task of applying our interpretation of subsections (d) and (e) to the facts that existed at the time the judge denied the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number><em>N.J.SA </em>52:17C-10. We have concluded that subsection (d) does not provide immunity from the consequences of a PSAP\u2019s negligence in responding to a request for emergency services, and does not provide immunity for negligence in the way the PSAP employees input the information received from the caller and the way they dispatch police units in immediate response to the 9-1-1 call. Therefore, <em>N.J.SA </em>52:17C-10(d) does not include immunity for the negligent acts committed by Venable and Mike: inputting an incorrect description of Honrath\u2019s vehicle; failing to note that Honrath\u2019s vehicle was in motion; failing to keep Lester on the telephone so she could update Venable on the vehicle\u2019s route of travel; failing to issue a general alert; and failing to notify Westfield police of the abduction. We hold that the City and its PSAP were not afforded immunity under <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:17C-10(d) for any of these negligent acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Nor does subsection (e) afford any benefit to the City under the facts presented here. At the time Venable and Mike mishandled the incoming call from Lester concerning Massaehi\u2019s abduction, there was no police investigation underway. Nor had police requested any assistance from Venable or Mike. Indeed, not until Honrath\u2019s roommate called Westfield police, by which time Honrath had already arrived at the apartment with Massaehi, were police even notified. Thus, although Venable and Mike were negligent, their negligence did not arise while providing \u201cassistance to law enforcement ... in connection with any lawful investigation by or other law enforcement activity of the law enforcement officer.\u201d <em>N.J.SA </em>52:17C-10(e). The City is consequently not afforded immunity under subsection (e). Therefore, the Law Division correctly denied the City\u2019s motion to dismiss plaintiffs complaint because neither subsection (d) nor subjection (e) provide immunity under the facts presented here.
