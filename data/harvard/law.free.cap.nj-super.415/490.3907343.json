Plaintiff<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sustained serious injuries as a result of a trench collapse at his worksite. Plaintiffs claim that the workers\u2019 compensation bar does not apply to preclude their suit because the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d) found that the accident was the result of a \u201cwillful violation\u201d of its regulations, and therefore constituted an \u201cintentional wrong\u201d for State law purposes, and because James\u2019 superintendent sent plaintiff into the eighteen to twenty foot trench knowing the dangers he faced. Plaintiffs argue that \u201cthe court erred in holding that an intentional wrong under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8 had not occurred.\u201d We reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">Plaintiff sustained multiple injuries on August 10, 2004, as the result of a trench collapse on a construction project at Giralda Farms (the \u201cproject\u201d) in Chatham and Madison. In their complaint, plaintiffs identified defendants Reckson Associates and Reckson Construction as \u201crelated business organizations\u201d that developed and managed the project. The complaint also alleged that Reckson Construction had contracted with James, an excavation contractor, to construct a retention pond and other related structures.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>For purposes of this appeal, we must accept the facts in a manner giving all legitimate inferences to plaintiffs on James\u2019s motion for summary judgment. <em>Estate of Hanges v. Metropolitan Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>202 <em>N.J. </em>369, 388, 997 A.2d 954 (2010); <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 540, 666 A.2d 146 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Plaintiff was employed as a laborer by James which had to complete its \u201cwork for the retention pond and storm water upgrades before other work [on the project] could go forward.\u201d Therefore, its contract with Reckson had a \u201csubstantial completion\u201d date of October 15, 2004. The contract also provided that James would be responsible \u201cfor planning the work to meet the schedule required by Reckson.\u201d James was also responsible for ensuring that the work was executed safely.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Glenn Key (\u201cKey\u201d) was James\u2019 superintendent for the project and a \u201ccompetent person\u201d for purposes of OSHA. An OSHA \u201ccompetent person\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-8\">fo]ne who has had training in and is knowledgeable about soil analysis, the use of protective systems, and the requirements of the OSHA standard. One who is also capable of identifying existing and predictable hazards in the surroundings or working conditions which are hazardous, unsanitary or dangerous to employees, and has the authority to take prompt corrective measures to eliminate them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">Key had received formal OSHA safety training through the Utility and Transportation Contractors Association (\u201cUTCA\u201d) and been employed by James for thirty-two years as a construction superintendent. He had been \u201cfully trained in the requirements of OSHA with respect to excavation work\u201d and has undergone forty hours of OSHA training \u201csince the accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">From the outset of the project, James had experienced difficulties because of \u201crecord rainfalls\u201d and \u201ctorrential rain\u201d which impeded the progress of the project. On August 10, 2004, the day of the accident, a dewatering sump<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for the retention pond under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>construction was being relocated. The assignment involved \u201cmov[ing] the existing dewatering sump that was in the bottom of the pond to a location just outside of the top slope of the pond.\u201d According to J.D. Potash (\u201cPotash\u201d), James\u2019 president, the sump had to be relocated that day before it rained because the rest of the project \u201ccould not advance\u201d if the sump was not relocated.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">The assignment to relocate the sump involved plaintiff, Key and five other individuals. In order to relocate the sump, there had to be an excavation and construction of a trench. According to Potash, the trench was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-5\">to be lined with ... geo-textile fabric ... which is a black kind of wool or felt-like fabric and usually in the bottom goes a layer of stone, maybe four, six inches deep of stone, then a pipe is laid, and then more stone is put around the sides and above the pipe and then the fabric is then folded over like an envelope so you have kind of a sandwich with the fabric being the bread and the pipe being the meat and the stone being the condiments____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Initially, Key attempted the cover the trench, which was about eighteen to twenty feet deep, by having his men \u201cstretch out [the fabric] and walk it over the trench.\u201d However, the crew experienced some difficulty while attempting to do this. According to Key, the fabric \u201cwasn\u2019t laying right against the trench. It was getting twisted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">At this point plaintiff \u201cvolunteered\u201d to go into the trench and \u201cfix\u201d the fabric. However, Key \u201cstopped him\u201d and told him not to enter the trench. According to Key, he was concerned about plaintiff\u2019s safety \u201c[i]n case of failure.\u201d Key acknowledged that \u201c[c]onsidering the depth of the excavation, the soil type and the conditions and the lack of room to cut the slopes back more, ... [he] didn\u2019t want personnel to enter the excavation to install the filter fabric\u201d because he was worried about the trench \u201cfailing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">After denying plaintiffs offer to enter the trench, the crew, consisting of six men, continued to \u201cdrape the filter cloth\u201d over the trench. Key indicated that he saw \u201csome cracking in the bank\u201d of the trench as they tried to lay the cloth. However, they were unsuccessful in laying it properly. Key maintains that in his \u201cfrustration\u201d to get the fabric to lay correctly, he ultimately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>\u201cdirected\u201d plaintiff \u201cto enter the excavation to correct the problem with the cloth.\u201d That direction was in violation of OSHA\u2019s non-discretionary requirements because the trench had no protective system to make it more stable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">According to Key, there was a \u201ctrench box\u201d which could have been used to make the trench more stable but he did not use it because the \u201c[b]ueket and backhoe\u201d were wider than the box and \u201cwouldn\u2019t fit inside\u201d the trench. Additionally, Key maintains that he did not use \u201csloping,\u201d which would have also made the trench more stable, because it was \u201ca confined area\u201d and \u201cthe space\u201d for the trench would not allow it. In less than five minutes after plaintiff entered the trench, it caved in and buried plaintiff to his chest. He was transported to the Morristown Memorial Hospital and treated for multiple injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Thereafter, work on the project was suspended temporarily pending an OSHA investigation. After its investigation, OSHA issued James a citation for a \u201cwillful\u201d violation of its regulations based on the fact that it had failed \u201cto protect [its employees] from cave-ins by an adequate protective system,\u201d the excavation was not properly \u201csloped\u201d and because plaintiff \u201cwent into an unprotected trench, approximately [twenty] feet in depth____\u201d It was fined in the amount of $49,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">In Key\u2019s written report following the accident, he stated that \u201c[c]onsidering the depth of the excavation, the soil type and conditions and the lack of room to cut the slopes back more[,] ... [he] didn\u2019t want personnel to enter the excavation to install the filter fabric____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Plaintiffs argue that the trial court erred in holding that an \u201cintentional wrong\u201d had not occurred for purposes of <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:15-8. According to plaintiffs, James does not have immunity-under the workers\u2019 compensation statute because the facts, when viewed in the totality of the circumstances, create a jury question on that issue. On the other hand, James responds that Key\u2019s actions do not amount to an \u201cintentional wrong\u201d because they do not meet the threshold established by caselaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation system was characterized by the Supreme Court in <em>Millison v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>161, 174, 501 A.2d 505 (1985) (discussing the legislative history of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act) as \u201ca historic trade-off whereby employees relinquished their right to pursue common-law remedies in exchange for automatic entitlement to certain, but reduced, benefits whenever they suffered injuries by accidents\u201d as a result of and through the \u201ccourse of employment.\u201d Thus, \u201cemployees would receive assurance of relatively swift and certain compensation payments, but would relinquish their rights to pursue a potentially larger recovery in a common-law action.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>However, as the Court subsequently noted in <em>Laidlow v. Hariton Mach. Co., Inc., </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>602, 605, 790 A.2d 884 (2002), <em>Millison\u2019s </em>\u201ccharacterization\u201d of the Worker\u2019s Compensation system is \u201conly broadly accurate\u201d because not every accident is immune from a common law suit. This is because there are \u201ccertain types of conduct by the employer and the employee\u201d which the Legislature has determined \u201cwill render the Workers\u2019 Compensation bargain a nullity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 605-06, 790 A.2d 884.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See N.J.S.A </em>34:15-7; <em>Akef v. BASF Corp., </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>408, 412-13, 658 A.2d 1252 (1995). Moreover, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8 limits an employer\u2019s immunity to common law suits by excepting \u201cintentional wrong[s].\u201d <em>Laidlow, supra, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>at 606, 790 A.2d 884.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>The issue of what qualifies as an \u201cintentional wrong\u201d under the statute was first addressed by our Supreme Court in <em>Millison, supra, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>at 177-80, 501 A.2d 505. There, the Court stated that the \u201cintentional wrong\u201d exception was to be interpreted narrowly so as not to \u201cswallow up\u201d the \u201c \u2018exclusivity\u2019 provision of the Act\u201d and adopted Dean Prosser\u2019s \u201csubstantial certainty\u201d test. <em>Id. </em>at 177-78, 501 A.2d 505. \u201cIntent\u201d under the \u201csubstantial certainty\u201d test is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\">[T]he mere knowledge and appreciation of a risk\u2014something short of substantial certainty\u2014is not intent. The defendant who acts in the belief or consciousness that the act is causing an appreciable risk of harm to another may be negligent, and if the risk is great the conduct may be characterized as reckless or wanton, but it is not an intentional wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 177, 501 A.2d 505 (quoting W. Prosser and W. Keeton, <em>The Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 80 at 36 (5th ed. 1984)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">The <em>Millision </em>Court stated that \u201cthe dividing line between negligent or reckless conduct on the one hand and intentional wrong on the other ... [had to] be drawn with caution, so that the statutory framework of the Act [wa]s not circumvented simply because a known risk later blossom[ed] into reality.\u201d <em>Millison, supra, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>at 178, 501 A.2d 505. Hence, in order to meet the standard, the Court further stated that \u201c[w]e must demand a virtual certainty.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>For that matter, gross negligence by an employer or a lack of concern for an employee\u2019s safety is insufficient to remove the cloak of immunity. <em>Tomeo v. Thomas Whitesell Constr. Co., Inc., </em>176 <em>N.J. </em>366, 823 A.2d 769 (2003) (defendant entitled to summary judgment and jury verdict vacated where employer disabled safety lever on a snow blower because \u201cthe Legislature contemplated that those accidents would be part and parcel of workplace hazards covered by\u201d the Act). Furthermore, the mere toleration of workplace hazards is insufficient to show an \u201cintentional wrong.\u201d <em>Millison, supra, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>at 179, 501 A.2d 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">The Court therefore adopted a two-prong test that had to be satisfied in order to establish that an employer has lost its immunity under the statute: \u201c(1) the employer must know that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>actions are substantially certain to result in injury or death to the employee, and (2) the resulting injury and the circumstances of its infliction on the worker must be (a) more than a fact of life of industrial employment and (b) plainly beyond anything the Legislature intended the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act to immunize.\u201d <em>Laidlow, supra, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>at 617, 790 A.2d 884. The first prong of the test is known as the \u201cconduct\u201d prong, and the second as the \u201ccontext\u201d prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">In <em>Laidlow, </em>the Court refined the two-prong test, and indicated that in determining whether the employer\u2019s actions would meet the conduct prong no one fact was dispositive. <em>Laidlow, supra, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>at 621, 790 A.2d 884. Accordingly, there had to be an analysis based on the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 621-23, 790 A.2d 884. <em>See Mull v. Zeta Consumer Products, </em>176 <em>N.J. </em>385, 823 A.2d 782 (2003). For instance, the Court noted that the \u201cabsence of a prior accident\u201d or \u201cclose-calls\u201d does not necessarily \u201cmean that the employer did not appreciate that its conduct was \u2018substantially certain\u2019 to cause death or injury.\u201d <em>Laidlow, supra, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>at 621, 790 A.2d 884. Furthermore, the Court stated that the removal or alteration of a safety device, although not an \u201cintentional wrong\u201d per se, could meet the conduct prong depending on the facts of the ease. <em>Id. </em>at 617-18, 790 A.2d 884. The Court also found that \u201c[i]n general, the same facts and circumstances will be relevant to both prongs of <em>Millison.\u201d Id. </em>at 623, 790 A.2d 884.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Moreover, the Court articulated how summary judgment motions based on the Workers\u2019 Compensation bar should be approached. <em>Laidlow, supra, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>at 623, 790 A.2d 884. First, the court had to determine \u201cwhether, when viewed in a light most favorable to the employee, the evidence could lead a jury to conclude that the employer acted with knowledge that it was substantially certain that a worker\u201d would sustain injury. <em>Ibid. </em>In the event that question is answered in the affirmative, \u201cthe trial court must then determine whether, if the employee\u2019s allegations are proved, they constitute a simple fact of industrial life or are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>outside of the purview of the conditions the Legislature could have intended to immunize under the Workers\u2019 Compensation bar.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>If the latter, a trial is required when \u201cthe substantial certainty standard presents a jury question,\u201d because whether the employer\u2019s actions meet the context prong is a judicial function. <em>Ibid. </em>However, resolving whether the conduct prong has been met is a question which the jury has to determine. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Plaintiffs argue that the motion judge erred in finding that Key\u2019s conduct did not present a jury question under the conduct prong. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">In <em>Laidlow, supra, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>at 606, 790 A.2d 884, the Court was again called upon to determine whether an employer\u2019s conduct constituted an \u201cintentional wrong\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8. In that case, Rudolph Laidlow (\u201cLaidlow\u201d) had \u201csustained a crush and degloving injury\u201d which resulted \u201cin partial amputations of the index, middle, ring and small fingers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 606-07, 790 A.2d 884. He suffered these injuries when his hand became caught in a rolling mill he was operating at his place of employment, AMI-DDC, Inc. (\u201cAMI\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 606, 790 A.2d 884. There had been a prior occasion where Laidlow\u2019s glove had \u201cbecome hooked on a bar, but he was able to slip his hand out of the glove before it was pulled into the machine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 607, 790 A.2d 884. Another coworker\u2019s gloves had previously been hooked on the bar, as well. These incidents were reported to AMI. The employees\u2019 gloves were getting hooked because, although the safety guard on the rolling mill had been installed, it was \u201c \u2018never\u2019 engaged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 608, 790 A.2d 884. The only time the guard was placed in the proper position was when OSHA inspectors came to the plant. As soon as the OSHA inspectors left, the guard was \u201cdisabled.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Laidlow operated the mill without the safety guard for about twelve to thirteen years. The plaintiff had expressed concern about operating the mill without the safety guard to his supervisor on several occasions. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">After his injury, Laidlow brought a common law action against AMI. Laidlow argued that \u201cthe combination of the employer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>disabling of the safety guard and [its] deception of OSHA presented] a triable issue on whether\u201d AMI\u2019s conduct constituted an \u201cintentional wrong.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 609-10, 790 A.2d 884. On the other hand, AMI argued that removal of a safety device alone failed to meet the \u201cintentional wrong\u201d test. <em>Id. </em>at 610, 790 A.2d 884. Additionally, AMI maintained that operating the mill without any injury within the past twelve or thirteen years indicated that the conduct did not amount to an \u201cintentional wrong.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The Court found that under the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable jury could conclude that the employer knew that it was \u201csubstantially certain\u201d that removal of the safety device would result in injury. <em>Id. </em>at 622, 790 A.2d 884. In making that determination, the Court considered \u201cthe prior close-calls, the seriousness of any potential injury that could occur, Laidlow\u2019s complaints about the absent guard, and the guilty knowledge of AMI as revealed by its deliberate and systematic deception of OSHA.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The Court was again faced with the issue of when an employer\u2019s conduct exposes it to common law liability in <em>Crippen v. Central Jersey Concrete Pipe Co., </em>176 <em>N.J. </em>397, 823 A.2d 789 (2003), where Harold Crippen (\u201cCrippen\u201d), a \u201cmaterial man\u201d of the defendant, Central Jersey Concrete Pipe Company, died in the course of his employment. <em>Id. </em>at 399-400, 823 A.2d 789. As a \u201cmaterial man\u201d Crippen \u201ccontrolled the movement of sand and gravel into loading hoppers located in the ... change-over room.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 399, 823 A.2d 789. In order to regulate the inflow of sand and gravel, \u201cCrippen had to walk on a single two-inch by ten-inch wooden plank and stand on a six-foot high, unsecured ladder that rested on the wooden plank.\u201d \u201c[W]hile performing those duties Crippen fell into the sand hopper and suffocated\u201d to death. <em>Id. </em>at 400, 823 A.2d 789. Prior to Crippen\u2019s death, OSHA had conducted an investigation and cited the defendant for several violations. <em>Id. </em>at 401-02, 823 A.2d 789. During discovery, the plaintiff found out that the defendant had failed to \u201cabate many of the hazardous conditions\u201d for which it had been cited. <em>Id. </em>at 403, 823 A.2d 789. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>Additionally, the defendant\u2019s Environmental Health and Safety Manager acknowledged that he knew someone \u201ccould die\u201d if the violations were not abated. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The specific issue before the Court was \u201cwhether an employer\u2019s ... fail[ure] to cure hazardous conditions in violation of a directive issued by ... OSHA, coupled with its intentional deception of OSHA,\u201d amounted to an \u201cintentional wrong\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8. <em>Id. </em>at 399, 823 A.2d 789. Among other things, the defendant argued that its actions did not amount to an \u201cintentional wrong\u201d because there had been \u201cno prior incidents involving the hopper\u201d and its failure to implement OSHA\u2019s safety programs was a \u201cmere toleration of a dangerous condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 405-06, 823 A.2d 789.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The Court analyzed the facts under the conduct and context prongs articulated in <em>Millison </em>and reiterated \u201cthat the absence of a prior accident [does] not preclude a finding of an intentional wrong.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 408, 823 A.2d 789 (citing <em>Laidlow, supra, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>at 621, 790 A.2d 884). The Court stated that such evidence, and violations of OSHA safety regulations were valuable in the \u201csubstantial certainty\u201d analysis. <em>Id. </em>at 408, 823 A.2d 789. Thus, the Court \u201cconclude[d] that a reasonable jury could conclude that defendant had knowledge that its deliberate failure to cure the OSHA violations would result in a substantial certainty of injury or death to one of its employees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 409, 823 A.2d 789.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Finally, in <em>Mull, supra, </em>176 <em>N.J. </em>at 387, 823 A.2d 782, the plaintiff was employed as a line operator at the defendant\u2019s plastic-bag manufacturing facility. As part of the plaintiffs duties she worked with a machine known as a \u201cwinder,\u201d which wound \u201cplastic bags onto spools for packaging and delivery.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The plastic frequently jammed the machine and caused the nylon ropes to break requiring the line operator to clear the jam and replace the broken ropes. <em>Ibid. </em>On the day of the accident, the machine became jammed while the plaintiff was operating it. The plaintiff stopped the machine, \u201clifted a fiberglass guard, removed the lodged plastic, and began to replace the nylon ropes\u201d which had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>broken. <em>Id. </em>at 387-88, 823 A.2d 782. While doing that, \u201cthe winder began to operate, pulling [the] plaintiffs left hand into the machine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 388, 823 A.2d 782. The plaintiff suffered \u201cserious injuries, including the amputation of her left pinky and ring fingers.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>OSHA cited the defendant for several safety violations as a result of the accident. <em>Ibid. </em>The defendant had also been previously cited \u201cfor failing to provide its employees with ... lockout/tagout procedures\u201d \u201cdesigned to control the release of hazardous energy when a worker is servicing or performing maintenance on equipment or machinery.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>There had also been a prior accident with another line operator who had been injured when his hand was pulled into the winder. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The Supreme Court emphasized that in determining whether there was a \u201csubstantial certainty of death or injury, \u201cno one fact\u201d was dispositive because the facts would be viewed in the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 392, 823 A.2d 782. Rejecting the defendant\u2019s argument that it had not deceived OSHA, the Court found that under the facts, the plaintiff had satisfied <em>Millison\u2019s </em>conduct prong, <em>ibid., </em>and because the plaintiff had also satisfied the \u201ccontext prong,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 392-93, 823 A.2d 782, the order of summary judgment was reversed. <em>Id. </em>at 393, 823 A.2d 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">In his deposition, Key acknowledged that \u201c[considering the depth of the excavation, the soil type and the conditions and the lack of room to cut the slopes back more, ... [he] didn\u2019t want personnel to enter the excavation to install the filter fabric\u201d because he was worried about the trench \u201cfailing.\u201d Additionally, Key indicated that he had said \u201cno\u201d to plaintiffs initial request to enter the trench because he was worried about his safety. Therefore, defendant had knowledge that allowing its employees to enter the trench without any safety device could lead to injury or death. Moreover, Key\u2019s acknowledgement that there was an accumulation of water in the bottom of the trench, indicating that moisture was weeping from the soil, that there was cracking on the bank of the trench, coupled with his knowledge that Type C <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>soil, the kind of soil he was working with, was the least stable, all show, in the totality of the circumstances, that he knew the trench was unstable and that it could fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Moreover, like the plaintiffs in <em>Laidlow, Crippen </em>and <em>Mull, </em>Van Dunk\u2019s safety was disregarded to increase defendant\u2019s profit and productivity. Potash acknowledged that the relocation of the sump was essential because without it the rest of the project could not go forward. Therefore, defendant was under pressure to relocate the sump before it rained. The fact that plaintiffs safety was sacrificed for defendant\u2019s benefit is reinforced by the events following his accident. After OSHA had finished its investigation, defendant was able to relocate the sump by using the trench box it had on site without harm to any of its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">We recognize that this is a \u201cclose ease.\u201d There was no removal of a safety device, although non-use of the \u201ctrench box\u201d is somewhat analogous. Similarly, there was no deception for purposes of an OSHA inspection or otherwise, and no prior or on-going events involving similar risks. In fact, Key had gone out of his way to prevent a prior entry into the trench because he understood the risks, but perhaps that made his ultimate decision more \u201cknowing\u201d and \u201cwillful\u201d than others involved in the precedent, and certainly one which could be viewed by a reasonable jury as involving a \u201csubstantial certainty\u201d of death or injury. Furthermore, the fact OSHA gave defendant a \u201cwillful\u201d violation citation for failing to protect Van Dunk from a cave-in by using either a trench box or sloping informs the \u201ctotality of the facts\u201d and circumstances analysis under the conduct prong. <em>Laidlow, supra, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>at 623, 790 A.2d 884. <em>See also Alloway v. Bradlees, Inc., </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>221, 236, 723 A.2d 960 (1999) (suit by employee of subcontractor against general contractor and others).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">Nonetheless, defendant maintains that the court in <em>Fisher v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>363 <em>N.J.Super. </em>457, 470, 833 A.2d 650 (App.Div.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>310, 845 A.2d 135 (2004) expressed a reluctance to find an \u201cintentional wrong\u201d in cases falling outside of the industrial-manufacturing context. We dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>agree. While the court\u2019s language distinguished some precedent outside that setting, the <em>Fisher </em>Court merely concluded that Sears\u2019s conduct was not egregious enough to support a finding of \u201cintentional wrong.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 472-73, 833 A.2d 650.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">We need not address plaintiffs contention that OSHA\u2019s \u201cwillful\u201d violation and \u201cintentional wrong\u201d under the statute \u201cshare common elements,\u201d and that the OSHA finding is dispositive of the issue before us. While it may be important in the totality of the circumstances analysis, <em>Laidlow, supra, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>at 623, 790 A.2d 884, we do not find it conclusive.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See also Alloway v. Bradlees, Inc., supra, </em>at 236, 723 A.2d 960.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Finally, plaintiffs maintain that the court below erred in holding that Van Dunk\u2019s accident \u201cwas a fact of industrial life.\u201d As already noted, with respect to the context prong of the <em>Millison </em>test, the Court in <em>Laidlow </em>stated that \u201c[i]n general, the same facts and circumstances will be relevant to both prongs.\u201d <em>Laidlow, supra, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>at 623, 790 A.2d 884. In making its conclusion about the context prong, the trial court here stated that \u201c[g]iven the hazardous nature of construction sites, this Court finds that this is just a function of industrial life.\u201d The trial court did not give significant credit to the OSHA citation or the fact that defendant could have made the trench more stable if it had used protective devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Although the motion judge is accurate in stating that construction sites have a dangerous nature, that does not excuse the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>failure to use safety devices to alleviate the dangers and risks which were clearly known in this case. Here, it is unlikely that the Legislature would have considered allowing an employee to enter an unstable trench without the use of a trench box or adequate sloping, coupled with the employer\u2019s knowledge that the trench was unstable and could fail at any moment, to \u201cconstitute simple facts of industrial life.\u201d <em>Laidlow, supra, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>at 622, 790 A.2d 884. Thus, on the legal issue before us, we conclude that the Legislature would not have sanctioned the context within which this accident happened, or barred its recovery from James. Thus, plaintiff satisfied his burden on both prongs, warranting a reversal of the summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b518-9\">When we refer to plaintiff in the singular, we refer to Kenneth who is sometimes called Van Dunk.
