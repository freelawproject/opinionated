HARRIS, J.S.C.</author>\n<p id=\"AlK\">(temporarily assigned).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">Paris Wilson is the sole survivor of a tragic mass slaying. He was left for dead with life-threatening wounds as his mother and siblings lay dying nearby in their home. After enduring multiple stab wounds allegedly inflicted by his uncle, Paris was finally able\u2014more than thirty hours after the attack\u2014to telephone a Jersey City 9-1-1 operator for help. Rescue arrived almost immediately thereafter, but those responders could not save Paris\u2019s mother, brother, and sister who perished as a result of their grievous wounds. Unfortunately, two earlier unheeded calls to Jersey City\u2019s 9-1-1 system\u2014one communicated during the bloodshed itself\u2014did not promptly bring emergency response services to stop the horrors being wreaked upon the Wilson household.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">Plaintiffs in this litigation seek to hold several governmental actors\u2014together with their public employers\u2014-just as responsible for plaintiffs\u2019 harm as the alleged perpetrator himself. Our review in this appeal relates to summary judgment orders that extinguished plaintiffs\u2019 claims against all defendants on the grounds of several types of governmental immunities and certain evidentiary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>shortcomings. We affirm in part; reverse in part; and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">Because summary judgment was granted in favor of defendants, we recite the facts most favorable to plaintiffs. <em>Estate of Hanges v. Metro. Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>202 <em>N.J. </em>369, 374, 997 A.2d 954 (2010) (citing <em>Guido v. Duane Morris, LLP, </em>202 <em>N.J. </em>79, 82, 995 A.2d 844 (2010) (citing <em>Roa v. Roa, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>555, 562, 985 A.2d 1225 (2010))).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">In the early pre-dawn hours of Tuesday, September 20, 2005, Marcia Wilson and her three young children\u2014DeQuan, Dartagnania, and Paris\u2014were in their Jersey City apartment located at 185 Martin Luther King Drive, also known as 207 Wegman Parkway.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to the third amended complaint, Marcia\u2019s brother\u2014 Dwayne Wilson\u2014brutally attacked his family members with a knife, inflicting serious and, in some cases, lethal stab wounds upon each of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">At approximately 12:50 a.m., Anthony Andrews, who was visiting in his sister\u2019s apartment across the hall from the Wilson residence, heard an uproar and used his cellular telephone to call 9-1-1. Because Andrews\u2019s emergency call originated with a cellular telephone, it was initially routed to a New Jersey State Police (NJSP) call center where it was answered by defendant Lu Ann Burd. The call lasted only a few seconds, and resulted in an immediate transfer to the Jersey City Police Department\u2019s (JCPD) 9-1-1 call center:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-11\">[Burd]: 9-1-1, where is your emergency?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-12\">Andrews: Hello, um, ran at 227 Wegman. We heard somebody screaming next door, inside this building right here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>[Burd]: What town?</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Andrews: Jersey City.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">[Burd]: Alright hold on I\u2019ll connect you into the police department out there, hold on.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">JCPD: 9-1-1 Operator 3-5, where is your emergency?</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">Andrews: Uh,</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">[Line with NJSP disconnected.]</p>\n<p id=\"b172-11\">Defendant Laura Jean Petersen, a call taker at the JCPD, received Burd\u2019s transfer and spoke with Andrews:</p>\n<p id=\"b172-12\">[Petersen]: 9-1-1 operator 3-5, where is your emergency?</p>\n<p id=\"b172-13\">Andrews: Uh-185-uh-Wegman ...</p>\n<p id=\"b172-14\">[Petersen]: 185 We-</p>\n<p id=\"b172-15\">Andrews: Yeah, I hear some screamin[g] and throwing stuff, so I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on next door. Somebody\u2019s fighting or something.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-17\">[Petersen]: Okay, and that\u2019s 185 Wegman Parkway?</p>\n<p id=\"b172-18\">Andrews: Yeah.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-19\">[Petersen]: Okay, we\u2019re going to get someone over there as soon as possible, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-20\">Andrews: Alright bye.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-21\">[Petersen]: Thank you, bye bye now.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-22\">[End of call.]</p>\n<p id=\"b172-23\">In the moments between speaking with Burd and then with Petersen, caller Andrews\u2014a non-resident of Jersey City\u2014inadvertently changed the address of the location of the emergency from \u201c227 Wegman\u201d to \u201c185 Wegman Parkway.\u201d Both addresses turned out to be fatally incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-24\">At the conclusion of the call, Petersen completed a routine computer-aided dispatch (CAD) ticket that was transferred to defendant Michael Edward Clark, a dispatcher at the JCPD. The CAD ticket included the incorrectly reported location of 185 Wegman Parkway. For purposes of the CAD ticket, Petersen selected the call code \u201cF1900-Person screaming/calling for help; time elapsed not applicable; injury not applicable.\u201d In the narrative portion of the CAD ticket, Petersen inaccurately explained that the \u201c[reporting party] hears screaming coming from house next door, no further info.\u201d Petersen gave the call a priority two, which\u2014according to plaintiffs\u2019 expert witness\u2014is the second highest response priority.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Upon receipt and review of Petersen\u2019s CAD ticket, Clark dispatched defendant police officers Jose M. Santana and Ernest Vidal\u2014who, between them both, had less than seven months experience<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\u2014to 185 Wegman Parkway. Both officers stated in their depositions that they were expected to respond only to the address provided by the dispatcher. Arriving at the location corresponding to 185 Wegman Parkway within five minutes of Andrews\u2019s initial 9-1-1 call, officers Santana and Vidal discovered a dwelling that appeared to be unoccupied. Santana stated that it never occurred to him they were at the wrong address because they had verified it with dispatcher Clark. The police officers were unable to find anything amiss after a brief canvass of the area around 185 Wegman Parkway.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">At the officers\u2019 request, Clark attempted to re-call Andrews using the telephone number that had automatically appeared on Petersen\u2019s computer screen. He did so despite the fact that appropriate procedure required control sergeants or tour supervisors to attempt call-backs, unless the dispatcher asked specific permission to do so. Nevertheless, Clark pointed out that in regular daily practice, it was standard for dispatchers to make call-backs because otherwise the sergeants or supervisors would \u201cbe on the phone eight hours a day handling calls for four districts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">When Clark attempted to place the call-back to Andrews, the phone rang several times and then was transferred to voice mail, at which point Clark terminated the call-back without leaving a message. He explained, \u201c[i]t\u2019s not part of our policy and procedures to leave voice mail messages on phones.\u201d Police officers Santana and Vidal suspended their incipient hunt for an emergency and resumed their regular patrol duties after having spent approximately thirty minutes at the wrong address.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>Approximately twenty-two hours after making his first' 9-1-1 call, Andrews placed a second 9-1-1 call at 11:09 p.m., still on Tuesday, September 20, 2005. Defendant Brenda MurdaughJones of the JCPD answered the call this time:</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">[Murdaugh-Jones]: 9-1-1 emergency Operator 326, where is your emergency? [Andrews]: Hello, I called the police last night\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">[Murdaugh-Jones]: Ex\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">[Andrews]: because I heard\u2014Hello?</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">[Murdaugh-Jones]: Yes, go ahead, what did you say sir?</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">[Andrews]: I called the police last night because I heard a little bit of noise and reckin\u2019 (sic) in the building across the hall. It sounded like somebody was fist\u2014it sounded like somebody was f\u00edghtin[g]\u2014(inaudible) something. I called the police last nightf] [NJobody never came. And then all of a sudden I saw a guy rush out [of] the building [and] jump in his car and skid off in his car, so ... I don\u2019t know what happened next door. So, somebody should have came out and checked. I called the police two times, they never came.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">[Murdaugh-Jones]: Okay Sir, let me stop you right now because I, you know, we give people the opportunity to tell us what the life threatening emergency is, so that\u2019s the first question we do ask. Do you have a life threatening emergency that\u2019s going on right now?</p>\n<p id=\"b174-11\">[Andrews]: Exc\u00faseme?</p>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">[Murdaugh-Jones]: Do you have a life threatening emergency that\u2019s going on right now?</p>\n<p id=\"b174-13\">[Andrews]: No it would\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b174-14\">[Murdaugh-Jones]: Alright,</p>\n<p id=\"b174-15\">[Andrews]:\u2014it happened last night.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-16\">[Murdaugh-Jones]: What you\u2019re going to do is you\u2019re going to dial back on the non-emergency number\u2014okay? The number you need to be dialing is 201-547\u2014 [Andrews]: See they should have come yesterday[.]</p>\n<p id=\"b174-17\">[Hang up.]</p>\n<p id=\"b174-18\">Murdaugh-Jones explained in her deposition that she was trained to get off the 9-1-1 phone lines as soon as possible so that they are not tied up. In the ease of Andrews\u2019s call, she listened to see if it involved a contemporaneous life-threatening event, and believed that Andrews hung up before she finished providing the Police Department\u2019s non-emergency telephone number.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-19\">Meanwhile, back in the Wilson apartment, Paris had awoken on the Tuesday of the attack around 9:45 a.m. During the one hour he was conscious, he recalled hearing his sister request water but he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>was unable to get up to help her. His brother told Paris that they needed to find their mother\u2019s cellular phone, but Paris again lost consciousness and did not awake again until \u201cclose to the afternoon,\u201d which actually turned out to be the late morning, on Wednesday, September 21, 2005. At that point, his brother was barely alive but somehow had moved himself into another room. Paris finally managed to call 9-1-1 and direct the police to the apartment approximately thirty-four hours after the assault was first launched. By the time help finally arrived, Paris was the only one in the apartment to have survived.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Plaintiffs filed their initial complaint on August 9, 2006. On October 8, 2008, they filed a third amended complaint,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> alleging: (1) negligence, gross negligence, and wanton and willful disregard for the safety of others against Jersey City-employed defendants Petersen, Murdaugh-Jones, Clark, Santana, and Vidal; (2) respondeat superior, negligent retention, training, and supervision against Jersey City; (3) negligence, gross negligence, and wanton and willful disregard for the safety of others against NJSPemployed defendant Burd; and (4) respondeat superior against the State of New Jersey and the NJSP.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">In March 2009, all defendants moved for summary judgment. Plaintiffs thereupon cross-moved for partial summary judgment against Petersen and Murdaugh-Jones. On April 15, 2009, in a written decision memorialized by four separate orders, the court granted all of defendants\u2019 motions and denied plaintiffs\u2019 cross-motion. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">A. We start with first principles: a trial court will grant summary judgment to a moving party only \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact challenged and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment or order as a matter of law.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:46-2(c); <em>see also Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 523, 666 A.2d 146 (1995); <em>Carlson v. City of Hackensack, </em>410 <em>N.J.Super. </em>491, 494-95, 983 A.2d 203 (App.Div.2009). \u201cAn issue of fact is genuine only if, considering the burden of persuasion at trial, the evidence submitted by the parties on the motion, together with all legitimate inferences therefrom favoring the non-moving party, would require submission of the issue to the trier of fact.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:46-2(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">On appeal, \u201cthe propriety of the trial court\u2019s order is a legal, not a factual, question.\u201d Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment 3.2.1 on <em>R. </em>2:10-2 (2010). We employ the same standard that governs trial courts in reviewing summary judgment orders. <em>Chance v. McCann, </em>405 <em>N.J.Super. </em>547, 563, 966 A2d 29 (App.Div.2009). Thus, we contemplate, as did the Law Division, \u2018\u201cwhether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.\u2019\u201d <em>Liberty Surplus Ins. Corp. v. Nowell Amoroso, P.A, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>436, 445-46, 916 A2d 440 (2007) (quoting <em>Brill, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 536, 666 A2d 146).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">The motion judge determined that all of the defendants were entitled to governmental immunity from liability, but through slightly different statutory devices. The City of Jersey City was held to be immunized from plaintiffs\u2019 claims by three different provisions: <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:2-3; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:2-10; and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-10(e). The individual Jersey City employees were found to be similarly immunized by diverse combinations of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-2 (Petersen, Murdaugh-Jones, Santana, and Vidal); <em>N.J.S.A </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>59:5-4 (Santana and Vidal); and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-10 (Petersen, Murdaugh-Jones, and Clark). Lastly, the State defendants\u2014 Burd, the NJSP, and the State of New Jersey\u2014were each determined to enjoy immunity pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:17C-10.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Commonly understood, the motion judge found two sources of immunity. First, she held that particularized immunity provisions of the Tort Claims Act (TCA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:1-1 to 12-3, shielded several defendants from liability. Second, she determined that <em>N.J.S.A </em>52-.17C-10 (Title 52 immunity) protected all of the governmental actors (with the exception of police officers Santana and Vidal) and their employers from suit. Lastly, the motion judge found that without a supporting expert opinion, plaintiffs\u2019 tort claims for negligent training, supervision, and retention were inadequate to present to a jury. We do not entirely subscribe to the motion judge\u2019s point of view on these issues, for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">Plaintiffs submit that they presented clear evidence that Jersey City call takers Petersen and Murdaugh-Jones, as well as dispatcher Clark, ignored mandatory policies and procedures, which requires disenfranchisement of both their and Jersey City\u2019s TCA immunity claims. With respect to Jersey City police officers Santana and Vidal, plaintiffs contend that the question of whether the officers\u2019 abbreviated and abruptly-ended investigation at 185 Wegman Parkway was unreasonable should have been left to a jury for its determination. In essence, plaintiffs assert that once having become involved with Andrews\u2019s emergency call, each of these governmental actors negligently performed ministerial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>duties in their responses. For purposes of the summary judgment disposition, we agree with some, but not all, of plaintiffs\u2019 contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 evidence, interpreted indulgently, demonstrated that the 9-1-1 call takers did not follow published protocol and failed to ask Andrews the basic information of who, what, where, and when as prescribed by the standard operating procedures of the JCPD.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although Andrews\u2019s initial communication about the location of the assaults was eoneededly inconsistent and faulty, plaintiffs\u2019 experts opined that the harm suffered by the Wilson family would have been substantially mitigated if, in the two brief exchanges with Andrews, the Jersey City call takers had fully complied with the Manual\u2019s \u201cshould obtain\u201d admonition to collect the necessary background information from the caller. If Andrews\u2019s own location had been requested (he was just across the hallway from the Wilson apartment in 185 Martin Luther King Drive), and an accurate call-back telephone number had been obtained, the police officers would have probably found the Wilson family within an hour of the deadly assault. Had there been a more thorough compilation of information during Andrews\u2019s second 9-1-1 call, emergency resources could have been provided to the victims within twenty-four hours of the bloodshed, which might have ultimately saved their lives. Plaintiffs argue that dispatcher Clark was similarly short-sighted when he tried to call Andrews back at the behest of the police officers, only to suddenly terminate the call when transferred to voicemail. The failure to leave a voice-mail message instructing Andrews to call the dispatcher back contributed to the evolving harm at the scene of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">As for the police officers\u2019 conduct, plaintiffs argue that it was woefully incomplete and inadequate. Plaintiffs claim that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>rookie police officers put off any further pursuit of pertinent information that might lead them to the exigent event because they viewed it as something reserved for detectives, not patrol officers. Plaintiffs highlight the close locational proximity of the actual crime scene to where the police officers were actually sent\u2014supposedly less than 200 feet apart\u2014as further evidence of a negligently-conducted search for an emergency situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Jersey City and its employees sought refuge under the correlative principles embodied in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:2-3(d) and <em>N.J.S.A. 59:3-</em>2(d), both relating to the exercise of judgment or discretion by public agents. Additionally, the police officers asserted they were entitled to the protection of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:5-4, which provides immunity for the failure of a public entity and its employees to provide police protection service or sufficient police protection service to members of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">These defendants argue that all of the employees\u2019 actions were animated by purposive discretionary choices made in the heat of the moment, and were informed by the limited public resources available to them. Petersen, for example, claimed that she was in the midst of addressing another emergency call that was vying for her time and commanded her attention. Murdaugh-Jones contended that she was trained to divert non-emergency calls as quickly as possible to appropriate channels in order to remain available for authentic exigent situations. Clark asserted that he should not have even attempted the call-back to Andrews in the first place, as that task was reserved for supervisory personnel only. Santana and Vidal argued that their decision to suspend their mission was impelled by the demands and burdens of being patrol officers with numerous other assignments to juggle. Although we share empathy for each of these defendants\u2019 explanations of their conduct, and except for the police officers and the dispatcher, we are unconvinced that they were performing anything besides ministerial acts. As such, if those acts or omissions were negligently done and proximately linked to a plaintiffs harm, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>it would expose one or more of them, as well as their public employer, to liability and damages, notwithstanding the TCA</p>\n<p id=\"AkR\">According to <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:3-2(d), a public employee<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-5\">is not liable for the exercise of discretion when, in the face of competing demands, he determines whether and how to utilize or apply existing resources, including those allocated for equipment, facilities and personnel unless a court concludes that the determination of the public employee was palpably unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">In <em>Del Tufo v. Twp. of Old Bridge, </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>312, 324, 650 A.2d 1044 (App.Div.1995), <em>aff'd, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>90, 685 A.2d 1267 (1996), we stated that two conditions had to be satisfied before this immunity could be properly applied. \u201cFirst the challenged conduct must constitute the \u2018exercise of discretion.\u2019 Secondly, the conduct must be a determination whether and how to utilize resources \u2018in the face of competing demands.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 324-25, 650 A 2d 1044.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">A public entity or employee of such bears the burden to plead and prove immunity under the TCA. <em>Wymbs v. Twp. of Wayne, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>523, 539, 750 A.2d 751 (2000). Thus, the burden of proving that there were \u201ccompeting demands\u201d is on defendants in this case. <em>Manna v. State, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>341, 351, 609 A.2d 757 (1992). <em>See also Morey v. Palmer, </em>232 <em>N.J.Super. </em>144, 148, 556 A.2d 811 (App.Div.1989) (stating that \u201cspecifically, with respect to motions for summary judgment based on municipal tort immunities, the burden is on the public entity both to plead and prove its immunity under the Act\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Our appraisal of the record, when viewed under the lens of <em>Brill\u2019s </em>generosity to the non-movant plaintiffs, convinces us that there were genuine disputed facts relating to the two Jersey City call takers\u2019 performance of ministerial\u2014not discretionary\u2014acts. We take our lead from <em>Massachi v. AHL Serv., Inc., </em>396 <em>N.J.Super. </em>486, 935 A.2d 769 (App.Div.2007), <em>certif. denied, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>419, 949 A.2d 847 (2008), which held that \u201cwhere police officers negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>gently perform ministerial duties, ... <em>\u2018N.J.S.A. </em>59:5-4 does not insulate [them] from [the] unfortunate results of their negligently executed ministerial duties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 496, 935 A.2d 769 <em>(quoting Suarez v. Dosky, </em>171 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 10, 407 A.2d 1237 (App.Div. 1979), <em>certif. denied, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>300, 412 A.2d 806 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Similarly, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-2(d) and <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:2-3(d) do not provide immunity from liability for negligence in performance of ministerial police duties once the police have decided to protect. <em>Suarez, supra, </em>171 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 9-10, 407 A.2d 1237; <em>Massachi supra, </em>396 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 495-96, 935 A.2d 769. An act is \u201cministerial\u201d if it is \u201c[o]ne which a person performs in a given state of facts in a prescribed manner in obedience to the mandate of legal authority, without regard to or the exercise of his own judgment upon the propriety of the act being done.\u201d <em>Morey, supra, </em>232 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 151, 556 A.2d 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">With these principles in mind, we conclude that the actions of the dispatcher and the police officers were each non-ministerial in nature. Dispatcher Clark is faulted for failing to follow a stated policy of enlisting a superior officer before attempting the callback to Andrews. Even though this arguably contravened a standard operating procedure, the record conclusively demonstrates that dispatchers\u2019 decisions to make call-backs or to involve superior officers were routine discretionary acts linked to a scarce human resource: the availability of supervisory staff members, who had multiple other tasks to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">As for the manner in which the search around 185 Wegman Parkway was managed, we determine that the competing demands associated with protecting and serving the public and the need to be available for general police services made the police officers\u2019 conduct in those circumstances reasonable, discretionary, and immune from liability. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>59:5-4; <em>cf. Lee v. Doe, </em>232 <em>N.J.Super. </em>569, 557 A.2d 1045 (App.Div.1989) (no immunity pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:5-4 where police left scene and perpetrator returned to inflict harm upon plaintiff).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>The claimed breaches of duty by the call takers, however, relate to their less than stellar on-the-scene behavior, not to governmental policy decisions that might benefit from immunity. Accordingly, Jersey City and its call takers do not enjoy similar TCA immunity. We emphasize that our point of view does not require a jury to conclude that these governmental actors conducted themselves negligently, or even if they were negligent, that such conduct proximately contributed to a plaintiffs harm. Rather, we simply cannot find that TCA immunity exists under the indulgent state of facts that we have identified for the summary judgment analysis. Plaintiffs should not be deprived of the right to present an appropriate factual backdrop and expert opinion to a jury for its thoroughgoing review. Whether plaintiffs will succeed in persuading the jury of the alleged breaches of duty and the more thorny issue of proximate cause, remains to be seen.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Our analysis of the State defendants\u2019 entitlement to TCA immunity does not take a different course. Indeed, the State concedes that Burd\u2019s transfer of Andrews\u2019s first 9-1-1 call to Petersen was a ministerial act. However, the State defendants argue that even under a <em>Brill </em>magnifying glass, no rational trier of fact could conclude that Burd\u2019s conduct was negligent. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 9-1-1 expert, Paul Linnee, opined in his report that Burd\u2019s actions in the manner of transferring Andrews\u2019s call were palpably unreasonable and grossly negligent. He took issue with the manner in which Burd transferred the call, as well as with the fact that she did not stay on the line long enough to ensure that Andrews transmitted the same information he initially relayed to her. If she had, it was conceivable that Andrews\u2019s locational discrepancies would have been realized and corrected, which might have prevented later confusion as to the true location of the ongoing crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Linnee characterized Burd\u2019s action as an unannounced blind transfer, despite the fact that she told Andrews she was transferring his call. The expert claimed that Burd\u2019s conduct contravened <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:24\u20142.3(a)(7), which prohibits blind transfers: \u201cNo call-taker shall transfer a 9-1-1 call without first advising the calling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>party that the call is being transferred and that the caller should remain on the line until the call is connected. No \u2018blind transfers\u2019 are permitted.\u201d However, we find that Burd clearly did not engage in a blind transfer. Linnee opined that Burd should have followed the National Emergency Number Association\u2019s (NENA) Call Taking Operational Standards, which suggest that call takers \u201cshould stay on the line until the connection is complete and all pertinent information has been relayed to the answering\u201d call taker. Linnee noted that contrary to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:24-2.3(a)(7), \u201cevery other 9[-]l[-]l system\u2019s call transferring protocols\u201d he had reviewed required not only that the first call taker ensure that a connection was made, but also stay on the line to be satisfied that \u201cthe caller\u2019s critical information is being effectively passed on\u201d to the next call taker.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Even if we were to hypothetically engraft NENA\u2019s provisions onto New Jersey\u2019s 9-1-1 operational standards, and then conclude that Burd had neglectfully terminated her call involvement until Andrews gave the next call taker an address different from the address he told Burd, plaintiffs have failed to show how this constitutes negligence. Both the first address\u2014227 Wegman\u2014 and the second address\u2014185 Wegman\u2014were incorrect. We cannot conceive how a rational trier of fact could conclude\u2014without engaging in rank speculation and conjecture\u2014that any change in the duration of Burd staying on the line would have made any conceivable difference to those being assaulted in the apartment at 185 Martin Luther King Drive. However, because Burd properly performed her ministerial duties as specified in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:24\u2014 2.3(a)(7), and no evidence was submitted demonstrating that she was actually required to do anything further, Burd, the NJSP, and the State were all entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law, regardless of the absence of TCA immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">All of the non-police officer defendants claim that they are immune from liability pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:17C-10(e). The motion judge agreed, but we do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>When the original 1989 statute establishing the 9-1-1 Commission and Office of Emergency Telecommunications Service to plan, design, and implement the statewide emergency 9-1-1 telephone system was adopted, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-10(b) (since repealed) provided the following limitations of liability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-4\">No telephone company, public safety answering point, agents of, or manufacturer supplying equipment to a telephone company or PSAP, shall be liable to any person who uses the enhanced 9-1-1 service established under this act for release of [the telephone number and street address of any telephone used to place a 9-1-1 call], including non-published telephone numbers, or for failure of any equipment or procedure in connection with the enhanced 9-1-1 service or for any act or the omission of an act committed while in the training for or in rendering PSAP services in good faith and in accordance with this act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-5\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-10(b).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-6\"><em>As </em>written, this section of the statute promised that no liability could be found in favor of \u201cany person who uses the enhanced 9-1-1 service established under this act\u201d against telephone companies; PSAPs; equipment suppliers and manufacturers; and their agents for three distinct types of conduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\">\u2022 \u201cfor release of [the telephone number and street address of any telephone used to place a 9-1-1 call], including non-published telephone numbers\u201d (release of information).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-8\">\u2022 \u201cfor failure of any equipment or procedure in connection with the enhanced 9-1-1 service\u201d (failure of equipment or procedure).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-9\">\u2022 \u201cfor any act or the omission of an act committed while in the training for or in rendering PSAP services in good faith and in accordance with this act\u201d (act or omission while rendering PSAP services).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">On its face, the third type of immunity ensured a broad spectrum of coverage for any act or omission connected with \u201crendering PSAP services in good faith and in accordance with this act,\u201d without reservation. In its statutory definition, a PSAP was described as having been \u201cassigned the responsibility of receiving 9-1-1 calls and, as appropriate, directly dispatching emergency response services or transferring or relaying emergency 9-1-1 calls to other public safety agencies.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-1(Z). Although undefined by statute, an \u201cemergency response service\u201d presumably included law enforcement agents (police officers), as well as emergency responders (firefighters; members of first aid, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>rescue and ambulance squads; and hazardous materials workers). Thus, the immunity provisions in the 1989 statute provided protection to PSAPs and their agents when information gleaned from 9-1-1 calls was handed off to all such services.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\"><em>N.J.S.A </em>52:17C-10(b) was repealed, and subsections (c), (d), and (e) were added to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-10 in 1999, at a time when several other amendments were adopted in part to recognize that the Federal Communications Commission was requiring wireless telephone companies to provide wireless enhanced 9-1-1 service. <em>See </em>Senate Law &amp; Public Safety Committee, <em>Statement to Senate Bill No. 1495 </em>(Jan. 25, 1999). \u201c[T]he bill also clarifies existing limitations of liability for telephone companies, wireless telephone companies and other entities in connection with enhanced 9-1-1 service and wireless enhanced 9-1-1 service and in connection with supplying assistance to investigative or law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>It also \u201cprovid[ed] that the limitation of liability would be inapplicable in the event of wanton or willful disregard for the safety of persons or property.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">The newly re-configured provisions for limitations of liability appear in the 1999 statute as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-8\">c. No telephone company, person providing commercial mobile radio service as defined in 47 <em>U.S.C. </em>[\u00a7 ]332(d), public safety answering point, or manufacturer supplying equipment to a telephone company, wireless telephone company, or PSAP, or any employee, director, officer, or agent of any such entity, shall be liable for damages to any person who uses or attempts to use the enhanced 9-1-1 service, wireless 9-1-1 service or wireless enhanced 9-1-1 service established under this act for release of the information specified in this section, including non-published telephone numbers. This limitation of liability is inapplicable if such failure resulted from a malicious purpose or a wanton and willful disregard for the safety of persons or property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-9\">d. No telephone company, person providing commercial mobile radio service as defined in 47 <em>U.S.C. </em>[\u00a7 ]332(d), public safety answering point, or manufacturer supplying equipment to a telephone company, wireless telephone company, or PSAP, or any employee, director, officer, or agent of any such entity, shall be liable to any person for civil damages, or subject to criminal prosecution resulting from or caused by any act, failure or omission in the development, design, installation, operation, maintenance, performance or provisioning of any hardware, software, or any other aspect of delivering enhanced 9-1-1 service, wireless 9-1-1 service or wireless enhanced 9-1-1 service.

Subsection (d) appears to m\u00e1tch up with the 1989 legislation\u2019s limitation on liability in the case of a failure of equipment or procedure. Lastly, subsection (e) is arguably related to the 1989 legislation\u2019s limitation on liability for an act or omission while rendering PSAP services. However, a more detailed examination of the language reveals that these parallels are irrelevant because all of the 1989 limitations on liability protected a PSAP and its agents only from claims by \u201cany person who uses the enhanced 9-1-1 service.\u201d Plaintiffs do not enjoy this status because they did not personally use the 9-1-1 system.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, if the 1989 legislation were still in effect, defendants would not be entitled to immunity. We cannot simply assume that the 1999 law replicated the three areas of immunity from its predecessor; indeed, the whole complexion of the limitations of liability was altered.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">We observe that the legislative history surrounding the 1999 amendment is not consistent. As already noted, the report of the Senate Law &amp; Public Safety Committee averred that the statutory amendment \u201cclarifies existing limitations of liability.\u201d Conversely, the Assembly Policy and Regulatory Oversight Committee and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Assembly Appropriations Committee reported that the bill \u201calters the existing limitation of liability language to include wireless enhanced 9-1-1 service, except in the event of wanton or willful disregard for the safety of persons or property.\u201d <em>See </em>Assembly Policy and Regulatory Oversight Committee, <em>Statement to [First Reprint] Senate No. 1495 </em>(March 18,1999); Assembly Appropriations Committee, <em>Statement to [First Reprint] Senate No. 1495 </em>(May 3,1999). Lastly, the bills\u2019 Sponsors\u2019 statements appended to the proposed legislation in November 1998, speak of \u201can expanded limitation of liability.\u201d <em>See </em>Sponsor\u2019s <em>Statement to S. 1495 </em>(Nov. 16,1998); Sponsor\u2019s <em>Statement to A 2581 </em>(Nov. 9, 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Thus, we are confronted with three disparate expressions of the legislative intent of the 1999 law regarding its limitations of liability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-7\">\u2022 \u201c[C]larifies existing limitations of liability.\u201d <em>See </em>Senate Law &amp; Public Safety Committee, <em>Statement to Senate Bill No. 1195 </em>(Jan. 25,1999).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-8\">\u2022 \u201c[A]lters the existing limitation of liability.\u201d <em>See </em>Assembly Policy and Regulatory Oversight Committee, <em>Statement to [First Reprint] Senate No. 1195 </em>(March 18, 1999); Assembly Appropriations Committee, <em>Statement to [First Reprint] Senate No. 1195 </em>(May 3,1999).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-9\">\u2022 \u201c[E]xpand[s| limitation of liability.\u201d <em>See </em>Sponsor\u2019s <em>Statement to S. 1195 </em>(Nov. 16, 1998); Sponsor\u2019s <em>Statement to A. 2581 </em>(Nov. 9,1998).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">Before interpreting the limitation of liability provisions contained in the statute, we must first resolve a prefatory issue. Plaintiffs contend that the Jersey City defendants do not qualify for Title 52 immunity because Jersey City was not acting as a PSAP. A \u201c[pjublic safety answering point (PSAP)\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aob\">a facility, operated on a 24-hour basis, assigned the responsibility of receiving 9-1-1 calls and, as appropriate, directly dispatching emergency response services or transferring or relaying emergency 9-1-1 calls to other public safety agencies. A public safety answering point is the first point of reception by a public safety agency of 9-1-1 calls and serves the jurisdictions in which it is located or other participating jurisdictions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-11\"><em>\\N.J.S.A. </em>52:170-1(0.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-12\">A public safety agency is defined as \u201ca functional division of a municipality, a county, or the State which dispatches or provides law enforcement, fire fighting, emergency medical services, or other emergency services.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:17C-l(j).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Plaintiffs seek to debar Jersey City from its status as a PSAP because it was the second\u2014not \u201cthe first\u201d\u2014site to answer Andrews\u2019s call. However, the plain language of the statute does not require that a PSAP be the first answering site for an emergency call, but rather that it be \u201cthe first point of reception by a public safety agency of 9-1-1 calls.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-1(Z). Thus, in this case the NJSP call center was the PSAP for the State\u2019s emergency dispatches, and Jersey City\u2019s call center was the PSAP for Jersey City\u2019s emergency dispatches. Whether, as in this case, a call is transferred from another PSAP does not change the ultimate receiver\u2019s status if it independently acts as the PSAP for its assigned territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Having established that Jersey City and the NJSP both functioned as PSAPs in this case, we must then analyze whether, with respect to Andrews\u2019s calls, the PSAPs were \u201cproviding] any lawful assistance to any investigative or law enforcement officer ... in connection with any lawful investigation by or other law enforcement activity of the law enforcement officer.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-10(e). This requires the application of our jurisprudential tools relating to statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">A court\u2019s most important objective when interpreting a statute is to \u201cdiscern the meaning and intent of the Legislature.\u201d <em>State v. Gandhi, </em>201 <em>N.J. </em>161, 176, 989 A.2d 256 (2010); <em>see also State v. Friedman, </em>413 <em>N.J.Super. </em>480, 486, 996 A.2d 457 (App.Div.2010). \u201c[Generally, the best indicator of that intent is the statutory language,\u201d <em>DiProspero v. Penn, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>477, 492, 874 A.2d 1039 (2005), and the plain meaning of the statute\u2019s words are understood in accordance with the \u201cgenerally accepted meaning\u201d of the words. <em>Carlson, supra, </em>410 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 495, 983 A.2d 203. \u201cIf the plain language leads to a clear and unambiguous result, then [the] interpretive process is over.\u201d <em>Richardson v.

Allstate Ins. Co., </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>318, 323, 744 A.2d 175 (2000). When the language is unclear, legislative history is one available source to determine the meaning of a statute. <em>G.S. v. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>161, 172, 723 A.2d 612 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Defendants contend that the plain language of <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:17C-10(e) provides for a broad limitation of liability. They do not address the seeming incongruity of an allegedly broad limitation of liability that only applies to the limited context of \u201cassistance to any investigative or law enforcement officer,\u201d leaving out the myriad other situations\u2014fire, medical emergency, hazardous materials spill\u2014that would not be within the orbit of the statute\u2019s immunities.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Plaintiffs argue that a close examination of the entirety of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-10 suggests that it only applies to \u201cassistance\u201d that may be provided after an investigation or other law enforcement activity has already commenced. More specifically, they contend that it refers only to the provision of assistance to an officer in connection with that particular individual\u2019s already-ongoing investigation or activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">At the time the call takers in this case acted upon Andrews\u2019s 9-1-1 calls, they were not rendering assistance to any particular officer with respect to an already existing investigatory activity. Rather, all they were doing at those times was facilitating the dispatch of emergency response services pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-1(Z). By serving as the vanguard between a member of the public who requests emergency services or alerts the call taker to an emergency situation and the public entity that provides them, the call taker\u2019s role is narrowly focused and swiftly completed. However brief, this task is of signal importance to the caller and to the public interest. Only after the call taker has determined the nature of the situation, collected all relevant information, and passed that information on for dispatch, is it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>possible that an investigation or related law enforcement activity may commence. In other words, in the tumultuous moments during the first stages of a reported emergency, the call taker is not assisting an investigation; she is facilitating and participating in a dispatch, which is a defined responsibility of a PSAP. It is only after the dispatch is made, in the ordinary case, that an investigation might be opened or other activity commenced by law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">No such investigation truly commenced in this ease until Paris Wilson was found alive on Wednesday, September 21, 2005, although Santana and Vidal\u2019s request to Clark to initiate a call-back to Andrews a day earlier bore the mark of such an investigation as well. It was only then that there was a statutorily-described investigation to assist, not before. Subsequently, in connection with that investigative activity, law enforcement personnel may seek assistance from the PSAP, at which point the immunity provided by <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:17C-10(e) would become effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\"><em>N.J.SA </em>52:17C-10(e)\u2019s particularized limitation on liability makes sense when considered within the statutory scheme and in relation to the other provisions of <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:17C-10. Interpreting subsection (e) in the manner proposed by defendants would mean that whenever a call taker responded to a 9-1-1 call requiring dispatch of police, both the call taker and PSAP would automatically become immune from suit for anything other than those actions constituting wanton and willful disregard for the safety of persons or property. Such an interpretation would render subsections (c) and (d) of <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:17C-10 irrelevant as surplusage. \u201cFundamental rules of statutory construction militate against an interpretation of a statute that requires a court to assume that a provision is surplusage; the presumption is \u2018that every word in a statute has meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fletcher v. Cessna Aircraft Co., </em>412 <em>N.J.Super. </em>530, 536, 991 A.2d 859 (App.Div.2010) (quoting <em>In re Att\u2019y Gen.\u2019s \u201cDirective on Exit Polling: Media &amp; Non-Partisan Pub. Interest Groups,\u201d </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>283, 298, 981 A.2d 64 (2009)). Interpreting subsection (e) to grant immunity to PSAPs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>and call takers with respect to any and all actions taken regarding calls that lead to police dispatch would entirely eliminate the need for subsections (c) and (d). It also ignores the common sense difference between a dispatch of emergency response services and a law enforcement investigation or other related activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Moreover, had the Legislature intended to immunize call takers and PSAPs for the general handling of 9-1-1 calls leading to a police response, it could have simply stated in plain language that neither would be liable for damages resulting from the handling of emergency calls. Instead, it restricted immunity only to situations involving the \u201centity\u2019s provision of lawful assistance,\u201d without reference to individual call takers\u2019 provision of such lawful assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Here, at the time of Andrews\u2019s first call, neither State call taker Burd nor Jersey City call taker Petersen was providing lawful assistance to officers with respect to a concurrent investigation or other law enforcement activity. The same is true of MurdaughJones\u2019 handling of Andrews\u2019s second call, particularly in light of the fact that she never even contacted the police. The absence of her or the PSAP\u2019s \u201cproviding] of any lawful assistance\u201d is manifest. Thus the protective mantle of Title 52 was unavailable to these individuals and their respective employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">With respect to dispatcher Clark, however, at the time the dispatched police officers requested that he attempt to call back Andrews and obtain more information, he was lawfully assisting the officers with their concurrent investigatory activity of trying to locate the proper address of the emergency. Clark\u2019s inability to contact Andrews was due, in part, to the fact that the 9-1-1 call system utilized by Jersey City did not effectively record the unique cellular telephone number from which Andrews called. Plaintiffs presented no evidence that Clark\u2019s conduct was rendered \u201cin a manner exhibiting wanton and willful disregard for the safety of persons and property.\u201d Thus, Clark remained entitled to Title 52 immunity and the motion judge\u2019s dismissal of all claims against him was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>Thus, we conclude that under the facts and circumstances of this case, immunity for Jersey City, Petersen, and MurdaughJones pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-10(e) is unavailable. Their conduct consisted of facilitating a dispatch, which is a primary function of a call taking agent of a PSAP. Immunity for Clark\u2019s limited call-back exists only because he was performing a mere secondary responsibility as an agent of a PSAP in assisting the lawful investigatory activity by law enforcement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">As for the State defendants, the statute similarly does not provide them with immunity, but we remain convinced that Burd\u2019s conduct cannot by any rational means be proximately linked to any of plaintiffs\u2019 resulting harm. The dismissal of all claims against the State defendants was therefore properly granted, notwithstanding the absence of Title 52 immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">We next address the dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 claims against the Jersey City for negligent training, supervision, and retention. The motion judge granted summary judgment in favor of Jersey City on this claim because \u201cthe mere actions of the employees themselves without expert testimony to establish the standard of care is insufficient to substantiate plaintiffs claim that Jersey City fell below the standard of care in training, supervising and or retaining the individual defendants.\u201d After a review of the motion record we see no abuse of discretion that would permit us to interfere with the court\u2019s discretionary determination on this evidentiary issue. Plaintiffs\u2019 remaining arguments on appeal lack sufficient merit to warrant discussion in a written opinion beyond the brief comments that follow. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(l)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Plaintiffs contend that Jersey City neglected to follow its internal procedures for training and supervising its call takers, did not properly disseminate the Manual that defined their duties and responsibilities, and did not ensure that the employees retained their Manuals, despite policies to the contrary. Nevertheless, none of these putative defalcations is incorporated in an expert opinion concerning the standard or level of training and follow-up that is appropriately required of 9-1-1 employees. The legal question posed by these circumstances is well outside the awareness of a person of average intelligence and ordinary experience, the typical traits required of jurors. <em>Estate of Chin v. St Barnabas Med. Ctr., </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>454, 469, 734 A.2d 778 (1999). The doctrine of common knowledge is not applicable to the esoteric realm of emergency telecommunications facilities, at least in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Plaintiffs contend that certain untoward conduct of the Jersey City employees bears upon their employer\u2019s determination to allow them to remain on the job and work on the day of the incident. Although the record contains evidence of disciplinary actions taken against Petersen, Murdaugh-Jones, and Clark, several of those incidents occurred after the events of this case and, thus, are not relevant here. An assertion of negligence requires proof of harm caused by a breach of duty. <em>Polzo v. County of Essex, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>569, 584, 960 A.2d 375 (2008). Here, there is no evidence that would permit a rational trier of fact to conclude that plaintiffs suffered any harm as a result of anything these employees did or failed to do after the day in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">We also note in passing that although the plaintiffs\u2019 theory of liability is independent of harm caused by an employee, the concept of negligent training, supervision, and retention generally has no significance where, as here, the injury is alleged to have been caused by an employee\u2019s negligence in the performance of his or her duties. <em>Hoag v. Brown, </em>397 <em>N.J.Super. </em>34, 54, 935 A.2d 1218 (App.Div.2007). That is so because an employer is vicariously responsible for the negligent acts of an employee acting within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>the scope of his or her employment \u201cunder standard agency principles\u201d even if the employer was diligent in hiring, training, supervising and retaining the employees. <em>See Mavrikidis v. Petullo, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>117, 133-34, 707 A.2d 977 (1998) (observing that the tort is not applicable when the employer\u2019s liability can be established under the principle of respondeat superior).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">On the other hand, the employer\u2019s negligence with respect to selection, retention, and supervision of employees is important when the employee is acting outside the scope of employment. <em>DiCosala v. Kay, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>159, 173, 450 A.2d 508 (1982). The allegations in this case cannot reasonably support such an interpretation, making the claim by plaintiffs unsupportable.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Lastly, we conclude that the motion judge was correct in denying partial summary judgment to plaintiffs on their affirmative claims against call takers Petersen and Murdaugh-Jones. Even though plaintiffs\u2019 version of defendants\u2019 respective conduct could lead to a finding of negligent performance of a ministerial act, a rational trier of fact would not inevitably render that same conclusion. Moreover, given the attenuated proximate cause present in this case, it would have been grossly premature\u2014even if negligence were established\u2014to grant even partial summary judgment for plaintiffs. The motion judge\u2019s decision in this respect is unexceptionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">In summary, we affirm the dismissals with prejudice of all claims against dispatcher Clark, police officers Santana and Vidal, as well as against the State, the NJSP, and its employee Burd. We reverse the dismissals as against Jersey City and its two call takers Petersen and Murdaugh-Jones. Those surviving claims are remanded to the Law Division for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">Affirmed in part; reversed in part; and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b171-14\"> The apartment building is located at the intersection of Martin Luther King Drive and Wegman Parkway.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b173-8\"> Santana was sworn in as a police officer in April 2005; Vidal was sworn in as a police officer in August 2005.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b175-9\"><em> </em>Plaintiff Paris Wilson is an infant, and is represented in the third amended complaint by a guardian ad litem, his aunt Sonya Manzano.

One of the final orders in this case, however, granted summary judgment in favor of defendants Burd, the NJSP, and the State. We assume that by entering this final order, the motion judge intended that her rationale for the State\u2019s immunity would apply to the other two State defendants as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b178-7\"> 9-1-1 call takers in Jersey City are trained using a manual prepared under the auspices of the Jersey City Police Department Central Communications Bureau entitled <em>Call Taker Policy and Procedures Reference Manual </em>(Codified 7/99) (Manual).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b180-9\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:2-3(d) provides, in similar fashion, for immunity covering discretionary activities that runs in favor of the public entity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b186-8\"> We note that plaintiff Paris Wilson did access the 9-1-1 system more than twenty-four hours after he was attacked, but neither he nor the other plaintiffs take issue with the outcome of that call, which ultimately rescued him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b192-7\"> Although providing immunity only for a secondary role may seem anomalous, it strikes us that if broad immunity were intended to apply as defendants contend, leaving out all emergency response services except law enforcement would be even more incongruous and inexplicable. We leave it to the Legislature to decide the proper contours of the limitations of liability, if any, for PSAPs and their agents.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
