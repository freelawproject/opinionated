The Hammer vehicle was insured by Proformanee Insurance Co. (\u201cProformanee\u201d) while the Thomas vehicle was insured by New Jersey Manufacturers Insurance Co. (\u201cNJM\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Douglas Thomas\u2019 policy with NJM policy obligated the insurer, in pertinent part, to \u201cpay damages for bodily injury or property damage for which any insured becomes legally responsible because of an auto accident [but] ... [w]e have no duty to defend any suit or settle any claim for bodily injury or property damage not covered under this policy.\u201d The policy excluded liability coverage for any insured \u201c[w]ho intentionally causes bodily injury or property damage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">On June 3, 2005, Hammer filed a complaint against the Thomases seeking compensation for his injuries and against Proformance for UM benefits. Hammer\u2019s request to enter default against Thomas was filed on August 8, 2005, and, according to his brief, default was entered. NJM answered the Hammer complaint on behalf of Douglas Thomas only.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">Meanwhile, on June 8, 2005, Proformanee filed a declaratory judgment action against NJM, Thomas, Douglas Thomas, and William Hammer. Proformanee sought a ruling that NJM had wrongfully disclaimed coverage to the Thomases and was obligated to defend or indemnify its insureds. Hammer and NJM filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>answers. On September 9, 2005, the Hammer and Proformance complaints were consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">On February 13, 2007, a consent judgment was entered in favor of Hammer against Thomas for $425,000. This was the amount of the <em>Rule </em>4:21A-1 arbitration award based on a finding that Thomas was 100% responsible for the accident. With taxed costs and pre-judgment interest, the total judgment was $450,165.74.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">In accordance with instructions by the court during a conference on the trial date, NJM and Proformance filed cross-motions for summary judgment with a joint stipulation of facts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following oral argument on August 15, 2008, summary judgment was entered in favor of NJM.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Proformance and Hammer appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">Following the accident, Thomas and Hammer were taken to Christiana Hospital. Hammer suffered multiple serious injuries; Thomas suffered a head laceration as a result of hitting the windshield during impact.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to the police report, Thomas told Trooper Doelling he was \u201cangry\u201d after having an argument with his parents about whether or not he was taking his medication; he claimed he was, but his parents believed he was not. He admitted to \u201cdriving recklessly\u201d and traveling about sixty-five miles per hour on the county road with a speed limit of fifty miles per hour. Thomas explained that after he viewed a vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>traveling toward him in the opposite lane, he let go of the steering wheel and his vehicle traveled into the oncoming lane, striking the Hammer vehicle head on. When asked by the trooper why he had let go of the wheel, Thomas responded that he \u201cwanted to hit the other vehicle,\u201d and when asked the reason, Thomas said he \u201cwanted to end it all.\u201d Accordingly, the trooper classified the accident as an attempted suicide.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Thomas\u2019 parents, who were present at the hospital, related that Thomas is a paranoid schizophrenic who was prescribed medications but was displaying symptoms that he was not taking them. They told the trooper that when they confronted him, Thomas went to his vehicle and quickly departed the driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">On September 20, 2004, Thomas gave a recorded statement to NJM in which he stated there was poor visibility because it was night and raining, and he crossed the center lane into oncoming traffic and struck another vehicle. When questioned about his responses to the investigating trooper, Thomas first stated he didn\u2019t know if he wanted \u201cto hit the other vehicle,\u201d and then said he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to hit it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">With respect to the motions for summary judgment, counsel agreed to the following stipulated facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-8\">Joshua Thomas:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-9\">1. Had an argument with his parents;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-10\">2. Was driving recklessly;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-11\">3. At about 65 miles per hour;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-12\">4. Was angry;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-13\">5. Viewed a vehicle traveling toward him in the opposite lane;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-14\">6. Let go of the wheel;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-15\">7. Joshua told the Trooper that he wanted to end it all;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-16\">8. By letting go of the wheel, while traveling at about 65 miles per hour, there was a reasonable likelihood that Joshua would cause property damage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-18\">The court also had as part of the record a February 9, 2007 affidavit by Thomas submitted in connection with Hammer\u2019s sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>mary judgment motion, joined in by Proformance (in this context collectively referred to as \u201cappellants\u201d), seeking a finding of fact that Thomas did not intend to harm Hammer. The motion was denied by order of March 16, 2007. Thomas had certified, in part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-6\">4. I did not even notice Mr. Hammer\u2019s vehicle until just before we collided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-7\">6. I suffered serious injuries, in the collision, including a concussion, with loss of consciousness....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-8\">8. I have no recollection of making the[] statements [contained in the police report] and, in fact, no recollection of being questioned, at Christiana Hospital, by a [police officer].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-9\">9. I certainly did not tell the State Police that I was trying to kill myself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-10\">10. In conjunction with the above events, I was evaluated by Dr. Elliot L. Atkins, Ed.D., who performed a forensic psychological evaluation of me.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-11\">12. In his [March 28, 2005] Report, Dr. Atkins concludes that any statements that I may have made to the State Police, while hospitalized with a head injury, were inaccurate, and in fact, were in conflict with other accounts of the crash, which were apparently elicited from me that evening.[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-12\">13. Dr. Atkins ultimately concluded that I was not suicidal on the night [of the accident],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-13\">16. I certainly did not intentionally injure Mr. Hammer. The injuries which he did suffer were the unintended consequences of my careless driving [at the time].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-14\">In granting summary judgment to NJM, the judge held that <em>Charles Beseler Co. v. O\u2019Gorman &amp; Young, Inc., </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>542, 911 A.2d 47 (2006), relied on by appellants, was inapplicable as it \u201cwas really limited to the set of facts in the Workers\u2019 Compfensation] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>venue,\u201d incorporating his rationale articulated during Hammer\u2019s prior unsuccessful summary judgment motion. He found the apparent factual dispute had been removed by the parties\u2019 stipulations, specifically, stipulation number eight, which reflected an intention to cause property damage. The judge further noted that, as a practical matter, Thomas knew he would cause more than just property damage and it was more than reasonably likely he would injure or kill himself or someone in the other vehicle, but that such a finding was unnecessary in view of the stipulation that implicated the policy exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Proformance argues on appeal: (1) there was conflicting evidence as to Thomas\u2019 subjective intent to cause injury so that summary judgment was not appropriate; (2) the exclusion should not be enforced because the language is ambiguous as it fails to define \u201caccident\u201d or \u201cintentional,\u201d and NJM\u2019s interpretation of the policy is inconsistent with the reasonable expectation of the insured; (3) the court should have relied on <em>Beseler, </em>which held in a workers\u2019 compensation case that a similar exclusion was ambiguous for failing to exclude acts substantially certain to result in injury, warranting coverage; and (4) Proformanee\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Hammer argues on appeal: (1) NJM failed to bring this ease within the policy exception and meet its burden of establishing that Thomas intentionally caused the bodily injury suffered by Hammer; (2) there should have been no exclusion based on the <em>Beseler </em>rationale; (3) NJM must provide coverage for the unintended consequences of an insured\u2019s intentional act, absent an express exclusion; (4) the incident was an \u201caccident\u201d under NJM\u2019s policy because Thomas did not intend to harm Hammer; and (5) the court erred in failing to construe NJM\u2019s exclusion in favor of coverage because any fair and reasonable interpretation of the policy would so allow. Based on our review of the record and applicable law, we are satisfied summary judgment was appropri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>ate and the court properly concluded as a matter of law that Thomas\u2019 conduct fell within the exclusion of NJM\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">When reviewing a grant of summary judgment, we employ the same standards used by the motion judge. <em>Prudential Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. v. Boylan, </em>307 <em>N.J.Super. </em>162, 167, 704 A.2d 597 (App.Div), <em>certif. denied, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>608, 713 A.2d 499 (1998). First, we determine whether the moving party has demonstrated that there were no genuine disputes as to material facts, and then we decide whether the motion judge\u2019s application of the law was correct. <em>Atl. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Hillside Bottling Co., Inc., </em>387 <em>N.J.Super. </em>224, 230-31, 903 A.2d 513 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>104, 912 A.2d 1264 (2006). In so doing, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 523, 666 A.2d 146 (1995). We accord no deference to the motion judge\u2019s conclusions on issues of law, <em>Manalapan Realty, L.P., v. Twp. Comm. of Manalapan, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995), which we review de novo. <em>Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot. v. Kafil, </em>395 <em>N.J.Super. </em>597, 601, 930 A.2d 457 (App.Div.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Our Supreme Court has analyzed intentional acts exclusions under both automobile and homeowners policies and has found them to be valid and consistent with public policy. <em>See Allstate Ins. Co. v. Malec, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>1, 13, 514 A.2d 832 (1986) (\u201cdeclaring that a specific exclusion, in an automobile liability insurance policy, from coverage for the insured\u2019s liability caused by his intentional wrongful acts does not violate either public policy or ... the statutory scheme,\u201d particularly where \u201cthere are available to the claimant other sources of recovery, such as PIP benefits, UM coverage, and workers\u2019 compensation benefits\u201d). <em>See also Harleysville Ins. Co. v. Garitta, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>223, 231, 785 A.2d 913 (2001) (holding that, in the context of homeowners liability policies, \u201c \u2018[pjolicy provisions that exclude coverage resulting from intentional wrongful acts are \u201ccommon,\u201d are \u201caccepted as valid limitations,\u201d and are consistent with public policy\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Malec, supra, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>at 6, 514 A.2d 832) (alteration in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>NJM\u2019s insuring agreement requires it to pay damages for bodily injury or property damage for which its insured becomes legally responsible because of an automobile accident. The term \u201caccident\u201d is used here as a term of art (\u201cautomobile accident\u201d) because it is a personal auto policy. If this were the only provision in the policy, NJM could not disclaim coverage because Hammer\u2019s claim is for bodily injury and its insured\u2019s legal responsibility clearly results from an automobile accident. However, the insuring agreement expressly disclaims a defense or settlement of any bodily injury or property damage claim not covered under the policy, expressly excluding coverage for an insured who \u201cintentionally causes bodily injury or property damage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\"><em>Voorhees v. Preferred Mutual Insurance Co., </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>165, 607 A.2d 1255 (1992) and <em>SL Industries, Inc. v. American Motorists Insurance Co., </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>188, 607 A.2d 1266 (1992) serve as the starting point for analyzing whether conduct alleged to be intentional may, nonetheless, be covered under a liability insurance policy. The Court explained the balancing test implicated in interpreting a policy exclusion for intentional injuries, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-6\">The jurisprudence interpreting insurance provisions that implicate the question of the extent of coverage for intentional acts demonstrates a careful balance between competing doctrines. On the one hand, we have long held that public policy denies insurance indemnification for the civil consequence of wrong-doing____On the other hand, we recognize the desire to compensate victims with insurance proceeds to the extent that that compensation will not condone and encourage intentionally-wrongful conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-8\"><em>[Voorhees, supra, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 180-81, 607 A.2d 1255 (internal citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">In <em>Voorhees </em>the homeowners policy provided coverage to an insurer legally liable because of bodily injury caused by an \u201coccurrence,\u201d defined as an \u201caccident,\u201d but excluded coverage for \u201cliability ... caused intentionally.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 171, 607 A.2d 1255. The Court stated that its inquiry \u201cparallelled] that taken in interpreting policy exclusions for intentional acts [which] preclude coverage for injuries expected or intended by the insured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 184, 607 A.2d 1255. The Court focused on the injuries resulting from the act and held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number><em>[T]he accidental nature of an occurrence is determined by analyzing whether the alleged wrongdoer intended or expected to cause an injury. </em>If not, then the resulting injury is \u2018accidental,\u2019 even if the act that caused the injury was intentional. That interpretation prevents those who intentionally cause harm from unjustly benefit! Jing from insurance coverage while providing injured victims with the greatest chance of compensation consistent with the need to deter wrong-doing. It also accords with an insured\u2019s objectively-reasonable expectation of coverage for unintentionally-caused harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 183, 607 A2d 1255 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The Court elaborated that \u201c[a]bsent exceptional circumstances that objectively establish the insured\u2019s intent to injure,\u201d involving acts that are particularly reprehensible, such as sexual abuse of children in a day care center, \u201cwe will look to the insured\u2019s subjective intent to determine intent to injure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 185, 607 A.2d 1255. Thus, actions that appear foolhardy or reckless are not automatically excluded from coverage but require an inquiry into the actor\u2019s subjective intent to cause injury. <em>Id. </em>at 184, 607 A.2d 1255; <em>see also Cumberland Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Murphy, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>344, 349, 873 A.2d 534 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">In <em>SL Industries, supra, </em>the insured\u2019s general liability and comprehensive catastrophic liability policies provided coverage for injuries caused by an \u201coccurrence\u201d defined as an \u201caccident ... which results in bodily [or personal] injury ... neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.\u201d 128 <em>N.J. </em>at 194, 607 A.2d 1266. The Court enunciated the principle that once it is established the wrongdoer \u201csubjectively intends or expects to cause <em>some </em>sort of injury, that intent will generally preclude coverage,\u201d unless \u201cthere is evidence that the extent of the injuries was improbable,\u201d in which case a court \u201cmust inquire as to whether the insured subjectively intended or expected to cause that injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 212, 607 A.2d 1266 (emphasis added); <em>see also Cumberland Mut., supra, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>at 349, 873 A.2d 534. Lacking the intent to cause the \u201cimprobable\u201d injury, the injury will be deemed accidental and coverage must be provided. <em>SL Indus., supra, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 212, 607 A.2d 1266.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">In <em>Garitta, supra, </em>the homeowners policy similarly provided liability coverage for bodily injury caused by an occurrence for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>which the insured was responsible, defined in terms of an accident resulting in bodily injury, with an exclusion for bodily injury \u201c[wjhich is expected or intended by the insured.\u201d 170 <em>N.J. </em>at 230, 785 A.2d 913 (alteration in original). The Court reaffirmed the <em>Voorhees </em>and <em>SL Industries </em>holdings, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-5\">Courts ordinarily should refrain from summary judgment in respect of whether an insured intended or expected to cause the actual injury to a third party unless the record undisputedly demonstrates that such injury was an inherently probable circumstance of the insured\u2019s conduct. In that latter circumstance, a trial may not be necessary to determine the applicability of the exclusion, provided that there has been sufficient demonstration of the insured\u2019s subjective intent to cause some degree of injury. When the insured\u2019s conduct is particularly reprehensible, courts may presume an intent to injure without inquiring into the actor\u2019s actual intent. <em>[Id. </em>at 234-35, 785 A2d 913.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">In <em>Garitta, </em>the undisputed facts indicated that the insured was called out to a fight, exited the house with a knife hidden in the back of his pants and met the victim, who was unarmed. <em>Id. </em>at 235, 785 A.2d 913. Right before the encounter, his friend had urged him to cut the victim. <em>Ibid. </em>Without warning, the insured thrust the knife into the victim\u2019s bare torso twice, resulting in the victim\u2019s death. <em>Ibid. </em>The Court accepted as true the insured\u2019s repeated testimony following the incident that he did not intend to cause the victim\u2019s death, but found that testimony \u201c[did] not alter the reality that the insured affirmatively stabbed [the victim] with a knife, an inherently dangerous object, given to him by [a friend] for the purpose of cutting or harming the victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 239, 785 A.2d 913. Because the Court was satisfied the mortal injury inflicted on the victim was \u201can inherently probable consequence of the insured\u2019s actions,\u201d the Court was able to find, as a matter of law, the insured\u2019s intent for purposes of the exclusion, and concluded on summary judgment that the insured\u2019s conduct fell within the policy\u2019s provision excluding coverage. <em>Id. </em>at 241-42, 785 A2d 913.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">In <em>Cumberland Mutual, supra, </em>the insured\u2019s homeowners policy similarly provided coverage for bodily injury caused by an occurrence, defined as an accident resulting in bodily injury, and contained an exclusion providing the insurer would not cover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>bodily injury or property damage, \u201cwhether or not expected or intended by the insured, which is a consequence of an insured\u2019s willful harm or knowing endangerment.\u201d 183 <em>N.J. </em>at 347, 873 A.2d 534. The undisputed facts were that the fourteen-year-old insured and two other juveniles shot BBs from a platform twenty-five yards from the roadway on a night with poor visibility with the intention of \u201cdinging\u201d passing cars, the insured estimated he hit four or five vehicles based on the sound of the BBs ricocheting off them, one of his shots then went through the soft top of the victim\u2019s jeep and struck her, permanently blinding her in one eye. <em>Id. </em>at 345-46, 873 A.2d 534. The insured admitted to intentionally shooting at the cars, but denied he intended to hurt anyone. At the time, he also claimed he did not understand someone could get hurt and nothing was said indicating that any of the boys expected or feared that anyone would be hurt. <em>Id. </em>at 345, 873 A.2d 534. The Court, equally divided, relying on the principles articulated in the above cited cases, affirmed the grant of summary judgment to the insured on cross-motions seeking a determination whether the policy provisions clearly excluded the insured\u2019s acts from coverage, concluding that what occurred in the case was an \u201caccident\u201d within the meaning of the policy. <em>Id. </em>at 347-51, 873 A.2d 534. The Court was satisfied the circumstances surrounding the shooting provided no basis for concluding the juveniles subjectively intended or expected to injure anyone. <em>Id. </em>at 350, 873 A.2d 534. Nor was the victim\u2019s injury \u201can inherently probable consequence\u201d of the insured\u2019s conduct, in light of the weather, the boys\u2019 stated intention, their distance from the road, the few shots that hit their mark and the \u201cunlikely happenstance of the [victim\u2019s] vehicle having a permeable top.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 348, 350, 873 A.2d 534. Moreover, the Court did not find the \u201cheedless conduct\u201d of the juvenile equivalent to the acts characterized as \u201cparticularly reprehensible\u201d so as to give rise to a presumption of intent to injure the victim. <em>Id. </em>at 350, 873 A.2d 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">In order to withstand summary judgment, NJM must demonstrate there is no genuine issue that Thomas\u2019 conduct falls within the policy exclusion, namely, that he intentionally caused bodily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>injury or property damage. <em>R. </em>4:46-2(c); <em>see also Proformance Ins.

Jones, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>406, 415, 887 A.2d 146 (2005) (holding that \u201cpolicy exclusions must be narrowly construed; [and] the burden is on the insurer to bring the case within the exclusion[ ]\u201d (citation and quotation marks omitted)). \u201cAn issue of fact is genuine only if, considering the burden of persuasion at trial, the evidence submitted by the parties on the motion, together with all legitimate inferences therefrom favoring the non-moving party, would require submission of the issue to the trier of fact.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:46-2(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">We must therefore analyze NJM\u2019s policy exclusion and the facts surrounding the motor vehicle accident, with all favorable inferences to appellants, under the balancing test and principles enunciated in the <em>Voorhees </em>line of cases. Appellants argue that the fact the NJM does not include \u201cintended or expected\u201d precludes the application of the <em>Voorhees </em>line of cases and renders the exclusion ambiguous, thus mandating coverage. We reject those arguments. Even in <em>Voorhees, </em>where the exclusion did not contain the \u201cexpected or intended\u201d language, the Court analyzed the exclusion as if the language were there. <em>Voorhees, swpra, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 183, 184, 607 A.2d 1255. The same analysis is applicable to NJM\u2019s exclusion of coverage for an insured who \u201cintentionally causes bodily injury or property damage.\u201d \u201cIntentionally causes\u201d is not an ambiguous phrase. Appellants have failed to show that the language of NJM\u2019s exclusion would fairly support more than one meaning and, therefore, we apply the plain language of the policy. <em>See Villa v. Short, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>15, 23, 947 A.2d 1217 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Thus, we begin our inquiry with whether \u201cthe record undisputedly demonstrates [Hammer\u2019s] injury was an inherently probable consequence of [Thomas\u2019] conduct.\u201d <em>Garitta, supra, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>at 234, 785 A.2d 913. In this ease it is undisputed that Thomas was speeding and he let go of the wheel after seeing Hammer\u2019s vehicle approaching in the opposite direction. Hammer\u2019s injury was an \u201cinherently probable consequence\u201d of Thomas\u2019 conduct. Since this prong was clearly met, summary judgment is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>appropriate if \u201cthere has been a sufficient demonstration of [Thomas\u2019] subjective intent to cause some degree of injury.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">We are not convinced that the trial court\u2019s interpretation of stipulation number eight as reflecting Thomas\u2019 intention to cause property damage ends the inquiry in NJM\u2019s favor. The coverage and exclusion language of the NJM policy contains parallel references to \u201cbodily injury or property damage.\u201d We thus interpret the exclusion to apply to the respective bodily injury or property damage claim if there is an intention to cause that component.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Our conclusion is based, in part, on the Court\u2019s rationale in <em>Cumberland Mutual, supra, </em>which contained the following exclusion: \u201cWe do not cover <em>bodily injury </em>or <em>property damage, </em>whether or not expected or intended by the insured, which is a consequence of an insured\u2019s willful harm or knowing endangerment.\u201d 183 <em>N.J. </em>at 347, 873 A.2d 534 (emphasis added). In that case there was clear intent by the juvenile insured to cause property damage. The Court, however, did not discuss or conclude that the insured\u2019s intent to cause property damage precluded coverage to the insured for personal injury.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">We reject NJM\u2019s argument that Thomas\u2019 conduct was equivalent to the acts the Court has characterized as \u201cparticularly reprehensible,\u201d so as to give rise to a presumption of an intent to injure Hammer without inquiring into Thomas\u2019 actual intent. We are satisfied, however, that the record, giving all favorable inferences to appellants, does sufficiently demonstrate Thomas\u2019 subjective intent to cause some degree of injury. The record consists of the police investigation report prepared immediately following the motor vehicle accident on June 10, 2004, Thomas\u2019 September 20, 2004 recorded statement to NJM, Thomas\u2019 February 9, 2007 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>affidavit, Dr. Atkins\u2019 March 28, 2005 report, and the parties\u2019 summary judgment stipulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">We first consider Thomas\u2019 affidavit and Dr. Atkins\u2019 report. First of all, Thomas\u2019 statement that he \u201cdid not even notice Hammer\u2019s vehicle until just before we collided\u201d must be read with stipulations number five and six that \u201cThomas viewed a vehicle traveling toward him in the opposite lane\u201d and \u201clet go of the wheel,\u201d clearly demonstrating that Thomas observed Hammer's vehicle in the oncoming lane before he made the decision to let go of his steering wheel, causing his vehicle to ram into Hammer\u2019s. Secondly, Thomas\u2019 statements that he did not recollect being questioned at the hospital and \u201ccertainly did not tell the State Police that [he] was trying to kill [him]self\u2019 is non-evidential in view of the stipulation number seven that he \u201ctold the trooper that he wanted to end it all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Thirdly, the three statements made by Thomas at the hospital as reported by Dr. Atkins (he \u201cwent out speeding and cracked up the car in a suicide attempt,\u201d \u201ccrashed car intentionally to affect his parents,\u201d and \u201cargued with his parents about medication and then went out speeding and then got involved in an accident\u201d) are not inconsistent with one another or with the statements made to Trooper Doelling as reflected in his investigative report. Being killed as a result of \u201ccracking up\u201d or \u201ccrashing his car\u201d would definitely \u201caffect\u201d his parents. Moreover, Thomas did become involved in a \u201cmotor vehicle accident,\u201d which as previously explained, is a term of art.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">In addition, Dr. Atkins\u2019 diagnosis of \u201cschizophrenia, paranoid type,\u201d and his conclusion that Thomas \u201cwas not suicidal at the time of his accident\u201d and his actions could have been the result \u201cof one of his many efforts to flee in the face of his perception that he was facing possible psychiatric commitment\u201d or, as in the past, \u201can attention getting device,\u201d do not raise a material issue of fact as to Hammer\u2019s subjective intention or expectation to injure Hammer by his actions. Even if Thomas did not intend to kill himself by letting go of the wheel, the record reflects that he did intend to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>crash his car into Hammer\u2019s. We find unpersuasive the distinction drawn by appellants that Thomas\u2019 \u201clet[ting] go\u201d of the wheel while speeding and in the face of oncoming traffic in the opposite lane, was not the same as steering his car directly into Hammer\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Lastly, Thomas\u2019 concluding statement in his affidavit that he \u201cdid not intentionally injure [] Hammer\u201d and that Hammer\u2019s \u201cinjuries ... were the unintended consequences of [his] careless driving\u201d was the first time Thomas ever stated that he had no intention to injure Hammer. These statements are self-serving bare assertions contained in an affidavit submitted in connection with a summary judgment motion and framed in legal language. Under the circumstances of this case, these statements fail to create a genuine issue of fact.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Thomas got into his car and angrily sped on a public road, and because he was attempting suicide or injury to himself to affect his parents, he let go of the steering wheel only after viewing a car traveling toward him in the opposite lane and crashed into it. He further stipulated that under all the circumstances, there was a \u201creasonable likelihood\u201d he would cause property damage. However, it is compelling in the record that Thomas\u2019 intent was not so limited. By letting go of the wheel only after he saw the oncoming car, as opposed to driving off the road at any time before, Thomas clearly manifested an intention to injure the other motorist in the car. NJM has sufficiently demonstrated that Thomas harbored a subjective intent to cause some injury and that Hammer\u2019s injury was an inherently probable consequence of Thomas\u2019 conduct. Therefore, summary judgment was appropriate because no further factual inquiry was necessary to resolve the issue as a matter of law as to whether Thomas\u2019s actions fell within NJM\u2019s policy provision excluding coverage for \u201cany insured [w]ho intentionally causes bodily injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">We reject appellants\u2019 argument that the trial judge erred in not applying the standard and analysis articulated by the Court in <em>Beseler, supra, </em>involving a similarly worded exclusion for \u201cbodily injury intentionally caused or aggravated by [the employer]\u201d contained in the liability portion of an employer\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation and Employers Liability Insurance Policy. 188 <em>N.J. </em>at 545, 911 A.2d 47. <em>Beseler </em>involved a work-related accident whereby the employee had eight fingers amputated while using a large press brake machine on which the employer allegedly removed certain safety guards and warnings. <em>Id. </em>at 544, 911 A.2d 47. The employee filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim, as well as a common-law claim against his employer based on the contention the employer committed an intentional wrong so as to avoid the exclusive remedy bar of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. <em>Ibid.; see also N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8 (providing a narrow exception permitting a common-law action for a work-related incident based on an \u201cintentional wrong\u201d). The insured employer sought a declaratory judgment against its liability carrier that the carrier owed a duty to defend and indemnify the employer against the employee\u2019s claim that the employer had created a \u201csubstantial certainty of injury.\u201d <em>Beseler, supra, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>at 545, 911 A.2d 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">The Court first noted the ease involved a specialized area of law pertaining to the application of the \u201cintentionally caused\u201d exclusion in a standard Workers\u2019 Compensation and Employers Liability Insurance Policy to an employer\u2019s claim for coverage against an employee\u2019s common-law action, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\">In this matter we deal with an exception to an insurance policy written in the specialized area of workers\u2019 compensation coverage and related employer liability for an employee\u2019s common-law cause of action for bodily injuries. The latter category of actions are not easily pursued.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-8\"><em>[Id </em>at 546, 911A 2d 47.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">In discussing the exclusion in the liability portion of the policy and whether it would apply to the facts of the case, the Court only cited New Jersey case law discussing the workers\u2019 compensation system and the public policy behind the statutory exception that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>permits an employee to seek both workers\u2019 compensation and common-law remedies, as well as case law from other jurisdictions involving work-related accidents that was in accord with its decision. <em>Id. </em>at 546, 548-49, 911 A.2d 47. The Court discussed the evolution of the \u201cintentional wrong\u201d test, citing the landmark workers\u2019 compensation case of <em>Laidlow v. Hariton Machinery Co., Inc., </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>602, 613, 790 A.2d 884 (2002), which clarified that an intentional wrong under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8 included \u201c \u2018actions taken with a subjective desire to harm\u2019 as well as \u2018instances where an employer knows that the consequences of those acts are substantially certain to result in such harm.\u2019 \u201d <em>Beseler, supra, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>at 546-47, 911 A.2d 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The Court then compared the insured\u2019s policy exclusion to the expanded definition of intentional wrong under the statute, and concluded the policy language (excluding claims of \u201cbodily injury intentionally caused\u201d) excluded only injuries that result from a subjective intent to injure and not those injuries where an employer knows that the consequences of its acts are substantially certain to result in such harm. <em>Id. </em>at 547-48, 911 A.2d 47.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Because the policy did not contain express language excluding injuries falling under the \u201csubstantially certain\u201d prong of the intentional wrong exception, the Court found the policy\u2019s exclusion to be ambiguous and construed it in favor of the insured. <em>Id. </em>at 548, 911 A.2d 47. It reasoned that an employer could reasonably conclude the policy\u2019s language was narrower than the statutory \u201cintentional wrong\u201d exception to exclusivity and thus \u201cwould not expect that it would be bare of coverage against the allegations in [the employee\u2019s] common-law action.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Accordingly, the Court ordered the carrier to provide coverage for its insured. <em>Id. </em>at 547, 911 A.2d 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>Appellants argued to the trial court that the NJM policy Douglas Thomas purchased contains the same exclusion considered ambiguous by the Court in <em>Beseler </em>(\u201cintentionally causes bodily injury or property damage\u201d). They urged that because the policy does not specifically exclude acts substantially certain to result in injury, the court should apply the \u201cunintended consequence\u201d standard of <em>Beseler </em>and hold the exclusion does not apply to unintended injuries resulting from intentional acts. <em>See id. </em>at 545, 547, 911 A.2d 47. Appellants contended no reasonable trier of fact could conclude Thomas intended to injure Hammer and, even if he intended to cause bodily injury to himself, the injuries to Hammer were simply an unintended consequence. Accordingly, appellants argued NJM should be required to provide coverage. They acknowledge on appeal that <em>Beseler </em>was concerned primarily with workers\u2019 compensation but urge us, as a matter of first impression, to extend its holding to automobile insurance exclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">We are not persuaded by appellants\u2019 argument. In the present matter, the trial court correctly found the <em>Beseler </em>decision to be clearly restricted to the workers\u2019 compensation setting and inapplicable to case law dealing with exclusions for intentional acts contained in automobile insurance or homeowners policies. In <em>Beseler, </em>the Court compared the language of the employer\u2019s insurance policy exclusion with a specific standard applicable solely to workers\u2019 compensation law, namely the \u201cintentional \u2022wrong\u201d exception to exclusivity contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8. Notably, the Court did not cite either <em>Cumberland Mutual, </em>decided only the year before, or any of the litany of cases involving the intentional acts exclusions <em>(Voorhees, SL Industries </em>and <em>Garitta, </em>discussed in <em>Cumberland </em>Mutual). The omission of these authorities from the Court\u2019s analysis makes it clear that the Court did not intend to engraft that standard on other than workers\u2019 compensation cases and require automobile or homeowners insurance exclusions to contain express language excluding acts \u201csubstantially certain\u201d to result in injury in order to be enforced. Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number><em>Beseler\u2019s </em>holding has not been applied to any of these types of cases in the three and a half years since it was decided.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">As no evidence has been presented demonstrating the NJM policy did not meet the reasonable expectations of its insured, the argument presented by Proformance does not warrant any discussion in this opinion. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(l)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b267-10\"> Hammer filed opposition to NJM\u2019s motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b267-11\"> By order of August 25, 2008, the court severed the Hammer complaint against Thomas from Proformance\u2019s declaratory judgment action, and stayed the Hammer complaint pending the present appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b267-12\"> The police investigation report states that Trooper Doelling spoke with Thomas\u2019 treating nurse who said he suffered from a laceration to his head and results of the CT scan were negative.
