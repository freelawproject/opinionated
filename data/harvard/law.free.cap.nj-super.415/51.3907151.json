Defendant now asserts that the trial judge committed a number of errors, which prejudiced defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. We agree that the judge erred as to the charge on causation and conclude that the error was sufficient to warrant a new trial as to the felony murder conviction. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for a new trial on that charge. As to the other convictions, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-11\">On February 26, 2006, at approximately 12:30 a.m., Alejandro Morales and Francisco Urbina Serrano were walking down Hale Street in New Brunswick. Several people were standing in front of 175 Hale Street, and one of the individuals approached Serrano, asking for a cigarette. Serrano was, at that time, standing between two houses, in front of an alley and four concrete steps that led to a concrete walkway below. The vertical drop of the steps was approximately thirty-three inches.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>While Serrano was standing in front of the alley, another individual, later identified as defendant, held Serrano by the shirt, struck him and pushed him down the steps into the alley. Defendant fled immediately thereafter. Other witnesses stated, however, that a group of people were involved in beating Serrano both before and after he fell down the steps.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">New Brunswick police officers William Contreras and Ronnie Cheng arrived at Hale Street only a minute or two after the incident. At that time, Serrano was \u201claying in his son\u2019s lap ... and ... was unresponsive.... \u201d Morales provided officer Contreras with a physical description of the assailants, and Contreras communicated the information over the police radio.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">The police also identified two witnesses to the assault\u2014Stephanie Contreras and Eleidie Torres. Torres was interviewed at 8:03 a.m. and at 9:45 p.m. on February 26th, and she stated that when she and Contreras arrived on Hale Street, prior to the incident, defendant told the girls to get out of the area because \u201c[t]hey had to handle some business.\u201d Torres further stated that she saw defendant strike Serrano in the face, and Serrano fell down the steps. Contreras was interviewed at 11:36 p.m. on February 26th, and she stated that she saw defendant \u201cholding the guy from the shirt. And they ... was right on the first stair.\u201d Defendant then \u201chit him in the stomach, turned him around and, to the side,\u201d and pushed him down the steps.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">Five police officers\u2014three investigators and two uniformed officers\u2014went to defendant\u2019s home to speak with him about the crime. The police officers explained to defendant, who was seventeen years old, and defendant\u2019s mother, Judy Tajada, \u201cwhat was going on[,]\u201d and defendant and his mother were taken to the police station in two separate cars. Defendant was not placed in handcuffs and was not under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">When defendant arrived at the police station, he was interviewed by Sergeant Investigator Ivan Scott, Detective Rodney Blount and Detective Daniel Dominguez, to translate for defendant\u2019s mother. At the beginning of the interview and prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>defendant being read his Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rights, Judy Tajada wanted to know what had happened. The police did not answer her question, but stated, \u201cwe\u2019ll go through everything, there\u2019s some stuff I [got to] do first anyway so, we\u2019ll, we\u2019ll go through it.\u201d The detectives then informed defendant and his mother of defendant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights, and defendant and his mother waived their rights. At no point during the interview was defendant told that he was under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Defendant then made the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-6\">Well I was with my, my boy and chillin\u2019 on the block whatever and a dude came up to me and told me that he wanted to rob somebody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-7\">Um, I know the guy but yea you know what I mean.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-8\">And I didn\u2019t want any have any part with that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-9\">He kept insisting, insisting and I figured I was like whatever cause he was just gonna keep bothering me and he was, he was this Mexican cat, two Mexican cats____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-10\">... And whatever he\u2019s talking to me I\u2019m like I don\u2019t wanna have any part with this, he keeps insisting whatever so I\u2019m like whatever. All he wanted me to do was push one of the guys into a like, into his hands where like him and dude was alone. I did it, I don\u2019t what, whatever he did with that dude I don\u2019t know, then the other cat that was with him when I did that he looked at me funny and then he went up this porch, knocked on the window and that\u2019s when I took off, I ran.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-11\">Defendant described the person who incited the robbery as a Dominican man, Jesus Tejada. Defendant also stated, inconsistently, that he saw Serrano fall into the other person\u2019s arms, but then also stated that he did not see what happened when Serrano fell because he \u201cwanted to watch [his] back [to] make sure the other dude didn\u2019t attack [him]____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-12\">While defendant gave his statement, Detective Dominguez translated the conversation to defendant\u2019s mother, and defendant asked, \u201cNeed help? Want me to tell her?\u201d Detective Dominguez <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>replied, \u201cNo. Cause you could listen and I have no reason to lie.\u201d Nonetheless, defendant communicated to his mother throughout the interview in Spanish.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Also during the interview, defendant\u2019s mother stated that she \u201csupport[ed] everything [the police] are doing, if my kid is responsible for anything ... he has to pay for what he did----I\u2019m not going to hide behind anything.... If he\u2019s responsible, if he\u2019s guilty, you have my permission to go.\u201d When the police were questioning the veracity of defendant\u2019s statements, defendant stated, \u201cYo like for real man, ya\u2019ll need to stop this cause I\u2019m just about to stop saying, talking, whatever and ya\u2019ll can just lock me up to do whatever you got to do, like for real, I have no reason to lie to anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">As a result of the fall, Serrano suffered fractures on the right and left side of his skull, as well as the base of his skull. These caused severe brain hemorrhage and craniocerebral injuries, and Serrano died as a result of these injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">Following his being indicted, defendant filed a motion \u201cto suppress [his] statement and all evidence derived from his illegal arrest.\u201d After the hearing, at which Sergeant Scott, Detective Selesky, Detective Blount, defendant\u2019s mother and defendant testified, the judge determined that it was \u201cat least arguable that he was saying that he wanted to stop talkingf,]\u201d when defendant stated that the police could \u201clock [him] up.\u201d As a result, the police had a duty to \u201cstop questioning him and to reconfirm that he was willing to speak to them and to readvise him of his Miranda rights, which they did not do[.]\u201d Therefore, defendant\u2019s statements were admissible only up to that point in the interview. However, despite the <em>Miranda </em>violation, the judge determined that defendant\u2019s statements were given voluntarily, and the remainder of defendant\u2019s statements were available to impeach defendant\u2019s credibility if defendant was to testify at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">Defendant\u2019s trial was held in July and August 2007. At trial, the State first proffered Officer Contreras, and he testified to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Morales\u2019s account of the attack on Serrano. The State also played a videotape of defendant\u2019s redacted interview with Sergeant Scott.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Stephanie Contreras and Eleidie Torres also testified, but both stated that their earlier statements to the police were not true and that they were scared or coerced into making their statements implicating defendant. Contreras and Torres also claimed to be drunk on the night of February 26th. However, the State played an audiotape of Stephanie\u2019s interview with the police, as well as a redacted audiotape of Eleidie\u2019s statements to the police, which were admitted substantively, as prior inconsistent statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Defendant acknowledged pushing Serrano. His primary defense was that he had no intent to rob Serrano, and he \u201cwanted nothing to do with the robbery,\u201d but \u201cmerely pushed and ran____\u201d Defendant\u2019s other defense was that \u201cthe injuries [to Serrano] occurred ... after [defendant] had left the scene.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">Defendant was found guilty of first-degree felony murder and second-degree robbery, but acquitted of first-degree robbery and aggravated manslaughter. Defendant filed a motion for a new trial, asserting that the judge should have suppressed defendant\u2019s entire statement to the police, that the judge did not correctly charge the jury and the judge erred in an evidentiary ruling. The judge denied defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">The judge then merged defendant\u2019s robbery and felony murder convictions and sentenced defendant to a term of thirty years imprisonment, with thirty years parole ineligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-11\">On appeal, defendant raises the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b90-12\">I. THE GUILTY VERDICTS FOR ROBBERY AND FELONY MURDER WERE AGAINST THE WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE, BECAUSE THE STATE PRESENTED NO EVIDENCE THAT DEFENDANT INTENDED TO COMMIT A THEFT (RAISED BELOW).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-13\">II. THE TRIAL COURT COST DEFENDANT A FAIR TRIAL BY OMITTING KEY LANGUAGE ON ATTEMPT AND CAUSATION FROM THE JURY INSTRUCTIONS (NOT RAISED BELOW).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-14\">A. THE COURT FAILED TO DEFINE \u201cATTEMPT\u201d FOR THE JURY.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-15\">B. THE TRIAL COURT PROVIDED AN INCOMPLETE CHARGE ON CAUSATION.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>III. THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S RESPONSE TO THE JURY\u2019S QUESTION ON CAUSATION UNFAIRLY PREJUDICED DEFENDANT, NECESSITATING A NEW TRIAL (RAISED BELOW).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">IV. DEFENDANT\u2019S CONVICTION FOR FELONY MURDER SHOULD BE REVERSED, BECAUSE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS CASE, HIS ACQUITTAL OF FIRST DEGREE ROBBERY PRECLUDED A CONVICTION FOR FELONY MURDER, DESPITE HIS CONVICTION FOR SECOND DEGREE ROBBERY (NOT RAISED BELOW).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">V. THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR BY DENYING DEFENDANT\u2019S REQUEST TO CHARGE THE JURY WITH AGGRAVATED ASSAULT AND SIMPLE ASSAULT AS LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSES TO ROBBERY (RAISED BELOW).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">VI. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN ADMITTING DEFENDANT\u2019S STATEMENT WHICH WAS THE PRODUCT OF AN ILLEGAL ARREST WITHOUT PROBABLE CAUSE, IN VIOLATION OF DEFENDANT\u2019S RIGHT TO BE FREE FROM UNREASONABLE SEIZURES PURSUANT TO THE FOURTH AMENDMENT OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION AND ART. I., 117 OF THE NEW JERSEY CONSTITUTION (RAISED BELOW).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">A. DEFENDANT WAS UNDER ARREST WHEN HE WAS REMOVED FROM HIS HOME.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">B. THE POLICE DID NOT HAVE PROBABLE CAUSE TO ARREST DEFENDANT.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">VII. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN ADMITTING DEFENDANT\u2019S STATEMENT WHICH WAS OBTAINED UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT TAINTED ITS VOLUNTARINESS, IN VIOLATION OF DEFENDANT\u2019S FIFTH AMENDMENT RIGHT AGAINST SELF-INCRIMINATION (RAISED BELOW).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">VIII. THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S CANDID PREJUDGING OF THE TESTIMONY DURING THE MOTION TO SUPPRESS REASONABLY LED DEFENSE COUNSEL TO BELIEVE THAT THE COURT COULD NOT BE FAIR AND UNBIASED DURING THE HEARING, AND SHOULD HAVE PROMPTED THE COURT\u2019S RECUSAL PURSUANT TO <em>11. </em>1:12-1 (RAISED BELOW).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-12\">IX. NUMEROUS INSTANCES OF THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S UNNECESSARY INTERVENTION IN THE PROCEEDINGS UNDERMINED THE DEFENSE AND COST DEFENDANT A FAIR TRIAL (PARTIALLY RAISED BELOW).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-13\">X. THE TRIAL COURT IMPROPERLY PREVENTED DEFENDANT FROM INTRODUCING EXCULPATORY HEARSAY STATEMENTS OF ALEJANDRO MORALES THAT HAD SIGNIFICANT INDICIA OF RELIABILITY (RAISED BELOW).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-14\">XI. THE CUMULATIVE ERRORS COST DEFENDANT A FAIR TRIAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-15\">XII. THE JUDGMENT OF CONVICTION IS ERRONEOUS.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Defendant argues that the judge\u2019s jury instructions \u201cwere fatally deficient because they were incomplete.\u201d Specifically, defendant claims that the judge failed to define \u201cattempt\u201d for the jury, and the judge provided an incomplete charge on causation. Defendant also argues that the judge erred in providing the jury with an \u201cunreasonable example\u201d of the felony murder affirmative defense. Defendant did not, however, object to the jury instructions at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">Pursuant to <em>Rule </em>1:7-2, a defendant is required to challenge instructions at the time of trial or else waives the right to contest the instructions on appeal. <em>See State v. Adams, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>186, 206-07, 943 A.2d 851 (2008). \u2018Where there is a failure to object, it may be presumed that the instructions were adequate.\u201d <em>State v. Morais, </em>359 <em>N.J.Super. </em>123, 134-35, 819 A.2d 424 (App. Div.2003) (citing <em>State v. Macon, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>325, 333, 273 A.2d 1 (1971), <em>certif. denied, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>572, 832 A.2d 322 (2003)). Therefore, we may reverse only in the presence of plain error, that is error \u201cclearly capable of producing an unjust result.\u201d <em>Adams, supra, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>at 207, 943 A.2d 851 (citing <em>R. </em>2:10-2). <em>See also State v. Martin, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>2, 15, 573 A.2d 1359 (1990).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-8\">As applied to a jury instruction, plain error requires demonstration of \u201clegal impropriety in the charge prejudicially affecting the substantial rights of the defendant and sufficiently grievous to justify notice by the reviewing court and to convince the court that of itself the error possessed a clear capacity to bring about an unjust result.\u201d <em>State v. Hock, </em>54 <em>N.J. </em>526, 538 [257 A.2d 699] (1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>399 <em>U.S. </em>930, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>2254, 26 L.Ed.2d 797 (1970). The alleged error is viewed in the totality of the entire charge, not in isolation. <em>State v. DiFrisco, </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>434, 491 [645 A.2d 734] (1994). In addition, <em>any finding of plain error depends on an evaluation, of the overall strength of the State\u2019s case. See State v. Cotto, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>316, 326-27 [865 A.2d 660] (2005).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-9\"><em>[State v. Nero, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>397, 407, 949 A.2d 832 (2008) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>State v. Chapland </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>275, 289, 901 A.2d 351 (2006)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">It is well-established that \u201c[c]orrect charges are essential for a fair trial[,]\u201d and to that end, \u201cthe court must explain the controlling legal principles and the questions the jury is to decide.\u201d <em>Martin, supra, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>at 15, 573 A.2d 1359. \u201cAlthough a party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>is not entitled to a charge in his own words, he is entitled to a charge which fully, clearly, and as accurately as possible sets forth the fundamental issues.\u201d <em>State v. Ball, </em>268 <em>N.J.Super. </em>72, 112, 632 A.2d 1222 (App.Div.1993) (citing <em>State v. LaBrutto, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>187, 204, 553 A.2d 335 (1989); <em>State v. Green, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>281, 288-89, 430 A.2d 914 (1981)), <em>aff'd, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>142, 661 A.2d 251 (1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 <em>U.S. </em>1075, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>779, 133 L.Ed.2d 731 (1996). The jury charges must, therefore, \u201crelate the law to the facts of a case----\u201d <em>State v. Savage, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>374, 389, 799 A.2d 477 (2002). \u201cLT]he test is to examine the charge in its entirety, to ascertain whether it is either ambiguous and misleading or fairly sets forth the controlling legal principles <em>relevant to the facts of the case.\u201d LaBrutto, supra, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>at 204, 553 A.2d 335 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">With these principles in mind, we address defendant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">Defendant alleges that the judge erred by charging the jury with a truncated definition of causation with regard to felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">At trial, one of defendant\u2019s main defenses was that defendant ran away after pushing Serrano, and a group of people started \u201ckicking [Serrano], pounding him, taking his head and slamming it against the ground.\u201d The State Medical Examiner testified that Serrano suffered from at least two impacts about the skull. The Medical Examiner stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-11\">The second impact on the other side of the head could be caused by a scenario which really was just explained. He\u2019s down. He has one impact already. In order to get another impact on the other side of the head!,] obviously the other side of the head had to impact the pavement as well. Most likely scenario is he\u2019s down, he\u2019s lifted up, he\u2019s forcibly thrown down onto the pavement again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-12\">It\u2019s more likely that the right side injuries would be caused by him being-accelerated from the top of the stairs to the bottom. This is much more distance that he\u2019s going to be able to travel during that fall being pushed and being the body would be accelerated and it struck the ground____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-13\">The injuries on the right side\u2014the injuries created by the impact on the right side [were] enough to be lethal. The injuries created on the left side by themselvesLJ although less severe[,] would still be enough to be lethal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>Defendant proffered the testimony of Dr. Paul Adler as an expert in emergency medicine. Dr. Adler testified that he did not disagree with the State\u2019s medical examiner, \u201cin that two or more forceful or massive injuries could have caused\u201d Serrano\u2019s injuries. These injuries could have been caused by \u201ca baseball bat, ... a brick, ... a really forceful push down and then a massive punch to be honest.\u201d He also testified that a kick in the head by a \u201cbig, strong person with big hulking boots\u201d could have caused defendant\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Victoria Velasquez, who had been looking out of the second floor window of an apartment with a view of Hale Street at approximately 12:30 a.m. on the night of the attack, also testified for the defense. She saw four men beating Serrano about the face, and one of the men beating Serrano was Ricardo Gonzalez, also known as Pato. She \u201conly saw the guys r[u]n away and then he was there lying down ... by the stairs on the sidewalk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Erick Lezama, Velasquez\u2019s husband, who was with her in the second story apartment on the night of the attack, indicated that he saw three or four people assaulting one person, and he recognized Pato as one of the assailants. He stated that \u201cthey started hitting him [when] he was standing, then they push[ed] him in the hallways I guess he fell down and they kept beating him and then I only saw the four guys run away____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Notably, neither Morales, Lezama nor Velasquez identified defendant as one of Serrano\u2019s assailants.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">The <em>Model Jury Charge (Criminal), </em>Felony Murder, Non Slayer Participant (rev. Mar. 22, 2004), states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7C\">The second element requires the State to establish that the victim\u2019s death was caused during the commission of or attempt to commit or flight after committing or attempting to commit the (insert predicate crime). In order to meet its burden of proof in this regard, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-9\">2. That the victim\u2019s death was a probable consequence of the commission of or attempt to commit or flight after committing or attempting to commit (insert predicate crime). In order for the death to be a \u201cprobable consequence\u201d of the (insert predicate crime) the death must not have been too remote, or too accidental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>in its occurrence, or <em>too dependent on another\u2019s volitional acts </em>to have a just bearing on the defendant\u2019s liability or the gravity of his/her offense. In other words, you must decide if the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that, under all the circumstances, the death did not occur in such an unexpected or unusual manner that it would be unjust to find the defendant responsible for the death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-6\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Here, however, the judge omitted the \u201canother\u2019s volitional acts\u201d language and charged the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-8\">The second element that the State must prove is that the victim\u2019s death was a probable consequence of the commission of the robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-9\">So in order for a death to be a probablte] consequence it need not have been too remote or too accidental to have a just bearing on the defendant\u2019s liability or the gravity of the offense; in other words, you must decide if the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that under all the circumstances the death of Mr. Serrano did not occur in such an unexpected or unusual manner that it would be unjust or unfair to find the defendant responsible for that death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">During deliberations, the jury asked for \u201csome clarification as to the concept of probable consequence of the robbery.\u201d The judge explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-11\">So this is a factual question for you to determine. The jury in this case must determine whether the death of Mr. Serrano was what we would eall a probable consequence of this kind of a robbery\u2014right?\u2014and/or\u2014or I should say, whether it was so unexpected and so unusual that it would be unfair to hold this defendant responsible for it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-12\">I can\u2019t give you a better clarification in that, only\u2014only to say to you that the spirit of the law requires the jury to look at all of the circumstances surrounding the alleged commission of the robbery\u2014right?\u2014and whether or not the death that flowed from that robbery, if you\u2019re satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the death did take place during the course of the robbery\u2014right?\u2014that that death was a probable consequence or that it was not so unexpected or so unusual that it would simply be unfair to hold one of the\u2014you know, the alleged robbers responsible for the death as well. And again that\u2019s because the whole idea of felony murder is that one does not have to intentionally cause death to be responsible for a felony murder, one just has to be intentionally involved in the felony. Okay?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-13\">We find that the judge\u2019s omission constituted plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-14\">A key factor in the defense was that a group of people were involved with beating Serrano, even after defendant pushed him down the steps. This is reflected in Velasquez\u2019s and Lezama\u2019s testimony and the medical corroboration by Dr. Adler. The jury might have determined, based on defendant\u2019s statement to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>police, that defendant pushed Serrano down the steps and ran away, and immediately subsequent to defendant\u2019s acts, a group of people, not part of the robbery plan, attacked Serrano and inflicted the fatal blows upon him. The record is devoid of any evidence indicating that defendant\u2019s intent was to act in concert with a group of people in the commission of a robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">As we have noted, the jury charge must \u201cfairly set[ ] forth the controlling legal principles <em>relevant to the facts of the case </em>[,]\u201d <em>LaBrutto, supra, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>at 204, 558 A.2d 335 (emphasis added), and the judge must \u201crelate the law to the facts of a case____\u201d <em>Savage, supra, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>at 389, 799 A.2d 477. Here, the jury charge did not address the possibility that volitional acts by other persons could break the causal chain, which linked defendant to Serrano\u2019s murder, despite the inclusion of such instructions in the Model Jury Charge. <em>See Martin, supra, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>at 32, 573 A.2d 1359 (\u201cThe court should instruct the jury that the defendant, whether a sole perpetrator or an accomplice, is liable for felony murder only if the death is not too remote, accidental in its occurrence, or too dependent on another\u2019s volitional act to have a just bearing on the defendant\u2019s culpability.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">Although the judge instructed the jury that it may not find defendant guilty if \u201cthe death of Mr. Serrano oceur[red] in ... an unexpected or unusual manner,\u201d the judge should have instructed the jury specifically regarding the effect of volitional acts by third parties, which may break the causal chain. The judge\u2019s instructions were generally correct but were not specifically tailored to address one of defendant\u2019s principal defenses. Moreover, \u201cclearly erroneous instructions usually are considered poor candidates for rehabilitation under the harmless error philosophy.\u201d <em>State v. Feaster, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>1, 45, 716 A.2d 395 (1998) (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">The judge\u2019s omission may have led the jury to a result it would not have otherwise reached and was plain error. The jury charge was confusing as to the law of causation as it related to the facts of this case, and the judge faded to specifically instruct the jury as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>this critical issue. <em>See Martin, supra, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>at 32, 573 A.2d 1359.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Although we find the judge erred in his causation charge, we also address defendant\u2019s contention regarding the jury-charge as to \u201cattempt\u201d in the event of retrial. In pertinent part, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-1, Criminal Attempt, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\">a. A person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, acting -with the kind of culpability otherwise required for commission of the crime, he:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-8\">(3) Purposely does ... anything which, under the circumstances as a reasonable person would believe them to be, is an act ... constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in his commission of the crime, b. Conduct which may be held substantial step under subsection a. (3). Conduct shall not be held to constitute a substantial step under subsection a. (3) of this section unless it is strongly corroborative of the actor\u2019s criminal purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-9\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>2C:5-l(a)(3), (b).l</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">\u201cAn attempt must be purposive; no lesser mental state will suffice.\u201d Cannel, <em>New Jersey Criminal Code Annotated, </em>comment 3 on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-1 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-11\">The State acknowledges that defendant\u2019s participation in the robbery \u201cwas limited to the attempt phase.\u201d The State was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant attempted to aid the \u201cdude\u201d in the commission of the robbery. In charging the jury on robbery, the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-12\">Now, the first crime that is charged in the indictment is the crime of robbery in the first degree and the law that this charge is based on is pretty straightforward. It says a person is guilty of robbery in the first degree if in the course of committing a theft he purposely inflicts serious bodily injury upon another. Okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-13\">So in order for you to find the defendant guilty of robbery in the first degree the State has to prove to you beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was in the course of committing a theft, and, two, that while in the course of committing a theft he purposely inflicted serious bodily injury upon Francisco Urbina Serrano.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-14\">So the first element that the State has to prove is that the defendant was in the course of committing a theft. Now, in this connection we say that someone is in the course of committing a theft if the act occurs in an attempt to commit the theft, during the commission of the theft or in an attempt or an immediate flight after the attempted commission. Okay? So in the course of committing a theft means in an attempt to commit the theft, during the commission of the theft and in the immediate flight after its attempted commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>And theft is defined as the unlawful taking or exercise of unlawful control over the property of another with the purpose to deprive him thereof. Okay?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">The judge did not define \u201cattempt\u201d for the jury, although the Model Jury Charge for first-degree robbery specifically instructs that \u201c[i]f attempt is involved, [the judge must] define attempt.\u201d <em>Model Jury Charge (Criminal), </em>Robbery in the First Degree (Rev. July 2, 2009). Consequently, the judge did not explain (1) that attempt requires purposeful acts (\u201cpurposeful conduct\u201d element); (2) that defendant must have had the culpability otherwise required for commission of the crime (\u201cculpability\u201d element); nor, (3) as is pertinent to this ease, that defendant must have taken a \u201csubstantial step\u201d in the commission of the offense (\u201csubstantial step\u201d element).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">However, the judge also charged the jury regarding accomplice liability; he instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-8\">Now, in order to be an accomplice under our law the State must prove each of the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt: Number one, the State must prove that it was the defendant\u2019s purpose to promote or facilitate the commission of the robbery ... of Francisco Urbina Serrano.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-9\">Okay. So the State must prove to start off that it was the defendant\u2019s purpose or conscious object to assist in the robbery of Francisco Serrano____[Tjhe State must prove that the defendant possessed the same criminal state of mind that is required to be proved against the persons who actually committed the crimes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-12\">... [Y]ou must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he did have a conscious object or an intention to promote or facilitate or help out in the robbery and that he did in fact help out in the robbery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-13\">In other words, the jury was instructed that it could not convict defendant unless it was convinced, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant\u2019s purpose was to aid another person rob Serrano and that defendant shared the same mental state as the \u201cdude.\u201d Given this instruction, we find that the judge\u2019s failure to instruct the jury as to the \u201cpurposeful conduct\u201d element and \u201cculpability\u201d element of attempt was harmless error, as the jury clearly determined that defendant possessed the required culpability and acted purposefully as an accomplice in the commission of the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>The accomplice charge does not, however, address the \u201csubstantial step\u201d element of attempt. To satisfy this element, \u201cthe step taken must strongly show the defendant\u2019s criminal purpose. That is, the step taken must be substantial and not just a very remote preparatory act, and must show that the accused has a firmness of criminal purpose.\u201d <em>Model Jury Charge (Criminal), </em>Attempt (Rev. June 15, 2009). \u201cThese steps may be mere preparation; only very remote preparatory acts cannot amount to an attempt____[T]hat substantial additional steps were required for completion of the plan is irrelevant.\u201d Cannel, <em>supra, </em>comment 6 on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">The Supreme Court has noted that \u201cthere is an especially close link between the criminal-purpose and substantial-step requirements.\u201d <em>State v. Perez, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>540, 554, 832 A.2d 303 (2003). We must consider \u201cdefendant\u2019s words and acts in tandem as part of the whole picture from which the jury could have drawn its inferences.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(holding, where defendant was convicted of attempt to commit child endangerment, that defendant\u2019s acts\u2014 including offering a thirteen-year old victim a ride and calling her to his car\u2014amounted to a substantial step, especially where the \u201cjurors were permitted to use common experience to interpret defendant\u2019s words [to the police] to determine his intent\u201d). And as we have previously noted, any finding of plain error in the jury charge depends on an evaluation of the overall strength of the State\u2019s case. <em>See Cotto, supra, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>at 327, 865 A.2d 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">Here, defendant stated that the plan was to push Serrano down into the alleyway so that the other individual could rob him. Defendant also acknowledged in his statement to the police, which defendant did not contradict at trial, that he pushed Serrano down the alley. Defendant only claimed that he lacked the required mental state, a defense which, as we have noted, the jury rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">Defendant, in effect, admitted to committing one of the elements of robbery\u2014\u201c[i]nflict[ing] bodily injury or us[ing] force upon another[,]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-l(a)(l)\u2014and the jury found that he did so as an accomplice, with the conscious object to assist in the robbery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>of Serrano and with the requisite state of mind \u201cthat is required to be proved against the persons who actually committed the crimes.\u201d Defendant\u2019s undisputed conduct was unmistakably beyond the stage of mere preparation and was a substantial step in the commission of the offense, as planned by the other individual. Therefore, while the judge\u2019s failure to charge the jury with attempt was in error, this error was not sufficient to lead the jury to a result it would not have otherwise reached. <em>R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">We faced a similar issue in <em>State v. Gonzalez, </em>where we determined that the failure to define \u201cattempt in the predicate offense of robbery, and its specific component, \u2018substantial step,\u2019 N.J.S.A 2C:5-1 b, constitute^] plain error.\u201d 318 <em>N.J.Super. </em>527, 536, 723 A.2d 1278 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>148, 735 A.2d 573 (1999), <em>abrogated on other grounds by State v. Hill, </em>199 <em>N.J. </em>545, 565-66, 974 A.2d 403 (2009). However, in that case, we determined that defendant\u2019s actual conduct in the commission of the attempted robbery was \u201csimply unknown.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 534, 723 A.2d 1278. There were several conflicting versions of the attempted robbery, and, based on defendant\u2019s inculpatory statement, defendant was arguably \u201cattempting to commit a <em>theft </em>from the victim\u2019s person[ ]\u201d when defendant commenced his criminal conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 535, 723 A.2d 1278 (emphasis added). Theft, however, is not a predicate offense for felony murder. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-3(a)(3). It was largely because defendant\u2019s actions were unknown and may not have constituted attempted robbery that we held that the failure to charge the jury with attempt constituted plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Here, as noted, the plan was for defendant to push Serrano down the alleyway steps so the other individual could be alone with Serrano and rob him, and defendant admitted pushing Serrano down the steps. This satisfied the force or bodily injury requirement for robbery, and defendant\u2019s conduct, by defendant\u2019s own admission, was a substantial step in the commission of the attempted robbery. It is irrelevant that the there were several more steps to be taken to complete the robbery; defendant\u2019s admitted conduct went beyond mere preparation.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Defendant further claims the judge committed an error in illustrating the affirmative defense to felony murder. After explaining the definition of \u201cprobable consequence,\u201d the judge then illustrated the affirmative defense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-6\">As an example, what if three or four men decided\u2014had a plan that they were going to unlawfully enter an unoccupied store in the middle of the night and they had decided that there was not going to be any violence\u2014right?\u2014they were just going to commit a nighttime burglary in an unoccupied store. All right? And one person\u2019s role is to stay in the car and wait. No weapons are carried. Nobody talks about any violence. They don\u2019t expect to see anybody in that store. They go in the store and then there\u2019s a security guard there who ends up having a scuffle with one of the perpetrators dies from a heart attack let\u2019s say. The guy waiting in the car would assert this affirmative defense saying, number one, I had nothing to do with the act that caused the death; number two, I never dreamed anybody else was going to engage in any violence, nobody had a weapon, the plan was to commit a non-violent felony, and so even though there was a burglary and a death was caused during the burglary it\u2019s not fair to hold me responsible. Okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-7\">And again, as I explained, all four of those factors have to be satisfied, that the defendant did not commit the homicidal act or in any way cause or aid in the commission. But what we mean by the homicidal act is the act that cause the death. Okay? So right off the bat in order to satisfy that affirmative defense the defendant\u2014the State has to\u2014the defendant has to satisfy that element which says that he did not commit the homicidal act or assist in the nature of the homicidal act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">Defendant now argues that \u201c[t]his example gave the impression that ... there must be (a) a non-violent felony; (b) an explicit agreement to avoid violence; (c) a freakish death; and (d) defendant far removed from the action.\u201d Defendant also claims that the judge \u201cconfus[ed] the affirmative defense with the probable consequence test.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">The felony murder statute delineates an affirmative defense for any prosecution wherein the defendant was not the only participant in the underlying crime and:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-10\">(a) Did not commit the homicidal act or in any way solicit, request, command, importune, cause or aid the commission thereof; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-11\">(b) Was not armed with a deadly weapon, or any instrument, article or substance readily capable of causing death or serious physical injury and of a sort not ordinarily carried in public places by law-abiding persons; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-12\">(e) Had no reasonable ground to believe that any other participant was armed with such a weapon, instrument, article or substance; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>(d) Had no reasonable ground to believe that any other participant intended to engage in conduct likely to result in death or serious physical injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-7\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11\u20143(a)(3).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">The judge\u2019s illustration did not conflate the affirmative defense with causation. The judge had already discussed the causation element of felony murder, and this illustration was only in reference to the affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">While illustrations in jury charges can mislead, rather than help the jury, because they have a tendency to be too simplistic and to imply a too restricted understanding of the law, this illustration accurately conveyed the affirmative defense to the jury. The judge explained that defendant must not have \u201chad nothing to do with the act that caused the death[,]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11\u20143(a)(3)(a); that defendant did not have a weapon,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:11\u20143(a)(3)(b); and the intent and preset plan was to commit a non-violent felony. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>2C: 11\u20143(a)(3)(b). We find no error here.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">Defendant next argues that his conviction for felony murder should be reversed because his acquittal of first degree robbery, aggravated manslaughter and reckless manslaughter compels the conclusion that the jury found that the causation element was not satisfied. Defendant did not raise this objection below, and so we analyze it under the plain error standard. <em>R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">We find there was no error, much less plain error, in the jury\u2019s verdict. The jury could have determined that defendant\u2019s acts did not rise to the level of recklessness, but defendant aided in the robbery by pushing Serrano down the steps. This is sufficient to overcome the affirmative defense, an element of which is that the defendant must not have \u201caid[ed] the commission\u201d of the homicidal act.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Defendant also claims that the judge committed reversible error by denying defendant\u2019s request to charge the jury with aggravated assault and simple assault as lesser included offenses to robbery. Defendant requested the simple assault charge at trial, and we must therefore determine whether there was a \u201crational basis\u201d for the lesser-included charge. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-8(e). Defendant did not, however, request the aggravated assault charge, and we review the judge\u2019s conduct under plain error standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">In <em>Cassady, supra, </em>the Supreme Court noted that \u201c \u2018whether an included offense charge is appropriate requires (1) that the requested charge satisfy the definition of an included offense set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-8(d), and (2) that there be a rational basis in the evidence to support a charge on that included offense.\u2019 \u201d 198 <em>N.J. </em>at 178, 966 A.2d 473 (quoting <em>State v. Thomas, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>119, 131, 900 A.2d 797 (2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">However, when, as in this case, defendant requested a lesser-included offense charge, \u201cwhether the lesser offense is strictly \u2018included\u2019 in the greater offense ... is less important ... than whether the evidence presents a rational basis on which the jury could acquit the defendant of the greater charge and convict the defendant of the lesser.\u201d <em>State v. Brent, </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>107, 117, 644 A.2d 583 (1994); <em>see Cassady, supra, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>at 178, 966 A.2d 473. \u201c[S]heer speculation does not constitute a rational basis.\u201d <em>Brent, supra, </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>at 117, 644 A.2d 583. In <em>Cassady, supra, </em>for example, the Court found no rational basis to support defendant\u2019s requested theft charge as a lesser-included offense of robbery, where</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-9\">defendant entered a bank; he spoke menacingly to a teller, demanding money; when the teller failed to hand over the money, defendant vaulted a bullet-proof glass partition, landing on the inside portion of the teller\u2019s counter where the teller stood in front of her cash drawer; defendant then began \u201cpulling the [cash] drawer\u201d where the teller stood and, fearing for her life, she fled; defendant took the money in the teller\u2019s drawer, jumped back over the bullet-proof glass partition, and escaped.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>[ 198 <em>N.J. </em>at 178, 966 A2d 473 ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">The Court concluded that \u201cto claim that defendant\u2019s actions in this case merely constituted a theft improperly minimizes defendant\u2019s conduct and wrongfully belittles its import and consequences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 179, 966 A 2d 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">There is no rational basis in the evidence to charge defendant with either aggravated or simple assault. Defendant stated, in his admission to the police, that he attacked Serrano because he was aiding in a robbery; no other explanation was offered at trial to explain defendant\u2019s conduct. Although defendant stated that he did not intend to partake in the ill-gotten gains of the robbery, he nonetheless admitted to pushing Serrano for the sole purpose of aiding in the commission of the robbery. Accordingly, to argue that defendant\u2019s conduct might have simply constituted assault or aggravated assault is to ignore the record developed at trial and speculate as to defendant\u2019s motives.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">Defendant next argues that the judge erred in admitting his statement to the police at trial, which he asserts was the product of an unlawful arrest without probable cause. We reject defendant\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">We defer to the trial judge\u2019s factual findings so long as those findings are \u201csupported by sufficient credible evidence in the record.\u201d <em>State v. Elders, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>224, 243, 927 A.2d 1250 (2007) (citations omitted). We further owe deference to the trial judge\u2019s decisions \u201csubstantially influenced by his opportunity to hear and see the witnesses and to have the \u2018feel\u2019 of the ease, which a reviewing court cannot enjoy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 244, 927 A.2d 1250 (citations omitted). \u201cA trial court\u2019s findings should be disturbed only if they are so clearly mistaken that the interests of justice demand intervention and correction.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citations and quotations omitted). However, \u201c \u2018[a] trial court\u2019s interpretation of the law and the legal consequences that flow from established facts are not entitled to any special deference.\u2019 \u201d <em>Zabilowicz v.

A juvenile must be questioned in the \u201cpresence of the juvenile\u2019s parents or guardians, even if the juvenile waives the <em>Miranda </em>rights.\u201d <em>State in Interest of J.F., </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>89, 98, 668 A.2d 426 (App.Div.1995). The State must demonstrate that the totality of the circumstances establishes that the \u201c \u2018accused\u2019s will was not overborne and that the confession was the product of a free choice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98, 668 A.2d 426 (quoting <em>State in Interest of S.H., </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>108, 114-16, 293 A.2d 181 (1972)). \u201c \u2018[T]he root of the inquiry is whether [the juvenile\u2019s] will has been overborne by police conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Q.N., </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>165, 172, 843 A.2d 1140 (2004) (quoting <em>State v. Presha, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>304, 313, 748 A.2d 1108 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Defendant claims that his statements were not voluntary because his mother was not informed of the reasons that defendant was being detained, and defendant was not permitted to speak to his mother. However, the record reflects otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">The trial judge noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>[TJhis defendant is not a 14-year old child or a 15-year old child. The defendant was a 17-year old articulate individual who spoke English very well and based upon his demeanor with the officers was very, very calm and very\u2014quite willing to speak and said that he knew why he was there. Okay? The police were courteous, they did not in any way coerce him, and indeed they very shortly thereafter did make the best efforts that they can make to advise Miss Tejada as to what was going on.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The judge further noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-6\">I\u2019m also satisfied that his mother was present, they had made arrangements for her to be present, they made a good-faith effort to tell her, you know, what was going on, although they could have done it a little better and a little sooner, but I don\u2019t think that that fact negates the voluntariness under the totality of circumstances of his statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">Again, we defer to the trial judge\u2019s factual findings when, as in this ease, they are supported by sufficient credible evidence in the record. <em>See Elders, supra, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>at 243, 927 A.2d 1250.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">Defendant spoke to his mother throughout the interview, and the police informed his mother, prior to coming to the police station, that defendant needed to be questioned. The entire interview was translated for defendant\u2019s mother as defendant spoke. She also unequivocally supported the police officer\u2019s questioning of her son. Although the police could have informed defendant\u2019s mother sooner, she was present in the room during the questioning and was unmistakably involved. There is no basis to disrupt the trial judge\u2019s findings that defendant\u2019s statements were made voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">Defendant next claims that the judge prejudged defendant\u2019s claims during his motion to suppress, which should have prompted the judge\u2019s recusal pursuant to <em>Rule </em>1:12-1. Defendant also argues that the judge unnecessarily intervened in the proceedings and undermined defendant\u2019s defense, which prejudiced defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. We address defendant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">Defendant first asserts that he did not receive a fair hearing during his motion to suppress because the \u201ctrial court made determinations of disputed tacts before hearing all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>evidence.\u201d Specifically, at the suppression hearing, the issue was whether defendant was under arrest when removed from his parents\u2019 house; whether there was probable cause for the alleged arrest; and whether his statements were voluntary. Following the presentation of the State\u2019s witnesses, the judge indicated, off the record, that he was leaning toward finding that defendant was not under arrest, and that there was probable cause for the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Defendant objected to the judge\u2019s off-hand comments, and the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-7\">And I\u2019ve heard testimony now that convinces me that I\u2019ve heard enough to make a ruling in the case. You don\u2019t even know what my ruling is because I haven\u2019t announced it fully yet, but I am satisfied that the one argument that you have made that there was no probable cause to arrest the defendant is simply without merit. <em>I\u2019ve heard testimony that there was an eyewitness identification of the defendant by one witness and that other mtnesses corroborated that this victim was, you know, assaulted and ultimately died, and I am satisfied that there was probable cause and there is nothing that Detective Blount can say that will change that.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-8\">Now, you know, you have to put on the record whatever you think is appropriate, and I respect your right to do so, but the bottom line is I disagree with you that I am required to hear any and all witnesses that counsel choose to provide in oral argument when I\u2019ve heard what I have\u2014what I deem to be sufficient to resolve the motion that\u2019s before the Court and that\u2019s what I heard with respect to the one issue, so you could\u2014frankly, I don\u2019t need\u2014in my view I don\u2019t need to let you call this witness. You know, whether even you have oral argument is\u2014is perhaps unnecessary in some cases, right? In this case you\u2019ve been granted oral argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-9\">There were certain factual issues that had to get resolved by the Court and I am satisfied from the testimony of Sergeant Scott that there was probable cause. That\u2019s a legal conclusion, by the way, not a factual one completely, <em>but if you want to call Detective Blount because you think somehow that will clarify the record you\u2019re more than willing to do so.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-10\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">Defendant then presented his witnesses in support of the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-12\">We conclude that the judge did not \u201cprejudge\u201d the merits of defendant\u2019s motion. The record reflects that the statements were made <em>after </em>hearing the State\u2019s witnesses, and at that point, the judge was presented with sufficient credible evidence to make a ruling on the motion. Moreover, defendant was not barred from presenting his own witnesses on the matter. Even if the judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>statements were in error, defendant was not prejudiced, as defendant presented no compelling evidence to support his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Defendant next asserts that the \u201ctrial court repeatedly intervened in the proceedings to the detriment of the appearance of impartiality.\u201d The first alleged instance of impartiality followed defendant\u2019s opening, wherein his counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-6\">So when you\u2019re looking at all this evidence keep in mind that\u2019s an innocent man there until the State proves his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and they have to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt of all the elements of these crimes that he\u2019s been charged with. That\u2019s what\u2019s required in a criminal case. It\u2019s the toughest standard, the hardest standard in our legal system, and it should be. <em>It should be especially in a case where a mart, a young kid, is facing a murder charge. I don\u2019t have to tell you the consequence of a conviction on a murder charge, </em>so if there\u2019s any doubt and that doubt is reasonable you owe it to the oath you took on the Bible to find him not guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-7\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">After defense counsel completed his opening remarks, the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-9\">Ladies and gentlemen, I did want to just mention to you at this point in time that in his opening [defense counsel] made some comments to you about the possible punishment or the impact that a conviction would have on the defendant. I want you to understand that under our law you are not to consider the issue of punishment. Under our law you must decide whether the State has proven the defendant\u2019s guilty of any of the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. All right? If you find the defendant not guilty of course that\u2019s the end of the case. If you find the defendant guilty of any charge it\u2019s the Court\u2019s responsibility under the law to determine what the appropriate punishment or consequence should be. So throughout this trial I\u2019m going to ask you to focus on the evidence that you hear and relate it to the law that I explain to you and make your determination only as to whether the State has proven the defendant guilty of any of the crimes charged beyond a reasonable doubt. The issue of consequence or punishment is for the Court to decide so please keep that in mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-10\">[Defense counsel], I will ask you in future arguments to the jury not to raise those issues.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-11\">\u201cNew Jersey juries do not consider the punishments attendant to offenses in deciding guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>State v. Short, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>47, 59-60, 618 A.2d 316 (1993) (citing <em>State v. Conforti, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>239, 244-45, 250 A.2d 6 (1969) (noting that in making its determination, \u201cthe jury should not be influenced by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>consideration of what will be the result of its verdict, nor should its attention be distracted from its chief function\u201d) (quoting <em>State v. Bell, </em>102 <em>N.J.Super. </em>70, 75-76, 245 A.2d 370 (1968), <em>certif. denied, </em>52 <em>N.J. </em>485, 246 A.2d 447 (1968) (citations omitted))). Defense counsel\u2019s opening remarks were intended to sway the jury by having them consider the fact that defendant was a \u201cyoung man,\u201d and that a conviction would have a severe impact on defendant\u2019s future. Defense counsel\u2019s remarks were in error, and the judge\u2019s correction was appropriate. The judge did not make \u201c \u2018remarks that might prejudice a party or which are calculated to influence the minds of the jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>D.G. ex rel. J.G. v. North Plainfield Bd. of Educ., </em>400 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 25, 945 A.2d 707 (App.Div.) (quoting <em>Cestero v. Ferrara, </em>110 <em>N.J.Super. </em>264, 273, 265 A.2d 387 (App.Div.1970), <em>aff'd, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>497, 273 A.2d 761 (1971)), <em>certif. denied, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>346, 953 A.2d 764, <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 <em>S.Ct. </em>776, 172 L.Ed.2d 756 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Defendant next argues that during the judge\u2019s final charge he made an unnecessary comment about defense counsel\u2019s closing. During defense counsel\u2019s closing he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-7\">Also finally I want to thank my client\u2019s family who have been in court here today, every day, have been supporting Jesse and myself throughout the beginning of this ordeal and I appreciate their trust and their faith in me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">The judge then made the following relevant comment in his jury instruction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-9\">[Y]ou may recall that [defense counsel] made some mention of the fact that the defendant has family members in court. That is none of your consideration. All right? You should not be influenced by anything that\u2019s happening in the courtroom other than the presentation of evidence. That is extremely important. Many times during the course of a trial there are spectators in the courtroom that feel very strongly one way or another about the outcome of the trial. That should not in any way be considered by a jury. Okay? You consider this case based on the evidence and the law as I explain it to you and you should not be influenced by the fact that there are or there are not spectators in the courtroom. Just like I told you at the beginning of the case, avoid any media coverage, avoid any information about this case that doesn\u2019t come to you from the witness stand. So that\u2019s an important point of view.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">This instruction was entirely appropriate. Defense counsel\u2019s comments were calculated to improperly garner jury sympathy by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>noting that defendant had a supportive family. The judge was correct in instructing the jury that it may only consider facts presented in trial, not the presence of spectators in the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Defendant also claims that the judge demonstrated bias by classifying certain of defendant\u2019s questions as \u201cinappropriate,\u201d rather than \u201cinadmissible\u201d or \u201cirrelevant.\u201d We have reviewed the two instances cited by defendant, and we conclude that defendant\u2019s arguments are insufficient to warrant extended discussion. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2). However, we note the judge\u2019s comments were not prejudicial, and the judge, in one instance, rebuked the prosecutor for improper conduct. Moreover, we are satisfied that it was \u201cthe weight of the evidence, particularly the damning statements uttered by defendant himself, that led to [defendant\u2019s felony] murder conviction rather than the [judge]\u2019s [allegedly] improper comments____\u201d <em>State v. Timmendequas, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>515, 596, 737 A.2d 55 (1999) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">Defendant also claims that the judge committed prejudicial error when defendant cross-examined the State\u2019s medical examiner. During a lull in defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-8\">THE COURT: [Defense counselJ, while you\u2019re checking your notes I just have a question for Dr. DiCarlo, but you can check your notes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-9\">Doctor, in forming your opinion did you consider whether the victim may have received the first blunt trauma injury by, you know, landing on the steps and then sort of bouncing off the steps and landing on the sidewalk for the second one? Did you consider that at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-10\">THE WITNESS: I thought of that scenario, but I ruled that\u2014ruled that out because if he hit the steps and then the second injury was him just bouncing another foot or two the force in which he then hit the bottom of the steps would be considerable less and it would be more difficult to get these injuries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-11\">Following the judge\u2019s question, defendant then continued with his cross-examination. Defendant did not object to the judge\u2019s question but now claims that this question prejudiced him because \u201cthe question may have influenced jurors to attach weight to that scenario.\u201d This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>The Supreme Court recently recognized that \u201cjudges may question witnesses to clarify testimony, expedite a case, and otherwise protect the proceedings. But in exercising their discretionary power, judges must take care not to influence the jury by signaling doubt about a witness\u2019s credibility.\u201d <em>State v. Taffaro, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>442, 445, 950 A.2d 860 (2008). Here, the judge asked a single question to the medical examiner, and defendant did not object to the judge\u2019s statements at the time of trial. Furthermore, defendant\u2019s case was strengthened by the medical examiner\u2019s answer, because it supported a finding that Serrano did not receive the second trauma as a result of the fall, but from some other impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">We find no error here.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">Finally, defendant argues that the judge erred by not permitting him to introduce testimony from Officer Contreras that Serrano\u2019s friend, Morales, identified someone other than defendant following the attack. Defendant sought to introduce Morales\u2019s statement as an exception to the rule against hearsay, either as a present sense impression or an excited utterance. According to defendant, Morales identified another individual, not defendant, as the person who struck Serrano and pushed him down the steps.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">Officer Contreras arrived at the scene of the attack on Serrano within a minute after he was called and spoke to Morales \u201cthree to four minutes\u201d after arriving at the scene. Contreras described Morales\u2019s behavior as \u201cconcerned and confused\u201d and stated that he did not notice anything unusual about Morales.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">The judge concluded that the officer\u2019s testimony as to Morales\u2019s statements was not covered by any hearsay exception. He noted: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>He also concluded that there was no evidence that Morales was startled or that this statement was made immediately after perceiving the event. This statement was neither a present sense impression nor an excited utterance.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>[T]his is simply a case where a police officer responds to a scene conducting a preliminary investigation and then a witness provides a narrative statement to the police officer about what he perceived. Obviously, such a statement cannot be made admissible or in almost every criminal trial then there would be, you know, an attempt to allow this type of testimony without appropriate cross-examination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>On appeal, defendant argues that this statement should have been admitted as an excited utterance. We review a trial judge\u2019s evidentiary determinations under an abuse of discretion standard, provided that the judge\u2019s rulings are not inconsistent with applicable law. <em>State v. Buda, 195 N.J. </em>278, 294, 949 A.2d 761 (2008) (citing <em>Hisenaj v. Kuehner, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>6, 12, 942 A.2d 769 (2008)); Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment 4.6 on <em>R. </em>2:10-2 (2010). An abuse of discretion only arises on demonstration of \u201cmanifest error or injustice.\u201d <em>Hisenaj, supra, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>at 20, 942 A.2d 769 (citations omitted). An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial judge\u2019s \u201cdecision [was] made without a rational explanation, inexplicably departed from established policies, or rested on an impermissible basis.\u201d <em>United, States v. Scurry, </em>193 <em>N.J. </em>492, 504, 940 A.2d 1164 (2008) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\"><em>\u201cN.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(2) defines an excited utterance as 1) \u2018[a] statement relating to a startling event or condition\u2019; 2) \u2018made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition\u2019; and 3) \u2018without opportunity to deliberate or fabricate.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. J.A., </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>324, 340, 949 A.2d 790 (2008). There are several pertinent factors to weigh in determining whether a statement was an excited utterance, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-7\">(1) the amount of time that transpired between the initial observation of the event and the subsequent declaration of the statement; (2) the circumstances of the event; (3) the mental or physical condition of the declarant; (4) the shock produced; (5) nature of the statement; and (6) whether the statement was made voluntarily or in response to a question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-8\"><em>[Buda, supra, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>at 294, 949 A.2d 761 (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">In <em>J.A., supra, </em>for instance, the judge concluded that the \u201crobbery of a woman who is knocked to the ground and whose purse is wrested from her as she cries out is clearly a \u2018startling event\u2019 under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(2), and that the witness\u2019s statement related to that event.\u201d 195 <em>N.J. </em>at 340, 949 A.2d 790. Furthermore, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>witness, who followed the attackers for a number of blocks and waited a few minutes before making a statement to the police, was without \u201copportunity to deliberate or fabricate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 340-41, 949 A 2d 790. However, there was no evidence of the witness\u2019s appearance or condition, such as whether he was in an anxious or calm state when relating the events, and it was an error for this judge to make an assumption that the witness would have been in an excited state after observing a robbery and pursuing the robbers. \u201c[FJacts should have been elicited on the record to support such a finding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 341, 949 A2d 790.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Nothing in the record supports the conclusion that Morales was \u201cunder the stress of excitement\u201d when making his statements to Officer Contreras; rather, Morales appeared \u201cconcerned and confused.\u201d Furthermore, the trial judge concluded that too much time had passed between the time Morales witnessed the presumably exciting event and the time he made the statement\u2014at least four to five minutes. We conclude that the judge\u2019s decision did not amount to an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">With regard to defendant\u2019s claims that cumulative errors prejudiced defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial, that the judgment of conviction is erroneous and that his conviction was against the weight of the evidence, we conclude that these arguments are without sufficient merit to warrant extended discussion. <em>R. </em>2:11\u2014 3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">Defendant\u2019s convictions for robbery and aggravated assault are affirmed. However, defendant\u2019s felony murder conviction is reversed, and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b88-13\"> <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>436, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
