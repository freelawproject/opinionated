Lott, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:ll-3(a)(l) and/or (2); second-degree burglary, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:18-2; first-degree felony-murder of Lott, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:ll-3(a)(3); and third-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-4(d).

After merging the weapon offense into the murder conviction, the judge sentenced defendant to life imprisonment with an 85% period of parole ineligibility pursuant to the No Early Release Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2, and a concurrent eighteen-month sentence on the trespass conviction. On appeal, defendant raises the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">\n<em>POINT ONE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">THE ADMISSION OF EXTENSIVE PRIOR BAD-ACTS EVIDENCE AND THE COURT\u2019S FAILURE TO PROVIDE A LIMITING INSTRUCTION DEPRIVED DEFENDANT OF HIS RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">\n<em>POINT TWO</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">THE TRIAL JUDGE\u2019S REFUSAL TO MORE SPECIFICALLY INSTRUCT THE JURY THAT A CONTINUING COURSE OF ILL TREATMENT COULD PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR A VERDICT OF PASSION/PROVOCATION MANSLAUGHTER VIOLATED DEFENDANT OF HIS RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL.</p>\n<p id=\"AJ8\">\n<em>POINT THREE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT DEPRIVED DEFENDANT OF HIS RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL.

THESE FLAWED COUNTS ESTABLISHED A DEFECTIVE PLEA OFFER BY THE STATE. AT TRIAL, THEY IMPERMISSIBLY SHIFTED THE ATTENTION OF THE JURY TO IRRELEVANT AND ERRONEOUS LEGAL CONCEPTS INSTEAD OF CONSIDERING THE MURDER OR PASSION/PROVOCATION ISSUE.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">We have considered these arguments in light of the record and applicable legal standards. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">At approximately 10:00 p.m. in the evening of September 24, 2004, Virginia \u201cGina\u201d Liotta returned to the home she shared with her two young sons and her sixty-seven year old mother, Elizabeth J. Lott, in Wantage. Lott was a professor of economics at Pace University in New York and in very poor health. The house, described by the prosecutor as Lott\u2019s \u201cdream home,\u201d was situated on forty acres and quite isolated from other homes in the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">Along with her sons, Liotta had been out to dinner at her uncle\u2019s home in Totowa. Upon returning home, the sliding door to the family room was unlocked as it usually was. Liotta entered and found her mother \u201clying ... on the floor, face down[,]\u201d surrounded by blood, with a wooden, folding tray table on top of her. Her thick eyeglasses were broken and lay on the floor near her body. Liotta called 9-1-1 and emergency medical personnel arrived at the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">A neighbor, Jill Shrope, saw the emergency vehicles and went to Lott\u2019s house. She took Liotta\u2019s older son, who was six, back to her house, called defendant at the Fone Booth Bar and Restaurant (the Fone Booth) where he worked as a bartender, and told him to come to her house. Defendant arrived at Shrope\u2019s house approximately twenty minutes later.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">Defendant and Liotta were involved in a tumultuous, twelve-year romantic relationship, and he was the father of her two sons. He had recently been hired by the Fone Booth, having worked in the past as an automobile mechanic, a male dancer, and a personal trainer. He was in excellent physical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Lott did not care for defendant and limited his visits to her home to only two days per week so that defendant could see his sons. The acrimony between defendant and Lott, and the reasons for it, were the subject of much testimony at trial, and we examine that evidence in further detail below.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Investigators arrived at the crime scene, processed it, and secured various items for analysis. There were no signs of forced entry at the Lott home, nothing appeared to have been stolen, and there was no evidence of a sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">Liotta and defendant went to the local police department with Detective Sergeant Donald Peter of the Sussex County Prosecutor\u2019s Office. Peter called the Fone Booth, and confirmed that defendant had worked there during the evening, but that he had left \u201cfor a period of time\u201d claiming to be ill. Detective Virgil Rome, Jr., of the Prosecutor\u2019s Office went to the Fone Booth and secured the videotape from surveillance cameras at the bar parking lot. It revealed that defendant arrived for work at 6:01 p.m., left the premises at 7:51 p.m., and returned at 9:00 p.m., ample time for defendant to have gone to Lott\u2019s home, kill her, and return.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">At trial, defendant\u2019s fellow employees and a patron at the bar testified that he did not appear to be ill on the evening of September 24, but claimed that he was. Defendant left the bar for some time. When he returned, he was disheveled, sweaty, and his eyes were bloodshot. Although .he apologized for leaving in the middle of his shift, the manager fired him. Defendant remained in the bar, however, and ordered some food; he appeared nervous, was pacing, and repeatedly went to the men\u2019s room, leaving the bar after receiving a phone call.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">Investigators questioned defendant after advising him of his Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rights. Defendant denied killing Lott, though he admitted his relationship with her was not good. Defendant also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>initially denied leaving the bar at all, but subsequently told the police that he had left for twenty minutes to get some air. When confronted with his fellow employees\u2019 statements that he was gone for more than one hour, defendant admitted it might have been longer than twenty minutes but that \u201che absolutely never left the parking lot\u201d of the Fone Booth. The investigators collected defendant\u2019s shoes and clothing, as well as DNA samples. Defendant\u2019s shoe tested positive for the presence of Lott\u2019s blood. Defendant was arrested on September 29 and charged with her murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">At trial, the State introduced forensic evidence that the blood on defendant\u2019s shoe resulted from impact splatter and that defendant had been standing within ten feet of the blood source at the time. Lott was likely struck with the folding table when she was in a horizontal position. The medical examiner opined that Lott died from blunt impact trauma to her skull and brain, having sustained a skull fracture to her right side that was likely fatal and caused by significant force.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Alan Casey, a jailhouse informant, testified that defendant told him while both were incarcerated in the Sussex County jail that he went to Lott\u2019s house with the intention of killing her. Defendant professed his love for Liotta and the children, and that he wanted to five with them, but told Casey \u201cthe only way for it to happen was for [Lott] to not be there.\u201d Casey claimed defendant knew Lott would be alone in her home on the night of September 24 because he had earlier spoken to Liotta by phone. Indeed, in her testimony, Liotta corroborated a phone conversation with defendant had occurred earlier in the evening. Defendant told Casey that when he appeared at Lott\u2019s home the night of the murder, and she threatened to call the police, he \u201csnapped,\u201d pushed her to the ground, and hit her with the folding table.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">Defendant testified on his own behalf. It suffices to say that defendant admitted killing Lott, but claimed he did so in the heat of passion after she provoked him. As we note below, defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>anticipated passion/provocation defense became the central focus of the trial even before it was asserted through his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Defendant testified that he was sick on the night of the murder and left the Fone Booth, though he claimed it was with permission. He had spoken to Liotta by phone, and she was upset. Defendant believed it was due to the constant tension between her and her mother and he further thought they had argued that day. Defendant decided to go to Lott\u2019s home and speak to her about their problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Defendant saw Lott watching television through the rear sliding door. He \u201ctapped\u201d on the door and Lott let him in. However, the conversation deteriorated into a battery of insults; he called Lott \u201c[a] witch.\u201d Defendant claimed Lott came at him swinging her arms and that she picked up the folding table and swung it at him, hitting him in the left arm, causing a minor laceration. He grabbed the table from her and hit her on the head. When she fell to the ground, he hit her again and left the table on top of her. Defendant claimed that after Lott hit him with the table, \u201c[he] went into a blackout, a blur.\u201d He was enraged because Lott told him he was \u201cnot good enough for her daughter ... [his] kids, [his] sons, [and] that if it was up to her she\u2019d take [his] kids away ... and ... [he] would never see [them] again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">During cross-examination, defendant acknowledged that he had given a number of different accounts of his activities on the night of the homicide to law enforcement authorities. He also admitted that in an attempt to have his bail lowered, he had supplied a false certification in which he claimed the police had coerced him into providing a formal statement immediately after arrest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>dant never indicated in any of those prior statements, however, that Lott had threatened or hit him with the folding table.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">There was other evidence that inferentially challenged the credibility of defendant\u2019s version of the events in Lott\u2019s home. For example, when he was initially interviewed by the police, they observed no injury to his arm. Defendant also claimed that when he returned to the Fone Booth after the homicide, his frequent trips to the men\u2019s room were caused by nausea and his need to take care of the cut, but surveillance videotape did not appear to show any injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Based upon this evidence, and the additional evidence we detail below, defendant was convicted of the knowing and purposeful murder of Lott, possession of a weapon, the table, with an intent to use it unlawfully against Lott, and criminal trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">Defendant argues that \u201cextensive testimony regarding [his] prior bad acts\u201d was admitted in violation of <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b), that even if the evidence was admissible, its probative value was outweighed by it potential prejudice, <em>see N.J.R.E. </em>403, and that the judge failed to provide any instructions to the jury on the proper use of such testimony. Defendant identifies this evidence as follows: \u201cthe fact that defendant had neglected his son, had been unfaithful to his girlfriend, had been employed as a male stripper, had amassed substantial credit card debt, and had forged his son\u2019s name on a credit card application.\u201d The evidence at issue was introduced largely through Liotta\u2019s testimony and the cross-examination of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">On direct examination, Liotta described how she met defendant in 1992 when she was a social worker and he was a \u201cmale dancer.\u201d The relationship was \u201con again, off again,\u201d and, although Liotta <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>loved defendant, \u201c[they] had a lot of problems.\u201d Early in the relationship, she discovered defendant had another girlfriend. Defendant \u201cwould call [her] obsessively\u201d at work, and call her \u201cbosses\u201d to make sure she was working.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Defendant objected to the evidence at sidebar, specifically citing Liotta\u2019s testimony that defendant was \u201ca male dancer,\u201d and claimed it was irrelevant. The judge overruled the objection, finding the testimony to be \u201cproper introductory testimony to establish the nature of the relationship.\u201d The judge also ruled that the testimony about defendant \u201ccalling and checking\u201d on Liotta was relevant because \u201cit [went] to the issue [defendant was] raising,\u201d presumably the passion/provocation defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">Liotta testified that although defendant continued to try to find other employment, he spent several hours each day lifting weights, \u201cdo[ing] aerobics,\u201d and going to the gym. After the couple\u2019s first child was born in 1998, Liotta went to law school and graduated in 2003. The couple continued their relationship, though they never lived together, and Liotta became pregnant again in 2003. Lott was upset that Liotta \u201cwas having another child with [defendant].\u201d A second son was born, and while Liotta believed that defendant \u201cloved his children,\u201d she testified that \u201c[h]e did not\u201d support them financially.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">Liotta began to testify about the first time Lott met defendant. The couple had just started dating and defendant arrived for Thanksgiving dinner. When asked about defendant\u2019s dress and attitude at the dinner, defense counsel again objected.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-9\">[Defense counsel]: The objection is the one that I made ... before. It\u2019s a continued objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-10\">The reason that your Honor overruled my objection was you said that it went to our defenses____[H]ow he livedf ] does not go to our defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-11\">[Judge]: This is the entire relationship that existed among these people since they met each other____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-12\">[Defense counsel]: ... It\u2019s not what took place between the witness and [defendant]. It\u2019s how Mrs. Lott reacted to what took place. Whether she was justified or not is not relevant. The passion and provocation goes to the action, not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>reason for the action____It\u2019s the expression of ... [Lott\u2019s] dislike that\u2019s relevant. It\u2019s not the reason for it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">The prosecutor argued the evidence went \u201cto the motive of ... defendant,\u201d and demonstrated why Lott \u201chated [defendant] from the beginning,\u201d something defense counsel asserted in his opening statement. The judge overruled the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Liotta continued to testify that at the dinner, defendant \u201cspit\u201d out the food her mother had cooked because it was prepared with salt. Her mother \u201cwas highly insulted.\u201d Liotta went on to describe her mother\u2019s disapproval of defendant\u2019s \u201cdancing,\u201d and her concern that defendant was \u201cdoing other things, sleeping with people for money, prostituting himself____ [S]he was concerned that he could be in homosexual relationships.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">Liotta described an incident during her second pregnancy when she was hospitalized and became ill in her room. Defendant was the only person with her, but left without summoning a nurse. Liotta \u201ccall[ed] for help until three ... or four in the morning ... [and] just laid there throwing up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-11\">Liotta described another incident that also occurred while she was in the hospital. Defendant was supposed to pick up their older son at school. When Liotta called him, defendant told her his car had broken down far from the school. Liotta became \u201chysterical,\u201d and began calling other parents; she finally reached one, and when she explained the problem, the parent told her that defendant was there with her, \u201ceating a can of tuna fish.\u201d Liotta told her mother about the incident, and Lott responded, \u201cthis is the kind of thing [defendant] does____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-12\">Early in the relationship, Lott told her daughter that defendant was \u201ctrying to control [her]\u201d and was \u201cstalking [her].\u201d In the summer of 2004, there was a verbal altercation between defendant and Lott. She called defendant a \u201cbum,\u201d and he called her \u201ca fat pig,\u201d in front of the couple\u2019s son.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-13\">In addition to Liotta\u2019s testimony, defendant identifies several exchanges between him and the prosecutor on cross-examination that produced evidence in violation of <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b). For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>example, during direct examination, defendant claimed that Lott did not like him because he \u201cwasn\u2019t professional.\u201d On cross-examination, the prosecutor extensively questioned defendant about his debts, the fact that he had \u201clost five jobs in five years as a mechanic,\u201d and that he had \u201cnever saved anything----\u201d The prosecutor then asked:</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">Q. Do you remember applying for a credit card in your son\u2019s name?</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">A. For Alex\u2014it was just for a joke.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">Q. It was a joke?</p>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">A. I never used it____</p>\n<p id=\"b145-12\">Q. It was a joke. It was a joke. You do something that affects your son\u2019s credit\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b145-14\">A. I never used [it].</p>\n<p id=\"b145-15\">Q. \u2014and you laugh about it?</p>\n<p id=\"b145-16\">A. I didn't. I didn\u2019t know any better at the time. I put his name on it. I got\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b145-17\">Q. Forged a credit card application. Forged your son\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-18\">The prosecutor then questioned defendant extensively about his failure to pay child support, something he had asked Liotta about at length during her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-19\">The prosecutor also questioned defendant about an incident involving \u201ca naked woman\u201d being found under his son\u2019s crib shortly before his baptism; about defendant not telling Liotta that he had been married before; and extensively about an argument he had with another man who was friendly with Liotta during \u201cthe early part of [their] relationship____\u201d The prosecutor asked if defendant \u201cassaulted\u201d the other man, which defendant denied, and whether he hid \u201cin the bushes\u201d before confronting the man.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-22\">The prosecutor asked defendant about his \u201cdancing\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b145-23\">Q. Let\u2019s talk about that. You say dancing. We\u2019re not talking about the polka or the tango or anything?</p>\n<p id=\"b145-25\">A. No. I worked in Chippendale\u2019s in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-26\">Q. Right. You danced at Feathers, right, gay club?</p>\n<p id=\"b145-27\">A. One time. I didn\u2019t like it and I quit.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-28\">Q. You used to strip for money?</p>\n<p id=\"b145-29\">A. No, I worked out in a sola flex machine, but that was in like 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Q. ,No. You danced, you took off your clothes for money. That\u2019s what you did for a living?</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">A. Oh, yeah.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Asked if Lott \u201cknew about [his] dancing,\u201d defendant replied that she did. The prosecutor then asked:</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Q. She knew that you stripped at gay clubs?</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">A. No. And that was only twice. And I quit.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">Q. You know that she suspected that you were involved in more conduct than just taking off your clothes, right?</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">A. I had no idea.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">Q. You didn\u2019t know[?]</p>\n<p id=\"b146-12\">A. I said I [had] no idea.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-13\">Q. She never called you [a] male whore before?</p>\n<p id=\"b146-14\">A. No, she did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-15\">Over defense counsel\u2019s objection, the judge permitted the prosecutor to inquire about defendant\u2019s relationship with Brian Schell. Defendant claimed he was Schell\u2019s \u201cpersonal trainer,\u201d and that Schell \u201coffered [him] money to do body worshipping.\u201d During a break, the jury sent out a note asking what \u201cbody worshiping\u201d was, and the prosecutor, over defendant\u2019s objection and contrary to the judge\u2019s earlier ruling limiting the testimony, was permitted to continue his questioning of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-16\">[Prosecutor:] [W]hen I was cross-examining you before, you had a sexual relationship with Brian Schell, right? There was a sexual component to it?</p>\n<p id=\"b146-17\">[Defendant:] For him it was sexual, not me.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-18\">[Prosecutor:] What does that mean, for him it was sexual? What are you talking about?</p>\n<p id=\"b146-19\">[Defendant:] He got a sexual thrill out of ... watching me work out or touching my body.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-20\">[Prosecutor:] ... That\u2019s what Pm trying to get at. There was sexual contact between you and Brian Schell and there was money exchanged. Right?</p>\n<p id=\"b146-21\">Defendant: At the time there was, yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-22\">The State contends all of this evidence was \u201crelevant to rebut an unfair and inaccurate attack against the victim, and to provide a proper framework for the jury to fully evaluate the events leading up to the murder.\u201d It further argues the evidence was \u201crelevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>to the issue <em>of </em>passion/provocation raised by the [defendant.\u201d According to the State, the evidence did not fall within the ambit of <em>Rule </em>404(b)\u2019s exclusion \u201cof other crimes, wrongs, or acts,\u201d because the testimony only showed that defendant\u2019s behavior was \u201cboorish, indolent and self-indulgent,\u201d and not that he had a propensity to commit murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">We believe the State\u2019s arguments misconstrue our jurisprudence in this area. The evidence needed to be evaluated pursuant to <em>Rule </em>404(b) and most of it should have been excluded because it was irrelevant. The only close question in our mind is if reversal is required because the testimony \u201craise[s] a reasonable doubt as to whether the [evidence] led the jury to a verdict it otherwise might not have reached.\u201d <em>State v.

Moreover, some of the alleged conduct disclosed through the testimony was indeed criminal or quasi-criminal in nature, e.g., that defendant forged an application for a credit card and was a male prostitute.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">We also reject the State\u2019s assertion that the <em>Rule </em>\u201conly prohibits reference to an act that demonstrates a propensity for a similar action,\u201d and that the jury could not have considered this evidence as demonstrating defendant\u2019s propensity to commit murder. The <em>Rule </em>cannot be read in such a crabbed fashion. The evil the <em>Rule </em>seeks to avoid is that \u201c[i]f other crime evidence were to be admitted, the jury might think of a defendant as a bad person in general and convict____\u201d Biunno, <em>Current N.J.

Our courts have distinguished this type of evidence, generally under the rubric of res gestae, because such evidence of \u201c[t]he defendant\u2019s actions \u2018serves to paint a complete picture of the relevant criminal transaction\u2019 and therefore [is] admissible.\u201d <em>State v. Long, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>138, 156, 801 A.2d 221 (2002) (quoting <em>State v. Martini, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>176, 242, 619 A.2d 1208 (1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 <em>U.S. </em>875, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>203, 133 L.Ed.2d 137 (1995)). The judge correctly recognized this when he overruled defendant\u2019s initial objection, characterizing what had transpired to that point as \u201cproper introductory testimony to establish the nature of the relationship.\u201d But that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>cannot be fairly applied to almost all that followed. Indeed, when the balance of the testimony is reviewed under the <em>Cofield </em>test, which we do de novo since the trial judge never considered the question, we conclude that the evidence cannot meet the first prong of the analysis, i.e., that it be \u201crelevant to a material issue----\u201d <em>See Williams, supra, </em>190 <em>N.J. </em>at 122, 919 A.2d 90 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">The Court has recently considered the issue of relevancy as it relates to 404(b) evidence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-8\">[T]o be relevant, the other-crimes evidence must bear on a subject that is at issue at the trial, for example, an element of the offense or some other factor such as motive, opportunity, intent, or plan. In determining whether 404(b) evidence bears on a material issue, the Court should consider whether the matter was projected by the defense as arguable before trial, raised by the defense at trial, or was one that the defense refused to concede. Further, the other-crimes evidence must be necessary for the proof of the disputed element. Indeed, in assessing the fourth prong, courts should consider whether the matter can be proved adequately by other evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-9\"><em>[Stale v. P.S., </em>202 <em>N.J. </em>232, 256-57, 997 A.2d 163 (2010) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">The State attempted throughout the trial to argue that the evidence was relevant for a variety of reasons. First, that it showed motive, i.e., that defendant knew Lott hated him, that he believed she was \u201cpoisoning\u201d Liotta against him, and he wanted the victim out of the picture. We agree that Lott\u2019s hatred of defendant and her influence over her daughter were highly relevant and provided a motive for why defendant killed her, and by implication, a negation of his claim that Lott provoked him when he attempted to mitigate the tension between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">But we fail to see how specific instances of defendant\u2019s conduct towards Liotta while she was in the hospital, or his financial circumstances, or his job as a male dancer, or insinuations of prostitution and credit card fraud, were relevant to his motive for killing Lott. Certainly, the State introduced the general theme of the bitter animosity between defendant and Lott through the testimony of Liotta and her brother Joseph, and, to the extent it did so without references to specific conduct by defendant, the evidence was proper. Defendant essentially admitted in his state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>ments to the police, and certainly in his testimony, that Lott hated him and attempted to influence her daughter to sever her relationship with him. Lott may have been well-justified in her evaluation of defendant\u2019s character and in trying to break his hold over her daughter; but whether Lott\u2019s dislike of defendant was deserved or not was irrelevant to defendant\u2019s motive.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The State also advanced an argument repeatedly at trial, as it does before us in a single sentence, without any citation, that the evidence \u201cwas relevant to the issue of passion/provocation raised by the defense.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">As the Supreme Court has instructed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-7\">Murder is reduced to manslaughter if the murder is committed in the heat of passion in response to a reasonable provocation. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-4 b(2). Passion/provocation manslaughter has four elements: (1) reasonable and adequate provocation; (2) no cooling-off time in the period between the provocation and the slaying; (3) a defendant who actually was impassioned by the provocation; and (4) a defendant who did not cool off before the slaying. The first two elements of the offense are objective; thus, if they are supported by the evidence, the trial court should instruct the jury on passion/provocation manslaughter, leaving the determination of the remaining elements to the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-8\"><em>[State v. Josephs, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>44, 103, 803 A.2d 1074 (2002) (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ak9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>To be sure, \u201cthe State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had not killed his victim in the heat of passion caused by a reasonable provocation!,]\u201d in order to secure a murder conviction. <em>State v. Viera, </em>346 <em>N.J.Super. </em>198, 212, 787 A.2d 256 (App.Div.2001) (citations omitted), <em>certif. denied, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>38, 803 A.2d 634 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">However, the State has not demonstrated how Lott\u2019s animosity toward defendant, well-justified or not, is relevant to prove an essential element of murder, or disprove an element of defendant\u2019s asserted claim. During the trial, in response to defendant\u2019s objection, the prosecutor claimed the evidence showed \u201c[tjhere were plenty of reasons that [Lott] didn\u2019t like ... defendant.\u201d Because she \u201chad valid reasons to treat ... defendant the way she did,\u201d the prosecutor argued Lott\u2019s provocative conduct, if it took place as defendant claimed, was not \u201cunreasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">This argument, however, entirely misstates the relevant inquiry. Regarding the adequacy of the provocation, \u201c[t]he question ... essentially amounts to whether loss of self-control is a reasonable reaction.\u201d <em>State v. Mauricio, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>402, 412, 568 A.2d 879 (1990). Lott\u2019s reason for treating defendant as she did, or as he claimed she did, was irrelevant because the \u201ctest is purely objective, [and] the provocation must be \u2018sufficient to arouse the passions of an ordinary [person] beyond the power of his [or her] control.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>State v. King, </em>37 <em>N.J. </em>285, 301-02, 181 A.2d 158 (1962) (in turn quoting <em>State v. Herrmann, </em>77 <em>N.J.L. </em>534, 535, 76 A 1086 (E. &amp; A.1909))). In other words, the fact that defendant engaged in the \u201cboorish, indolent and self-indulgent\u201d instances of specific conduct the State adduced, and further assuming Lott knew about them, we fail to see how that knowledge is relevant to any materially, disputed fact regarding defendant\u2019s asserted passion/provocation manslaughter defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">In reality, the State\u2019s justification for introducing this extensive testimony, as acknowledged in its brief, was to \u201crebut an inaccurate and unfair attack on the victim.\u201d We assume this means that defendant\u2019s testimony regarding the events that oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>curred over twelve years, and his conclusion that Lott\u2019s hatred of him was misplaced, was fair game and could be attacked through specific instances of his bad conduct to show that Lott\u2019s hatred was justified. There is no basis for this in our evidence rules. <em>See N.J.R.E. </em>608(a) (excluding \u201cspecific instances of conduct\u201d as proof of a character trait affecting credibility); <em>see also State v. Darby, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>509, 520, 809 A.2d 138 (2002) (generally noting that other-crime evidence is not admissible solely to affect credibility).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">We conclude that virtually all of the evidence adduced by the State was inadmissible and should have been excluded. Although defendant objected in some instances, he did not in many others. For example, much of the cross-examination of defendant was uninterrupted by objection. Whether reviewed as plain error or not, <em>see R. </em>2:10-2, the question is whether the evidence as a whole \u201craise[s] a reasonable doubt as to whether ... [it] led the jury to a result it otherwise might not have reached.\u201d <em>Bankston, supra, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>at 273, 307 A.2d 65 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">The State\u2019s proofs were substantial. It produced circumstantial evidence that defendant\u2019s claim of going to Lott\u2019s house to ease the tension between them was incredible, that he told Casey his intention was otherwise, that he repeatedly lied about his whereabouts that night to the police, that his physical superiority over Lott made any attack by her unlikely, and that he had the motive to kill her. The only material issue in dispute was defendant\u2019s state of mind, and in this regard, defendant\u2019s evidence was limited to his testimony, and, in an ironic way, the same evidence of hatred and distrust that the State used to prove motive. Because there were no eyewitnesses to the murder except defendant, the jury\u2019s assessment of his credibility was critical.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">The Court has recognized that \u201c \u2018[t]he likelihood of prejudice is acute when the proffered evidence is proof of a defendant\u2019s uncharged misconduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Barden, supra, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>at 394, 949 A.2d 820 (quoting <em>State v. Stevens, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>289, 302, 558 A.2d 833 (1989)). Moreover, while we deem the evidence to be irrelevant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>and inadmissible in the first instance, the jury was never provided with any instruction regarding the permissible and impermissible uses of such other bad acts testimony. Thus, without any guidance, the jury was free to utilize the testimony for an impermissible purpose, i.e., that the defendant was a bad person. Viewed in tandem, we maintain a reasonable doubt that the repeated admission of irrelevant other bad acts evidence may have led the jury to a result that it otherwise may not have reached, and we therefore reverse defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">As a result of our conclusion, we need not address the issues defendant raises in Points Four and Five. We find the issue defendant has raised in Point Two of his pro se supplemental brief to be of insufficient merit to warrant any further discussion. <em>See R. </em>2:11\u20143(e)(2). We address the remaining points only for guidance in the event of a retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">In Point Two and in Point One of his supplemental pro se brief, defendant contends the judge failed to properly instruct the jury as to passion/provocation manslaughter. He admits that the judge utilized the model charge, and, as per his request, specifically referenced the \u201ctwelve-year history between [him] and Lott.\u201d However, he claims the charge \u201cdid not sufficiently explain how the cumulative impact of a series of events ... could be relevant to the issue of provocation,\u201d and emphasized \u201cthe necessity of there being \u2018a significant physical confrontation\u2019 immediately preceding the killing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">We believe the judge properly utilized the model jury charge as it then existed. He explained the relevance of the extended acrimony between defendant and Lott, thus tailoring the jury instruction to the facts presented. <em>See State v. Robinson, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>32, 42-43, 754 A.2d 1153 (2000). The judge properly told the jurors that there needed to be more than words alone to substantiate a reasonable provocation. <em>See Viera, supra, </em>346 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 215, 787 A.2d 256 (\u201c[0]rdinarily words alone, no matter how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>offensive or insulting, do not constitute adequate provocation to reduce murder to manslaughter.\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">To the extent defendant claims that the judge erred by telling the jury there needed to be \u201ca significant physical confrontation\u201d between defendant and Lott, we note the model charge uses that phrase. Moreover, the phrase connotes the fact that defendant\u2019s response must be to a reasonable provocation. <em>See State v. Docaj, </em>407 <em>N.J.Super. </em>352, 368-69, 971 A.2d 418 (App.Div.) (\u201cAlthough perhaps sufficient to warrant the instruction, the evidence of an alleged slap was conceded to be insufficient to constitute adequate provocation.\u201d) (footnote omitted), <em>certif. denied, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>370, 982 A.2d 457 (2009); <em>see also State v. Oglesby, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>522, 536, 585 A.2d 916 (1991) (finding insufficient provocation to warrant an instruction on passion/provocation manslaughter when unarmed victim slapped the defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">As defendant notes in his pro se brief, however, the model charge used by the trial judge contained an error that we recognized in <em>Docaj, supra, </em>407 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 370-71, 971 A.2d 418. On retrial, the charge must comply with our holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">The State argues that there was no need to provide the passion/provocation charge because the evidence was insufficient to support the claim. We do not address the issue because we do not know what proofs may be adduced during any retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">We also note that defendant, in Point Three, alleges that prosecutorial misconduct in summation requires reversal. We would not reach the same conclusion. However, the prosecutor\u2019s frequent comments that defendant was \u201ca liar\u201d should not be repeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b139-10\"> <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>436, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b141-9\"> The State withdrew its proffer of the formal post-arrest statement during pretrial hearings on defendant\u2019s suppression motion. Defendant attempted to introduce the statement before testifying, the State objected, and the judge ruled it was inadmissible. However, during cross-examination, defendant was asked to review various portions of the statement, and did so again on re-direct. Ultimately, the judge granted the State\u2019s motion to admit the statement into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>evidence over defendant's objection. There is no issue raised on appeal regarding defendant's formal post-arrest statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b148-9\"> <em>See Evid. R. </em>55 (\"[E]vidence that a person committed a crime or civil wrong on a specified occasion, is inadmissible to prove his disposition to commit crime or civil wrong as the basis for an inference that he committed a crime or civil wrong on another specified occasion but, ... such evidence is admissible to prove some other fact in issue including motive, intent, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b151-9\"> We also note that during trial, the State argued on occasion that defendant had other motives for killing Lott. For example, in arguing that defendant's \"body worshipping\" activity with Schell was admissible, the State claimed that defendant killed Lott because she called him \"a male whore.\" This epithet, the State argued, was particularly \"sting[ing!\" because defendant had, in fact, engaged in prostitution. In his summation, in listing all of defendant\u2019s motives, the prosecutor claimed defendant killed Lott \"to keep his secret\" regarding Schell. But, there was no evidence that Lott called defendant \"a male whore\u201d to his face, and defendant denied that she ever did. There was no evidence that Lott knew defendant had engaged in \"sexual contact\u201d with Schell. The State also advanced an argument in front of the jury, through the questioning of defendant, and again in summation, that Lott was killed so that defendant would have access to her estate, even though he was not married to Liotta. In summation, the prosecutor claimed that defendant \u201cneeded some money\u201d and \"the reasonable security that ... Lott could give him.\u201d We believe the State\u2019s theory that Lott was killed for her money was speculative based on the evidence adduced before the jury, but, more importantly, much of the testimony that was admitted was not probative of such motive.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
