The requirements for obtaining a special concessionaire permit are (1) the State or its political subdivision has entered into a contract with the applicant authorizing the sale of alcoholic beverages on the property; (2) the property on which the sale will take place is State property; and (3) the applicant has convinced the Director that it is fit to serve alcoholic beverages. <em>N.J.AC. </em>13:2-5.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">In this appeal, the New Jersey Restaurant Association (NJRA), Park and Orchard Restaurant, Taos Restaurant, Candlewyek Diner, Trediei Restaurant and The Landmark (collectively appellants), all of whom hold municipally-issued plenary liquor licenses, challenge the decision of the Director and the ABC granting an application submitted by Benihana Meadowlands Corp. (Benihana) for a special concessionaire permit, which authorized Benihana to sell alcoholic beverages for on-site consumption within its restaurant. The property on which Benihana proposed to operate its restaurant will be located within Xanadu, the entertainment complex within the Meadowlands Sports Complex, which is owned by the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority (NJSEA), a political subdivision of the State of New Jersey. NJSEA had leased the Xanadu real estate to Mills/Maek-Cali (the developer), who then subleased a portion of the building to Benihana.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">We conclude that the requirements of <em>N.J.AC. </em>13:2-5.2 were met, and we affirm the final decision of the Director and the ABC.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>These are the facts adduced from the record. On September 7, 2007, Benihana submitted to Jerry Fischer, Director of ABC, its application for a special concessionaire permit followed by the requisite service on appellants together with published notice in <em>The Bergen Record.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Appellants filed timely notice with Fischer objecting to Benihana\u2019s application for the following reasons: 1) Benihana did not satisfy the criteria for receiving a special concessionaire permit because (a) it had not entered a bona fide contract with NJSEA, authorizing the sale of alcoholic beverages; (b) the building in which Benihana would operate was not a public building because it was owned by the developer; and (c) the seventy-five year lease between the developer and NJSEA effectively transferred ownership of the property to the developer; 2) <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:2-5.2 was inconsistent with the policy and terms of the ABC Act, and the regulation is invalid; 3) issuing Benihana a special concessionaire permit would (a) \u201cviolate New Jersey law concerning municipal control over the retailing of alcoholic beverages\u201d, (b) amount to the issuance of a plenary license, which only municipalities may issue, and (c) improperly increase the amount of plenary licenses within the municipality; and 4) issuing Benihana a special concessionaire permit would violate appellants\u2019 due process, equal protection and property rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Appellants requested that Fischer refer the matter to the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) for a plenary hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ), claiming that the matter amounted to a \u201ccontested case.\u201d The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) defines a \u201ccontested case\u201d as \u201cany licensing proceeding, in which the legal rights ... or other legal relations of specific parties are required by constitutional right or by statute to be determined ... after opportunity for an agency hearing!.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-2(b). Additionally, appellants claimed that an ALJ should hear the case because it involved constitutional issues outside of Fischer\u2019s area of expertise.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>After Fischer conducted a conference with the interested parties, appellants asked that he recuse himself, claiming that he was biased in favor of the developer. In so contending, they relied on a June 23, 2005 advisory opinion that Fischer had issued, which stated that because Xanadu was located on state property, Fischer would entertain applications for special concessionaire permits submitted by Xanadu tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">NJRA, one of the appellants in this ease, as well as Hartz Restaurant Association (Hartz), had appealed that advisory decision. <em>See In re Determination by Dir. of the Div. of Alcoholic Beverage Control, </em>392 <em>N.J.Super. </em>577, 580, 921 A.2d 1159 (App.Div.2007) (hereinafter <em>In re Xanadu </em>Permits). We declined to entertain the appeal, concluding that generally \u201ccourts in New Jersey do \u2018not render advisory opinions or function in the abstract.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 581, 921 A.2d 1159 (quoting <em>Crescent Pk. Tenants Ass\u2019n v. Realty Equities Corp., </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>98, 107, 275 A.2d 433 (1971)). However, we noted that we found \u201cno fault with the Director\u2019s assertion of subject matter jurisdiction as a way of beginning the evaluative process, but the underlying issues may not proceed to final resolution on the administrative level before the objections raised by appellants receive an appropriate hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 583-84, 921 A.2d 1159.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Following the conference, appellants submitted to Fischer a statement of their objections and the facts implicated by the objections. They advanced the same objections as previously noted and repeated their request for a transfer to the OAL. They also added a claim that Fischer\u2019s June 2005 advisory opinion was improperly issued because Fischer had failed to comply with <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:2-36.1(a), which provides that the ABC Director should issue an advisory opinion only when the matter relates to \u201cissues not previously articulated by the Division or involves a substantial question of general applicability.\u201d They later again wrote to Fischer and requested that he recuse himself, arguing Fischer\u2019s \u201cdemonstrated commitment\u201d to his prior findings and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>conclusions was \u201cinappropriate as a matter of law and provide[d] an independent basis for\u201d his recusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Fischer issued an order denying appellants\u2019 request for recusal. He explained that none of the reasons that appellants had advanced in support of their request had merit, and he had no pecuniary interest in Benihana\u2019s receipt of a special concessionaire permit. Further, Fischer said, the authority to decide contested cases was vested in the agency head, so even if he referred the matter to the OAL, an AL J would merely issue a recommendation, which Fischer could reject.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">He, thereafter, issued a scheduling order that requested additional briefing on whether <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:2-5.2 was a valid regulation and whether the Director of the ABC had the statutory authority to grant a special concessionaire permit. He also preliminarily decided that the matter was not a contested case; however, he gave appellants the opportunity to further brief whether Benihana\u2019s application implicated any of appellants\u2019 constitutionally protected rights and elevated the dispute to a contested case. Assuming that his preliminary decision was correct, Fischer said that he would not transfer the matter to the OAL, and that he would not allow discovery because the right to be heard in a non-contested case did not include such a right.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">After receipt of the parties submissions, Fischer entered a final pre-hearing order. In that order, he determined that <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:2-5.2 was a valid regulation, and that he had the authority to issue a special concessionaire permit. He found that Hartz had failed to establish a constitutional right to a hearing and again rejected the request to transfer the matter to the OAL as a contested case.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">Consistent with his findings in the advisory opinion, Fischer found that the property on which Benihana would operate was owned by a public entity, and that the seventy-five-year lease between NJSEA and the developer did not divest NJSEA of its ownership rights in the property. Further, he found that Benihana had entered into a valid contract with NJSEA, authorizing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>sale of alcoholic beverages on the property, and Benihana had satisfied the contract and state-property criteria for receiving a special concessionaire permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">He then scheduled a hearing at which time evidence could be presented on the last remaining issue\u2014whether Benihana was qualified to receive a special concessionaire permit. Appellants did not appear at the hearing. The only objector who appeared was Hartz.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">By order dated December 18, 2008, Fischer granted Benihana\u2019s application for a special concessionaire permit, finding that it had satisfied the criteria for receiving a permit, and that it was fit to sell alcoholic beverages. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">On appeal, appellants challenge the issuance of the permit and raise the following issues: (1) Fischer should have recused himself from deciding whether to grant Benihana\u2019s application for a special concessionaire permit because he was biased; (2) the hearing that Fischer provided appellants was inadequate to protect appellants\u2019 property interests in their liquor licenses and did not comply with our decision in <em>In Re Xanadu Permits, </em>as he stated he would entertain applications for special concessionaire permits submitted by Xanadu tenants; (3) Benihana did not satisfy the criteria for receiving a special concessionaire permit; and (4) issuing Benihana a special concessionaire permit violated the policy of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>33:1-1 to -97. We address the issues seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">Appellants contend that Fischer erred in denying their request for recusal, reasoning that Fischer was biased and unable to impartially decide the issues in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">In addressing this issue, we consider the powers and responsibilities of the Director. The Director of the ABC is charged with the duty \u201cto supervise the manufacture, distribution and sale of alcoholic beverages in such a manner as to fulfill the public policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>and legislative purpose of\u2019 the ABC Act. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>33:1-3. One of the purposes is \u201c[t]o strictly regulate alcoholic beverages to protect the health, safety and welfare of the people of this State.\u201d All other purposes stem from this fundament. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>33:1-3.1(b) (listing nine other purposes).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Among the powers that the Director may exercise in carrying out the Act\u2019s policy and purpose are the powers to adopt rules and regulations and to authorize the sale of alcoholic beverages on property owned or controlled by the State or its political subdivisions, subject to those rules and regulations. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>33:1-39 and -42.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">In furtherance of this authority, the Director adopted <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:2-5.2. This regulation establishes the criteria to obtain a special concessionaire permit. In relevant part, the regulation provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-8\">(a) Application for a special concessionaire permit may be made to the Director by any individual, partnership, corporation, limited liability company, or other type of legal entity who has entered into a contract with the State of New Jersey, or any political subdivision thereof, whereby said person or organization is authorized to sell alcoholic beverages for immediate consumption in any public building or on any property owned by or under the control of the State of New Jersey or any political subdivision thereof. Such permit may also authorize the sale of alcoholic beverages in original containers for off-premises consumption, provided the applicant, with the consent of the governmental agency, establishes to the satisfaction of the Director that there is good cause for such sales.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-9\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">Within ten days of filing the application, the applicant must post public notice of its filing. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:2-5.2(d). Any party objecting to the application is entitled to a hearing upon submission of a written objection to the Director:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-11\">Upon timely receipt of a duly signed written objection to the issuance of a special concessionaire permit, the Director will afford a hearing to all parties and notify the applicant and the objector of the date, hour and place thereof. No hearing need be held if no objection shall be lodged, but the application shall not be denied without first affording the applicant an opportunity to be heard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-12\"><em>[N.J.A.C. </em>13:2-5.2\u00ae.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-13\">If the objection raises issues sufficient to designate the matter as a \u201ccontested case,\u201d the Director <em>may </em>refer the matter to the OAL for a hearing before an ALJ. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-10; <em>N.J.S.A. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>52:14F-7 a. However, such referral is discretionary. <em>In re Application of County of Bergen, </em>268 <em>N.J.Super. </em>403, 413, 633 A.2d 1017 (App.Div.1993) (explaining that the agency head has the discretion to refer a case to the OAL for a hearing). The APA defines \u201ccontested case\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-5\">a proceeding, including any licensing proceeding, in which the legal rights, duties, obligations, privileges, benefits or other legal relations of specific parties are required by constitutional right or by statute to be determined by an agency by decisions, determinations, or orders, addressed to them or disposing of their interests, after opportunity for an agency hearing, but shall not include any proceeding in the Division of Taxation, Department of the Treasury, which is reviewable de novo by the Tax Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>52:14B-2(b)J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">If the Director exercises his or her discretion and refers a contested case to the OAL, an ALJ holds a trial-like hearing on the matter. <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:14B-10. At the close of the hearing, the ALJ issues a recommendation to the agency head on findings of fact and conclusions or law. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-10(e) and (d). The ALJ\u2019s recommendation has no independent force and effect, as the agency Director \u201chas the exclusive right to decide\u201d the case. <em>In re Kallen, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>14, 20, 455 A.2d 460 (1983). The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-8\">[T]he agency head may reject or modify [the ALJ\u2019s] findings of fact, conclusions of law or interpretations of agency policy ..., but shall state clearly the reasons for doing so. The agency head may not reject or modify any findings of fact as to issues of credibility of lay witness testimony unless it is first determined from a review of the record that the findings are arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable or are not supported by sufficient, competent, and credible evidence in the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-9\"><em>[.N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-10(c).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">We may review the agency head\u2019s decision, and when doing so, we apply a deferential standard of review. <em>In re Application of County of Bergen, supra, </em>268 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 410, 633 A.2d 1017. If we are \u201csatisfied after [our] review that the evidence and the inferences to be drawn therefrom support the agency head\u2019s decision, then [we] must affirm even if [we] feel[ ] that [we] would have reached a different result itself.\u201d <em>In re Tenure Hearing of Young, </em>202 <em>N.J. </em>50, 70, 995 A.2d 826 (2010) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>(quoting <em>Clowes v. Terminix Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>575, 588, 538 A.2d 794 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Appellants argue that Fischer should recuse himself from the case and allow an ALJ to decide the matter because Fischer demonstrated that he was unable to remain impartial in reviewing Benihana\u2019s application as evidenced by: (1) the absence in Fisher\u2019s advisory opinion of the criteria for issuing an advisory opinion contained in <em>N.J.AC. </em>13:2-36.1(a), which limits advisory opinions to \u201cissues not previously articulated by the Division\u201d and to \u201cquestion[s] of general applicability\u201d; (2) satisfaction of neither criterion in <em>N.J AC. </em>13:2-36.1(a); (3) Fischer\u2019s clear continued support for the conclusions and findings in his June 23, 2005 advisory opinion; and (4) Fischer\u2019s refusal to refer the matter to an ALJ, despite the fact that occasionally in the past applications for special concessionaire permits had been referred to ALJs.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Fischer rejected appellants\u2019 request to refer the matter as without basis. With respect to <em>N.J.AC. </em>13:2-36.1(a), Fischer said that one of the criteria in that regulation was that the matter involve issues not previously articulated by the Division. While quoting NJRA\u2019s appellate brief that his advisory opinion \u201crepresented] a novel view of the regulation which apparently was never adopted by the agency before the case at issue\u201d, he concluded that no one questioned that the issue was novel.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">Fischer did not dispute his continued support of his advisory opinion. While he acknowledged that two years had passed since he issued the advisory opinion, no relative facts had changed. He still believed that special concessionaire permits were available within Xanadu, so long as the applicants established that they were fit to receive the permits and any objectors were given an opportunity to be heard. Finally, Fischer explained that to \u201cexpedite the process,\u201d he, and not an ALJ, should consider Benihana\u2019s application. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-9\">Not only do I have almost eight years of experience as Director of the ABC, I am familiar with the history of the issuance of Special Concessionaire Permits by the agency. I must evaluate the exigencies and time constraints of this project and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>commensurate public interest demands by resolving disputes in a reasonable time frame. Whether previous ABC Directors decided to transfer matters to the OAL is irrelevant. This is not a basis for recusal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Even if the matter could be referred to the OAL as a contested case, Fischer said, he would still be the person who would render a final decision in the matter because \u201can agency head has the exclusive authority to decide contested cases.\u201d <em>(Application of County of Bergen, N.J. for Approval to Dissolve Bergen County Utils. Auth., </em>268 <em>N.J.Super. </em>403, 414, 633 A.2d 1017 (App.Div. 1993)). He concluded that there was no basis for appellants\u2019 request that an ALJ decide the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">On appeal, appellants maintain their argument. They contend that Fischer\u2019s issuing the advisory opinion\u2014at the request of the developer\u2014without first addressing the requirements in <em>N.J.AC. </em>13:2-36.1(a) \u201ccalls into question the possible bias of the Director in favor of the Developer.\u201d Appellants underscore that in the past the Director referred contested cases to the OAL for a hearing before an ALJ and contend that Fischer\u2019s refusal to refer this matter to the OAL establishes a basis for his recusal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">More importantly, they say, Fischer\u2019s refusal to depart from the findings in his advisory opinion was \u201cinappropriate as a matter of law\u201d and warranted his removal from the ease. They draw support from three cases, all of which provide that we may remand a case to a different judge when the trial judge erred and there is concern that the trial judge may be committed to his or her prior findings, citing <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. A.W., </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>591, 617, 512 A.2d 438 (1986), <em>Graziano v. Grant, </em>326 <em>N.J.Super. </em>328, 350, 741 A.2d 156 (App.Div.1999), and <em>Carmichael v. Bryan, </em>310 <em>N.J.Super. </em>34, 49, 707 A.2d 1357 (App.Div.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>Finally, appellants note that <em>Rule </em>1:12\u20141(f) requires removal of a decision-maker for any \u201creason which might preclude a fair and unbiased hearing and judgment, or which might reasonably lead counsel or the parties to believe so\u201d, citing <em>Sheeran v. Progressive Life Ins. Co., </em>182 <em>N.J.Super. </em>237, 243, 440 A.2d 469 (App.Div.1981), where the court applied <em>Rule </em>1:12-1 in determining whether an ALJ had a conflict of interest that required recusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">ABC and the other respondents contend that Fischer correctly denied appellants\u2019 motion for recusal. They rely primarily on <em>In re Carberry, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>574, 556 A.2d 314 (1989), where the plaintiff, a State Police Trooper, was subject to a disciplinary hearing headed by State Police Superintendent Pagano after the plaintiff had tested positive for marijuana use. <em>Id. </em>at 577, 556 A.2d 314.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">For the first time on appeal, the plaintiff argued that as commander of the department that lodged disciplinary charges against him, Pagano should have recused himself from presiding over the disciplinary hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 582, 556 A.2d 314. We agreed, finding it was plain error for the superintendent to have heard the case and we remanded the case to the OAL. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">The Supreme Court disagreed and reversed, finding no facts that demonstrated Pagano\u2019s inability to fairly and impartially decide the matter and no basis for us to remand the matter to the OAL. <em>Id. </em>at 584, 556 A.2d 314. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-9\">[W]e recognize that conduct of a disciplinary hearing by the agency head might raise some doubts in the mind of the employee whether the hearing officer is impartial. Perhaps those doubts could be allayed if someone other than the Superintendent were to conduct disciplinary hearings. Although the Administrative Procedure Act reserves to an agency head the right to conduct administrative hearings in contested matters, <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:14F-8, the agency head may direct that a contested matter be assigned to an ALJ. Consequently, Superintendent Pagano could refer the matter to the OAL for hearing by an ALJ. Even in that context, as the head of the agency, he would retain the power to \u201cadopt, reject or modify the recommended report and decision,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:14B-10(c), or the \u201cfindings of fact and conclusions of law\u201d of the ALJ, <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:14F-7. Thus the agency head has the power to make the critical decision whether to refer a matter to an ALJ, as well as the power to make the final decision on the merits. The point remains, however, that it is for the agency head to decide initially whether to refer the matter to the OAL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>[T]he right to decide contested cases is an integral part of the administrative process. Administrative agencies carry out their regulatory responsibilities not only through rulemaking, or informal administrative action, but also through adjudication of contested cases. \u201cThus, the agency\u2019s decisional authority over contested cases is directly and integrally related to its regulatory function.\u201d To presume that the agency head is biased merely because he or she is applying an agency rule or regulation to a particular employee would severely undermine the function of administrative agencies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 584-85, 556 A.2d 314 (quoting <em>In re Uniform Admin.

We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">Fischer\u2019s failure to mention <em>N.J.AC. </em>13:2-36.1 in his advisory opinion is inconsequential, and we found no impropriety in his issuing the advisory opinion. <em>In re Xanadu Permits, supra, </em>392 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 583-84, 921 A.2d 1159. Nor did we find that he erred in concluding that special concessionaire permits were avail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>able to Xanadu tenants because Xanadu was state property. <em>Ibid. </em>Fischer\u2019s continued support for the conclusions in his advisory opinion was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Finally, Fischer had discretion to not refer the matter to the OAL. <em>In re Application of County of Bergen, supra, </em>268 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 413, 633 A.2d 1017. That other ABC directors referred similar cases to the OAL is irrelevant. His decision to hold the hearing himself did not establish bias, and he did not err in denying the request for recusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">Appellants next challenge the adequacy of the hearing that Fischer afforded them claiming, first, as they had a property right in their liquor licenses, a trial-type hearing at which they could object to Benihana\u2019s application was required; and second, the hearing did not comply with our earlier directive.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">As we have noted, the APA provides that an objector may receive a trial-type hearing before an ALJ if the matter is a \u201ccontested case.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-9 and -10. A contested case is a proceeding in which the Constitution or a statute requires an adjudicatory hearing prior to a final decision by the agency head. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-2(b); <em>In re Application of County of Bergen, supra, </em>268 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 413, 633 A.2d 1017. Here, no statute granted appellants the right to an adjudicatory hearing. Their claim to a hearing would have to be premised on a constitutional right being at stake.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">In his April 22, 2008 order, Fischer issued a preliminary decision that Benihana\u2019s application implicated none of appellants\u2019 constitutional rights, and they were not entitled to a trial-type hearing. <em>In re Freshwater Wetlands Permits, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>452, 456, 888 A.2d 441 (2006) (concluding that under the APA, a hearing right exists only for a non-applicant to a permit if that third party can demonstrate a particularized property interest of constitutional significance that is directly affected by an agency\u2019s permitting decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>Fischer concluded that, consistent with ABC\u2019s past practices, an \u201cappropriate hearing\u201d required only an opportunity for appellants to be heard, not a trial-type hearing. \u201cIn general,\u201d Fischer explained, \u201capplications requesting the issuance of an alcoholic beverage license or permit must satisfy the issuing authority of the appropriateness of the issuance of such a license or permit, including the fitness of the applicant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">He alluded to the requirements imposed on the municipality when issuing a license, <em>N.J.S.A </em>33:1-24, and concluded that the ABC must comply with the same mandates when it considers license and permit applications. A municipality (and according to Fischer, the ABC) is authorized and required</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQY\">to receive applications for such licenses as such other issuing authority is authorized to issue; to investigate applicants and to inspect premises sought to be licensed; to conduct public hearings on applications and revocations; to enforce primarily the provisions of this chapter and the rules and regulations so far as the same pertain or refer to or are in any way connected with retail licenses, except plenary retail transit licenses; to maintain proper records; to keep full and correct minutes; and to do, perform, take and adopt all other acts, procedures and methods designed to insure the fair, impartial, stringent and comprehensive administration of this chapter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-6\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">The statute is silent in reference to holding a trial-type hearing for a third-party objector.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">\u201cAt all times in the [review] process,\u201d said Fischer,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6y\">the issue is whether the applicant has satisfied the Director that it is qualified and appropriate to receive and operate an alcoholic beverage permit and under what conditions or limitations, if any, this permit is to be operated. The role of the objector is to provide such other information or comment as it has available so as to complete the record in order to assist the Director in making his decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">The proceeding is not an adversarial dispute between parties, but rather, an administrative action pursuant to a legislative delegation of power.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">Fischer rejected Hartz\u2019s contention that it had a particularized property interest in its license, finding that our courts have consistently held that a license to sell alcoholic beverages is a temporary permit or privilege, not a right. <em>Butler Oak Tavern v. Div. of Alcoholic Beverage Control, </em>20 <em>N.J. </em>373, 381, 120 A.2d 24 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>(1956); <em>Cavallaro 556 Valley St. Corp. v. Div. of Alcoholic Beverage Control, </em>351 <em>N.J.Super. </em>33, 40, 796 A.2d 938 (App.Div.2002) (\u201cIt is well accepted that ownership of a liquor license is a privilege and not a property right[.]\u201d). Additionally, Fischer referred to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>33:1-26, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-6\">In case of death, bankruptcy, receivership or incompetency of the licensee, or if for any other reason whatsoever the operation of the business covered by the license shall devolve by operation of law upon a person other than the licensee, the director or the issuing authority may, in his or its discretion, extend the license for a limited time, not exceeding its term, to the executor, administrator, trustee, receiver or other person upon whom the same has devolved by operation of law as aforesaid. <em>Under no circumstances, however, shall a license, or 'rights hereunder, be deemed property, </em>subject to inheritance, sale, pledge, lien, levy, attachment, execution, seizure for debts, or any other transfer or disposition whatsoever, except for payment of taxes, fees, interest and penalties imposed by any State tax law for which a lien may attach pursuant to <em>R.S. </em>54:49-1 or pursuant to the State Tax Uniform Procedure Law, <em>R.S. </em>54:48-1 et seq., or any similar State lien of tax, except to the extent expressly provided by this chapter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">L (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">Fischer concluded that appellants had no particularized property interest in their liquor licenses that entitled them to a trial-type hearing. He did schedule a hearing at which appellants could present evidence and arguments challenging Benihana\u2019s qualifications to receive a special concessionaire permit. Appellants neither appeared at the hearing nor presented evidence challenging Benihana\u2019s qualifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">At the hearing, Benihana presented two witnesses, one who testified to the Xanadu security plan and how it related to alcohol management and consumption, and the other who testified to the nature of Benihana\u2019s business as a family restaurant and the training that it provides its employees on alcohol consumption. Fischer concluded that Benihana had satisfied all of the criteria for receiving a special concessionaire permit, and that it was fit to sell alcoholic beverages.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">On appeal, appellants contend that Fischer erred in finding that a liquor license does not create a constitutionally protected property right entitling them to a trial-type hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Appellants rely first on <em>Hills Dev. Co. v. Twp. of Bernards, </em>229 <em>N.J.Super. </em>318, 551 A.2d 547 (App.Div.1988), arguing that we held that neighbors of a proposed affordable housing site had a sufficiently particularized property interest, entitling them to a contested case hearing. Appellants misconstrue our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">In <em>Hills Dev., </em>we concluded that the neighbors were entitled to a contested case hearing <em>by statute, </em>not by constitutional right. <em>Id. </em>at 336, 340-42, 551 A.2d 547. We noted that due process did not require a trial-type hearing to protect the neighbors\u2019 constitutional rights in their real estate because the proposed action (rezoning) did not amount to a talking, and the alleged decrease in value that the affordable housing might cause the neighbors\u2019 property did not \u201csignal the invasion of a right protected by due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 334-35, 551 A.2d 547.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Similarly in <em>Boss Co. v. Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, </em>40 <em>N.J. </em>379, 387-88, 192 A.2d 584 (1963), another ease on which appellants rely, the Court addressed the issue of \u201cwhether a liquor license and any rights thereunder are property or rights to property within the meaning of section 6321 of the Internal Revenue Code.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 383,192 A.2d 584. That issue implicated both state law on the nature of a liquor license and federal law on whether a federal lien may attach to the license. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">With respect to the state law, the Court first looked to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>33:1-26, which states that \u201c[ujnder no circumstances ... shall a [liquor] license, or rights thereunder, be deemed property[.]\u201d <em>Boss Co., supra, </em>40 <em>N.J. </em>at 383, 192 A.2d 584. The Court then discussed the nature of a liquor license and the rights that it creates in the licensee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-8\">A liquor license in New Jersey vests a personal right in the licensee to conduct a business otherwise illegal. As such, it is merely a temporary permit or privilege. But once granted, it is protected against arbitrary revocation, suspension or refusal to renew.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-9\">This license has value\u2014not merely the personal value to the licensee that inheres in the right to engage in the business of selling intoxicating liquors, but also the monetary value that arises from the power possessed by the licensee to substitute, with the municipal consent, some other person in his place as licensee. Moreover, in limited situations, the personal nature of the license is sacrificed so that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>value can justly accrue to the benefit of third parties. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>33:1-26 provides that if the operation of the business covered by the license devolves by operation of law upon a person other than the licensee, the issuing authority may, in its discretion, \u201cextend said license for a limited time, not exceeding its term, to the executor, administrator, trustee, receiver or other person upon whom the same has devolved by operation of law as aforesaid.\u201d If the license is extended, the holder thereof can exercise the same rights as the original licensee, and by conducting the business or converting the license into money by consenting to a person-to-person transfer, the estate of a deceased licensee will benefit or the assets available for creditors of a financially troubled licensee will be increased. Thus, the liquor license is a legal interest in the nature of an economic asset, created and protected by statute, and because it has monetary value and is transferable, either by consent of the licensee or by operation of law (in the special statutorily-described sense), it possesses the qualities of property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">[Boss <em>Co., supra, </em>40 <em>N.J. </em>at 384-85,192 A.2d 584 (internal citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">But, the Legislature had clearly stated in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>33:1-26 that a liquor licenses shall not be deemed property. <em>Boss Co., supra, </em>40 <em>N.J. </em>at 385, 192 A.2d 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">The Court recognized that it was presented with \u201c[t]he somewhat unusual situation ... [of] whether a liquor license can be classified as \u2018property\u2019 for federal purposes despite a legislative pronouncement to the contrary.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>It concluded that it could because a liquor license had value and created interests similar to property interests. <em>Id. </em>at 385-87, 192 A.2d 584. \u201cThus, as far as the federal government is concerned, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>33:1-26 cannot immunize liquor licenses from the attachment of federal liens\u201d because \u201c \u2018state law is inoperative to prevent the attachment of liens created by federal statutes in favor of the United States.\u2019 \u201d <em>Boss Co., supra, </em>40 <em>N.J. </em>at 387, 192 A.2d 584 (quoting <em>United States v. Bess, </em>357 <em>U.S. </em>51, 57, 78 <em>S.Ct. </em>1054, 1058, 2 L.Ed.2d 1135, 1141 (1958)).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">Additionally, said the Court, its decision was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-10\">consistent with the suggestion of Judge Francis that \u201cthe public interest requires liberal interpretation and application of the lien statute [section 6321] because such money is the life blood of government.\u201d The liquor license, although transferable, is still to be considered a temporary permit or privilege, and not property, as it always has been, even before our Legislature so declared by statute, and this consideration is to continue to govern the relationship between state and local government and the licensee. Likewise, the vitality of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>33:1-26 is in no way diminished and will continue to protect the liquor license from any device which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>would subject it to the control of persons other than the licensee, be it by pledge, lien, levy, attachment, execution, seizure for debts or the like. And finally, the sound discretion of the issuing authority to issue, renew or transfer liquor licenses will not be disturbed, for the seizure by the federal government merely obviates the necessity of securing the consent of the licensee to the transfer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\"><em>[Id, </em>at 387-88,192 A2d 584 (internal citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-6\"><em>Boss Co. </em>provides no support for appellants. A liquor license is \u201ca temporary permit or privilege, and not property ... and this consideration is to continue to govern the relationship between state and local government and the licensee.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The application of the federal lien law to the license does not alter this basic principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Appellants also rely on <em>Sea Girt Rest. &amp; Tavern Owners Ass\u2019n v. Borough of Sea Girt, </em>625 <em>F.Supp. </em>1482, 1485-88 (D.N.J.), <em>aff'd, </em>802 F.2d 445 (3d Cir.1986). There, holders of liquor licenses argued that <em>N.J.S.A </em>33:1-47.1, which provides for regulation of the hours of sale of intoxicating liquors by local referendum, violated the licensees\u2019 procedural due process rights because it did not afford them notice and an opportunity to be heard. <em>Sea Girt, supra, </em>625 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 1485.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">Relying on <em>Boss Co., supra, </em>40 <em>N.J. </em>at 384, 192 A.2d 584, the district court concluded that while a liquor license did not create a property right, it did create a property interest that was protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from arbitrary revocation, suspension or refusal to renew. <em>Sea Girt, supra, </em>625 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 1487. The licensees had a basis for asserting a procedural due process challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">The challenge lacked merit, however, because \u201cthe referendum process set forth in <em>N.J.S.A </em>33:1-47.1 constitutes a fair process of decision-making,\u201d <em>Sea Girt, supra, </em>625 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 1489-90, primarily because it allowed the licensees to be heard by campaigning against the proposed referendum. <em>Id. </em>at 1491. The court explained that procedural due process</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZc\">does not guarantee a uniform code of procedure. Although the fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner, the concept is flexible, calling for procedural protection as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>dictated by the particular circumstances. In other words, all that is required is \u201ca fair process of decision-making.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuR\"><em>[Id. </em>at 1489 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">The referendum process provided the licensees a fair opportunity to be heard; the statute did not violate the licensees\u2019 due process rights. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\"><em>Sea Girt </em>does not offer appellants any support. The decision confirms that a liquor license is not property, but it cannot be revoked, suspended or denied renewal without an adequate opportunity to be heard. Here, Fischer provided appellants an adequate opportunity to be heard by entertaining their various legal arguments and by affording them a hearing, which they notably did not attend.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">Appellants challenge Fischer\u2019s reliance on <em>In re Freshwater Wetlands Permits, supra, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>452, 888 A.2d 441, in finding that appellants did not have a particularized property interest in their liquor licenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">The objectors in <em>In re Freshwater Wetlands Permits </em>were neighboring property owners who had filed objections to a developer\u2019s application for a Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) permit to fill wetlands. <em>Id. </em>at 455, 888 A.2d 441. They claimed that flooding conditions on their properties would be exacerbated if the developer filled the wetlands. <em>Id. </em>at 455-56, 888 A.2d 441.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">Over a two-year period the DEP \u201cextensively examined the issue\u201d by meeting with the objectors, considering their expert reports and conducting on-site inspections. <em>Id. </em>at 456, 888 A.2d 441. Ultimately, the DEP issued the permit, and the neighbors appealed, claiming that to protect their property interests, due process required that they receive a trial-type hearing before an ALJ. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">The Supreme Court determined that the objectors were afforded not only a full opportunity to be heard by DEP during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>extensive permitting process, but also judicial review of the agency\u2019s decision granting the permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">Under the Administrative Procedure Act, \u201call interested persons are afforded reasonable opportunity to submit data, views or arguments, orally or in writing, during any proceedings involving a permit decision.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-3.1(a). In this case, the neighboring homeowners clearly were \u201cinterested persons\u201d and had a right to protest the issuance of a permit to fill wetlands on the [developer\u2019s] property. As landowners within 200 feet of the affected property, the neighbors received notice and, over a two-year period, submitted to the DEP their data, views, and arguments, both orally and in writing, objecting to the grant of a GP-6 permit. Under the FWPA regulations, they also received a \u201cpublic hearing,\u201d which is \u201can administrative non-adversarial type hearing before a representative or representatives of the [DEP] providing the opportunity for public comment, but does not include cross-examination.\u201d <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:7A-1.4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 463, 888 A2d 441.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">Further, the objectors would have an opportunity to present their objections to the planning board when it considered the developer\u2019s drainage system. <em>Id. </em>at 472, 888 A2d 441. The Court concluded that the process that the neighbors received, and would receive before the planning board, was sufficient to protect their interest without affording them a trial-type hearing before an ALJ. <em>Id. </em>at 471-73, 888 A2d 441.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">The Court underscored that \u201cdue process is a flexible and fact-sensitive concept.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 467, 888 A2d 441. Not every situation requires a trial-type hearing to satisfy its demands. <em>Ibid. </em>Rather, \u201cits demands ... [are] a function of what reason and justice require under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">We reject appellants\u2019 contention that <em>In re Freshwater Wetlands Permits </em>is distinguishable because unlike the objectors there, appellants\u2019 claims here are speculative. They claim, without specificity, that issuing Benihana a special concessionaire permit will, in fact, have a negative impact on their property. Instead, they complain that Fischer\u2019s refusal to allow them to conduct discovery inhibited their ability to \u201cput in quantifiable terms\u201d the negative effect that issuing the permit will have on their property. Presumably, they are referring to an economic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>impact, such as loss of profits. Such a contention is speculative, at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Appellants cannot predict the future nor contend with any degree of certainty that Benihana\u2019s sale of alcoholic beverages on its property will negatively impact their businesses. More importantly, even if they could establish such an impact, that negative effect is irrelevant in deciding whether Benihana is qualified to receive a special concessionaire permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">In <em>Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co. v. Point Pleasant Beach, </em>220 <em>N.J.Super. </em>119, 129, 531 A.2d 749 (App.Div.1987), we held that in deciding to issue a liquor license, the focus must be on the impact that the license will have on the \u201cpublic health, safety, morals and general welfare[,]\u201d and that a desire to protect other businesses from economic competition is an impermissible consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">We again reiterate the principle that we enunciated in <em>Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., </em>that the economic impact that granting a special concessionaire permit may have on appellants was not relevant in deciding whether Benihana was qualified to receive the permit. The asserted property interest does not entitle appellants to a trial-type hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">We also reject appellants\u2019 argument that our earlier decision mandated such a hearing. We earlier stated that appellants had to be afforded a hearing sufficient to allow them to \u201cdevelop and present arguments regarding the validity and appropriateness of the jurisdictional exercise, the accuracy and sufficiency of any of the grounds on which the exercise is to be based, and the impact of the exercise on their legal rights[.]\u201d <em>In re Xanadu Permits, supra, </em>392 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 583, 921 A.2d 1159.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">In our prior decision, we neither prescribed the nature of the hearing nor established the parameters of matters germane to Fischer\u2019s consideration of the application. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-10\">To the extent appellants have standing to develop and present arguments regarding the validity and appropriateness of the jurisdictional exercise, the accuracy and sufficiency of any of the grounds on which the exercise is to be based, and the impact of the exercise on their legal rights, they cannot be denied a fitting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>opportunity to do so on the administrative agency level. That right is recognized in the regulation itself governing the application process for special concessionaire permits, which establishes that any objectors must be afforded the opportunity for a hearing. On its face, that regulation contains no special standing criteria that an objector must meet. It presupposes that a hearing will be held if \u201ca duly signed written objection to the issuance of a special concessionaire permit\u201d is received by the Director. Precluding any objector with real standing from challenging the exercise of special-concessionaire-permit jurisdiction, or from raising any other grounds pertinent to such an application, would deny it a basic opportunity to protect its property interests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-5\">We find no fault with the Director\u2019s assertion of subject matter jurisdiction as a way of beginning the evaluative process, but the underlying issues may not proceed to final resolution on the administrative level before the objections raised by appellants receive an appropriate hearing. That opportunity is assured by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:2-5.2. To be certain these appellants\u2019 rights are exercised in a timely and sufficient manner, they should receive specific notice of the applications from the Director, in addition to the notice by publication provided in subsections (c), (d), and (e) of the regulation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\"><em>[In re Xanadu Permits, supra, </em>392 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 583-84, 921 A.2d 1159. (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Nothing we said mandated a trial-type hearing. Given appellants\u2019 limited interest in their liquor licenses and the speculative nature of their claim that Benihana\u2019s permit will negatively impact their businesses, Fischer appropriately declined appellants\u2019 request for a trial-type hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">We likewise reject appellants\u2019 claim that in considering their objections, Fischer \u201cimproperly prohibited\u201d them \u201cfrom developing arguments\u201d regarding whether (1) Benihana had entered a contract with NJSEA; (2) NJSEA had effectively ceded control of Xanadu to the developer; (3) the building in which Benihana would operate was a public building, as that term is used in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:2-5.2; (4) other special concessionaire permits throughout the State were allowed to sell alcoholic beverages without limitations; and (5) the issuance of a special concessionaire permit to Benihana will impact appellants\u2019 property rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">Fischer did not consider whether others who hold special concessionaire permits are allowed to sell alcoholic beverages without limitations, as that issue had no relevance to the criteria for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>receiving a special concessionaire permit. He considered and decided the other presented issues. That Fischer decided those four issues on the briefs and evidence submitted to him prior to the hearing is insignificant. Administrative disputes may be summarily decided when they do not involve disputed facts. <em>Contini v. Bd. of Educ. of Newark, </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>106, 120, 668 A.2d 434 (App.Div.1995) (providing that summary decisions may be issued in administrative disputes, even when the disputes rise to the level of contested cases), <em>certif. denied, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>372, 678 A.2d 713 (1996); <em>In re Farmers\u2019 Mut. Fire Assurance Ass\u2019n of N.J., </em>256 <em>N.J.Super. </em>607, 618, 607 A.2d 1019 (App.Div.1992) (\u201cAn evidentiary hearing is mandated only when the proposed administrative action is based on disputed adjudicatory facts.\u201d). There were no disputed facts related to these issues and Fischer properly disposed of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">We find no merit in appellants\u2019 claim that Fischer erroneously precluded them from \u201cinquiring] into the relationship of the NJSEA to the Xanadu Project\u201d by relying on principles of collateral estoppel and res judicata. Fischer correctly included in his order that he would not \u201creview the appropriateness of the entire Meadowlands Xanadu Project\u201d because we had addressed the issue and had concluded that NJSEA had authority to undertake the Xanadu project. Fischer was under no obligation to revisit the issues addressed and resolved by us in <em>Hartz Mountain Indus., Inc. v. N.J. Sports &amp; Exposition Auth., </em>369 <em>N.J.Super. </em>175, 187-88, 848 A.2d 793 (App.Div.) (providing that by statute, NJSEA is authorized to undertake the Xanadu project), <em>certif. denied, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>147, 862 A.2d 56 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">Fischer refused to entertain appellants\u2019 arguments on the appropriateness of the Xanadu project because those arguments were not relevant to whether Benihana was qualified to receive a special concessionaire permit and because Fischer had no jurisdiction to decide the propriety of the Xanadu project. Fischer said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaI\">I do not find that the provision in <em>N.J.AC. </em>13:2-5.2 that requires me to determine whether Benihana[\u2019s] application for a Special Concessionaire Permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>should be granted, also mandates that I review the appropriateness of the entire Meadowlands Xanadu project. This, however, seems to be exactly what the objectors are requesting ... [by raising as an issue] whether Meadowlands Xanadu falls within the scope of NJSEA\u2019s statute and whether NJSEA has ceded control over Xanadu to the developer. Issues addressing the nature of the agreement between the developer and the NJSEA or challenging their agreement are not properly before me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\">My role as ABC Director cannot function as a collateral attack on another agency\u2019s duly considered and enacted project. I do not, and cannot, set policy for other state agencies. Yet, the objectors ask me to accept arguments which have the effect of overruling the decisions of the NJSEA and potentially end[ing] the Meadowlands Xanadu project. The jurisdiction for a review of these NJSEA determinations does not lie at the ABC.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Citing <em>Hartz Mountain Indus., supra, </em>369 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 192, 848 A.2d 793, Fischer noted that \u201cthe Appellate Division has already completed such a review and found that the NJSEA had the authority to select the Xanadu project.\u201d He was correct in his analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Finally, we reject appellants\u2019 complaint that Fischer did not allow them to conduct discovery and cross-examine witnesses, thereby prejudicing their ability to oppose Benihana\u2019s application. They do not explain how they were prejudiced by the lack of discovery or what information they wanted to discover, other than to say that because they did not have a copy of Benihana\u2019s lease, they \u201cwere unable to address, among other things, the financial interest of the Developer in Benihana\u2019s Special Concessionaire Permit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">In sum, the hearing opportunity afforded appellants is consistent with our earlier instruction that appellants be afforded a hearing and \u201cfitting opportunity\u201d to be heard on the relevant issues. They were afforded that opportunity and chose not to participate. They cannot be heard to complain at this stage of the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">Appellants next contend that Benihana did not satisfy the following two requirements contained in <em>N.J.AC. </em>13:2-5.2(a) to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>receive a special concessionaire permit: (1) the applicant has entered a contract with the State or its political subdivision authorizing the applicant to sell alcoholic beverages, (2) in any public building or on property owned by, or under the control of, the State or its political subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Fischer found that Benihana had satisfied these criteria because on August 9, 2007, NJSEA and Benihana had entered into an agreement authorizing Benihana to sell alcoholic beverages on property that NJSEA owned, and NJSEA retained sufficient control and oversight of the Xanadu project, pursuant to the terms of its ground lease with the developer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">On appeal, appellants do not dispute that NJSEA and Benihana entered into a contract on August 9, 2007. Rather, they argue that the contract is invalid for lack of consideration. They refer to the contract\u2019s provision that \u201cconsideration consisted of the NJSEA\u2019s obligation to grant a subtenant [of the developer] the right to sell and serve alcoholic beverages and cooperate in procuring\u201d a special concessionaire permit. Appellants urge that pursuant to the ground lease between NJSEA and the developer, NJSEA was already obligated to do those things.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">This argument is without merit. In the ground lease, NJSEA had agreed to cooperate with the developer\u2019s subtenants\u2019 efforts to obtain a special concessionaire permit if the subtenant convinced NJSEA that it satisfied the criteria for receiving a special concessionaire permit and if the sale of alcoholic beverages in the requested location complied with the master plan for the Xanadu project. NJSEA was not required to sign an agreement with a subtenant if the subtenant did not meet those conditions. In entering an agreement with a subtenant, NJSEA\u2019s consideration was a waiver of the right to not have alcoholic beverages served on its property.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Appellants contend that the contract between NJSEA and Benihana was a \u201c \u2018sham\u2019 created to perpetuate the illusion of a duly formed contractual relationship that does not exist, and does not at all resemble the kind of contractual relationship which the regulation was designed to address.\u201d They claim that \u201c[t]he archetypal example of such a contractual relationship would be the relationship between the NJSEA and the beer vendors at a stadium: the classic, intended purpose for the Special Concessionaire Permit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">We quickly dispose of this argument. NJSEA and Benihana entered the contract to satisfy the requirements of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:2-5.2(a). If that rendered the contract a sham, every contract entered for purposes of receiving a special concessionaire permit would be a sham. To the extent appellants challenge the agreement because Benihana is not NJSEA\u2019s direct tenant, but rather a subtenant of the developer\u2019s, that challenge also lacks merit. Nothing in the relevant statutes and regulations precludes a subtenant from applying for a special concessionaire permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Next, appellants challenge Fischer\u2019s finding that Benihana established the state-property criterion. Fischer found that Benihana had satisfied this criterion because the real estate on which the building that Benihana occupied was owned by NJSEA, and NJSEA retained control over the building by way of its control and oversight of the Xanadu project. He explained that the ground lease between NJSEA and the developer provided that during the seventy-five-year term of the lease, the developer would own the buildings located on the real estate. But when the lease expired, NJSEA would own the buddings in fee simple. Appellants argued that the developer\u2019s ownership of the buddings, coupled with the fact that the lease was long-term, effectively divested NJSEA of its ownership rights in the property, but Fischer disagreed. NJSEA had no obligation to renew the lease at its expiration, and at its expiration, the developer would be divested of its ownership rights in the buddings.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>Appellants now claim that Fischer misconstrued the meaning of the state-property criterion. According to appellants, <em>N.JAC. </em>13:2-5.2(a)\u2019s providing that the proposed sale of alcoholic beverages must take place \u201cin any public building or on any property owned by or under the control of the State\u201d means that the sale must take place either in a public building, which all agree is not the case here, or on property, such as a marina or entertainment facility, located outside of or adjacent to a public building. Benihana is not located outside of or adjacent to a public building, and it is not a marina or entertainment facility. Appellants reason Benihana failed to satisfy the state-property criterion.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">To support their interpretation of the state-property criterion, appellants rely on prior amendments to <em>N.JAC. </em>13:2-5.2 and accompanying comments. <em>N.JAC. </em>13:2-5.2 was first adopted in 1979. At that time the regulation did not allow for the sale of alcoholic beverages for off-premises consumption. 18 <em>N.J.R. </em>545 (March 17, 1986). In 1986, the regulation was amended to allow for off-premises consumption to accommodate retailers located within Penn Station, Newark, which the New Jersey Transit Authority had acquired in 1986. <em>Ibid. </em>In relation to that amendment, the regulation was changed to refer to the sale of alcoholic beverages \u201cin any public building owned by or under the control of\u2019 the State or its political subdivision, instead of \u201cproperty\u201d owned by the State. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">In 1990, <em>N.JAC. </em>13:2-5.2 was again amended \u201cto allow and permit consumption in not only a public building but on any property owned by or under the control of the political subdivision.\u201d 22 <em>N.J.R. </em>1813 (June 18,1990). The ABC explained: \u201cThis amendment is proposed since on several occasions the proposed lease of the premises includes property immediately adjacent to the building, such as a marina or entertainment facility.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Appellants contend that this comment shows that the \u201con any property owned by the State\u201d language refers only to property, like marinas and entertainment facilities, that are immediately adjacent to the public building.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>As did Fischer, we reject this argument. Fischer explained that marinas and entertainment facilities were merely examples of the types of properties that could be adjacent to public buildings. The regulation did not limit the types of properties that qualified as \u201cany property.\u201d Rather, Fischer said, the amendment expanded the types of property that qualified as state owned or controlled. But even if appellants\u2019 restrictive reading of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:2\u20145.2(a) were correct, Benihana satisfied the criterion because Xanadu was an entertainment facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The amendments and comments to <em>N.J.AC. </em>13:2-5.2(a) do not support appellants\u2019 restrictive reading of the regulation but rather demonstrate that the regulation was expanded to first allow for the sale of alcoholic beverages for off-site consumption (the 1986 amendment) then to allow for the sale of alcoholic beverages on any property owned by or under the control of the State or its political subdivision (the 1990 amendment). Here, NJSEA owned the real estate; the regulating requirements were met.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Appellants dispute that the real estate on which Benihana was located was owned by NJSEA, arguing that the seventy-five-year lease in this ease effectively created a fee simple ownership interest in the developer.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">We reject this argument; the lease did not divest NJSEA of its ownership rights because it had a definitive end date, it was not perpetually renewable, and NJSEA had no obligation to renew it.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">Finally, appellants challenge Fischer\u2019s finding that NJSEA retained control over the property. They contend that the ground lease requires the NJSEA to enter into a concessionaire agreement with the developer\u2019s subtenants so long as the subtenant satisfies the prerequisites stated in the ground lease. But, appellants say, NJSEA does not have \u201cthe right to designate which premises may be permitted to sell alcohol nor the right to grant approval to an individual tenant or operator prior to its application to ABC.\u201d This lack of control, coupled with the length of the ground lease, demonstrates that NJSEA does not retain owner<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>ship or sufficient control over the property to satisfy the second criterion in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:2-5.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">This argument lacks merit as well. Even if NJSEA lacked sufficient control over the property, Benihana nonetheless satisfied the state-property criterion because NJSEA owns the real estate. Fischer correctly found that NJSEA retained control over the property because the ground lease required the developer to redevelop the property in accordance with the Xanadu master plan, and NJSEA had the right to inspect the property for compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Finally, appellants contend that issuing a special concessionaire permit to Benihana violates the policy of the ABC Act. They cite <em>N.J.S.A. </em>33:1-12.14, which limits the number of plenary retail consumption and seasonal retail consumption licenses within a municipality by the population within the municipality and contend that granting special concessionaire permits to Xanadu tenants will result in an excess number of retailers selling alcoholic beverages within a municipality. They complain that Fischer\u2019s decision to issue special concessionaire permits to Xanadu tenants will effectively make it \u201ceasier to sell alcohol on property owned by a State Entity than on property privately owned.\u201d They underscore that plenary licenses to sell alcoholic beverages are expensive, but special concessionaire permits cost a mere $2,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">We easily dispose of this argument. The Director\u2019s authority to issue a special concessionaire permit comes directly from the ABC Act, namely <em>N.J.S.A. </em>33:1-42, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-10\">No sales of alcoholic beverages shall be made in any public buildings belonging to or under the control of the state or any political subdivision thereof except as to the national guard as hereinbefore provided, and except as permitted by the commissioner in specified eases and subject to rules and regulations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">Appellants\u2019 contention that issuing special concessionaire permits is somehow inconsistent with the ABC Act is baseless. The Legislature\u2019s intent is clear and explicit.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>We conclude that Fischer correctly issued the special concessionaire permit to Benihana, and his determination was not arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b216-8\"> Referring to <em>In re Application of Bayshore Rest.
