Harris appeals the 85-month sentence imposed following his conviction by a jury of eight counts of mail fraud related to a Ponzi scheme. In his sole issue on appeal, he contends that the district court erred by imposing a two-level vulnerable victim enhancement. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">A defendant may receive a two-level increase in his offense level if he \u201cknew or should have known that a victim of the offense was a vulnerable victim.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l). The commentary explains that a \u201cvulnerable victim\u201d means a victim of the offense \u201cwho is unusually vulnerable due to age, physical or mental condition, or who is otherwise particularly susceptible to the criminal conduct.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.1, comment (n. 2). This court ordinarily reviews the determination of unusual vulnerability for clear error. <em>See United States v. Angeles-Mendoza, </em>407 F.3d 742, 747 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">The district court relied on the testimony of Harris\u2019s aunt, Lepora Paige, that she told Harris she had cancer and wanted to invest money so that her children would have money to bury her. <em>See United States v. Gieger, </em>190 F.3d 661, 665 (5th Cir.1999). Harris contends that the district court misconstrued Ms. Paige\u2019s testimony as indicating that she was dying of cancer at the time she decided to invest when, in fact, she had been cancer free for five years. Harris did not challenge the district court\u2019s purported mischaracterization at the time of sentencing. We need not decide whether the more stringent plain error standard applies, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 455-56 (5th Cir.2005), because the enhancement passes muster under the clearly erroneous standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-16\">Harris does not dispute that he knew that Ms. Paige had been diagnosed with breast cancer at some point. Even if she had been cancer free for five years at the time she invested, as Harris maintains, her testimony demonstrates that she remained fearful that she might still die of cancer and wanted to invest her money to cover her funeral costs. Harris told her that in the event she died, he would send money to her children. The district court reasonably could have concluded that Ms. Paige was thus more susceptible to Harris\u2019s fraudulent investment scheme than the average person, and that Harris knew of and exploited that vulnerability. Thus, the district court\u2019s conclusion that Ms. Paige was a vulnerable victim was not clearly erroneous. <em>See Angeles-Mendoza, </em>407 F.3d at 747. We need not reach the parties\u2019 alternative arguments regarding whether any other victims were vulnerable due to age or other factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-17\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b445-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
