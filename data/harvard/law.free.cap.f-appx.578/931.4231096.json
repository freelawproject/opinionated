In her petition, Cho argues that the BIA erred in determining that she was ineligible for the waiver because her husband and children are not qualifying relatives under INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(H), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(H) since they were not \u201clawfully admitted for permanent residence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">Cho was originally admitted to the United States in 2003 on a B-2 non-immigrant visa. She hired an immigration attorney who substituted her name for another alien on an already approved application for an alien employment certification. She then filed an 1-140 visa petition and an I-485 application for adjustment of status. Based on these documents, Cho\u2019s status was adjusted to lawful permanent resident (LPR) in 2005. Five years later, she was convicted of visa fraud in federal court, and subsequently placed in removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">At a master calendar hearing, Cho stipulated that her immigrant visa was procured by fraud but stated that the fraud was attributable only to her lawyer, not herself. In any event, Cho does not dispute that she is removable based on the charge that she procured her visa through fraud. She challenges whether she was eligible for a waiver under INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(H) based on her lack of a qualifying relative. The BIA held that Cho is ineligible for a waiver of deportability under \u00a7 237(a)(1)(H) of the INA, because her putative qualifying relatives \u2014 her spouse and children \u2014 were not \u201clawfully admitted for permanent residence\u201d as their status was derivative of her own permanent resident status, which was void from its inception because it was procured through fraud. According to the BIA, derivative beneficiaries may not be lawfully admitted for permanent residence until the \u201cprincipal alien\u201d has been lawfully admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Here, the BIA disagreed in part with the IJ\u2019s opinion and did not expressly adopt it, so we will review only the BIA\u2019s decision. We review the BIA\u2019s legal determinations <em>de novo. Mejia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>498 F.3d 1253, 1256 (11th Cir.2007). We defer to the BIA\u2019s reasonable interpretation of ambiguous terms contained in the INA pursuant to <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). <em>Poveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>692 F.3d 1168, 1176 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">An unauthorized immigrant who procures a visa or admission into the United States through \u201cfraud or willfully misrepresenting a material fact\u201d is inadmissible. INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(i). This ground for inadmissibility may be waived for an immigrant who, among other requirements, \u201cis the spouse, parent, son, or daughter of a citizen of the United States or of an alien lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence.\u201d INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(H), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(H).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-11\">The INA defines the phrase \u201clawfully admitted for permanent residence\u201d to mean \u201cthe status of having been lawfully accorded the privilege of residing permanently in the United States as an immigrant in accordance with the immigration laws, such status not having changed.\u201d INA \u00a7 101(a)(20), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(20). Immigration regulations contain the same definition and add the sentence: \u201cSuch status terminates upon entry of a final administrative order of exclusion, deportation, or removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>The BIA has interpreted this phrase to mean that an immigrant who acquired permanent resident status through fraud or misrepresentation has never been \u201clawfully admitted for permanent residence.\u201d <em>In re Koloamatangi, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 548, 549-50 (BIA 2003). The BIA has therefore held \u201cthat the correct interpretation of the term \u2018lawfully admitted for permanent residence\u2019 is that an alien is deemed, <em>ab initio, </em>never to have obtained lawful permanent resident status once his original ineligibility therefore] is determined in proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 551. We have deferred to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of that term. <em>Savoury v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>449 F.3d 1307, 1313-17 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that an immigrant whose status was readjusted to permanent, resident due to a mistake by the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) had not been \u201clawfully admitted for permanent residence\u201d and was thus properly deemed inadmissible). Therefore, we held that an immigrant\u2019s permanent resident status was void from inception because he was never \u201clawfully admitted for permanent residence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">We have not previously considered whether the rationale from <em>Koloamatangi </em>and <em>Savoury </em>applies to invalidate the immigration status of family members, but the Ninth Circuit has held that it does. <em>See Kyong Ho Shin v. Holder, </em>607 F.3d 1213, 1216-18 (9th Cir.2010). In that case, two siblings obtained their LPR status derivatively from their mother, who received her LPR status through a criminal scheme run by a former INS officer. <em>Id. </em>at 1214-15. Under these circumstances, the validity of the siblings\u2019 visas turned on \u201cwhether [the mother\u2019s] admission for permanent residence was \u2018lawful\u2019 in nature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1216. The Ninth Circuit determined that the mother was never \u201clawfully admitted\u201d and her children, therefore, \u201ccannot validate their visas on the basis that she was an LPR until ordered removed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1217-18. In discussing derivative beneficiaries, the BIA has written \u201cthat the right of a derivative beneficiary to permanent resident status is wholly dependent upon that of the principal alien and may not be exercised unless and until the principal alien becomes a permanent resident.\u201d <em>Matter of Naulu, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 351, 353 (BIA 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">We find that the BIA correctly determined that Cho was ineligible for a waiver under INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(H) because her husband and children were not \u201clawfully admitted for permanent residence.\u201d Their status as lawful permanent residents was derivative of Cho\u2019s own status, which was void from its inception because it was procured through fraud. <em>See Koloamatangi, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 549-51; <em>Savoury, </em>449 F.3d at 1313-17. Accordingly, the BIA correctly dismissed Cho\u2019s appeal, and we deny her petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
