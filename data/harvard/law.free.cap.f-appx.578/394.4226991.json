Gonzalez sued Fausto Avila, James W. Jones, Lisa D. Vatani, and Valerie Steiner pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, claiming they were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs. We review a summary judgment de novo. <em>Xtreme Lashes, LLC v. Xtended Beauty, Inc., </em>576 F.3d 221, 226 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-20\">There is no indication in the record, viewed in the light most favorable to Gonzalez, that the defendants refused to treat him, ignored his complaints, intentionally treated him incorrectly, or engaged in conduct that clearly demonstrates a wanton disregard for his medical needs. <em>See Domino v. Tex. Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, </em>239 F.3d 752, 756 (5th Cir.2001). The defendants were responsive to Gonzalez\u2019s medical needs, prescribed medication to treat him, renewed the medicaton when needed, and referred him to a dermatologist. There is no evidence in the record that the defendants\u2019 failure to provide the specific size of clotrimazole Gonzalez requested was unreasonable, <em>cf. Burton v. Owens, </em>511 Fed.Appx. 385, 389-90 (5th Cir.2013), or that defendant Jones deliberately prescribed Gonzalez triamcinolone to harm him. Prescribing triamcinolone for Gonzalez\u2019s condition was medical malpractice at most, and committing malpractice is insufficient to show deliberate indifference. <em>Gobert v. Caldwell, </em>463 F.3d 339, 346 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>In light of the foregoing, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b420-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
