We granted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Government\u2019s unopposed motion to consolidate these cases on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">\n<em>Case No. 13-41298</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">We review for plain error Diaz-De Trevino\u2019s argument that the district court procedurally erred by failing to adequately explain the revocation sentence. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009); <em>United States v. Fernandez-Cusco, </em>447 F.3d 382, 384 (5th Cir.2006). Although the district court provided reasons for its sentence, little explanation is required for a within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005). Diaz-De Trevino\u2019s attempt to show plain error is even more difficult as she challenges a revocation sentence, and we have \u201cnot yet required district courts to expressly state their reasons for selecting a revocation sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Cantrell, </em>236 Fed.Appx. 66, 69 (5th Cir.2007) (per curiam) (unpublished). For these reasons, Diaz-De Trevino can show no error, plain or otherwise. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The judgment in No. 13-41298 is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">\n<em>Case No. 13-U308</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">Counsel appointed to represent Diaz-De Trevino on appeal in her illegal reentry case has filed a motion to withdraw and a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Diaz-De Trevino has not filed a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">We have reviewed counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief and the relevant portions of the record. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL in No. 13-41308 IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b471-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
