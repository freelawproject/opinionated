Middleton argues, for the first time, that his pleas were not entered knowingly and voluntarily; the district court failed to allow him to allocute before imposing his sentence; and the district court failed to solicit objections after imposing the sentence. Middleton also argues that the district court miscalculated his sentence and that his sentence is unreasonable. We affirm Middleton\u2019s convictions, but because he was not afforded an opportunity to allocute, we vacate Middleton\u2019s sentence and remand for resentenc-ing. In the light of our disposition, we need not address Middleton\u2019s remaining arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-11\">Because Middleton failed to present to the district court his arguments about the validity of his guilty pleas and his right to allocute, we review for plain error. Before we can correct an error not presented to the district court, the defendant must establish that an error occurred that was plain and that affected his substantial rights. <em>United States v. Perez, </em>661 F.3d 568, 583 (11th Cir.2011). If those elements are satisfied, we may exercise our discretion to correct the error if it \u201cseriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of a judicial proceeding.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b908-12\">The district court did not plainly err by accepting Middleton\u2019s pleas of guilty. Middleton argues that the district court failed to comply with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(b) to ensure that his guilty pleas were knowing and voluntary, but the district court questioned Middleton to determine whether he understood the crimes charged against him and the elements of those crimes; the rights he was waiving by pleading guilty; and the penalties for his offenses. See <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>751 F.3d 1244, 1254 (11th Cir.2014). Under further question<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>ing by the prosecutor, Middleton acknowledged that he was not coerced to change his pleas to guilty and that the factual basis in his written plea agreement was accurate. Middleton agreed to waive his right to appeal his sentence and argues that the district court failed to explain adequately the consequences of his waiver, but even if we were to assume that the district court plainly erred, that did not affect Middleton\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1299 (11th Cir.2005). Middleton has not been prejudiced because the government waives enforcement of the waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">Middleton is entitled to a new sentencing hearing because the district court plainly erred by failing to give him an opportunity to alloeute. The district court failed, \u201cbefore imposing sentence, ... [to] address [Middleton] personally in order to permit [him] to speak or present any information to mitigate the sentence.\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 32(i)(4)(A). The district court invited Middleton to \u201cplace on the record ... anything [he wished] regarding the contents in the [presentence investigation] report,\u201d but Middleton was not allowed to \u201cplead personally to the court for leniency in his sentence by stating mitigating factors and to have that plea considered by the court in determining the appropriate sentence,\u201d <em>United States v. Tamayo, </em>80 F.3d 1514, 1518 (11th Cir.1996). The district court asked Middleton\u2019s attorney if there was \u201canything [he] wish[ed] to state at this time,\u201d but the inquiry directed \u201cto counsel [did] not adequately protect [Middleton\u2019s] right of allocution.\u201d <em>Perez, </em>661 F.3d at 585; <em>see Gordon v. United States, </em>518 F.3d 1291, 1299 (11th Cir.2008). The failure to allow Middleton to alloeute affected his substantial rights because his sentence of 70 months exceeded the low end of his advisory sentencing range of 63 months. <em>See Perez, </em>661 F.3d at 586. And the \u201cdenial of [Middleton\u2019s] right to allo-eute affects the fairness, integrity, and public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Prouty, </em>303 F.3d 1249, 1253 (11th Cir.2002)). We exercise our discretion to correct the error in Middleton\u2019s sentencing hearing because \u201c[flailing to give a defendant the opportunity to speak to the court directly when it might affect his sentence is manifestly unjust.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Prouty, </em>303 F.3d at 1253).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">The government argues that Middleton was given an \u201cinvitation to object to his sentence before it was finalized,\u201d but we disagree. The district court announced Middleton\u2019s sentence in futuristic terms by stating that it was \u201cgoing to sentence [Middleton] to 70 months,\u201d but the district court also stated that it was imposing 3 years of supervised release, a $200 special assessment, and a forfeiture of his access devices. The district court did not revisit the subject of Middleton\u2019s sentence and proceeded to ask Middleton if \u201cthere [was] anything [he]\u2019d like to state to the Court now that [he][had] been sentenced.\u201d Because the district court failed to \u201cclearly inform [Middleton] of his allocution rights\u201d and to \u201cissuef ] [him] a personal invitation to speak prior to sentencing,\u201d <em>United States v. Gerrow, </em>232 F.3d 831, 833 (11th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Green v. United States, </em>365 U.S. 301, 305, 81 S.Ct. 653, 655, 5 L.Ed.2d 670 (1961)), we must vacate his sentence and remand for the district court to conduct a new sentencing hearing. During that hearing, the district court must give' Middleton an opportunity \u201cto speak or present any information to mitigate the sentence\u201d before his sentence is imposed. Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(4)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">We AFFIRM Middleton\u2019s convictions, but we VACATE his sentence and REMAND for resentencing in compliance with Rule 32(i)(4)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
