Martinez moved for and was denied a judgment of acquittal when the prosecution rested and again at the close of all of the evidence. <em>See United States v. Frye, </em>489 F.3d 201, 207 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-22\">On appeal, Martinez argues that the district court erred by denying his motions for acquittal because no rational juror could have found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on either count of conviction. \u201cWhen reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, this Court views all evidence, whether circumstantial or direct, in the light most favorable to the Government with all reasonable inferences to be made in support of the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Terrell, </em>700 F.3d 755, 760 (5th Cir.2012) (internal brackets, quotation marks, and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1834, 185 L.Ed.2d 843 (2013). We consider whether <em>\u201cany </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Vargas-Ocampo, </em>747 F.3d 299, 301 (5th Cir.2014) (en banc) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(June 24, 2014) (No. 13-10737).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-24\">Addressing the first count, \u201ccoercion and enticement in violation of ... \u00a7 2422(b), ... requires the government to prove that (1) [Martinez] used a facility of interstate commerce to commit the offense; (2) he was aware that [the minor] was younger than eighteen; (3) by engaging in sexual activity with [the minor], he could have been charged with a criminal offense un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>der Texas law; and (4) he knowingly persuaded, induced, enticed, or coerced [the minor] to engage in criminal sexual activity.\u201d <em>United States v. Rounds, </em>749 F.3d 326, 333 (5th Cir.2014). Addressing the second count of conviction, an individual commits the offense of transportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity in violation of \u00a7 2423(a) if he \u201cknowingly transports an individual who has not attained the age of 18 years in interstate ... commerce ... with intent that the individual engage in ... any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense.\u201d \u00a7 2423(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Martinez does not state which of these elements was not met but argues that there was evidence that he was in love with the minor and desired to marry her. Our review of the evidence presented at trial, including the testimony of the minor and Martinez\u2019s admissions, compels the conclusion that Martinez\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence must fail. <em>See Vargas-Ocampo, </em>747 F.3d 299, 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b388-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
