She argues that the IJ erred by admitting a document from a prior immigration proceeding because it was not submitted 15 days prior to the immigration hearing. She also contends that the BIA legally erred in concluding that she failed to establish that her United States citizen children would suffer exceptional and extremely unusual hardship as a result of her removal to India. Because the BIA based its decision on Kaur\u2019s failure to meet the hardship requirement without expressing an opinion on the remainder of the IJ\u2019s findings, Kaur contends that the BIA\u2019s decision is unclear.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-22\">We are statutorily barred from reviewing the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s purely discretionary denial of cancellation of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Sung v. Keisler, </em>505 F.3d 372, 377 (5th Cir.2007). This jurisdiction-stripping provision does not preclude review of constitutional claims or questions of law. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Sung, </em>505 F.3d at 377. However, we look past an alien\u2019s framing of an issue and will decline to consider \u201can abuse of discretion argument cloaked in constitutional garb.\u201d <em>Hadwani v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 798, 801 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks, citation, and alteration omitted). Because Kaur\u2019s arguments challenging the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s assessment of the hardship factors are nothing more than a disagreement with the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s weighing of the factors underlying the discretionary hardship determination, we lack jurisdiction over that challenge. <em>See Sung, </em>505 F.3d at 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-23\">Kaur\u2019s challenge to the admission of the document at trial implicates her due process rights, which we have jurisdiction to consider. <em>See id. </em>at 377. We review a due process challenge de novo. <em>Bouchikhi v. Holder, </em>676 F.3d 173, 180 (5th Cir.2012). As Kaur concedes, evidence used for purposes of impeachment are not required to be submitted 15 days prior to the immigration hearing. The IJ admitted the document over Kaur\u2019s objection because the IJ ruled that the document was being used to impeach Kaur. Because examination of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>transcript supports that ruling and Kauris challenge to the admission of the document is based solely upon the alleged violation of the' 15-day submission period, Kaur has failed to show that the IJ\u2019s decision violated due process standards of fundamental fairness. <em>See id. </em>Moreover, to the extent that Kauris challenge to the clarity of the BIA\u2019s decision is reviewable as a legal question, her challenge lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Accordingly, Kauris petition for review is DISMISSED IN PART for lack of jurisdiction and DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b427-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
