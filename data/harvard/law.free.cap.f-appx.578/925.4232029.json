On appeal, Barrera argues that the district court erroneously believed that it lacked authority to depart downward under the Sentencing Guidelines on the basis of cultural assimilation. He contends that, had the court known of its authority, he would have received a shorter sentence. Barrera also argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable in light of the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), because the court placed undue weight on his criminal history and failed to consider mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-19\">I. Failure to Depart Downward for Cultural Assimilation</p>\n<p id=\"b952-20\">We lack jurisdiction to consider a defendant\u2019s appeal of a discretionary decision of the district court to not apply a downward departure. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005). However, we may review <em>de novo </em>a claim that the district court mistakenly believed that it lacked authority to grant such a departure. <em>United States v. Mignott, </em>184 F.3d 1288, 1289 (11th Cir.1999). When nothing in the record indicates otherwise, we assume that the district court understood that it had the authority to depart downward. <em>United States v. Dudley, </em>463 F.3d 1221, 1228 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-4\">Contrary to Barrera\u2019s arguments, nothing in the record suggests that the district court mistakenly believed that it lacked authority to grant a downward departure. <em>See Dudley, </em>463 F.3d at 1228; <em>Mignott, </em>184 F.3d at 1289. The statement upon which Barrera relies \u2014 that missing family members did not constitute justification for returning to this country in violation of the law \u2014 means precisely that: Barrera\u2019s conduct is not rendered legal because of his family situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">II. Substantive Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">We review the reasonableness of a final sentence imposed by a district court under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445, 447 (2007). We first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, and then examine whether the sentence was substantively reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. Although we do not presume that a sentence falling within the guideline range is reasonable, we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008). The party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of showing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">The district court must impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in 18 U.S.C \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). In imposing a particular sentence, the court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the' offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">The weight given to any specific \u00a7 3553(a) factor is committed to the sound discretion of the district court. <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007). A court can abuse its discretion when it (1) fails to consider relevant factors that were due significant weight, (2) gives an improper or irrelevant factor significant weight, or (3) commits a clear error of judgment by balancing the proper factors unreasonably. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en banc). </em>Moreover, a district court\u2019s unjustified reliance on any one \u00a7 3553(a) factor may be a symptom of an unreasonable sentence. <em>United States v. Crisp, </em>454 F.3d 1285, 1292 (11th Cir.2006). However, an acknowledgment by the court that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is sufficient, and it need not discuss each factor expressly. <em>United States v. Garza-Mendez, </em>735 F.3d 1284, 1290 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-10\">Barrera\u2019s 57-month sentence is reasonable. The sentence is supported by the record and meets the goals encompassed within 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>though Barrera argues that the court placed undue emphasis on his criminal history without properly considering mitigating factors, the record shows that the court expressly acknowledged positive aspects of Barrera\u2019s recent life changes. Nonetheless, the court concluded that it could not overlook his extensive and violent criminal history. In addition, the court stated that it had listened to the parties\u2019 arguments and considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in imposing the sentence. <em>See Garza-Mendez, </em>735 F.3d at 1290. Accordingly, Barrera fails to demonstrate that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Tome, </em>611 F.3d at 1378.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
