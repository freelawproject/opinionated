He argues that: (1) the district court erred by denying his motion to suppress evidence of cocaine; and (2) the district court abused its discretion by denying his motion for a mistrial. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-10\">We apply a mixed standard of review to the denial of a motion to suppress, reviewing factual findings for clear error and the application of law to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Boyce, </em>351 F.3d 1102, 1105 (11th Cir.2003). We construe all facts in a light most favorable to the prevailing party. <em>Id. </em>We review <em>de novo </em>a court\u2019s determination of probable cause, <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996), and constitutional errors, <em>United States v. O\u2019Keefe, </em>461 F.3d 1338, 1346 (11th Cir.2006). We accept testimony deemed credible by the district court unless it violates laws of nature or is so inconsistent that no reasonable factfinder would accept it. <em>United States v. Ramirez-Chilel, </em>289 F.3d 744, 749 (11th Cir.2002). Finally, we review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion for mistrial. <em>United States v. Chastain, </em>198 F.3d 1338, 1351 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-13\">First, we reject Blackmon\u2019s claim that the court should have suppressed cocaine found during a consensual search of the vehicle he was riding in because the officer lacked probable cause for the initial traffic stop. An officer is permitted to conduct a warrantless investigatory stop when he has probable cause to believe a traffic offense has occurred or reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. <em>United States v. Spoerke, </em>568 F.3d 1236, 1248 (11th Cir.2009). This standard is met when an officer personally observes a traffic infraction. <em>United States v. Harris, </em>526 F.3d 1334, 1338 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-14\">In this case, the officer testified that he witnessed two traffic infractions committed by the driver of the vehicle Blackmon was riding in, and the district court concluded that the officer\u2019s testimony was credible. Blackmon argues that the officer could not have distinguished the tag light and failed to corroborate his observation of a lane violation, but the officer\u2019s testimony to the contrary was deemed credible by the district court. Because the officer\u2019s testimony was not so inconsistent that no factfin-der could reasonably accept it, the district court did not err by concluding that the officer had probable cause to justify an investigative stop or by denying Black-mon\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-15\">We also are unpersuaded by Blackmon\u2019s claim that the district court abused its discretion by denying his motion for a mistrial after a government witness committed a Doyle<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> violation. A defendant\u2019s due process rights are violated if the prosecution attempts to use his silence after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>receiving a Miranda<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> warning to impeach him. <em>Doyle, </em>426 U.S. at 619, 96 S.Ct. 2240. A statement references the defendant\u2019s silence if \u201cit was the prosecutor\u2019s manifest intention to refer to the defendant\u2019s silence\u201d or if the statement would naturally and necessarily be understood by the jury to be a comment on the defendant\u2019s silence. <em>United States v. Dodd, </em>111 F.3d 867, 869 (11th Cir.1997). A single statement about the defendant\u2019s silence does not show a manifest intent to reference the defendant\u2019s silence when it is a direct response to an open-ended question from defense counsel. <em>Chastain, </em>198 F.3d at 1351-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">As the record here shows, the government witness\u2019s brief reference to Black-mon\u2019s refusal to submit to an interview was given in response to an open-ended question on cross-examination. Furthermore, the witness\u2019s statement \u2014 that he had \u201cattempted] to interview Mr. Black-mon\u201d \u2014 could not be understood necessarily as a comment on Blackmon\u2019s silence because it could also be interpreted as a statement that the witness was unable to schedule an interview with Blackmon. On this record, the district court did not err in concluding that such a passing reference was not manifestly intended to reference Blackmon\u2019s silence. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Blackmon\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b881-11\">. <em>Doyle v.
