He challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, arguing that it is greater than necessary to satisfy the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We review his challenge to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence for abuse of discretion, <em>see Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), and apply a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness to the within-guidelines sentence, <em>see United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 360 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">In reliance on <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 109-10, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), and for purposes of preserving the issue for possible further review, Bonilla-Rivera argues that the presumption of reasonableness should not apply because the illegal reentry Guideline lacks an empirical basis. As Bonilla-Riv-era concedes, his argument is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 366-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">We have consistently rejected Bonilla-Rivera\u2019s \u201cdouble counting\u201d argument and his argument that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 results in excessive sentences because it is not empirically based. <em>See Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-31. We also have rejected the \u201cinternational trespass\u201d argument that Bonil-la-Rivera asserts. <em>See United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">Bonilla-Rivera has not shown that his sentence does not account for a sentencing factor that should receive significant weight, gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or represents a clear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). Mere disagreement with the propriety of his sentence or with the weight given to \u00a7 3553(a) factors does not suffice to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to a within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b440-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
