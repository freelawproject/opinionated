He argues only that the sentence imposed is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to satisfy the purposes of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-18\">We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Since Hernandez\u2019s sentence falls within the applicable guidelines range, we afford it a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-23\">We decline Hernandez\u2019s invitation to reweigh the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors because \u201cthe sentencing judge is in a superi- or position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 339. The fact that this court \u201cmight reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Hernandez fails to rebut the presumption that his sentence is substantively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b381-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
