He also moves for the appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">The defendants in Bibbs\u2019s \u00a7 1983 suit were the judge, assistant district attorney, and three private attorneys who participated in a state court case regarding the termination of Bibbs\u2019s parental rights over his child. Bibbs claimed that the defendants conspired through an abuse of process in that case to deprive him of the custody of his child through a default judgment against him. The relief sought in the \u00a7 1983 suit was \u201cremand [of the] cause back to the state court for remedy.\u201d The district court determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Bibbs\u2019s \u00a7 1983 suit pursuant to the <em>Rooker-Feld-man </em>doctrine and the domestic relations exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Bibbs argues that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine did not deprive the district court of subject matter jurisdiction because his \u00a7 1983 suit challenged the defendants\u2019 abuse of process in his state case rather than the state court decision itself. We review his argument de novo. <em>See Green v. Atkinson, </em>623 F.3d 278, 279-80 (5th Cir.2010) (per curiam). The <em>Rooker-Feld-man </em>doctrine applies to \u201ccases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the federal district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\u201d <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005). Because Bibbs\u2019s \u00a7 1983 suit sought to overturn the state court judgment, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the \u00a7 1983 suit pursuant to the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. <em>See id. </em>at 283-84, 291-92, 125 S.Ct. 1517.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Furthermore, Bibbs does not brief any argument challenging the district court\u2019s determination that it also lacked subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the domestic relations exception. Although pro se briefs are liberally construed, even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). Bibbs\u2019s failure to challenge the district court\u2019s determination regarding the domestic relations exception is an additional basis for affirming the district court\u2019s judgment. <em>See Brinkmann v. Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Bibbs\u2019s \u00a7 1983 suit counts as one strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Bibbs is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED; MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b474-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
