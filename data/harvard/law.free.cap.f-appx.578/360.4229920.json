His motion to file a supplemental brief is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Cockerham contends that, in view of <em>United States v. Santos, </em>553 U.S. 507, 128 S.Ct. 2020, 170 L.Ed.2d 912 (2008), he is actually innocent of the offense of conspiring to commit money laundering. He argues that the district court erred in determining that he could not meet the requirements of the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">In an appeal from the denial of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241, we review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and issues of law de novo. <em>Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001). We may affirm the district court\u2019s judgment on any ground supported by the record. <em>Sojourner T v. Edwards, </em>974 F.2d 27, 30 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Section 2255 provides the primary means of collaterally attacking a federal sentence, and relief is granted for errors that occurred at trial or sentencing. <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877-78 (5th Cir.2000). Section 2241, on the other hand, is used to challenge \u201cthe manner in which a sentence is executed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 877. A petition filed under \u00a7 2241 that raises errors that occurred at or prior to sentencing should be construed as a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 425-26 (5th Cir.2005). However, under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255, a \u00a7 2241 petition that attacks custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence may be entertained if the petitioner shows that the remedy provided under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. <em>Jeffers, </em>253 F.3d at 830; \u00a7 2255(e). A prior unsuccessful \u00a7 2255 motion or the inability to meet the requirements for filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion do not render the \u00a7 2255 remedy inadequate for purposes of the savings clause. <em>Tolliver, </em>211 F.3d at 878. To demonstrate that \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective, the petitioner must show that (1) his claims are \u201cbased on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense,\u201d and (2) his claims were \u201cforeclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim[s] should have been raised in [his] trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). The petitioner has the burden of affirmatively showing that the \u00a7 2255 remedy is inadequate or ineffective. <em>See Wesson v. United States Penitentiary Beaumont, TX, </em>305 F.3d 343, 347 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">Cockerham asserts that he could not have raised a claim based on <em>Santos </em>in a timely-filed \u00a7 2255 motion. He contends that he became aware of evidence supporting a <em>Santos </em>claim in February 2013, and as support for his contention, he points to an affidavit that uses the term \u201cproceeds\u201d to refer to money involved in the money laundering conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">We are not convinced that Cockerham needed the affidavit to be alerted to the existence of a claim based on <em>Santos. </em>Moreover, Cockerham could have raised a claim based on <em>Santos </em>in his direct criminal appeal, in which he was represented by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-13\">In view of the foregoing, Cockerham has not shown that his claim based on <em>Santos </em>was foreclosed by circuit law when he should have raised it, either on direct appeal or in his first \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>ingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">AFFIRMED; MOTION TO FILE SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b386-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
