Here, Bis-choff timely appealed the magistrate judge\u2019s sanctions order to the district court, contending that the magistrate judge lacked jurisdiction to enter the order because he had withdrawn from the case. The district court affirmed the magistrate judge\u2019s sanction. Because the magistrate judge had jurisdiction to award sanctions, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-21\">On appeal, Bischoff repeats his contention that the magistrate judge lacked jurisdiction to award sanctions because the district court had already granted Bischoffs request to withdraw as an attorney in the case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 23.) It is unclear what type of jurisdiction Bischoff contends the court lacked. His argument appears to be that because he withdrew from the case, the district court no longer had statutory authority to sanction him under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927. So, Bischoffs challenge is not to subject-matter or personal jurisdiction, but rather to the district court\u2019s authority under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927-that is jurisdiction in a generic sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-22\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s sanctions order for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Amlong &amp; Amlong, P.A. v. Denny\u2019s, Inc., </em>500 F.3d 1230, 1237 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cA decision that is contrary to the law plainly is an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1238.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-23\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927 allows a district court to sanction \u201c[a]ny attorney or other person <em>admitted to conduct cases </em>in any court of the United States or any Territory thereof who so multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously ...\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927 (emphasis added). Bischoff contends that this statute could not be applied once he withdrew from the case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>However, we can discern no such limitation from the statute. And, Bischoff provides no reason or authority for imposing such a limitation. To the contrary, the statute plainly applies to \u201cany attorney ... admitted to conduct cases,\u201d and is not limited to the current attorney of record at the time a sanction is made. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">Accordingly, we find no error and affirm the district court\u2019s affirmance of the magistrate judge\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b991-19\">. Bischoff presents a variety of other arguments. However, this is the only issue Bis-choff objected to before the district court. When a magistrate judge considers non-dis-positive matters, a party may not assign as error on appeal a defect not timely objected to before the district court. <em>Smith v. School Bd. of Orange Cnty., </em>487 F.3d 1361, 1365. Accordingly, Bischoffs other contentions are not preserved.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
