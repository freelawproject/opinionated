The Lees\u2019 property was subject to two mortgage liens at the time they filed for bankruptcy. The outstanding debt on the first-priority mortgage exceeded the fair market value of the property. Bank of America held a second-priority mortgage, which had a value of around $23,000. Because the debt on the first-priority mortgage exceeded the value of the property, the Lees moved to \u201cstrip off,\u201d or void in its entirety, the unsecured junior lien held by Bank of America.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">The bankruptcy court granted the Lees\u2019 motion, concluding that binding circuit precedent authorized the Lees to avoid Bank of America\u2019s junior mortgage lien under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506(a) and (d). <em>See McNeal v. GMAC Mortg., LLC (In re McNeal), </em>735 F.3d 1263, 1265-66 (11th Cir.2012); <em>Folendore v. U.S. Small Bus. Admin. (In re Folendore), </em>862 F.2d 1537, 1538-39 (11th Cir.1989). Bank of America appealed to the district court but moved for summary affirmance, acknowledging that <em>McNeal </em>and <em>Folendore </em>were controlling. The district court affirmed, and Bank of America now appeals to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">Bank of America maintains that the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Dewsnup v. Timm, </em>502 U.S. 410, 112 S.Ct. 773, 116 L.Ed.2d 903 (1992), makes clear that <em>Fo-lendore </em>was wrongly decided and should be overturned. <em>Dewsnup </em>held that a Chapter 7 debtor could not \u201cstrip down,\u201d or partially void, a creditor\u2019s lien on real property where the value of the property is less than what is due the creditor. 502 U.S. at 417, 112 S.Ct. 773. According to Bank of America, after <em>Dewsnup, </em>the Eleventh Circuit stands alone in holding that underwater junior liens may be \u201cstripped off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">However, in <em>McNeal, </em>we reaffirmed <em>Folendore </em>despite the holding in <em>Dewsnup. McNeal, </em>735 F.3d at 1265-66. Accordingly, it remains the law of this Circuit that a 'wholly unsecured junior lien \u2014 such as the one held here by Bank of America \u2014 is voidable under \u00a7 506(d). <em>Id. </em>Bank of America concedes that this panel is bound by <em>McNeal </em>and <em>Folendore </em>to affirm the bankruptcy court\u2019s order but reserves the right to seek rehearing of the issue by the Court sitting <em>en banc. </em>We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
