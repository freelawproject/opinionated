The district court imposed a total, within-guidelines sentence of 57 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-22\">On appeal, Guel-Escobedo argues that the district court reversibly erred by failing to award him an additional one-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b). Contrary to the Government\u2019s assertions, Guel-Escobedo\u2019s explicit request at sentencing for the additional one-level reduction under \u00a7 3El.l(b) based upon the upcoming amendment to \u00a7 3E1.1 was sufficient to preserve this challenge for appeal. <em>See United States v. Hernandez-Martinez, </em>485 F.3d 270, 272-73 (5th Cir.2007). As we held recently in <em>United States v. Palacios, </em>756 F.3d 325, 325 (5th Cir.2014), the amended version of \u00a7 3E1.1 is applicable in a case such as this one where the amendment was proposed at the time of sentencing and went into effect while the appeal was pending. Pursuant to the amended \u00a7 3E1.1, the Government may not withhold a \u00a7 3El.l(b) motion because the defendant refuses to waive his right to appeal, as it did in this case. The Government has not shown that this error was harmless as to the imposed sentence. <em>See United States v. Delgado-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number><em>Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 752-53 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Accordingly, Guel-Escobedo\u2019s sentence is VACATED and the case is REMANDED to the district court for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b480-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
