The district court departed below the advisory guidelines range and sentenced him to 24 months of imprisonment. Belman appeals his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-18\">Belman renews his assertions that the district court\u2019s application of the enhancement provision of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 violates the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of equal protection, as well as the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. However, the enhancement of Belman\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) did not violate his right to equal protection of the law. <em>See United States v. Cardenas-Alvarez, </em>987 F.2d 1129, 1134 (5th Cir.1993). Additionally, his below-guidelines sentence is not grossly disproportionate to his offense such that it violates the Eighth Amendment. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-19\">In addition, Belman maintains that the two-year statutory maximum sentence of \u00a7 1326(a) applies to him and that his sentence is unconstitutional because the convictions used to enhance his sentence were not alleged in his indictment. As Belman acknowledges, his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>See United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AXL\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir.
