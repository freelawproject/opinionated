' After careful review of the record and the briefs, we reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the Shel-tons and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b868-15\">This case concerns whether the Shel-tons\u2019 homeowners policy with Liberty Mutual covers the Sheltons\u2019 claim for a \u201csinkhole loss\u201d to their property in Oldsmar, Florida. Before we turn to the Sheltons\u2019 claim and the policy, we begin with some background information about insurance coverage for sinkhole losses in Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-16\">A. Insurance Coverage for Sinkhole Losses under Florida Law</p>\n<p id=\"b868-17\">Since 1981, Florida law \u201crequires property insurers to make sinkhole coverage available.\u201d <em>Cincinnati Ins. Co. v. Wiltshire, </em>472 So.2d 1276, 1277 n. 1 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1985). From 1981 to 2004, Florida law defined the term \u201csinkhole loss\u201d as \u201cactual physical damage to the property covered arising out of or caused by sudden settlement or collapse of the earth supporting such property only when such settlement or collapse results from subterranean voids created by the action of water on a limestone or similar rock formation.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.706 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-18\">In 2005, the Florida legislature redefined \u201csinkhole loss\u201d as \u201cstructural damage to the building, including the foundation, caused by sinkhole activity.\u201d 2005 Fla. Sess. Law. Serv. Ch. 2005-111, \u00a7 17 (West). Although it limited the definition of \u201csinkhole loss\u201d to cases where there was \u201cstructural damage\u201d to a covered property, the 2005 amendment did not define the term \u201cstructural damage.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b868-19\">In May 2011, the Florida legislature amended \u00a7 627.706 again to supply a definition for the phrase \u201cstructural damage\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number><em>\u201cas used in connection with any policy providing coverage ... for sinkhole losses.\u201d </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.706(2)(k) (2011) (emphasis added). The legislature provided a technical, five-part definition: \u201cStructural damage\u201d occurs only when \u201ca covered building ... has experienced\u201d one of the five events enumerated and defined in the statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">B. Liberty Mutual\u2019s Policy and the Sheltons\u2019 Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">Subsequent to the May 2011 legislative change, Liberty Mutual issued a renewal homeowners insurance policy for the Shel-tons\u2019 property, effective from July 18, 2011 to July 18, 2012. In January 2012, the Sheltons made a claim under the policy for a \u201csinkhole loss\u201d to their property. Liberty Mutual\u2019s policy provides that \u201c[s]inkhole loss means structural damage to the building, including the foundation, caused by sinkhole activity.\u201d The policy does not define the key phrase \u201cstructural damage to the building.\u201d The policy also does not reference any statutory or external definitions of this phrase.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-11\">In response to the Sheltons\u2019 January 2012 claim, Liberty Mutual sent an expert to examine the damage to the Sheltons\u2019 property. As relevant here, Liberty Mutual\u2019s expert found cosmetic damage to the Sheltons\u2019 home but no \u201cstructural damage\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 627.706(2)(k). In other words, the damage to the Sheltons\u2019 home did not fall within the five-part definition of \u201cstructural damage\u201d outlined in the applicable statute regulating polices for sinkhole losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-12\">Based on this expert opinion, Liberty Mutual declined coverage for the Sheltons\u2019 claim. Liberty Mutual maintained that its policy did not provide coverage for the Sheltons\u2019 claim because (1) a \u201csinkhole loss\u201d is defined to require \u201cstructural damage to the building,\u201d (2) the applicable Florida statute, \u00a7 627.706(2)(k), defines what constitutes \u201cstructural damage,\u201d and (3) the Sheltons\u2019 home did not experience <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>\u201cstructural damage\u201d within that statutory definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">C. The Sheltons\u2019 Lawsuit</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">Unhappy with Liberty Mutual\u2019s decision, the Sheltons brought suit alleging that Liberty Mutual\u2019s denial of coverage breached the terms of the insurance policy. Liberty Mutual moved for summary judgment, contending that the statutory definition of \u201cstructural damage\u201d in \u00a7 627.706(2)(k) governs the interpretation of the phrase \u201cstructural damage\u201d in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">. The district court disagreed, holding that the statutory definition of \u201cstructural damage\u201d was inapplicable because the insurance policy did not reference the statute or incorporate the statutory language. The district court concluded that the phrase \u201cstructural damage to the building\u201d in the policy should be given its plain meaning, which \u2014 according to the district court \u2014 is \u201cdamage to the structure.\u201d The district court effectively read \u201cstructural damage to the building\u201d to mean \u201cany damage to the structure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">A few months later, the Sheltons moved for summary judgment. In response, Liberty Mutual renewed its argument that the statutory definition of \u201cstructural damage\u201d in \u00a7 627.706(2)(k) applies to the Sheltons\u2019 policy. Liberty Mutual also proffered its expert\u2019s finding that the damage to the Sheltons\u2019 home does not meet the statutory definition of \u201cstructural damage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">Granting the Sheltons\u2019 motion, the district court reiterated its prior conclusion that the phrase \u201cstructural damage to the building\u201d in the policy means \u201cdamage to the structure,\u201d instead of the more restrictive statutory definition of \u201cstructural damage.\u201d The district court concluded that the salient issue then was whether sinkhole activity caused any damage to the Sheltons\u2019 structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-11\">The Sheltons\u2019 experts determined that all of the damage to the Sheltons\u2019 home was \u201cprimarily caused by the sinkhole activity.\u201d As to the amount of damages, the Sheltons\u2019 experts opined that subsurface repairs costing at least $81,345 were necessary to remediate the subsurface conditions and to stabilize and repair the foundation and structure of the Sheltons\u2019 home. In addition, aboveground repairs in the amount of $31,680 were needed to fix the cosmetic damages to the Sheltons\u2019 home.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court then entered final judgment for the Sheltons in the amount of $113,025. Liberty Mutual timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-12\">II. DISCUSSION<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AAEW\">A. Florida Insurance Law</p>\n<p id=\"b870-13\">\u201cBecause federal jurisdiction over this matter is based on diversity, Florida law governs the determination of the issues on this appeal.\u201d <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Steinberg, </em>393 F.3d 1226, 1230 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>(llth Cir.2004). The pivotal question here is whether the statutory definition of \u201cstructural damage\u201d contained in \u00a7 627.706(2)(k) applies to the phrase \u201cstructural damage\u201d in the Sheltons\u2019 policy. We outline the relevant Florida law and then apply it to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">\u201cIt is fundamental that the laws of Florida are a p\u00e1rt of every Florida contract.\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of Ins., State of Fla. v. Teachers Ins. Co., </em>404 So.2d 735, 741 (Fla.1981). \u201c[A]ll existing applicable or relevant and valid statutes, ... at the time a contract is made become a part of it and must be read into it just as if an express provision to that effect were inserted therein, except where the contract discloses a contrary intention.\u201d <em>Northbrook Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. v. R &amp; J Crane Serv., Inc., </em>765 So.2d 836, 839 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2000) (quotation marks omitted); <em>Gordon v. State, </em>608 So.2d 800, 802 (Fla.1992) (\u201cValid laws in effect at the time a contract is made enter into and become part of the contract as if expressly incorporated into the contract\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">Accordingly, a \u201cstatute in effect at the time an insurance contract is executed governs substantive issues arising in connection with that contract.\u201d <em>Hassen v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>674 So.2d 106, 108 (Fla.1996); <em>Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. v. Ceballos, </em>440 So.2d 612, 613 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1983) (\u201cIt is well settled in Florida that the statute in effect at the time the insurance contract is executed governs any issues arising under that contract.\u201d). Also, \u201c \u2018the renewal of a contract of insurance constitutes the making of a new contract for the purpose of incorporating into the policy changes in the statutes regulating insurance contracts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bell Care Nurses Registry, Inc. v. Cont\u2019l Cas. Co., </em>25 So.3d 13, 15 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2009) (quoting <em>Metro. Prop. &amp; Liab. Ins. Co. v. Gray, </em>446 So.2d 216, 218 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1984)); <em>May v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>430 So.2d 999, 1001 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1983) (\u201cIt is the law in this state that a contract of annually renewable insurance forms a new contract at each renewal for the purpose of incorporating into the contract the statutory provisions enacted after the creation of the original contract relationship.\u201d (quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">Applying Florida law here, we must conclude that the statutory definition of \u201cstructural damage\u201d contained in \u00a7 627.706(2)(k) governs the construction of the phrase \u201cstructural damage\u201d in the Sheltons\u2019 policy. The Florida legislature expressly stated that the statutory definition applies when the term \u201cstructural damage\u201d is <em>\u201cused in connection with any policy providing coverage ... for sinkhole losses.\u201d </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.706(2)(k) (emphasis added). There is no dispute here that the statutory definition of \u201cstructural damage\u201d in \u00a7 627.706(2)(k) was in effect when the Sheltons\u2019 policy was renewed in July 2011. Thus, under Florida law, the statutory definition of \u201cstructural damage\u201d is a part of the Sheltons\u2019 policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">We recognize that the Sheltons\u2019 policy does not reference or contain the statutory definition of \u201cstructural damage.\u201d But, under Florida law, the statutory definition \u201cmust be read into [the Sheltons\u2019 policy] just as if an express provision to that effect were inserted therein.... \u201d <em>Northbrook Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>765 So.2d at 839 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">Similarly, it is of little moment that Liberty Mutual and the Sheltons could have agreed to a different and broader definition of \u201cstructural damage\u201d than the one provided in \u00a7 627.706(2)(k). <em>See, e.g., Green v. Life &amp; Health of Am., </em>704 So.2d 1386, 1391 (Fla.1998) (holding that an insurer can agree to a different standard than the rigid statutory standard when the insurer \u201cchose to draft and incorporate a different ... standard in its application\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>Liberty Mutual\u2019s policy, however, did not incorporate a different definition of \u201cstructural damage.\u201d Under Florida law, the absence of an alternative definition means that the statutory definition fills the gap. There is no indication in the policy that the parties intended to depart from the statutory definition. <em>See Northbrook Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>765 So.2d at 839 (providing that all relevant and existing statutes become part of a contract, \u201cexcept where the contract discloses a contrary intention\u201d (quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">B. The Sheltons\u2019 Renewal Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">We reject the Sheltons\u2019 argument that the statutory definition should not apply because their policy is a renewal policy and \u201cLiberty Mutual failed to notify the Sheltons of the substantive changes to their insurance policy\u2019s sinkhole loss coverage.\u201d Because the Sheltons had a policy with Liberty Mutual before the legislature added the definition of \u201cstructural damage\u201d in May 2011, the Sheltons now contend that it was incumbent upon Liberty Mutual to notify them of the legislative change when the Sheltons renewed the policy in July 2011. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">The Florida legislature has provided concrete instructions with respect to renewal policies: an insurer must give written notice to the insured when \u201c[a] renewal policy ... contain[s] a change in policy terms.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.43141(2); <em>see also Marchesano v. Nationwide Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>506 So.2d 410, 413 (Fla.1987) (\u201cAbsent a notice to the contrary, the insured is entitled to assume that the terms of the renewed policy are the same as those of the original contract.\u201d). However, \u201cthe application of mandated legislative changes is not a change in policy terms.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.43141(l)(a). As such, even assuming without deciding that the addition of the statutory definition of \u201cstructural damage\u201d in \u00a7 627.706(2)(k) would otherwise constitute \u201ca change in policy terms,\u201d the notice requirement of \u00a7 627.43141(2) is not triggered for this legislative change.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-10\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b872-11\">Given our conclusion that the statutory definition applies to the term \u201cstructural damage\u201d in the Sheltons\u2019 policy, we reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the Sheltons and vacate the final judgment. We remand to the district court for further proceedings using the statutory definition of \u201cstructural damage\u201d in \u00a7 627.706(2)(k).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-12\">REVERSED, VACATED, AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b869-7\">.The five events are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-8\">1.
