On appeal, Costa argues that the BIA erred by concluding that the first labor-certification application filed on his behalf by his former employer, Arch Company, Inc. (Arch), was not \u201capprovable when filed\u201d under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.10(a)(3) and that he was ineligible for an adjustment of status under INA \u00a7 245\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255\u00ae as a \u201cgrandfathered\u201d alien. Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we dismiss in part, and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-24\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b929-25\">Costa entered the United States on June 9, 1999, as a non-immigrant visitor, with authorization to.remain until December 8, 1999. His visa was extended until December 7, 2000. He remained in the United States beyond that date without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>authorization. On April 30, 2001, Costa\u2019s former employer, Arch, filed a labor-certification application on his behalf with the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL). In 2003, the attorney who filed that application, Javier Lopera, was convicted of immigration fraud. Based on that conviction, the DOL issued a Notice of Findings (NOF) in which it informed Arch that it was conducting an internal investigation into the application in light of its discovery of Lopera\u2019s fraud conviction and requested additional supporting evidence for the application. In response, Arch withdrew the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">In 2004, another employer, Hurley Construction Company, Inc. (Hurley), filed a second labor-certification application on Costa\u2019s behalf. The DOL certified that application. Hurley then filed a Form I-140 Immigration Petition for Alien Worker Application on Costa\u2019s behalf, which U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (US-CIS) approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">Subsequently, Costa filed a Form 1-485 application for an adjustment of status with USCIS pursuant to INA \u00a7 245(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i). USCIS denied Costa\u2019s application because Costa had not maintained lawful status and had engaged in employment without authorization. Further, Costa\u2019s unlawful presence and employment could not be waived under INA \u00a7 245(i) as requested because the first labor-certification application filed on his behalf was ineligible for \u201cgrandfathering\u201d under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245. 10(a)(1)\u00a9 as it was not \u201capprovable when filed\u201d under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.10(a)(3). The application had not been approvable due to the fraud concerns regarding certification as noted in the DOL\u2019s NOF, including that Lopera had been convicted of separate acts of immigration fraud. USCIS\u2019s Administrative Appeals Office (AAO) affirmed the denial. On March 2, 2011, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued Costa a notice to appear (NTA), charging him as removable pursuant to INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B) for remaining in the United States for longer than permitted. At a master-calendar hearing, Costa admitted the allegations contained in his NTA and the IJ sustained the charge of removability. Costa indicated that he wished to renew his adjustment-of-status application.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">In a written brief in support of his adjustment-of-status application, Costa argued that the first labor-certification application filed by Arch on his behalf was \u201capprovable when filed\u201d under \u00a7 1245.10(a)(3). The evidence reflected that Arch withdrew the application because the company had \u201clost interest\u201d in pursuing Costa\u2019s certification after learning of Lopera\u2019s immigration fraud. Notwithstanding that fact that Arch later withdrew the application, it still remained that the application had been properly filed, meritorious in fact, and non-frivolous at the time of filing. When confronted with Arch\u2019s unwillingness to pursue the application, Costa immediately changed employers and continued the application process through Hurley to preserve the first application\u2019s 2001 priority date through \u201cgrandfathering\u201d under INA \u00a7 245(i). The documents submitted in support of Arch\u2019s labor-certification application would have been sufficient to certify the application but for the fraud allegations against Lopera.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-8\">At the merits hearing, the government argued that Costa had not met his burden to demonstrate that he was eligible for an adjustment of status under INA \u00a7 245\u00a9. The government submitted a complete copy of the DOL\u2019s NOF related to the denial of Arch\u2019s labor-certification application. The IJ inquired whether either par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>ty had a copy of the first labor-certification application that Arch had filed on Costa\u2019s behalf. Both the government and Costa responded that they did not. The IJ noted that it was Costa\u2019s burden to demonstrate that the application was approvable at the time of filing. Without a copy of the application, the IJ would be unable to conduct the required analysis to determine if the application was approvable when filed. After the IJ determined that Costa was not eligible to apply for any other form of relief, Costa requested a voluntary departure, which the IJ granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-4\">In an oral decision, the IJ concluded that Costa was ineligible for an adjustment of status pursuant to INA \u00a7 245(i), as he did not meet his burden to establish that the first labor-certification application had been \u201capprovable when filed.\u201d Costa had not produced' a copy of the first labor-certification application, and, thus, the IJ could not determine whether that application had been \u201capprovable when filed,\u201d such that Costa was eligible for an adjustment of status pursuant to INA \u00a7 245(i). Regardless of the approval of the 2004 labor-certification application, Costa could not adjust his status unless he was eligible under INA \u00a7 245(i). The IJ granted Cos-ta\u2019s request for a voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">Costa appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the BIA. In his appeal brief, Costa argued that he had satisfied his burden of proving that the first labor-certification application filed on his behalf had been \u201capprovable when filed\u201d under \u00a7 1245.10(a)(3). The DOL had never stated that the application was fraudulent and had denied that application only because Arch withdrew it. That application had been properly filed, meritorious in fact, and non-frivolous because it was filed with authentic documents by Arch. Because the DOL had issued a NOF that presumed the first application to be fraudulent because it was filed by Lopera, the DOL improperly found the application to be fraudulent based on guilt by association. In denying Costa\u2019s adjustment-of-status application, the IJ erroneously made the same presumption of fraud as the DOL had.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">On October 23, 2013, the BIA dismissed Costa\u2019s appeal, concluding that the IJ had not erred by determining that he was ineligible for an adjustment of status under INA \u00a7 245(i) because he had failed to meet his burden to establish that the first labor-certification application was \u201capprovable when filed.\u201d Contrary to Costa\u2019s assertion, the IJ did not deny Costa\u2019s adjustment-of-status application based on fraud, but rather on Costa\u2019s failure to meet his burden to establish that the application had been \u201capprovable when filed.\u201d Costa failed to provide a copy of the first labor-certification application and the letter from Arch attesting to the company\u2019s filing the application provided little additional support for the application\u2019s approvability at the time of filing. The BIA noted that, while not dispositive, the attorney who had filed the first labor-certification application had been convicted of immigration fraud. The BIA reinstated the IJ\u2019s grant of voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">In November 2013, Costa moved for the BIA to reconsider its prior decision. Cos-ta contended that the BIA had overlooked relevant facts, namely, that the second labor-certification application and Form I-140 filed by Hurley both had been approved. Costa also argued that, because the fraud allegations against Lopera arose after the time of filing the first labor-certification application, they provided no basis for the BIA\u2019s conclusion that the application had not been \u201capprovable when filed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b931-10\">On December 23, 2013, the BIA denied Costa\u2019s motion to reconsider, concluding that he largely had raised the same or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>similar arguments as those raised in his original appeal brief. Costa\u2019s mere disagreement with the BIA\u2019s prior decision was an insufficient basis upon which to reconsider that decision. Further, to the extent that Costa was attempting to raise new arguments related to the first labor-certification application, those arguments were not properly before the BIA on a motion to reconsider as they could have been raised in the original appeal. Nevertheless, these arguments did not alter the BIA\u2019s decision to deny Costa\u2019s request. Costa filed a Petition for Review with this Court on January 14, 2014 challenging the BIA\u2019s December 28, 2013 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">\u201cWe review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Calle v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2007). A motion to reconsider must specify errors of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s decision and must be supported by pertinent authority. <em>Id. </em>at 1329.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">On appeal, Costa raises the same arguments he has already raised twice before the BIA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He asserts that the government erred by denying him adjustment status; however, he does not argue any error on the part of the IJ or the BIA. The only issue before us is whether the BIA abused its discretion in denying Costa\u2019s motion to reconsider for failure to identify material legal or factual error in the October 23, 2013 decision. <em>See Calle, </em>504 F.3d at 1329 (holding that \u201cmerely reiterating arguments previously presented to the BIA does not constitute \u2018specifying ... errors of fact or law\u2019 as required for a successful motion to reconsider\u201d); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C). Because Costa did not identify any errors in the BIA\u2019s decision, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b932-7\">. To the extent that Costa\u2019s arguments on appeal are related to the BIA\u2019s October 23, 2013 order affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of his adjustment-of-status application, we will dismiss the petition as to those issues for lack of jurisdiction. Costa\u2019s petition was untimely filed on January 14, 2014, more than 30 days after entry of that order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) (\"The petition for review must be filed not later than 30 days after the date of the final order of removal.\u201d); <em>Lin v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>677 F.3d 1043, 1045 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
