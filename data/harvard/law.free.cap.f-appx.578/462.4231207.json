In reviewing the denial of \u00a7 2254 relief, we address issues of law de novo and findings of fact for clear error, applying the same deference to the state court\u2019s decision as the district court under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act. <em>Ortiz v. Quarterman, </em>504 F.3d 492, 496 (5th Cir.2007). Habeas relief may not be granted on a claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court, unless the decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law as determined by the United States Supreme Court,\u201d \u00a7 2254(d)(1), or \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented,\u201d \u00a7 2254(d)(2). <em>See Harrington v. Richter, </em>562 U.S. 86, 131 S.Ct. 770, 787, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">Williams argues that the state court erred in determining that the evidence was sufficient to support his convictions because the State failed to negate the reasonable probability that the victim misidentified him as a perpetrator. Employing the standard announced in <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979), the state appellate court determined that the evidence was sufficient for a rational trier of fact to conclude that Williams was one of the men guilty of the armed robbery and aggravated kidnapping of Owen Santiago. In making this determination, the state court considered the evidence that Santiago already knew Williams, had an ample opportunity to view him during the abduction, and made positive and consistent identifications of Williams as a perpetrator. This was bolstered by the testimony of Officer Glapion that, at around 1:00 a.m. on the night of Santiago\u2019s abduction, Glapion observed Williams and three other men walking away from the vicinity where Santiago\u2019s burning vehicle was discovered. This testimony also contradicted Williams\u2019s alibi evidence that he was at a club until 3:00 a.m. on the night of the incident. Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, and giving the jury\u2019s credibility findings the deference they are due, the state court could find that the evidence was sufficient to support Williams\u2019s convictions. <em>See Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-14\">Citing to Louisiana law, Williams asserts that, in addition to the <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>standard, the State was required to negate any reasonable probability of misidentifieation. Although Louisiana law has such a requirement when an offender\u2019s identity is at issue, <em>see State v. Barthelemy, </em>32 So.3d 999, 1015 (La.Ct.App., 2010), \u201cin challenges to state convictions under [\u00a7 2254], only <em>Jackson ... </em>need be satisfied, even if state law would impose a more demanding standard of proof.\u201d <em>West v. Johnson, </em>92 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>1385, 1394 (5th Cir.1996) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">The second claim presented by Williams is that the state court erred in finding that the photographic lineup shown to Santiago was not unduly suggestive and did not prejudice his defense. After reviewing the hearing on the motion to suppress the identification and the actual photographic lineup, the state court considered the relevant factors and determined that there was no substantial likelihood of misidentifi-cation. <em>See Manson v. Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98, 114, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 53 L.Ed.2d 140 (1977). Our review of the record, including the photographic lineup, supports this determination. <em>See Richter, </em>131 S.Ct. at 786-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Finally, Williams claims that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to impeach the testimony of Santiago and Officer Glapion based on alleged inconsistencies in their statements and their testimony. The state court properly applied the analysis announced in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), in determining that Williams had not shown deficient performance or prejudice. A state court\u2019s ruling on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is entitled to high deference. <em>Richter, </em>131 S.Ct. at 788. The\u2019 record supports the state court\u2019s determination that Williams\u2019s trial counsel was not ineffective in his cross-examination of Santiago and Glapion and that his representation did not prejudice Williams. Rather, the record supports the state court\u2019s determination that he was convicted in light of the victim\u2019s compelling positive identification testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">Williams has failed to show that the state court\u2019s denial of his claims involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented at trial. <em>See Richter, </em>131 S.Ct. at 786-87. The denial of his habeas corpus petition is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b489-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
