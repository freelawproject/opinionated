The district court imposed a within-Guidelines sentence of, <em>inter alia, </em>57 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">Longoria contends the district court reversibly erred by failing to award him an additional one-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 3El.l(b). As this court held recently in <em>United States v. Palacios, </em>756 F.3d 325, 325 (5th Cir.2014), the amended version of \u00a7 3E1.1 is applicable in a case such as this one, where the amendment was proposed at the time of sentencing and went into effect while the appeal was pending. Pursuant to the amended \u00a7 3E1.1, the Government may not withhold, as it did in this case, a \u00a7 3El.l(b) motion because the defendant refuses to waive his right to appeal. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, cmt. n. 6 (\u201cThe [Government should not withhold [a motion for additional level decrease] based on ... whether the defendant agrees to waive his or her right to appeal\u201d.).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-13\">In addition, the Government has not shown this procedural error was harmless as to the imposed sentence. <em>See United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 752-53 (5th Cir.2009) (requiring evidence \u201cthat the district court had a particular sentence in mind and would have imposed it\u201d in spite of the error in calculating the Guidelines sentencing range).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-14\">VACATED and REMANDED to district court for re-sentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b499-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
