Britton-Harr appeals his guilty-plea conviction and sentence for possession with the intent to distribute more than 100 kilograms of marijuana. Britton-Harr argues that his guilty plea was unknowing and involuntary because the Government destroyed exculpatory evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-28\">Prior to the guilty plea, the district court held a hearing on Britton-Harr\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>claims and ruled that the Government did not intentionally destroy any evidence. Britton-Harr does not raise any arguments that undermine that factual determination. Moreover, under circuit precedent, Britton-Harr\u2019s guilty plea precludes him from raising a <em>Brady </em>claim. <em>See United States v. Conroy, </em>567 F.3d 174, 178-79 (5th Cir.2009); <em>see also Orman v. Cain, </em>228 F.3d 616, 617 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Matthew v. Johnson, </em>201 F.3d 353, 361-62 (5th Cir.2000). Britton-Harr therefore identifies no basis for vacating his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Britton-Harr also requests a remand for the trial court to hear his motion based on newly discovered evidence as well as his other pending postconviction motions. Contrary to Britton-Harr\u2019s assertion, his pleading was not a motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence but rather an \u201cunauthorized motion which the district court was without jurisdiction to entertain.\u201d <em>United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994). Additionally, Britton-Harr\u2019s notice of appeal divested the district court of jurisdiction over his postconviction motions. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>882 F.2d 999, 1001 (5th Cir.1989). Accordingly, he is not entitled to a remand to allow the district court to hear the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b470-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
