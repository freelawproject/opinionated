Under review is the district court\u2019s order of June 10, 2013, dismissing as moot the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for substitution of counsel \u201c[b]ecause this case was fully settled.\u201d In the same order, the court dismissed the case without prejudice although it retained jurisdiction to enforce the parties\u2019 settlement agreement. In a July 17, 2013 order, the court denied relief from the judgment it had entered in the June 10, 2013 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-9\">The court was mistaken about the motion to substitute counsel being moot. The settlement agreement itself provides that it may be amended \u201cby a written instrument signed by the authorized representatives of each Party,\u201d and there is no deadline provided for amending it. The plaintiffs\u2019 motion for substitution of counsel states that plaintiffs are seeking to amend the settlement agreement and that defendant Pfizer does not oppose the amendment they seek.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-10\">The plaintiffs assert that they need new counsel because their original counsel refuses to represent them in seeking the amendment. Her emails, which are attached to the plaintiffs\u2019 reply in support of their motion for substitution, indicate that she no longer represents the plaintiffs. The motion establishes that the plaintiffs have attorneys who are willing to serve as their counsel in this matter. For all of these reasons, the motion for substitution of counsel is not moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-12\">As to the order of June 10, 2013, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s denial as moot of the motion to substitute counsel and its dismissal of the case; we leave intact its denial of the motion for sanctions. We VACATE as moot the court\u2019s July 17, 2013 order denying the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for relief from judgment. We leave all further questions to the court on remand.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
