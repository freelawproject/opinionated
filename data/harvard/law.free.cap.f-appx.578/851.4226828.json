On appeal, the government argues that the district court erred by concluding that a prior conviction must be charged as an element of the offense, in direct contravention of the Supreme Court\u2019s precedent in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). In response, Pedraza-Mendoza argues that any error was harmless because the district court would have imposed the same sentence regardless and the sentence was substantively reasonable under the circumstances. After careful review, we vacate and remand for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-12\">We review constitutional sentencing issues <em>de novo. See, e.g., United States v. Steed, </em>548 F.3d 961, 978 (11th Cir.2008). We are bound by prior precedent unless and until it is overruled by our Court sitting en banc or by the Supreme Court. <em>United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir.2008). We review the sentence a district court imposes for \u201creasonableness,\u201d which \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-13\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>the Supreme Court addressed the statute at issue here, which increases the penalty for aliens who return to the United States after deportation without special permission from 2 years to 20 years if their prior deportation had come following the commission of an aggravated felony. 523 U.S. at 226, 118 S.Ct. 1219. The issue there, as here, was whether prior convictions were an element of the offense, or merely a sentencing factor that need not be set forth in the indictment. <em>Id. </em>at 227-28, 118 S.Ct. 1219. After analyzing the language of the statute and noting that recidivism is one of the most traditional sentencing factors, the Supreme Court held that a defendant\u2019s prior conviction did not need to be alleged in the indictment or proven beyond a reasonable doubt if used for sentence enhancement purposes. <em>Id. </em>at 230-35, 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219. We\u2019ve said that we are \u201cbound by <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>until it is explicitly overruled by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>United States v. Dowd, </em>451 F.3d 1244, 1253 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-14\">In this case, the district coui't erred by determining that Pedraza-Mendoza\u2019s prior conviction for an aggravated felony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>should have been charged as an \u201celement\u201d of his illegal re-entry offense. This conclusion was in direct contravention of the Supreme Court\u2019s clear, binding precedent, established under very similar facts, in <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>528 U.S. at 235, 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219. As we\u2019ve held, <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains good law, since it has not been explicitly overruled by the Supreme Court, and therefore it still applies here. <em>See Dowd, </em>451 F.3d at 1253.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">As for Pedraza-Mendoza\u2019s claim that the district court\u2019s erroneous application of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was harmless, we disagree. In this Circuit, district courts must first correctly calculate the advisory sentencing range under the Guidelines, and then must determine a reasonable sentence in light of the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1189-90. An error in the district court\u2019s calculation of the applicable guideline range warrants reversal, unless the error was harmless. <em>United States v. Barner, </em>572 F.3d 1239, 1247 (11th Cir.2009). When a district court judge clearly states that he would impose the same sentence regardless of any error, then any error is harmless. <em>United States v. Keene, </em>470 F.3d 1347, 1349-50 (11th Cir.2006). When that happens, the relevant \u201cquestion then is whether the [sentence imposed] is reasonable, assuming exactly the same conduct and other factors in the case,\u201d using the guideline range applicable without the error. <em>Id. </em>at 1350. If we determine on review that the sentence imposed was reasonable, it will be affirmed. <em>Id. </em>If, on the other hand, a district court commits an error and it is not-clear from the record whether the error affected the sentence, the sentence should be vacated. <em>See United States v. Hall, </em>704 F.3d 1317, 1323 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we typically perform two steps. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190. First, we \u2018\u201censure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, \u25a0 selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Once we determine that a sentence is procedurally sound, we examine whether the sentence was substantively reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">If the court decides after \u201cserious consideration\u201d that a sentence outside the applicable guideline range is warranted, it must explain why that variance is \u201cappropriate in a particular case with sufficient justifications.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 46, 128 S.Ct. 586. The justifications should be \u201csufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance\u201d and complete enough to allow for meaningful appellate review. <em>Id. </em>at 50, 128 S.Ct. 586. In reviewing a sentence outside the applicable guideline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>range, we take the degree of variance into account and ensure that the district court\u2019s justifications for the variance are \u201csufficiently compelling,\u201d but we must also give \u201cdue deference\u201d to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as a whole, support the variance. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1186-87 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (quotation omitted). The fact that we \u201cmight reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate\u201d is not sufficient to justify reversal. <em>Id. </em>at 1187 (quotation omitted). We will vacate a sentence only if we are left with \u201cthe definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1190 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">Federal law prescribes a 20-year maximum sentence for an alien who illegally reenters the United States and whose deportation was subsequent to a conviction for an aggravated felony. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). The statutory maximum for an alien who illegally re-enters the United States without such a felony is two years. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1326(a). When the statutory maximum sentence is less than the bottom of the applicable guideline range, the statutory maximum becomes the guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">Here, we cannot say that the district court\u2019s error was harmless because its sparse discussion at the sentencing hearing makes it unclear whether its error in not applying <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>affected the imposed sentence. <em>See Hall, </em>704 F.3d at 1323. Moreover, even if the district court would have reached the same result absent the error, the sentence imposed here was procedurally unreasonable. <em>See Keene, </em>470 F.3d at 1349-50. If the court considered the applicable guideline range to be 24 months pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(a) and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), it committed procedural error by applying the incorrect statutory maximum based on its erroneous <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>holding. <em>See Barner, </em>572 F.3d at 1247. If, however, the court retained the applicable guideline range set forth in the pre-sentence investigation report, the sentence was still procedurally unreasonable because the district court provided no explanation for the significant downward variance from the applicable guideline range of 46 to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 46, 50, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>United States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081, 1093-94 (11th Cir.2008). Accordingly, we vacate Pedraza-Mendoza\u2019s sentence and remand for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b879-6\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with, educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
