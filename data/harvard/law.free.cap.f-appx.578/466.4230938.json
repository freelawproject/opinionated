He was sentenced to 51 months\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 supervised release. For the first time on appeal, Trevino contends the district court erred by imposing a term of supervised release without providing fact-specific reasons for its decision to deviate from Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 5Dl.l(c) (recommending courts ordinarily not impose supervised release when alien defendant likely deported after imprisonment).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Because this issue was not preserved in district court, review is for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d 324, 327-28 (5th Cir.2012). Under that standard, Trevino must show a forfeited plain (clear or obvious) error that affected his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he shows such reversible plain error, we have the discretion to correct the error, but should do so only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">The district court retains the discretion to impose supervised release in eases involving a deportable alien where added deterrence and protection are needed. <em>E.g., Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d at 329. In sentencing Trevino, the court explained supervised release was imposed as an additional potential sanction should Trevino attempt to return illegally. Trevino fails to show the requisite clear or obvious error. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 329-30; <em>United States v. Becerril-Pena, </em>714 F.3d 347, 349-51 (5th Cir.2013) (affirming without deciding whether plain-error review applied because contention failed even under <em>de novo </em>review).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b493-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
