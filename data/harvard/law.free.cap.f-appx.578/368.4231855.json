Robles argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to meet the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He maintains that his within-guidelines range sentence should not be considered presumptively reasonable because the Guideline under which he was sentenced, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, is not empirically based, but he acknowledges that this argument is foreclosed. He asserts that his guidelines range was greater than necessary because \u00a7 2L1.2 double counted his prior convictions and because his offense was a mere trespass. He contends that the sentence failed to account for his personal history and characteristics because it did not reflect that he had not previously served a sentence greater than 24 months, that he returned to the United States because of threats caused by his previous cooperation with authorities, his advanced age, his ties to the United States, and his colon cancer diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-21\">\u201c[A] sentence within a properly calculated Guideline range is presumptively rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>sonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). As Robles concedes, his argument that his within-guidelines range sentence should not be considered presumptively reasonable because \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The district court rejected Robles\u2019s request for a below guidelines range sentence and sentenced Robles at the top of the guidelines range based upon Robles\u2019s long history of violent crimes. The international trespass and the double counting of prior convictions arguments that Robles raises have both been previously raised in this court without success. <em>See United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-31. As Robles was sentenced within the guidelines range, the sentence is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness, and Robles has not shown sufficient reason for us to disturb that presumption. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b394-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
