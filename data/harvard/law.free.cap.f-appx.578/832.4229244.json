No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-14\">Debtors filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief in April 2010 seeking, among other things, to avoid foreclosure on their home by stripping off a wholly unsecured third mortgage held by GLC. In March 2012, after extensive litigation and discovery, GLC filed a motion to dismiss Debtors\u2019 case. GLC argued, for the first time, that Debtors were ineligible for Chapter 13 relief because their unsecured debt exceeded the limit established by 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 109(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-15\">The bankruptcy court denied GLC\u2019s motion to dismiss, concluding that GLC\u2019s challenge to Debtors\u2019 Chapter 13 eligibility was barred by the doctrine of laches.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The bankruptcy court determined that the facts underlying GLC\u2019s eligibility argument were apparent from the record beginning in July 2010, that GLC failed to challenge Debtors\u2019 eligibility despite sever<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>al opportunities to do so, and that Debtors would suffer great prejudice if they were denied eligibility after pursuing a Chapter 13 Plan for nearly two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">GLC also objected to confirmation of Debtors\u2019 Chapter 13 Plan on the grounds that Debtors had acted in bad faith. The bankruptcy court overruled GLC\u2019s objections following an evidentiary hearing. On appeal, the district court, affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">When the district court affirms the bankruptcy court\u2019s order, we review only the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision on appeal. <em>Educ. Credit Mgmt. Corp. v. Mosley, </em>494 F.3d 1320, 1324 (11th Cir.2007). We review the bankruptcy court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>Hemar Ins. Corp. of Am. v. Cox, </em>338 F.3d 1238, 1241 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cA factual finding is not clearly erroneous unless \u2018this court, after reviewing all of the evidence, [is] left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">\n<em>I. Laches:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">The equitable doctrine of laches \u201cbars a plaintiff from maintaining a suit if he unreasonably delays in filing a suit and as a result harms the defendant.\u201d <em>Amtrak v. Morgan, </em>536 U.S. 101, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 2077, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002). \u201cTo establish laches, a defendant must demonstrate (1) a delay in asserting a right or a claim, (2) that the delay was not excusable, and (3) that there was undue prejudice to the party against whom the claim is asserted.\u201d <em>AmBrit, Inc. v. Kraft, Inc., </em>812 F.2d 1531, 1545 (11th Cir.1986); <em>see also In re Sly, </em>305 B.R. 67, 71 (Bankr.N.D.Fla.2003) (citing <em>AmBrit, Inc. </em>and analyzing a laches claim in the context of a bankruptcy proceeding). We review rulings on laches under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>See AmBrit, Inc., </em>812 F.2d at 1546.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-11\">That GLC could have identified the eligibility issue as early as July 2010 is undisputed. Instead, GLC\u2019s failure to inspect closely Debtors\u2019 schedules resulted in a delay of nearly 20 months before GLC filed its motion to dismiss. GLC concedes that it \u201coverlooked\u201d the eligibility issue, that its focus was on Debtors\u2019 alleged dishonesty, that the \u201cfocus on the honesty issue predominated and overshadowed [GLC\u2019s] attention to any other issue,\u201d and that, as a result, GLC \u201cdid not consider and was not looking for the eligibility issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b860-12\">Meanwhile, Debtors contend that they would suffer undue prejudice if they were denied Chapter 13 eligibility at such a late stage in the proceedings. Debtors specifically argue that when GLC filed its motion to dismiss, Debtors were already two thirds of the way through the Chapter 13 process and had already maintained their Chapter 13 plan payments for two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-13\">In the light of the record and the procedural history of this case, the bankruptcy court abused no discretion in concluding that Debtors would suffer undue prejudice as a result of GLC\u2019s delay and, thus, that GLC\u2019s eligibility argument was barred by the doctrine of laches. Moreover, the bankruptcy court was not required to conduct an evidentiary hearing on GLC\u2019s motion, particularly given the bankruptcy court\u2019s familiarity with the case and that both parties had the opportunity to brief the issue and present argument at a non-evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-14\">\n<em>II. Good Faith</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b860-15\">The Bankruptcy Code requires, among other things, that a debtor act in good faith when filing his petition and proposing his plan. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325(a)(3), (a)(7). A debtor\u2019s good faith is determined on a case-by-case basis, con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>sidering the totality of the circumstances. <em>See In re Kitchens, </em>702 F.2d 885, 888 (11th Cir.1983). In <em>In re Kitchens, </em>we identified several non-exclusive factors for bankruptcy courts to consider in determining whether a debtor has acted with the requisite good faith. <em>See id. </em>at 888-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">\u201cA bankruptcy court\u2019s determination whether a chapter 13 plan has been proposed in good faith is a finding of fact reviewable under the clearly erroneous standard.\u201d <em>Brown v. Gore (In re Brown), </em>742 F.3d 1309, 1315 (11th Cir.2014). We have said that \u201c[t]he bankruptcy court judge is in the best position to evaluate good faith and weigh the relevant <em>Kitchens </em>factors, as it sits as a finder of fact and can best assess motives and credibility.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">In ruling on GLC\u2019s objections to the confirmation of Debtors\u2019 Chapter 13 Plan, the bankruptcy court considered expressly the voluminous record, the testimony presented at the evidentiary hearing, and the parties\u2019 written closing arguments. The bankruptcy court addressed specifically each of GLC\u2019s arguments about Debtors\u2019 alleged bad faith and engaged in a detailed analysis of the factual record. Although the bankruptcy court found that portions of Debtors\u2019 testimony lacked credibility, the court determined \u2014 based on the totality of the circumstances and the <em>In re Kitchens </em>factors \u2014 that Debtors were \u201cbasically honest debtors for purposes of seeking Chapter 13 relief.\u201d Distinguishing Debtors\u2019 case from cases where debtors were found to have acted in bad faith, the bankruptcy court concluded that Debtors\u2019 had not engaged in \u201cthe type of egregious conduct that would prove bad faith and disqualify them from confirming their Chapter 13 plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">Having reviewed the record in this case and the bankruptcy court\u2019s careful analysis, we are not \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d The bankruptcy court committed no clear error in overruling GLC\u2019s objections to the confirmation of Debtor\u2019s Chapter 13 Plan.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b861-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b859-8\">. In the alternative, the bankruptcy court seemed to determine that, even if GLC\u2019s eligibility argument was not barred by laches, it would fail on the merits. Given the procedural history of the case, the bankruptcy court explained it would be appropriate to consider post-petition events in determining whether Debtors satisfied section 109(e). Because one of Debtors' creditors in fact failed to claim an unsecured debt, the amount of Debtors' unsecured claims did not exceed the limits established in section 109(e). Because we affirm the bankruptcy court's decision on laches, we need not address or decide about its alternative ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b861-7\">. Although the bankruptcy court \u2014 in its oral ruling \u2014 briefly remarked that GLC \u201cfailed to establish\u201d Debtors\u2019 bad faith, we reject GLC's argument that the bankruptcy court shifted impermissibly the burden of proof from Debtors to GLC. Isolated words \u2014 especially ambiguous ones \u2014 are inconclusive. The bankruptcy court set forth the correct legal standards for evaluating Debtors' good faith and applied properly the law to the facts of the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
