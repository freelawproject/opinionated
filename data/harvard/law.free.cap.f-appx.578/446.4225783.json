He was sentenced to 21 months as to each count and to three years of supervised release. Pargas-Rodriguez argues that the district court reversibly erred by failing to include the trait of helpfulness in the jury instruction on character evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Although Pargas-Rodriguez did not renew his objection when presented with the opportunity, his objection at the charge conference \u201cwas adequate to alert the court of [his] position\u201d that the character evidence instruction should include the trait of helpfulness. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>985 F.2d 749, 755 (5th Cir.1993). Accordingly, we review the district court\u2019s failure to provide Pargas-Rodriguez\u2019s requested jury instruction \u201cunder an abuse of discretion standard, affording the trial court substantial latitude in describing the law to the jurors.\u201d <em>See United States v. Rios, </em>636 F.3d 168, 171 (5th Cir.2011). We will reverse the district court\u2019s refusal to give a jury instruction only \u201cif the proposed jury instruction was (1) substantively correct, (2) not substantively covered in the jury charge, and (3) concerned an important issue at trial, such that failure to give the requested instruction seriously impaired the presentation of a defense.\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>132 F.3d 232, 242 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">The jury was instructed in accordance with the Fifth Circuit Pattern Jury Instruction for character evidence. <em>See </em>Fifth Circuit Pattern Jury Instruction 1.09. Although the district court did not include the specific trait of helpfulness, the jury was instructed that it could consider character evidence presented by Pargas-Rodriguez in reaching its verdict. Accordingly, the substance of Pargas-Rodriguez\u2019s requested instruction was already substantially covered by the jury charge. <em>See Jones, </em>132 F.3d at 242; <em>see also United States v. Whitfield, </em>590 F.3d 325, 354 (5th Cir.2009). Further, Pargas-Rodriguez was able to adequately present his defense that he was helping out a friend by bringing the occupants of the apartment food and supplies. <em>See United States v. Hunt, </em>794 F.2d 1095, 1098 (5th Cir.1986). Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to include the requested jury instruction on helpfulness in the jury charge. <em>See Rios, </em>636 F.3d at 171. The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b472-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
