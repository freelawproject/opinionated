Black\u2019s complaint alleged an Eighth Amendment claim of deliberate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>indifference to his serious medical need, Hepatitis C. After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">In granting summary judgment, the district court did not err because Black failed to present any evidence that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his Hepatitis C. To show that the defendants acted with \u201cdeliberate indifference,\u201d Black had to present evidence from which a jury reasonably could conclude that the defendants knowingly disregarded a risk of serious harm by conduct that was more than gross negligence. <em>See Townsend v. Jefferson Cnty., </em>601 F.3d 1152, 1158 (11th Cir.2010) (explaining that deliberate indifference requires proof of \u201c(1) subjective knowledge of a risk of serious harm; (2) disregard of that risk; (3) by conduct that is more than gross negligence\u201d (quotation marks and brackets omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">Hepatitis C is an infectious disease that primarily affects the liver. Although Hepatitis C often has no symptoms, chronic infection can lead to liver damage, cirrhosis, liver cancer, and liver failure. The parties do not dispute that Black\u2019s Hepatitis C is a serious medical need.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">In Black\u2019s case, however, it is also undisputed that Black received regular care and close monitoring of his Hepatitis C. The Alabama DOC policy, adopted from the Federal Bureau of Prisons, sets forth criteria inmates must satisfy for placement in its Hepatitis C Treatment Program, in which inmates are considered for antiviral drug treatment. The policy prioritizes referral of inmates for antiviral drug treatment based on lab results. The medical staff at Limestone\u2019s Chronic Care Clinic routinely monitored Black\u2019s lab results to determine if he was a candidate for the program. Black\u2019s periodic liver function and liver enzyme test results were in the normal range and indicated that his condition was stable. Black\u2019s stable condition made him ineligible for placement in the Hepatitis C Treatment Program. Meanwhile, Limestone\u2019s medical staff continued to monitor Black and treated his symptoms, some which were unrelated to his Hepatitis C.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-10\">In particular, in September 2011, shortly after being transferred to Limestone, Black was examined for complaints of abdominal and rectal pain, and the examination yielded normal results. In October 2011, Black received several tests to monitor his Hepatitis C, but none of the results showed any developing problems with regard to the virus. At that time, Black\u2019s AST-To-Platelet Ratio Index (APRI) and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) levels were stable and within the normal range, and his liver showed no signs of cirrhosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-11\">In June 2012, Black again complained of discomfort in his abdomen, nausea, vomiting, and constipation. Black was examined and received a kidney, ureter, and bladder (KUB) x-ray, which was normal. Black\u2019s most recent tests in July 2013 showed that his APRI and ANC scores remained within normal limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-12\">Throughout, Black received regular care and monitoring for his Hepatitis C and medication for his symptoms, such as Lac-tulose to manage his blood ammonia levels. Black\u2019s condition remained stable, and he never had medical issues requiring immediate admission to the Hepatitis C Treatment Program. Moreover, Black did not suffer any negative health consequences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>from not being in the Hepatitis C Treatment Program.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">Contrary to Black\u2019s claims, this is not a case of denied or delayed treatment. Rather, the record establishes that Black received treatment for his Hepatitis C. Moreover, given the undisputed facts, no reasonable jury could conclude that the defendants, in treating Black, knowingly disregarded a serious risk of harm to him or that the treatment given amounted to more than gross negligence. <em>See Townsend, </em>601 F.3d at 1158.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">To the extent Black contends the defendants should have placed him in the Hepatitis C Treatment Program, a mere disagreement between an inmate and the prison\u2019s medical staff as to the course of treatment does not establish deliberate indifference. <em>See Harris v. Thigpen, </em>941 F.2d 1495, 1505 (11th Cir.1991). Because Black\u2019s condition was stable, and he did not suffer any negative health consequences by continuing to receive care at Limestone\u2019s Chronic Care Clinic, a jury could not reasonably conclude that the failure to put Black in the Hepatitis C Treatment Program was \u201cso grossly incompetent, inadequate, or excessive as to shock the conscience or to be intolerable to fundamental fairness.\u201d <em>See id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-9\">For all of these reasons, the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on Black\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b821-8\">. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court's grant of summary judgment, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Owen v. I.C. Sys., Inc., </em>629 F.3d 1263, 1270 (11th Cir.2011). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b822-6\">. In the district court, Black submitted a \"Rebuttal\u201d but that \"Rebuttal\u201d was not sworn or made under penalty of perjury, as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, and thus cannot create a factual dispute for summary judgment purposes. <em>See Gordon v. Watson, </em>622 F.2d 120, 123 (5th Cir.1980) (explaining that unsworn statements, even by <em>pro se </em>parties, should not be \"consider[ed] in determining the propriety of summary judgment\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b822-7\">. In December 2011, Nurse Debra Means at Limestone completed a Hepatitis C Treatment Referral Form on Black\u2019s behalf and faxed it to the Alabama DOC, the first step to be considered for placement in the Hepatitis C Treatment Program. Although the Alabama DOC did not receive the faxed referral form, Dr. Hugh Hood averred that, had the referral form been received, Black would have been deemed ineligible for the program at that time because of his normal lab results. Further, on July 29, 2013, Limestone medical staff submitted a second referral form for Black, which was under review while this action was pending in the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b822-21\">.On appeal, Black does not challenge the district court's dismissal without prejudice of his state law claims or his claims against Billy Mitchem, the former Warden at Limestone. Accordingly, these claims are abandoned. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
