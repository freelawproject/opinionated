Because we hold that defendant\u2019s prior DNA tests were not \u201cdefinitive\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 2953.74(A), we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals, but we remand the cause to the trial court to consider whether new DNA testing would be \u201coutcome determinative\u201d pursuant to R.C. 2953.74(B) and 2953.71(L).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-15\">Facts and Procedural Posture</p>\n<p id=\"b149-16\">{\u00b6 2} In 1997, Dr. Margo Prade was shot and killed in her van while parked outside of her medical office in Akron, Ohio. Her ex-husband, Akron Police Captain Douglas Prade, defendant-appellant, was tried and convicted for her murder and sentenced to life in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-17\">{\u00b6 3} The key physical evidence at trial was the bite mark that the killer made on Dr. Prade\u2019s arm through her lab coat and blouse. One of the state\u2019s experts testified that the bite mark was \u201cconsistent with\u201d defendant\u2019s teeth but concluded that \u201cthere\u2019s just not enough to say one way or the other\u201d that it was defendant\u2019s. The state\u2019s other expert testified that the mark \u201cwas made by Captain Prade.\u201d A defense expert opined that defendant\u2019s loose dentures meant that \u201cthe act of biting for Mr. Prade, is a virtual impossibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-18\">{\u00b6 4} The state also offered testimony from two eyewitnesses. One testified that he saw defendant near the murder scene before the murder, but also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>testified that although he learned of the murder the day it occurred, he came forward nine months later after months of press coverage that had featured defendant\u2019s photo. The other eyewitness testified that he was standing in the parking lot when he heard the possible killer\u2019s car \u201cpeeling off,\u201d and although he \u201cdidn\u2019t pay it no attention\u201d and did not identify anyone in his first two police interviews, he later identified defendant as the man inside the car during his third interview. The defendant also called an alibi witness, who testified that she saw defendant exercising at roughly the time of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">{\u00b6 5} The trial court sentenced defendant to life in prison, and the Court of Appeals for Summit County affirmed his convictions on appeal. State <em>v. Prade </em>(2000), 139 Ohio App.3d 676, 745 N.E.2d 475. This court declined discretionary review. <em>State v. Prade </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 1490, 739 N.E.2d 816.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">{\u00b6 6} In 2004, defendant filed an application for postconviction DNA testing pursuant to R.C. 2953.71. The trial court denied the application, concluding that defendant did not qualify for DNA testing, because R.C. 2953.74(A) precludes postconviction DNA testing when \u201ca prior definitive DNA test has been conducted.\u201d The trial court also determined that DNA evidence had been introduced at defendant\u2019s trial and excluded defendant as the source of the DNA samples taken from the victim. The court of appeals dismissed defendant\u2019s appeal as untimely. <em>State v. Prade, </em>9th Dist. No. 22718.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">{\u00b6 7} In 2008, defendant filed a second application for postconviction DNA testing. The trial court denied his second application, concluding again that defendant did not qualify for postconviction DNA testing because prior definitive DNA testing had been conducted. In addition, the trial court further determined that defendant failed to show that additional DNA testing would be outcome-determinative, as required by R.C. 2953.74(B), because the prior DNA testing had excluded defendant as a source of the DNA tested for trial and other evidence at trial supported his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">{\u00b6 8} The court of appeals affirmed the trial court judgment. The cause is now before this court pursuant to the acceptance of a discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">{\u00b6 9} The General Assembly enacted Ohio\u2019s DNA testing statutes in 2003 and has amended them twice since then. 2003 Sub.S.B. No. 11, 150 Ohio Laws, Part IV, 6498; 2004 Sub.H.B. No. 525, 150 Ohio Laws, Part IV, 6262; and 2006 Sub.S.B. No. 262.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> R.C. 2953.71 through 2953.84 governs postconviction DNA testing. At issue here is R.C. 2953.74, concerning the effect of prior tests:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>{\u00b6 10} \u201c(A) If an eligible inmate submits an application for DNA testing under section 2953.73 of the Revised Code and a <em>prior definitive DNA test </em>has been conducted regarding the same biological evidence that the inmate seeks to have tested, the court shall reject the inmate\u2019s application. If an eligible inmate files an application for DNA testing and a prior inconclusive DNA test has been conducted regarding the same biological evidence that the inmate seeks to have tested, the court shall review the application and has the discretion, on a case-by-case basis, to either accept or reject the application. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-4\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c(B) If an eligible inmate submits an application for DNA testing under section 2953.73 of the Revised Code, the court may accept the application only if one of the following applies:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-6\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c(2) The inmate had a DNA test taken at the trial stage in the case in which the inmate was convicted of the offense for which the inmate is an eligible inmate and is requesting the DNA testing regarding the same biological evidence that the inmate seeks to have tested, <em>the test was not a prior definitive DNA test </em>that is subject to division (A) of this section, <em>and </em>the inmate shows that DNA exclusion when analyzed in the context of and upon consideration of all available admissible evidence related to the subject inmate\u2019s case as described in division (D) of this section <em>would have been outcome determinative at the trial stage in that case.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">{\u00b6 14} The trial court denied defendant\u2019s renewed motion for postconviction DNA testing pursuant to the statute, concluding that a \u201cprior definitive test\u201d had already been performed. Moreover, the court concluded that even if it could further consider defendant\u2019s petition, the petition would fail under R.C. 2953.74(B) because an exclusion result would only duplicate the result at trial and would not be outcome-determinative. The court of appeals agreed with the trial court\u2019s analysis of whether the first test was definitive. 2009-0hio-704, 2009 WL 388217, \u00b6 13. However, although initially concluding that the issue whether the new DNA test would have been outcome-determinative was moot, \u00b6 15, the court went on to comment that it failed to see how yet another DNA exclusion would have been outcome-determinative at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">\n<em>Prior Definitive or Inconclusive DNA Test</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">{\u00b6 15} The phrase \u201cdefinitive DNA test\u201d in R.C. 2953.74 is not defined. The court of appeals used a dictionary definition of the word \u201cdefinitive\u201d: \u201c \u2018serving to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>provide a final solution or to end a situation.\u2019 \u201d 2009-0hio-704, 2009 WL 388217, \u00b6 8, quoting Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (11th Ed.2004) 327. Both the trial and appellate courts concluded that the prior DNA testing in this case was definitive because it excluded defendant. Id. at \u00b6 13. We disagree with the conclusion that the prior test was definitive.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">{\u00b6 16} At defendant\u2019s trial in 1998, there were several pieces of biological evidence tested for DNA, including (1) Dr. Prade\u2019s fingernail clippings, (2) a bite mark left on the fabric of the lab coat Dr. Prade was wearing when she was murdered, and (3) a broken, bloodstained bracelet.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">{\u00b6 17} Of that evidence, the most significant was the fabric on the victim\u2019s lab coat over the bite mark. The state\u2019s DNA testing expert agreed that the victim\u2019s lab coat over the bite mark on Dr. Prade\u2019s arm was \u201cthe best possible source of DNA evidence as to her killer\u2019s identity.\u201d During the attack, Dr. Prade apparently tried to defend herself by using her arm to push the killer away. The killer bit her arm through two layers of clothing \u2014 her lab coat and her blouse\u2014 and left a bite mark on her arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">{\u00b6 18} The testing done on the samples at issue back in 1998 was polymerase chain reaction testing (\u201cPCR\u201d). In 1998, Dr. Thomas Callaghan of the FBI testified that PCR testing had been available for over ten years and was the basis for many diagnostic tests. Dr. Callaghan tested some cuttings of cloth from the lab coat that Dr. Prade was wearing at the time of her death. One of the cuttings came from the bite mark that was on the sleeve in the biceps area. Dr. Callaghan testified that he analyzed the bite mark in three samples \u2014 the right side, the left side, and the center of the bite mark \u2014 because if the biter\u2019s tongue came into contact with the area, some skin cells from the biter\u2019s lips or tongue may have been left on the fabric of the lab coat. However, Callaghan also testified that due to the amount of Dr. Prade\u2019s blood on her lab coat, the DNA from Dr. Prade\u2019s blood overwhelmed or diluted the DNA from the biter\u2019s skin cells. Dr. Callaghan testified that although DNA other than Dr. Prade\u2019s would have been important in identifying the killer, the bite mark showed only Dr. Prade\u2019s DNA.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">{\u00b6 19} Because defendant was excluded as a contributor to the DNA that was typed in this case, the lower courts concluded that the prior DNA tests done in 1998 were definitive. However, the only information that the DNA testing on the lab coat revealed was that Dr. Prade\u2019s blood was present on her lab coat. The state\u2019s expert agreed that the 1998 DNA \u201ctest results [did] not give [him] any information about the killer\u201d and that \u201cthe bite mark show[ed] [him] Margo Prade\u2019s DNA only.\u201d Therefore, the testing excluded defendant only in the sense that the DNA <em>found </em>was not his, because it was the victim\u2019s. But the \u201cexclusion\u201d excluded everyone other than the victim in that the victim\u2019s DNA overwhelmed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>the killer\u2019s DNA due to the limitations of the 1998 testing methods. Therefore, the exclusion was meaningless, and the test cannot be deemed to have been definitive.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">\n<em>New DNA Testing Methods</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">{\u00b6 20} Since 1998, DNA testing has advanced so far that \u201ca DNA profile may now be developed from items which were previously unsuccessfully typed or potentially not attempted due to the compromised or limited nature of the sample,\u201d according to one of the expert witnesses. The PCR DNA testing used in this case in 1998 has been largely replaced by two newer technologies \u2014 short tandem repeat (or STR) testing and Y-chromosome STR (or Y-STR) testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">{\u00b6 21} One of the difficulties with the older DNA testing methods was that, as seen in the tests conducted on Dr. Prade\u2019s lab coat over the killer\u2019s bite mark in 1998, if there was a substantial quantity of the victim\u2019s DNA present, it might overwhelm and prevent detection of the perpetrator\u2019s DNA. As an expert explained in an affidavit, \u201cY-STR testing avoids this problem, because it detects only the male Y-chromosome on the swab, thus ignoring the overwhelming percentage of female DNA present that may otherwise \u2018drown out\u2019 the male perpetrator\u2019s DNA profile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">{\u00b6 22} When asked to provide an opinion on the value of Y-STR testing on the possible bite mark from Dr. Prade\u2019s lab coat, the DNA quality assurance administrator from the Ohio Attorney General\u2019s Office, Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation, stated: \u201cIf the lab coat cutting contains a bite mark, it is not unexpected that the DNA tests used in 1998 failed to detect DNA from the biter. When testing mixtures of DNA from two people, it is possible to resolve the different contributors so long as they are present in relatively equal proportions. If the minor component falls much below about one tenth of the total, it will not be detected. It has been my experience that trace amounts of DNA are particularly unlikely to be detected when they occur on an item which contains blood, as blood is a very rich source of DNA. * * * More recently, Y-STR tests that detect DNA found only in males have become available. In casework, I routinely see where Y-STR testing can resolve the minor male component in mixtures containing an overwhelming amount of female DNA. * * * I believe that Y-STR testing has the potential to identify any male DNA that might be contained within the lab coat bite mark sample.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">{\u00b6 23} Thus, new DNA testing methods are now able to provide new information that was not able to be detected at the time of defendant\u2019s trial. We hold that a prior DNA test is not \u201cdefinitive\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 2953.74(A) when a new DNA testing method can detect information that could not be detected by the prior DNA test.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>\n<em>Outcome-determinative</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">{\u00b6 24} In addition to being required to show that prior DNA testing done at the trial stage was not a prior definitive DNA test, the inmate must show that the DNA exclusion when analyzed in the context of and upon consideration of all available admissible evidence related to the defendant\u2019s case <em>would have been outcome-determinative at the trial in that case. </em>R.C. 2953.74(B)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">{\u00b6 25} R.C. 2953.71 provides that \u201coutcome determinative\u201d means that \u201chad the results of DNA testing of the subject inmate been presented at the trial of the subject inmate requesting DNA testing and been found relevant and admissible with respect to the felony offense for which the inmate is an eligible inmate and is requesting the DNA testing or for which the inmate is requesting the DNA testing under section 2953.82 of the Revised Code, and had those results been analyzed in the context of and upon consideration of all available admissible evidence related to the inmate\u2019s case as described in division (D) of section 2953.74 of the Revised Code, <em>there is a strong probability that no reasonable factfinder would have found the inmate guilty of that offense </em>* * (Emphasis added.) R.C. 2953.71(L).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">{\u00b6 26} After finding that the prior testing in this case was definitive, the trial court stated that defendant\u2019s application for DNA testing also failed under R.C. 2953.74(B) because new testing would not be outcome-determinative. However, the overall focus of the trial court\u2019s opinion was on the issue of the definitiveness of the DNA testing introduced at trial, and because of that focus, the court gave minimal consideration to analyzing whether a new test would be outcome-determinative.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">{\u00b6 27} In reviewing whether a new test would be outcome-determinative, the appellate court initially stated that the issue was moot, 2009-0hio-704, 2009 WL 388217, \u00b6 15, but then stated in the next paragraph of the opinion that defendant\u2019s assignment of error on the issue was overruled, id. at \u00b6 16, thus appearing to affirm the judgment of the trial court on the issue. The appellate court\u2019s overall focus in the appeal was very similar to the focus of the trial court \u2014 -the appellate court\u2019s analysis concentrated on whether the previous testing was definitive and then dealt with whether new testing would be outcome-determinative in a limited manner that made no attempt to engage in any concerted application of the statutes relevant to that issue. Like the trial court, the appellate court approached outcome-determinativeness from the perspective that the previous testing was definitive.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">{\u00b6 28} Neither court below considered R.C. 2953.74(B) and 2953.71(L) in detail because they each resolved the issue of definitiveness against the inmate \u2014 an issue that must be decided in an inmate\u2019s favor before the question of whether additional testing would be outcome-determinative has any relevance. Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>we reverse on the issue of the definitiveness of the prior testing, the trial court must be given the opportunity to consider outcome-determinativeness in detail as the statutes envision. Therefore, rather than applying R.C. 2953.74(B)(2) and 2953.71(L) at this point in the case, we remand the cause to the trial court for that court to consider whether the new DNA testing would be outcome-determinative. The trial court should consider the issue in light of our conclusion that the prior testing was not definitive but should now focus on the express requirements of those statutes for outcome-determinativeness.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">{\u00b6 29} We do not have before us the issue of whether to allow new DNA testing in cases in which a prior DNA test provided a match or otherwise provided meaningful information and the inmate is simply asking for a new test using the latest testing methods. Rather, our holding is limited to situations in which advances in DNA testing have made it possible to learn information about DNA evidence that could not even be detected at the earlier trial. \u201c[I]t was partially the development of Y-STR technology that prompted the General Assembly to enact R.C. 2953.71 through 2953.83 in order to allow otherwise qualified inmates the opportunity to take advantage of advances in technology that were not available at the time of their trials.\u201d <em>State v. Emerick, </em>170 Ohio App.3d 647, 2007-Ohio-1334, 868 N.E.2d 742, \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">{\u00b6 30} Because we hold that a prior DNA test is not \u201cdefinitive\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 2953.74(A) when a new DNA testing method can detect information that could not be detected by the prior DNA test, the DNA testing completed at the time of defendant\u2019s trial in 1998 was not a \u201cprior definitive test\u201d within the meaning of the postconviction DNA testing statutes. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the cause to the trial court to consider whether new DNA testing would be outcome-determinative.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b155-10\">Pfeifer, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b155-11\">Delaney and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b155-12\">Brown, C.

The General Assembly has enacted 2010 Sub.S.B. No. 77, which amends Ohio\u2019s postconviction DNA testing laws and now provides a definition for the phrase \u201cdefinitive DNA test,\u201d which is very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>similar to the definition established by this court. However, the recent amendments do not apply to our decision today, as this appeal predates the passage of this bill and concerns the definition of the law that existed at the time of the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b155-14\">O\u2019Donnell, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A-\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-15\">{\u00b6 31} I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>{\u00b6 32} In 1998, a jury convicted Douglas Prade of the murder of his ex-wife, Dr. Margo Prade. At trial, the prosecution presented evidence of a bite mark on Dr. Prade\u2019s arm that the killer made by biting through her lab coat and blouse. DNA testing of biological evidence found on the lab coat identified only Dr. Prade\u2019s DNA.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">{\u00b6 33} In 2004, Prade applied for postconviction DNA testing of the biological evidence offered at trial, including the part of the lab coat that had covered the bite mark. However, the trial court concluded that R.C. 2953.74(A) barred retesting of the DNA on the lab coat because a prior definitive DNA test had been conducted, and that test excluded Prade as the source of the DNA. Prade failed to timely appeal that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">{\u00b6 34} In 2008, Prade filed a second application for DNA testing, contending that advances in testing technology permitted the discovery and identification of any DNA that Dr. Prade\u2019s killer may have left on the lab coat. The trial court once again rejected his application on the basis that a prior definitive test had been conducted on this evidence and that the test had definitively excluded Prade as the source of that DNA. The court of appeals affirmed the denial of another DNA test on the lab coat, and Prade appealed that decision to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">{\u00b6 35} At issue in this appeal is whether the General Assembly intended for courts to consider technological advancements in DNA testing in determining whether a prior definitive DNA test has been conducted on the same biological evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">{\u00b6 36} R.C. 2953.74(A) provides: \u201cIf an eligible inmate submits an application for DNA testing under section 2953.73 of the Revised Code and a prior definitive DNA test has been conducted regarding the same biological evidence that the inmate seeks to have tested, the court shall reject the inmate\u2019s application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">{\u00b6 37} This case presents a straightforward question of statutory construction. As we explained in <em>State v. Buehler, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 114, 2007-Ohio-1246, 863 N.E.2d 124, in construing statutes, \u201c \u2018our paramount concern is the legislative intent in enacting the statute.\u2019 Furthermore, \u2018[i]n determining this intent, we first review the statutory language, reading words and phrases in context and construing them according to the rules of grammar and common usage.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.) Id. at \u00b6 29, quoting <em>State ex rel. Steele v. Morrissey, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 355, 2004-Ohio-4960, 815 N.E.2d 1107, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">{\u00b6 38} Here, the General Assembly has not defined the word \u201cdefinitive\u201d for purposes of postconviction DNA testing. Thus, as we stated in <em>State v. Anthony, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 173, 2002-Ohio-4008, 772 N.E.2d 1167, \u00b6 11, an undefined term in a statute \u201cmust be given its plain and ordinary meaning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>{\u00b6 39} According to Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986) 592, the word \u201cdefinitive\u201d means \u201cserving to supply a final answer, solution, or evaluation and to end an unsettled unresolved condition.\u201d Accordingly, for purposes of R.C. 2953.74(A), a definitive DNA test is one that supplies a final answer in identifying the biological evidence tested.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">{\u00b6 40} Notably, neither the plain meaning of the word \u201cdefinitive\u201d nor any other provision of the postconviction DNA testing statute authorizes the trial court to consider advances in testing technology to determine whether prior DNA tests were definitive. Moreover, if trial courts began to consider advances in testing technology, no test would ever be considered definitive, because the standards would continue to evolve and never reveal a final result. The finality of a conviction could therefore be undermined each time a new method of examination or technological advance occurred, even if the biological evidence had already been the subject of multiple postconviction DNA examinations. The General Assembly intended to preserve final judgments and never provided for the constant reexamination of DNA samples based on scientific advances.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">{\u00b6 41} This construction of the statute is supported by the narrow remedy afforded inmates in seeking postconviction relief. As this court explained in <em>State v. Steffen </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 399, 410, 639 N.E.2d 67, postconviction review is not a constitutional right, and it provides only \u201ca narrow remedy.\u201d Because of the significant societal interest in the finality of judgments, the postconviction-relief statute provides only a limited opportunity to collaterally attack a conviction, an opportunity not intended to allow inmates to relitigate issues previously resolved at trial. See id. (explaining that res judicata applies to actions for posteonviction relief); <em>State v. Gondor, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 377, 2006-Ohio-6679, 860 N.E.2d 77, \u00b6 47 (noting that courts construe statutes establishing postconviction relief narrowly to uphold the societal interest in final judgments). As we stated in <em>State v. Szefcyk </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 93, 671 N.E.2d 233: \u201c \u2018 \u201c[Pjublic policy dictates that there be an end of litigation; that those who have contested an issue shall be bound by the result of the contest, and that matters once tried shall be considered forever settled as between the parties.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Id. at 95, 671 N.E.2d 233, quoting <em>Federated Dept. Stores, Inc. v. Moitie </em>(1981), 452 U.S. 394, 401, 101 S.Ct. 2424, 69 L.Ed.2d 103, quoting <em>Baldwin v. Iowa State Traveling Men\u2019s Assn. </em>(1931), 283 U.S. 522, 525, 51 S.Ct. 517, 75 L.Ed. 1244.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">{\u00b6 42} This court should treat an inmate\u2019s postconviction application for DNA testing no differently. Notably, in <em>District Attorney\u2019s Office for Third Judicial Dist. v. Osborne </em>(2009), \u2014 U.S.-,-, 129 S.Ct. 2308, 2323, 174 L.Ed.2d 38, the Supreme Court of the United States declined to recognize a freestanding constitutional right to postconviction DNA testing. The court explained that any due process right of access to DNA evidence \u201cmust be analyzed in light of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>fact that [the inmate] has already been found guilty <em>at a fair </em>trial, and has only a limited interest in postconviction relief,\u201d id. at 2320, and it recognized that resolving the dilemma of \u201chow to harness DNA\u2019s power to prove innocence without unnecessarily overthrowing the established system of criminal justice\u201d is a \u201ctask [that] belongs primarily to the legislature,\u201d id. at 2316.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b158-10\">Sherri Bevan Walsh, Summit County Prosecuting Attorney, and Richard S. Kasay, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b158-11\">Jones Day, David Booth Alden, and Ann Netzel; and Ohio Innocence Project, Mark A. Godsey, and David M. Laing, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">{\u00b6 43} In enacting R.C. 2953.71 et seq., the General Assembly took up this task, considered the public-policy questions raised by postconviction DNA testing, measured an inmate\u2019s interest in proving actual innocence against the societal interest in the finality of judgments, and established a limited remedy affording postconviction DNA testing in cases where biological evidence has not been the subject of a prior definitive test. This court should not expand that remedy beyond the statute\u2019s express terms. The legislature could have provided for courts to consider advances in testing technology in determining whether prior tests were definitive, yet it chose not to do so. Instead, by barring applications for retesting when there has been a prior <em>definitive </em>test, the legislature signaled its intent to uphold the finality of convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">{\u00b6 44} As the trial court found, the prior DNA test definitively identified the biological evidence as belonging to Dr. Prade and as excluding Douglas Prade as a source. Thus, this is not a case in which DNA tests were performed that produced no valid and scientifically reliable result. Rather, the polymerase chain reaction tests performed before trial supplied a final answer as to the source of the DNA found on Dr. Prade\u2019s lab coat, and Prade had a full and fair opportunity to challenge any of the shortcomings of this DNA testing technique at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">{\u00b6 45} Because R.C. 2953.74 makes no provision for technological advancements in defining what constitutes a prior definitive test, and because the prior DNA tests were therefore definitive, Prade is barred from applying for postcon-viction DNA testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">{\u00b6 46} For these reasons, I would abide by the General Assembly\u2019s resolution of the competing public-policy concerns at issue here and hold that a prior DNA test may be considered definitive notwithstanding the development of new DNA testing techniques. Accordingly, I would affirm the decision of the court of appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b158-9\">Delaney, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison, L.L.P., and Michele Hirshman, urging reversal for amicus curiae, The Innocence Network.</attorneys>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
