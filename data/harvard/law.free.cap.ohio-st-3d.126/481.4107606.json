Lindeman, to issue a new sentencing entry in Cunningham\u2019s criminal case to comply with Crim.R. 32(C). Cunningham\u2019s sentencing entry fully complied with Crim.R. 32(C), as construed in <em>State v. Baker, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 197, 2008-Ohio-3330, 893 N.E.2d 163, syllabus, by including the finding of the court upon which his conviction is based, the sentence, the signature of the judge, and the time-stamp journalization by the clerk of court. <em>State ex rel. Pruitt v. Cuyahoga Cty.'Court of Common Pleas, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 402, 2010-Ohio-1808, 928 N.E.2d 722, \u00b6 3. The entry specified that Cunningham was tried and was found guilty by the court and that the court imposed no additional major-drug-offender term. Consequently, Cunningham had an adequate remedy by appeal to raise the claimed sentencing errors. <em>State ex rel. Cotton v. Russo, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 449, 2010-Ohio-2111, 928 N.E.2d 1092, \u00b6 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b603-13\">Brown, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
