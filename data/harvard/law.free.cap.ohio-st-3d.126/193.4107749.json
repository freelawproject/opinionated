Sutula, to resentence him. Barr\u2019s 2007 sentencing entry constituted a final, appealable order, which fully complied with Crim.R. 32(C) and <em>State v. Baker, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 197, 2008-Ohio-3330, 893 N.E.2d 163, syllabus (\u201cA judgment of conviction is a final appealable order under R.C. 2505.02 when it sets forth (1) the guilty plea, the jury verdict, <em>or the finding of the court upon which the conviction is based; </em>(2) the sentence; (3) the signature of the judge; and (4) entry on the journal by the clerk of court\u201d [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>By specifying in the sentencing entry that \u201cthe court found the defendant guilty of robbery 2911.02-F2 with notice prior conviction, repeat violent offender specification 2941.149 as charged in Count(s) 2 of the indictment,\u201d Judge Sutula sufficiently set forth the findings upon which Barr\u2019s bench conviction is based. Crim.R. 32(C). The judge was not required to add language that the court found the defendant guilty of the offenses after a bench trial; that additional language would have been superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-12\">{\u00b6 3} Therefore, the court of appeals correctly held that Barr is not entitled to the requested extraordinary relief in mandamus.
