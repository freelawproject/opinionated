Because the court of appeals patently and unambiguously lacks jurisdiction to proceed in the appeal because it was not filed pursuant to R.C. 2945.67(A) and App.R. 5(C), we grant the requested extraordinary relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b527-12\">{\u00b6 2} In 1982, relator, David J. Steffen, was indicted for aggravated murder with capital specifications, rape, and aggravated burglary. The aggravated-murder charge was based on the intentional killing of Karen Range while committing or attempting to commit rape. After a jury found him guilty of all counts and recommended the death penalty, the trial court sentenced Steffen to death for the aggravated-murder conviction and to consecutive prison terms of seven to 25 years on his remaining convictions for rape and aggravated burglary. The court of appeals affirmed the convictions and sentence. <em>State v. Steffen </em>(Dec. 11, 1985), Hamilton App. No. C-830445,1985 WL 4301, *18.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-13\">{\u00b6 3} This court affirmed the judgment of the court of appeals. <em>State v. Steffen </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 111, 31 OBR 273, 509 N.E.2d 383. We emphasized that Steffen\u2019s denial of the rape charge indicated lack of cooperation with law enforcement and that the evidence \u201cleads to a compelling conclusion that a rape had occurred and that [Steffen] was the perpetrator.\u201d Id. at 118, fn. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-14\">{\u00b6 4} Steffen subsequently filed a petition in a federal district court for a writ of habeas corpus. During the pendency of the federal case, the Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation (\u201cBCI\u201d) conducted DNA testing of the vaginal-swab specimen taken during the victim\u2019s autopsy. DNA testing had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>been available when Steffen was prosecuted. The test results eliminated him as the depositor of the semen. The federal district court then ordered the case returned to the common pleas court so that Steffen could exhaust his available state remedy for consideration of the DNA test results.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">{\u00b6 5} In August 2006, Steffen filed a motion for leave to file a delayed motion for a new trial pursuant to Crim.R. 33 based on the newly discovered DNA test results. The state filed a response joining in Steffen\u2019s request for leave, and after the common pleas court granted him permission, Steffen filed his delayed motion for a new trial. Additional DNA testing by an outside laboratory confirmed BCI\u2019s results. The DNA on the victim\u2019s swab specimen was later matched to the DNA of a former Hamilton County Coroner\u2019s Office employee, who confessed to abusing the victim\u2019s corpse between the time of its arrival at the county morgue and the autopsy.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">{\u00b6 6} On February 17, 2009, the court of common pleas reduced Steffen\u2019s rape conviction to attempted rape at the state\u2019s request. The court also denied Steffen\u2019s motion for a new guilt-phase trial, but granted his request for a new penalty-phase trial. The court stated that it was granting the new penalty-phase trial \u201c[bjecause the jury, the trial court, and the appellate courts all based their recommendations and conclusions as to the death penalty on a finding that [Steffen] raped the victim and was lying when he said he did not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">{\u00b6 7} The next day, the state filed a notice of appeal from \u201cthe February 17, 2009 decision of the trial court in which the trial court granted Steffen a New Trial as to the penalty phase of his capital murder case.\u201d The state\u2019s notice of appeal was not accompanied by a motion for leave to appeal the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">{\u00b6 8} On March 16, 2009, the common pleas court filed a journal entry, which specified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-9\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cFor reasons set forth in [the court\u2019s] February 17, 2009 decision, the amended motion for a new trial is DENIED as to the guilt phase proceedings, the verdict for Count Two of the indictment is MODIFIED from rape to attempted rape, and the amended motion for a new trial is GRANTED as to the penalty phase of the proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-10\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cIt is therefore ORDERED that Defendant David Steffen\u2019s conviction as to Count Two of the Indictment be reduced from rape to attempted rape [R.C. 2921.03 as applied to R.C. 2907.02], a felony of the second degree; and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-11\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cORDERED that the previously imposed sentence of death as to Count One of the Indictment, Aggravated Murder with Capital Specifications, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>previously imposed indefinite terms of imprisonment for Count Two, Rape be VACATED, and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-5\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cORDERED that this case be scheduled for a new sentencing hearing.\u201d (Capitalization sic.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">{\u00b6 13} Steffen filed a notice of cross-appeal from the portion of the decision denying his request for a new jury trial on the issue of guilt. Later, he filed a motion in the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County to dismiss the state\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the state failed to file a motion for leave to appeal the trial court\u2019s ruling concurrently with its notice of appeal. On June 5, 2009, the state filed both a memorandum opposing the motion to dismiss and a delayed motion for leave to appeal. The court of appeals denied Steffen\u2019s motion to dismiss the state\u2019s appeal because it \u201cwas taken as a matter of right under R.C. 2945.67(A).\u201d The court also denied as moot the state\u2019s motion for leave to appeal. After the court of appeals denied Steffen\u2019s application for reconsideration of the decision denying his dismissal motion, the state filed its merit brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">{\u00b6 14} On December 1, 2009, Steffen filed this action for a writ of prohibition to prevent respondents, the judges of the court of appeals, from proceeding on the state\u2019s appeal. The judges filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, and Steffen filed a memorandum in opposition. We granted an alternative writ and issued a schedule for the submission of evidence and briefs. <em>State ex rel. Steffen v. Court of Appeals, First Appellate Dist., </em>124 Ohio St.3d 1471, 2010-Ohio-354, 921 N.E.2d 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">{\u00b6 15} This cause is now before the court for our consideration of the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">\n<em>Prohibition Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">{\u00b6 16} To be entitled to the requested writ of prohibition, Steffen must establish that (1) the court of appeals judges are about to exercise judicial power, (2) the exercise of that power is unauthorized by law, and (3) denying the writ will result in injury for which no other adequate remedy exists in the ordinary course of law. <em>State ex rel. Cordray v. Marshall, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 229, 2009-Ohio-4986, 915 N.E.2d 633, \u00b6 25. It is uncontroverted that the court of appeals judges have exercised and are continuing to exercise judicial power in the underlying criminal case by denying Steffen\u2019s motion to dismiss the state\u2019s appeal and by proceeding in the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-12\">{\u00b6 17} For the remaining requirements, \u201c[i]f a lower court patently and unambiguously lacks jurisdiction to proceed in a cause, prohibition * * * will issue to prevent any future unauthorized exercise of jurisdiction and to correct the results of prior jurisdictionally unauthorized actions.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Mayer v. Henson, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 276, 2002-Ohio-6323, 779 N.E.2d 223, \u00b6 12. The dispositive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>issue is thus whether the court of appeals judges patently and unambiguously lack jurisdiction over the state\u2019s pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">\n<em>Patent and Unambiguous Lack of Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">{\u00b6 18} Section 3(B)(2), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution establishes that courts of appeals \u201cshall have such jurisdiction as <em>may be provided by law </em>to review and affirm, modify, or reverse judgments or final orders of the courts of record inferior to the courts of appeals within the district.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We have interpreted this constitutional provision to mean that \u201cthe state has no absolute right of appeal in a criminal matter unless specifically granted such right by statute.\u201d <em>State v. Fisher </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 22, 24, 517 N.E.2d 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">{\u00b6 19} The state\u2019s right to appeal in criminal cases is governed by R.C. 2945.67(A), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-8\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cA prosecuting attorney * * * may appeal as a matter of right any decision of a trial court in a criminal case * * * which decision grants a motion to dismiss all or any part of an indictment, complaint, or information, a motion to suppress evidence, or a motion for the return of seized property or grants post conviction relief pursuant to sections 2953.21 to 2953.24 of the Revised Code, and may appeal by leave of the court to which the appeal is taken any other decision, except the final verdict, of the trial court in a criminal case * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">{\u00b6 21} As we recently observed, \u201c[w]hile R.C. 2505.03 generally provides that every final order or judgment may be reviewed on appeal, R.C. 2945.67(A) specifically governs appeals by the state in criminal and juvenile delinquency proceedings. It provides that the state may appeal as of right an order that (1) <em>grants a motion to dismiss all or any part of an indictment, </em>complaint, or information, (2) grants a motion to suppress evidence, (3) grants a motion for the return of seized property, and (4) grants postconviction relief. It further provides that with the exception of final verdicts, the state may appeal any other decision in a criminal or juvenile delinquency proceeding by leave of the appellate court.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>In re A.J.S., </em>120 Ohio St.3d 185, 2008-Ohio-5307, 897 N.E.2d 629, \u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">{\u00b6 22} The court of appeals judges ruled that the court has jurisdiction over the state\u2019s appeal because the appeal is a matter of right under R.C. 2945.67(A). The judges claim that the statute authorizes the state\u2019s appeal as a matter of right without requiring the state to request leave to appeal because the decision being appealed included the trial court\u2019s modification of Steffen\u2019s rape conviction to attempted rape, which the judges claim constitutes a dismissal of the indicted rape charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">{\u00b623} We need not determine whether the trial court\u2019s modification of Steffen\u2019s rape conviction to attempted rape constituted a dismissal in part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>indictment, however, because the state did not appeal from that decision. In fact, the state itself had requested the reduction of the rape conviction to attempted rape that the court ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">{\u00b6 24} Instead, as the plain language of the state\u2019s February 18, 2009 notice of appeal establishes, the state appealed from the common pleas court\u2019s decision to grant Steffen a new penalty-phase trial in his capital murder case. \u201cPursuant to R.C. 2505.02 and 2505.03(A), a trial court\u2019s order granting the defendant a new trial in a criminal case is a final appealable order which the state may appeal by leave of court.\u201d <em>State v. Matthews </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 375, 691 N.E.2d 1041, syllabus. In <em>Matthews, </em>we held that \u201cthe state may appeal from [an order granting a defendant a new trial in a criminal case] only by leave of the court to which the appeal is taken, pursuant to R.C. 2945.67(A).\u201d Id. at 378.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">{\u00b6 25} Notably, the primary case cited by the state in support of its claim that the trial court\u2019s decision to grant a new penalty-phase trial was appealable as a matter of right involved the state\u2019s appeal from the decisions claimed to be dismissals of the indictment or the functional equivalent thereof. See <em>State v. Craig, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 135, 2007-Ohio-5752, 876 N.E.2d 957, syllabus (state may appeal as a matter of right from dismissal of an indictment regardless of whether the dismissal is with or without prejudice). Similar cases are limited to the state\u2019s appeals from decisions that either dismiss an indictment or are the functional equivalent of a dismissal of an indictment. See <em>In re S.J., </em>106 Ohio St.3d 11, 2005-Ohio-3215, 829 N.E.2d 1207, \u00b6 13 (trial judge\u2019s sua sponte dismissal of murder charge constituted final, appealable order subject to state\u2019s appeal as a matter of right because the dismissal was equivalent to granting a motion to dismiss the indictment); <em>In re A.J.S., </em>120 Ohio St.3d 185, 2008-Ohio-5307, 897 N.E.2d 629, syllabus (state has appeal as a matter of right from an order denying a motion for mandatory bindover because it is the functional equivalent of a dismissal of an indictment).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">{\u00b6 26} This precedent is distinguishable from the case at bar, where the state is manifestly <em>not appealing from the dismissal of an indictment or its functional equivalent. </em>And we are forbidden to add a nonexistent provision to the plain language of R.C. 2945.67(A). See <em>State ex rel. Lorain v. Stewart, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 222, 2008-Ohio-4062, 893 N.E.2d 184, \u00b6 36 (court cannot add language to statute); <em>State v. Hughes </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 424, 427, 715 N.E.2d 540 (\u201cIn construing a statute, we may not add or delete words\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">{\u00b6 27} Therefore, the state could not appeal the decision of the common pleas court granting Steffen a new penalty-phase trial as a matter of right. It was required to timely seek leave to appeal. \u201cA motion for leave to appeal by the state in a criminal case shall be governed by the procedural requirements of App.R. 5 and the time requirements of App.R. 4(B).\u201d <em>State v. Wallace </em>(1975), 43 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>Ohio St.2d 1, 72 O.O.2d 1, 330 N.E.2d 697, syllabus. App.R. 5(C) provides, \u201cWhen leave is sought by the prosecution from the court of appeals to appeal a judgment or order of the trial court, a motion for leave to appeal shall be filed with the court of appeals within thirty days from the entry of the judgment and order sought to be appealed * * *. Concurrently with the filing of the motion, the movant shall file with the clerk of the trial court a notice of appeal in the form prescribed by App.R. 3 and file a copy of the notice of appeal in the court of appeals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">{\u00b6 28} The state filed' a motion for leave to appeal, but the motion was not filed within 30 days of the March 16 entry being appealed, and it was not filed concurrently with the state\u2019s notice of appeal. Because the state did not comply with the requirements of App.R. 5, the court of appeals patently and unambiguously lacked jurisdiction over the state\u2019s appeal. See generally <em>State v. Mitchell, </em>Lucas App. No. L-03-1270, 2004-Ohio-2460, 2004 WL 1088380, \u00b6 11-12; see also <em>State v. Tate, </em>179 Ohio App.3d 71, 2008-Ohio-5686, 900 N.E.2d 1018, \u00b6 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">{\u00b6 29} Moreover, even if the court were to consider the state\u2019s irrelevant argument regarding the common pleas court\u2019s modification of Steffen\u2019s rape conviction to attempted rape, the state would still not prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">{\u00b6 30} In construing R.C. 2945.67(A), \u201cour paramount concern is the legislative intent\u201d of its enactment. <em>State ex rel. Steele v. Morrissey, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 355, 2004-Ohio-4960, 815 N.E.2d 1107, \u00b6 21. To discern this intent, \u201c[w]e consider the statutory language in context, construing words and phrases in accordance with rules of grammar and common usage.\u201d <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Grace, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 471, 2009-Ohio-5934, 918 N.E.2d 135, \u00b6 25. \u201cDismiss\u201d means to \u201cterminate (an action or claim) without further hearing, esp. before the trial of the issues involved.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (9th Ed.2009) 537. The trial court did not grant a motion to dismiss the rape charge in the indictment. There was no motion to dismiss the charge or the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">{\u00b6 31} Nevertheless, the judges rely on our holding in <em>Craig, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 135, 2007-Ohio-5752, 876 N.E.2d 957, to claim that the trial court\u2019s modification of the jury verdict convicting Steffen of rape to reduce his conviction to attempted rape constituted a dismissal of the rape charge from the indictment, which authorized the state\u2019s appeal as a matter of right under R.C. 2945.67(A). In <em>In re S.J., </em>106 Ohio St.3d 11, 2005-Ohio-3215, 829 N.E.2d 1207, we held that a court\u2019s dismissal of a murder charge on its own motion was the equivalent of a \u201c \u2018decision granting] a motion to dismiss\u2019 \u201d under R.C. 2945.67(A) so as to permit the state\u2019s appeal as of right from the dismissal. Id. at \u00b6 13. In <em>Craig, </em>syllabus, and \u00b6 15-16, we relied on <em>S.J. </em>to hold that \u201c[p]ursuant to R.C. 2945.67(A), the state may appeal the dismissal of an indictment whether the dismissal is with or without prejudice.\u201d Finally, in <em>A.J.S., </em>120 Ohio St.3d 185, 2008-Ohio-5307, 897 N.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>629, \u00b6 33, we held that the state could appeal as a matter of right from a juvenile court\u2019s denial of a motion for a bindover of the case to the common pleas court to try the juvenile delinquent as an adult because it was the \u201cfunctional equivalent of the dismissal of an indictment\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cHere, however, the juvenile court did not dismiss any charge or indictment; it merely denied the motion to transfer. In doing so, however, it prevented the state from seeking a criminal indictment to try A.J.S. as an adult. Because a juvenile court order denying a motion for mandatory bindover terminates the state\u2019s ability to secure an indictment for the acts charged, its denial of a mandatory transfer is the functional equivalent of the dismissal of an indictment. Thus, the state properly appealed as of right.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">{\u00b6 33} <em>Craig, </em>which is cited by the judges, and <em>S.J. </em>do not support the state\u2019s claimed appeal as a matter of right in the underlying criminal case because the trial court did not dismiss the rape charge or indictment either sua sponte or on motion of a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">{\u00b6 34} Furthermore, the trial court\u2019s modification of the jury verdict to reduce Steffen\u2019s rape conviction to a conviction for attempted rape \u2014 following trial and after the introduction of newly discovered evidence \u2014 is not the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of a dismissal of the rape charge pursuant to <em>A.J.S. </em>Id. at \u00b6 33. A motion to dismiss an indictment tests the legal sufficiency of the indictment, regardless of the quality or quantity of the evidence that may be introduced by either the state or the defendant. See, e.g., <em>State v. Certain, </em>180 Ohio App.3d 457, 2009-Ohio-148, 905 N.E.2d 1259, \u00b6 4; <em>State v. Preztak, </em>181 Ohio App.3d 106, 2009-Ohio-621, 907 N.E.2d 1254, \u00b6 12. These motions are generally raised prior to trial. See Crim.R. 12(C)(2), requiring defenses and objections based on defects in the indictment to be raised before trial. By contrast, the trial court\u2019s modification of a jury verdict is normally based on evidence that is introduced at trial. See Crim.R. 33(A)(4); <em>State ex rel. Shearer v. Wertz </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 348, 350, 4 O.O.3d 483, 364 N.E.2d 36 (\u201cthe record relates the verdict modification to the evidence in the case before respondent, as required by Crim.R. 33(A)(4)\u201d). Here, the modification is even further removed from the pretrial process usually associated with motions to dismiss an indictment or charges therein because it is based on newly discovered evidence \u2014 DNA test results and another\u2019s confession clearing Steffen of the rape \u2014 long after the trial of this case had concluded. The trial court\u2019s modification of the jury verdict did not, as did the trial court\u2019s denial of the bindover in <em>A.J.S., </em>120 Ohio St.3d 185, 2008-Ohio-5307, 897 N.E.2d 629, at \u00b6 33, \u201cprevent! ] the state from seeking a criminal indictment\u201d against Steffen. In fact, the criminal indictment against Steffen had already been returned. Therefore, the trial court\u2019s action was manifestly neither a dismissal of the rape <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>charge in the indictment nor its functional equivalent so as to permit the state to prosecute an appeal as a matter of right from the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">{\u00b6 35} Therefore, because the state\u2019s appeal in Steffen\u2019s underlying criminal case did not constitute an appeal as a matter of right under R.C. 2945.67(A) and did not comply with the requirements of App.R. 5 so as to qualify as a proper appeal by leave of court, the court of appeals judges patently and unambiguously lack jurisdiction over the state\u2019s appeal and should have granted Steffen\u2019s motion to dismiss it. \u201cWhere jurisdiction is patently and unambiguously lacking, relators need not establish the lack of an adequate remedy at law because the availability of alternate remedies like appeal would be immaterial.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Sapp v. Franklin Cty. Court of Appeals, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 368, 2008-Ohio-2637, 889 N.E.2d 500, \u00b6 15. Steffen has established his entitlement to the requested writ of prohibition to prevent the court of appeals judges from proceeding to consider the state\u2019s pending appeal from the common pleas court\u2019s decision granting a new penalty-phase trial in the underlying criminal case. Thus, we grant a writ of prohibition to prevent the court of appeals judges from proceeding on the state\u2019s pending appeal and to compel them to dismiss the state\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Writ granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b534-8\">Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b534-9\">Lanzinger, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b534-10\">Brown, C.J., not participating.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b534-11\">Lanzinger, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Arh\">concurring in judgment only.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">{\u00b6 36} The court of appeals contends that it does not patently and unambiguously lack jurisdiction over the state\u2019s appeal because the state has a right to appeal the trial court\u2019s modification of the rape count to attempted rape pursuant to R.C. 2945.67(A). However, the state requested this change and would have no right to appeal the \u201cdismissal\u201d of the rape count under the invited-error doctrine. See <em>State v. Bey </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 487, 493-494, 709 N.E.2d 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-13\">{\u00b6 37} In any event, the state\u2019s appeal does not concern the amendment of the rape count, but rather the decision to grant a new trial as to the penalty phase of the proceedings. This court has previously held that a decision granting a new trial in a criminal case is a final appealable order that the state may appeal by leave of court. <em>State v. Matthews </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 375, 691 N.E.2d 1041, syllabus. Because the state did not seek leave to appeal, the court of appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>patently and unambiguously lacks jurisdiction to hear the state\u2019s appeal. I therefore concur in the judgment to grant the writ of prohibition.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b535-5\">Dennis C. Belli; and Timothy Young, State Public Defender, and Randall L.
