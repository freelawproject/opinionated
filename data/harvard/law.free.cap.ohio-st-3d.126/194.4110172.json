Scott Krichbaum, to hold a new sentencing hearing. Alicea claims that his 1999 sentencing entry was not a final, appealable order because it did not include any indication of the manner of his conviction as required by Crim.R. 32(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-14\">{\u00b6 2} Alicea\u2019s claim lacks merit for two reasons. First, the remedy for a failure to comply with Crim.R. 32(C) is a revised sentencing entry rather than a new hearing. <em>State ex rel. Culgan v. Medina Cty. Court of Common Pleas, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 535, 2008-Ohio-4609, 895 N.E.2d 805, \u00b6 8-10. Second, Alicea\u2019s sentencing entry fully complied with Crim.R. 32(C) and <em>State v. Baker, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 197, 2008-0hio-3330, 893 N.E.2d 163, syllabus. The entry specified that Alicea was found guilty of rape after a jury trial. Therefore, the sentencing entry constituted a final, appealable order, and Alicea is not entitled to a new sentencing entry. <em>State ex rel. Pruitt v. Cuyahoga Cty. Court of Common Pleas, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 402, 2010-Ohio-1808, 928 N.E.2d 722.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b317-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Clemente Alicea, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b317-8\">Paul J.
