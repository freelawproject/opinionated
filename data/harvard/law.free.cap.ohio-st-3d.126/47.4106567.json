Celebrezze, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 385, 2006-Ohio-1195, 843 N.E.2d 1202, \u00b6 12. \u201cIn the absence of a patent and unambiguous lack of jurisdiction, a court having general subject-matter jurisdiction can determine its own jurisdiction, and a party contesting that jurisdiction has an adequate remedy by appeal.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Plant v. Cosgrove, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 264, 2008-Ohio-3838, 893 N.E.2d 485, \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">{\u00b6 3} For the following reasons, the juvenile court judges and magistrate do not patently and unambiguously lack jurisdiction to decide child-custody matters in the underlying proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">{\u00b6 4} First, they have specific statutory jurisdiction to do so. See R.C. 2151.23(A)(2) (juvenile court has exclusive original jurisdiction \u201cto determine the custody of any child not a ward of another court of this state\u201d); R.C. 3109.042 (\u201cAn unmarried female who gives birth to a child is the sole residential parent and legal custodian of the child until a court of competent jurisdiction issues an order designating another person as the residential parent and legal custodian\u201d). Mosier is an unmarried female who gave birth to the child, and there is no allegation or evidence in the record that the child is a ward of another state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-12\">{\u00b6 5} Second, Mosier erroneously claims that R.C. 3109.12 divested the juvenile court of jurisdiction to determine her child\u2019s custody because she had not filed a proper complaint. That statutory provision relates to the procedure that a father of a child born to an unmarried woman must use when requesting reasonable parenting time rather than legal custody. See R.C. 3109.12(A) (\u201cIf a child is born to an unmarried woman and if the father of the child has acknowledged the child and that acknowledgement has become final * * * or has been determined in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>action under Chapter 3111. of the Revised Code to be the father of the child, the father may file a complaint requesting that the court of appropriate jurisdiction of the county in which the child resides grant him <em>reasonable parenting time rights </em>with the child * * *\u201d [emphasis added]).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b171-9\">Lydy &amp; Moan, Ltd., Daniel T. Ellis, and Frederick E. Kalmbach, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b171-10\">Julia R. Bates, Lucas County Prosecuting Attorney, and John A. Borell, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c \u2018Custody\u2019 refers to the right to ultimate legal and physical control over a child, while \u2018parenting time rights\u2019 grant a parent the power of temporary physical control for the purpose of visitation.\u201d <em>Williamson v. Cooke, </em>Franklin App. No. 09AP-222, 2009-Ohio-6842, 2009 WL 5062118, \u00b6 22, citing <em>Braatz v. Braatz </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 40, 44, 706 N.E.2d 1218 (\u201c Visitation\u2019 and \u2018custody\u2019 are related but distinct legal concepts. \u2018Custody\u2019 resides in the party or parties who have the right to ultimate legal and physical control of a child. Visitation\u2019 resides in a noncustodial party and encompasses that party\u2019s right to visit the child\u201d). Through his counterclaim and motion in the underlying juvenile court proceeding, the child\u2019s father had sought custody of the child, not increased parenting time or visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">{\u00b6 7} Therefore, Mosier\u2019s claim alleges, at best, an error in the court\u2019s exercise of its jurisdiction rather than a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. See <em>Jimison v. Wilson, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 342, 2005-Ohio-5143, 835 N.E.2d 34, \u00b6 11. Because the juvenile court judges and magistrate do not patently and unambiguously lack jurisdiction to determine child-custody matters in the underlying case, Mosier has an adequate remedy by appeal to raise her claims, and the court of appeals properly dismissed her action for extraordinary relief in prohibition and mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b171-8\">Brown, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
