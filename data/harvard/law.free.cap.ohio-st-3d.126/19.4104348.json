Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Commercial Fin. Servs., Inc., </em>Cuyahoga Cty. C.P. No. CV-502459, a case in which appellees, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Commercial Financial Services, Inc., Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., Linda Cain, Timothy Adkins, George Kolar, and Cindy Deleo, are defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-12\">{\u00b6 2} \u201c[W]hen a trial court unconditionally dismisses a case or a case has been voluntarily dismissed under Civ.R. 41(A)(1), the trial court patently and unambiguously lacks jurisdiction to proceed, and a writ of prohibition will issue to prevent the exercise of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Hummel v. Sadler, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 84, 2002-Ohio-3605, 771 N.E.2d 853, \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-13\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cCiv.R. 41(A) allows for a dismissal of <em>all claims </em>against particular defendants,\u201d not individual claims. (Emphasis added.) <em>Pattison v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., </em>120 Ohio St.3d 142, 2008-Ohio-5276, 897 N.E.2d 126, \u00b6 19-20. Notwithstanding the court of appeals\u2019 conclusion that its decision in a previous appeal<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> had left only an employment-discrimination claim against appellees pending, that case merely held that the plaintiffs remaining claims were subject to arbitration. Arbitration does not normally require dismissal of the claims referable to arbitration; it warrants only a stay of those claims pending arbitration. See R.C. 2711.02(B) (\u201cIf any action is brought upon any issue referable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>arbitration under an agreement in writing for arbitration, the court in which the action is pending, upon being satisfied that the issue involved in the action is referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for arbitration, shall on application of one of the parties stay the trial of the action until the arbitration of the issue has been had in accordance with the agreement, provided the applicant for the stay is not in default in proceeding with arbitration\u201d). There is no indication in the record that Judge Sutula dismissed the remaining claims. Because the purported notice of dismissal filed in this case specifically referred to dismissal of the employment-discrimination claim but made no reference to the other claims that have yet to be dismissed, it failed to dismiss \u201call claims\u201d for purposes of Civ.R. 41(A).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b142-8\">Ulmer &amp; Berne, L.L.P., Ronald H.

Hannan, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">{\u00b6 4} Therefore, because not all of plaintiffs case was dismissed when the plaintiff attempted to voluntarily dismiss his employment-discrimination claim against appellees, the court of appeals erred in holding that Judge Sutula patently and unambiguously lacked jurisdiction to proceed in the underlying case pursuant to Civ.R. 41(A)(1)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b142-7\">Brown, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b141-14\">.
