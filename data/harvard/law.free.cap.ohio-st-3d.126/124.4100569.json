Judge McCormick failed to include in the sentencing entry any term of postrelease control.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-13\">{\u00b6 3} Nine years later, in 2008, Carnail filed a motion in the common pleas court to correct the \u201cillegal sentence.\u201d Shortly thereafter, Judge McCormick denied the motion. The court of appeals dismissed Carnail\u2019s appeal based on res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-14\">{\u00b6 4} In June 2009, Carnail filed a complaint in the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County for a writ of mandamus to compel Judge McCormick<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to conduct a new sentencing hearing to add the proper requirements of postrelease control or, in the alternative, to issue a final, appealable order. Judge McCormick filed a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss Carnail\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and Carnail filed a memorandum in opposition. The court of appeals granted the judge\u2019s motion and dismissed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>Carnail\u2019s complaint. The court held that the claimed sentencing error could not be remedied by extraordinary writ and that Carnail had adequate remedies by appeal and postconviction relief to raise his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">{\u00b6 5} This cause is now before us upon Carnail\u2019s appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">{\u00b6 6} Carnail asserts that the court of appeals erred in dismissing his mandamus complaint. \u201cA court can dismiss a mandamus action under Civ.R. 12(B)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted if, after all factual allegations of the complaint are presumed true and all reasonable inferences are made in relator\u2019s favor, it appears beyond doubt that he can prove no set of facts entitling him to the requested writ of mandamus.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Russell v. Thornton, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 409, 2006-Ohio-5858, 856 N.E.2d 966, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">{\u00b6 7} To be entitled to the writ, Carnail must establish a clear legal right to the requested relief, a corresponding clear legal duty on the part of Judge McCormick to provide it, and the lack of an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. <em>State ex rel. Husted v. Brunner, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 288, 2009-Ohio-5327, 915 N.E.2d 1215, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">\n<em>Postrelease Control for Rape Convictions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">{\u00b6 8} Carnail\u2019s mandamus claim is predicated upon his contention that his sentence is void because it did not include postrelease control for his rape convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">{\u00b6 9} Judge McCormick initially claims on appeal, as he did in his motion to dismiss Carnail\u2019s complaint in the proceedings below, that \u201cbecause [Carnail] was sentenced to a mandatory life sentence for rape, which is an indefinite sentence, the trial court was not required to advise [him] of post-release control.\u201d Although the court of appeals did not rely on this argument to dismiss Carnail\u2019s mandamus complaint, \u201cReviewing courts are not authorized to reverse a correct judgment on the basis that some or all of the lower court\u2019s reasons are erroneous.\u201d <em>State ex rel. McGrath v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth., </em>100 Ohio St.3d 72, 2003-Ohio-5062, 796 N.E.2d 526, \u00b6 8. Therefore, we first determine whether postrelease control was required for Carnail\u2019s rape convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-12\">{\u00b6 10} R.C. 2967.28 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-13\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c(B) Each sentence to a prison term for a felony of the first degree, for a felony of the second degree, for a felony sex offense, or for a felony of the third degree that is not a felony sex offense and in the commission of which the offender caused or threatened to cause physical harm to a person shall include a requirement that the offender be subject to a period of post-release control imposed by the parole board after the offender\u2019s release from imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>* * * Unless reduced by the parole board pursuant to division (D) of this section when authorized under that division, a period of post-release control required by this division for an offender shall be of one of the following periods:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-5\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c(1) For a felony of the first degree or for a felony sex offense, five years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">{\u00b6 13} In construing this statute, \u201cour paramount concern is the legislative intent\u201d in enacting it. <em>State ex rel. Steele v. Morrissey, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 355, 2004-Ohio-4960, 815 N.E.2d 1107, \u00b6 21. To discern this intent, we must \u201cread words and phrases in context according to the rules of grammar and common usage.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Lee v. Karnes, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 559, 2004-Ohio-5718, 817 N.E.2d 76, \u00b6 23.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">{\u00b6 14} After applying the rules of grammar and common usage to R.C. 2967.28(B)(1), we find that the statute\u2019s plain, unambiguous language expressly requires the inclusion of a mandatory postrelease-control term of five years for each prison sentence for felonies of the first degree and felony sex offenses. Carnail was convicted of rape in violation of R.C. 2907.02, which is both a felony of the first degree and a felony sex offense. R.C. 2907.02(B) and 2967.28(A)(3). Therefore, R.C. 2967.28(B) required that a five-year term of postrelease control be included in his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">{\u00b6 15} In arguing against this result, Judge McCormick cites R.C. 2967.28(F)(4), our opinion in <em>State v. Clark, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 239, 2008-Ohio-3748, 893 N.E.2d 462, and two Eighth District Court of Appeals cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">{\u00b6 16} R.C. 2967.28(F)(4) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-10\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cAny period of post-release control shall commence upon an offender\u2019s actual release from prison. <em>If an offender is serving an indefinite prison term or a life sentence in addition to a stated prison term, </em>the offender shall serve the period of post-release control in the following manner:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-11\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c(a) If a period of post-release control is imposed upon the offender and if the offender also is subject to a period of parole under a life sentence or an indefinite sentence, and if the period of post-release control ends prior to the period of parole, the offender shall be supervised on parole. The offender shall receive credit for post-release control supervision during the period of parole. The offender is not eligible for final release under section 2967.16 of the Revised Code until the post-release control period otherwise would have ended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-12\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c(b) If a period of post-release control is imposed upon the offender and if the offender also is subject to a period of parole under an indefinite sentence, and if the period of parole ends prior to the period of post-release control, the offender shall be supervised on post-release control. The requirements of parole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>supervision shall be satisfied during the post-release control period.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-4\">{\u00b6 20} R.C. 2967.28(F) is inapplicable to Carnail because it applies only to cases in which an indefinite prison term or life sentence is imposed <em>in addition to </em>a stated prison term. Carnail did not receive a stated prison term in addition to his concurrent life sentences for his rape convictions. Furthermore, under R.C. 2967.28(F), the presence of an indefinite and a definite sentence does not eliminate the postrelease-control requirement; it merely provides a procedural mechanism in which either supervision on parole or postrelease control is required to satisfy both sentences. Although it could be implied from this section that postrelease control is unnecessary for indefinite or life sentences, there is no specific language in either this or other provisions that modifies the express language in R.C. 2967.28(B)(1) requiring postrelease control. That is, R.C. 2967.28(B)(1) is not expressly limited to definite sentences; instead, it applies broadly to \u201c[e]ach sentence to a prison term for a felony of the first degree * * * [or] for a felony sex offense.\u201d Because R.C. 2967.28(B)(1) is phrased in broad, sweeping language, we must accord it broad, sweeping application. See <em>State ex rel. Mager v. State Teachers Retirement Sys. of Ohio, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 195, 2009-Ohio-4908, 915 N.E.2d 320, \u00b6 16.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">{\u00b6 21} Our decision in <em>Clark, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 239, 2008-Ohio-3748, 893 N.E.2d 462, is also inapposite. In that case, we merely held that a trial court was not required to discuss postrelease control or parole in a colloquy with a defendant seeking to plead guilty to aggravated murder, because postrelease control was not required for persons convicted of unclassified felonies like aggravated murder. Id. at \u00b6 36 (\u201can individual sentenced for aggravated murder such as [the defendant] is not subject to postrelease control, because that crime is an unclassified felony to which the postrelease-control statute does not apply\u201d). By contrast, the plain language of R.C. 2967.28(B)(1) requires that persons convicted of rape, which is both a felony of the first degree and a felony sex offense, be subjected to postrelease control for five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">{\u00b6 22} Insofar as Judge McCormick also cites decisions from one court of appeals that hold to the contrary, they are inapposite because they fail to apply the manifest language of R.C. 2967.28. See <em>State v. Jordan, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 91413, 2009-Ohio-4037, 2009 WL 2462702, \u00b6 38 (\u201cWhere a rape count requires an indefinite sentence that carries a life parole tail, postrelease control is not necessary\u201d); <em>State v. Dresser, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 92105, 2009-Ohio-2888, 2009 WL 1710757, \u00b6 3 (\u201cPostrelease control was not necessary for the rape counts because they are indefinite sentences that carry a life parole tail\u201d); see also <em>State v. Vlahopoulos, </em>154 Ohio App.3d 450, 2003-Ohio-5070, 797 N.E.2d 580, \u00b6 1, defining \u201clife tails\u201d as \u201cindeterminate sentences with a maximum term of life in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>prison.\u201d These cases erroneously rely on R.C. 2967.28(F)(4), which, as previously noted, is inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">{\u00b6 23} In addition, these Eighth Appellate District cases emanate from that appellate court\u2019s two-to-one decision in <em>State v. Linen </em>(Dec. 15, 2000), Cuyahoga App. Nos. 74070 and 74071, 2000 WL 1876409, in which the majority of the appellate panel held that postrelease control was inapplicable to defendants sentenced under R.C. Chapter 2971, when \u201cthere is no completion of a stated prison term; the judge, not the parole board, may impose conditional release, and the judge, not the parole board, may impose sanctions.\u201d Id. at *3. R.C. Chapter 2971 adopts a modifiable life term for certain sex offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">{\u00b6 24} Upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the serving of the minimum sentence, the parole board\u2019s termination of its control over the defendant\u2019s sentence, and the trial court\u2019s determination by clear and convincing evidence that the offender is unlikely to commit a sexually violent offense in the future, the court can terminate the indefinite sentence. R.C. 2971.03(C)(3), 2971.04, and 2971.05. Therefore, if the trial court ultimately terminates Carnail\u2019s sentence, he will have served his prison term, which would mean that subjecting him to the additional sanction of postrelease control would not be useless, as the majority in <em>Linen </em>suggests. See also <em>Clark, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 239, 2008-Ohio-3748, 893 N.E.2d 462, \u00b6 35, 36 (\u201cPostrelease control is a period of supervision that occurs after a prisoner has served his or her prison sentence and is released from incarceration * * *. When a person is paroled, he or she is released from confinement before the end of his or her sentence and remains in the custody of the state until the sentence expires or the Adult Parole Authority grants final release\u201d). Nothing in R.C. Chapter 2971 precludes a defendant convicted of rape from being subject both to the parole provisions of that chapter and, upon potential release, to the postrelease-control provisions of R.C. 2967.28.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">{\u00b6 25} As the dissenting opinion in <em>Linen </em>notes, the majority\u2019s position in that case is untenable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-8\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cPursuant to the express terms of R.C. 2967.28(B)(1), his sentence for gross sexual imposition was required to include a period of post-release control. * * * The majority simply sweeps these requirements away by asserting that R.C. 2929.19 and 2967.28 are inapplicable and that Linen was sentenced pursuant to R.C. [Chapter] 2971. Such an approach ignores the obvious and bisects relevant sentencing provisions from a complete sentencing quilt into a patchwork of unrelated cloth; treating the sentencing structure of the Revised Code as if it were a smorgasbord where a trial court is at liberty to pick and choose among any sentencing division which is expressly applicable, and render those provisions which are problematic to be \u2018inapplicable.\u2019 Simply put, the trial court, in addition to the strictures contained within R.C. [Chapter] 2971, was statutorily bound to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>include post-release controls in Linen\u2019s sentence on the felony sex offenses * * <em>Linen, </em>Cuyahoga App. Nos. 74070 and 74071, 2000 WL 1876409, at *3 (Sweeney, J., dissenting).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">{\u00b6 27} Similarly, the Sixth District Court of Appeals has expressly held that rape convictions require postrelease control as part of the sentence, that postre-lease control applies to indefinite or life sentences, and that R.C. 2967.28(F) does not alter this requirement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cRape is a felony of the first degree. As a classified felony, offenders convicted of rape must be given postrelease control * * *. R.C. 2967.28(B)(1) requires a period of five years of postrelease control for a felony of the first degree or a felony sex offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-7\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cHernandez points, however, to R.C. 2967.28(F) in support of his proposition that because he \u2018faced no charges with a definite prison sentence\u2019 postrelease control could not be imposed. This is not the case. That section specifically provides for the manner in which an offender serves postrelease control in addition to parole when the offender is serving \u2018an indefinite prison term or a life sentence in addition to a stated prison term.\u2019 (Emphasis added.) Because rape is a felony of the first degree, postrelease control was required to be imposed pursuant to R.C. 2967.28(B). Simply because Hernandez faced a possible indefinite term does not mean that only parole applies.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>State v. Hernandez, </em>Williams App. No. WM-08-015, 2009-Ohio-3915, 2009 WL 2415300, \u00b6 42-43.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">{\u00b6 30} In this regard, the Sixth District\u2019s interpretation of the pertinent provisions is more consistent with their plain language than the Eighth District\u2019s construction. This plain language requires no additional statutory interpretation. See <em>Symmes Twp. Bd. of Trustees v. Smyth </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 549, 553, 721 N.E.2d 1057 (\u201cWhen the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous and conveys a clear and definite meaning, there is no need for this court to apply the rules of statutory interpretation\u201d). And insofar as general policy considerations might support subjecting a defendant only to the parole provisions of R.C. Chapter 2971 without the additional application of the postrelease-control provisions of R.C. 2967.28, the General Assembly is the final arbiter of public policy. It could have easily and clearly excluded persons subject to R.C. Chapter 2971 from the ambit of R.C. 2967.28, but it did not do so. <em>State ex rel. VanCleave v. School Emps. Retirement Sys., </em>120 Ohio St.3d 261, 2008-Ohio-5377, 898 N.E.2d 33, \u00b6 27 (\u201cthe General Assembly is the final arbiter of public policy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">{\u00b6 31} Therefore, for the foregoing reasons, Carnail\u2019s sentence on his conviction for two rape charges was required to include a five-year term of postrelease control.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>\n<em>Mandamus to Compel Judge to Issue Final, Appealable Order</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">{\u00b6 32} Carnail claims that because his sentencing entry does not contain the mandatory term of postrelease control, it is void and he is entitled to a writ of mandamus to compel Judge McCormick to issue a sentencing entry that constitutes a final, appealable order. Although procedendo is the more appropriate remedy, \u201cmandamus will lie when a trial court has refused to render, or unduly delayed rendering, a judgment.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Reynolds v. Basinger, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 303, 2003-Ohio-3631, 791 N.E.2d 459, \u00b6 5.

Court of Common Pleas, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 535, 2008-Ohio-4609, 895 N.E.2d 805, which is the primary authority relied upon by Carnail, after a common pleas court judge had denied a motion for resentencing to issue a judgment that complied with Crim.R. 32(C), we followed the foregoing precedent by reversing a judgment of a court of appeals and granting writs of mandamus and procedendo to compel the judge and the common pleas court to issue a sentencing entry that complied with Crim.R. 32(C) and constituted a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">(\u00b6 35} Judge McCormick\u2019s 1999 sentencing entry for Carnail failed to include the statutorily required five-year term of postrelease control. R.C. 2967.28(B)(1). \u201cIn cases in which a defendant is convicted of, or pleads guilty to, an offense for which postrelease control is required but not properly included in the sentence, the sentence is void * * <em>State v.

The 1999 sentencing entry was not a final, appealable order, because it was void for failing to include the statutorily required mandatory term of postrelease control.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">{\u00b6 37} Consistent with our holding in <em>Culgan, </em>once Judge McCormick denied Carnail\u2019s motion to correct the 1999 sentence, Carnail was entitled to the requested extraordinary relief in mandamus to compel the judge to issue a new sentencing entry to comply with R.C. 2967.28(B)(1) to obtain a final, appealable order. Under this precedent, Carnail was not relegated to appealing the judge\u2019s order denying his motion to correct the sentence. See <em>Culgan, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 535, 2008-Ohio-4609, 895 N.E.2d 805, \u00b6 8, and cases cited therein. Similarly, in <em>State v. Clutter, </em>Crawford App. No. 3-08-27, 2008-Ohio-6576, 2008 WL 5205682, the Third District Court of Appeals dismissed an appeal from a trial court\u2019s denial of a defendant\u2019s motion for resentencing and held that under <em>Culgan, </em>the appropriate remedy was an action in mandamus or procedendo. Id. at \u00b6 13-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">{\u00b6 38} Consequently, the court of appeals erred in dismissing Carnail\u2019s mandamus action.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">{\u00b6 39} Therefore, in accordance with precedent, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals dismissing Carnail\u2019s mandamus action and grant a writ of mandamus to compel Judge McCormick to issue a sentencing entry that complies with the postrelease-control provisions of R.C. 2967.28.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">Judgment reversed and writ granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b253-11\">Pfeifer, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"ANk\">Lundberg Stratton and Lanzinger, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<judges id=\"ARA\">Brown, C.J., not participating.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b246-15\">.

In holding that Carnail is subject to postrelease control, however, the majority fails to give proper weight to the fact that certain forms of rape convictions, such as Carnail\u2019s, are unique first-degree felonies because they require indefinite life sentences, in which parole is the method of supervision after a prison release.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">{\u00b6 42} Carnail\u2019s prison term may be terminated or modified only by parole in accordance with R.C. 2971.03, 2971.04, and 2971.05. As the majority notes, a prisoner who is paroled remains in the custody of the state until the sentence expires or the Adult Parole Authority grants final release. <em>State v. Clark, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 239, 2008-Ohio-3748, 893 N.E.2d 462, \u00b6 36. If Carnail is released from prison, the terms of his release will be determined by the Adult Parole Authority, which will employ the more specific parole procedures outlined in R.C. Chapter 2971 rather than the general postrelease control procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">{If 43} I agree with the Eighth District\u2019s reading of R.C. 2967.28(F)(4) in <em>State v. Jordan, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 91413, 2009-Ohio-4037, 2009 WL 2462702, and <em>State v. Dresser, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 92105, 2009-Ohio-2888, 2009 WL 1710757. R.C. 2967.28(F)(4) establishes a process by which supervision on parole will satisfy the postrelease control requirement when an offender is serving a life sentence in addition to a stated prison term. The statute clearly delineates that parole and postrelease control are distinct concepts that work together to allow supervision of an offender who is released from prison. R.C. 2967.28(F)(4) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">{\u00b6 44} \u201c(a) If a period of post-release control is imposed upon the offender and if the offender also is subject to a period of parole under a life sentence or an indefinite sentence, and if the period of post-release control ends prior to the period of parole, the offender shall be supervised on parole. The offender shall receive credit for post-release control supervision during the period of parole. The offender is not eligible for final release under section 2967.16 of the Revised Code until the post-release control period otherwise would have ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">{\u00b6 45} \u201c(b) If a period of post-release control is imposed upon the offender and if the offender also is subject to a period of parole under an indefinite sentence, and if the period of parole ends prior to the period of post-release control, the offender shall be supervised on post-release control. The requirements of parole supervision shall be satisfied during the post-release control period.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b255-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>E\u2019Yen Carnail, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b255-9\">William D. Mason, Cuyahoga County Prosecuting Attorney, and James E. Moss, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">{\u00b6 46} Carnail was sentenced to two concurrent life terms for rape, with parole eligibility after ten years. These are indefinite sentences, not sentences with a stated term. Therefore, a trial court may ultimately terminate Carnail\u2019s prison term pursuant to R.C. 2971.03(C)(3), 2971.04, and 2971.05. Carnail\u2019s supervision on parole will satisfy the General Assembly\u2019s monitoring requirement for indefinite sentences, as R.C. 2967.28(F)(4) shows. Nevertheless, the majority holds that Carnail must also be notified of postrelease control because he did not receive a definite term in addition to his indefinite term. The majority does indicate that had Carnail been sentenced to both, the court would not have been required to advise him of postrelease control. However, in either event an offender serving an indefinite prison term is subject to the parole process. Because there is no valid reason to distinguish between offenders serving an indefinite sentence on the basis of whether they are serving an additional definite sentence, I would hold that postrelease control is not necessary for indefinite life sentences that arise from rape convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">{\u00b6 47} Instead, after awarding R.C. 2967.28(B)(1) a \u201cbroad, sweeping application,\u201d this court once again holds that a prisoner has been serving a void sentence, with all the illogie that entails.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">{\u00b6 48} Because I would hold that Carnail was not subject to mandatory postrelease control, I dissent from the majority\u2019s opinion and would deny the writ of mandamus.</p>\n<judges id=\"b255-7\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
