For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>{\u00b6 2} Ahmad argues that the court of appeals erred in denying the writ because it \u201cappears as though the court of appeals agreed the bond was excessive, but felt bound by the trial court\u2019s order because they could not find an abuse of discretion.\u201d We have previously recognized the \u201canomaly in original actions which are filed seeking habeas corpus on the grounds of excessive bail because the effect of such cases is an appeal from a decision of the trial court; yet, such cases are also considered as original actions so as to permit hearings and findings of fact.\u201d <em>In re DeFronzo </em>(1977), 49 Ohio St.2d 271, 273, 3 O.O.3d 408, 361 N.E.2d 448. The court of appeals acknowledged the hybrid qualities of the proceeding by conducting a de novo hearing while also considering the evidence submitted to the court of common pleas:</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cUpon review of the pleadings and hearing in the present matter, including the evidence presented at said hearing, this Court finds that Ahmad has failed to demonstrate that the $3,000,000 cash/surety bond imposed by the common pleas court is excessive. Although this Court may have set bail at a lower amount, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in setting bail in the amount of $3,000,000 cash/surety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">{\u00b6 4} The court did not err in its holding. Although the court of appeals opined that it may have set a lower amount for the bail, the court also specifically held that based on its de novo review of the habeas corpus claim, Ahmad failed to demonstrate that the pretrial bail is excessive. See <em>Chari v. Vore </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 323, 326, 744 N.E.2d 763 (\u201cthe burden of proof in a case alleging excessive bail is, as in other habeas corpus cases, on the petitioner\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">{\u00b6 5} Nor did the court of appeals abuse its discretion. Under Crim.R. 46(C), \u201c[i]n determining the types, amounts, and conditions of bail, the court shall consider all relevant information, including but not limited to:</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c(1) The nature and circumstances of the crime charged, and specifically whether the defendant used or had access to a weapon;</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c(2) The weight of the evidence against the defendant;</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c(3) The confirmation of the defendant\u2019s identity;</p>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c(4) The defendant\u2019s family ties, employment, financial resources, character, mental condition, length of residence in the community, jurisdiction of residence, record of convictions, record of appearance at court proceedings or of flight to avoid prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-13\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c(5) Whether the defendant is on probation, a community control sanction, parole, post-release control, bail, or under a court protection order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AOK\">{\u00b6 11} The prosecuting attorney had recommended a $10,000,000 bond and, in his recommendation, had summarized certain facts, including the serious nature and circumstances of the charge of conspiracy to commit murder that Ahmad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>faces, the substantial evidence against him, and the manifest confirmation of his identity as the perpetrator of the crime charged:</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b386-14\">Rion, Rion &amp; Rion, L.P.A., Inc., and John H. Rion, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cDefendant personally sought to hire a hit-man to kill his ex-wife; evidence of his criminal involvement includes, but is not limited to, arranging and attending multiple meetings to hire a hit-man to kill his ex-wife, obtaining money to pay a hit-man to kill his ex-wife, disbursing money as a down payment to a hit-man to kill his ex-wife, providing photographs and directions to assist the hit-man in locating his ex-wife for the purpose of killing her.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cDefendant is recorded on multiple audio recordings making arrangements to hire a hit-man to kill his ex-wife.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">{\u00b6 14} Other evidence, both testimonial and documentary, submitted in the proceedings below confirmed the prosecutor\u2019s summary.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">{\u00b6 15} The prosecutor also indicated that because of \u201c[Ahmad\u2019s] employment as a physician, [he] has access to large sums of money; furthermore, [his] family members are also physicians.\u201d Ahmad\u2019s current wife requested in a letter to the common pleas court judge that the $3,000,000 bond not be lowered because that amount was \u201cnot enough for his family\u2019s circumstances\u201d and his brother had the money to bail him out. Ahmad never credibly rebutted the contention that he could afford to pay the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">{\u00b6 16} Moreover, Ahmad is under two domestic-violence protection orders\u2014 one issued on behalf of his ex-wife and one issued on behalf of his current wife. Ahmad\u2019s current wife further stated that she feared that if the amount of bail were reduced, Ahmad would \u2014 as he had previously threatened \u2014 kill her and her youngest son.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">{\u00b6 17} Under these circumstances, the court of appeals did not abuse its discretion in determining that the $3,000,000 bail was not excessive. Ahmad is charged with a serious crime and faces a potentially lengthy sentence if convicted based on the substantial evidence against him. Thus, \u201c \u2018the incentive to abscond is greater and the amount must be such as to discourage the accused from absconding.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Nields </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 6, 18, 752 N.E.2d 859, quoting <em>Bland v. Holden </em>(1970), 21 Ohio St.2d 238, 239, 50 O.O.2d 477, 257 N.E.2d 397.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">{\u00b6 18} Therefore, we affirm the judgment denying the writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b386-13\">Brown, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lan-zinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"b387-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Mathias H.
