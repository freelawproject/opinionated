Bates, Lucas County Prosecuting Attorney, and Evy M. Jarrett, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>As for Galloway\u2019s objection to his reclassification as a Tier III sex offender under S.B. 10, Galloway failed to establish that Judge Cook abused her discretion by staying her ruling on his motion for an evidentiary hearing pending this court\u2019s resolution of comparable issues in the discretionary appeal in <em>State v. Bodyke, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 266, 2010-Ohio-2424, 933 N.E.2d 753.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>State ex rel. Charvat v. Frye, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 76, 2007-Ohio-2882, 868 N.E.2d 270, \u00b6 16, quoting <em>State ex rel. Verhovec v. Mascio </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 334, 336, 691 N.E.2d 282 (\u201c \u2018The determination of whether to issue a stay of proceedings generally rests within the court\u2019s discretion and will not be disturbed absent a showing of an abuse of discretion\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">{\u00b6 3} As for Galloway\u2019s remaining claim that he is also entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his motions to dismiss his criminal convictions based on his actual innocence and the court\u2019s lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, \u201ccourts are not required to hold a hearing in every postconviction case.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Madsen v. Foley Jones, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 178, 2005-Ohio-4381, 833 N.E.2d 291, \u00b6 10. And because Judge Cook has now denied Galloway\u2019s motions for an evidentiary hearing on his motions to dismiss, Galloway has an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law by appeal to challenge these rulings. <em>State ex rel. Hach v. Summit Cty. Court of Common Pleas, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 75, 2004-Ohio-1800, 806 N.E.2d 554, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">{\u00b6 4} Therefore, the court of appeals correctly denied the writ of mandamus. Even if it were the case that the court\u2019s rationale was incorrect in part, \u201c[w]e will not reverse a correct judgment simply because some or all of a lower court\u2019s reasons are erroneous.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Swain v. Bartleson, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 125, 2009-Ohio-4690, 914 N.E.2d 403, \u00b6 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b455-8\">Brown, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b455-11\">. We decided <em>Bodyke </em>on June 3, 2010, while this appeal was pending.
