At issue is its request for reimbursement from the state surplus fund for compensation and medical benefits paid to or on behalf of Kimberly Owings from April 1, 2004, through June 30, 2007. Respondent, Marsha Ryan, the administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>tor of the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation, denied that request, and Extendi-care has responded with this original action in mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">{\u00b6 2} Owings\u2019s 2002 workers\u2019 compensation claim was originally allowed for \u201csprain right shoulder; right rotator cuff syndrome; right shoulder bicipital tendonitis.\u201d Extendicare began paying temporary total disability compensation shortly after the claim was allowed, but moved to terminate that compensation in August 2003, claiming that Owings had reached maximum medical improvement (\u201cMMI\u201d). The Industrial Commission of Ohio found that Owings had not attained MMI and denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">{\u00b6 3} In February 2004, Extendicare filed another motion to terminate temporary total disability compensation, again alleging that Owings had reached MMI. Shortly thereafter, Owings asked the commission to additionally allow three conditions: \u201cimpingement of the right shoulder, fraying of the right labrum, and aggravation of pre-existing arthritis right shoulder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">{\u00b6 4} On April 1, 2004, a district hearing officer granted Owings\u2019s motion and denied Extendicare\u2019s. On July 20, 2004, a staff hearing officer affirmed and, in continuing temporary total disability compensation, found that \u201c[t]he injured worker has not reached [MMI] because of the newly allowed conditions in this order and cannot physically return to her former position of employment.\u201d Further appeal was refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">{\u00b6 5} Extendicare filed its notice of appeal to the Franklin County Common Pleas Court on October 7, 2004. On November 5, 2004, Owings filed her required R.C. 4123.512(D) complaint, alleging a right to participate in the workers\u2019 compensation system for the three contested conditions. She dismissed that complaint on October 12, 2005. She refiled her complaint on September 25, 2006, but dismissed it again on October 1, 2007. This second voluntary dismissal prompted Extendicare\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law. The court granted Extendicare\u2019s motion and on May 22, 2008, issued a judgment entry that specifically denied Owings\u2019s right to participate for the three disputed conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">{\u00b6 6} During the nearly four years of litigation, Extendicare, pursuant to R.C. 4123.512(H), continued to pay temporary total disability compensation and medical expenses as ordered by the commission or bureau. During this litigation, Extendicare also, on July 1, 2007, exercised its statutory right under that section to opt out of the surplus-fund reimbursement program. After the litigation ended in Extendicare\u2019s favor, it sought surplus-fund reimbursement from April 1, 2004 (the date of the order by the district hearing officer allowing additional conditions and continuing temporary total disability compensation), to June 30, 2007 (Extendicare\u2019s last day in the reimbursement program).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>{\u00b6 7} The bureau\u2019s self-insured department denied all reimbursement because Extendicare had opted out of the reimbursement program. The self-insured review panel, on appeal, affirmed that reasoning and added:</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c[T]he judgment entry establishes that Ms. Owings\u2019 claim is disallowed for the three additional allowances that were disputed in this claim. However, the claim remains allowed for a number of other conditions * * *. Moreover, [temporary total disability compensation] was being paid for these conditions at the time the disputed conditions were first added to the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c * * *[T]he employer has not established that the reimbursement request relates solely to the disallowed conditions, and not to the other conditions that remain allowed in the claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">{\u00b6 10} This order was affirmed by the administrator\u2019s designee, and Extendi-care has now filed a complaint in mandamus in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">{\u00b6 11} For obvious reasons, an administrative order that an employer pay compensation or medical expenses is not stayed by the employer\u2019s challenge to that order. R.C. 4123.512(H). An employer that ultimately prevails in a \u201cfinal administrative or judicial action\u201d that \u201cdetermined that payments of compensation or benefits, or both, made to or on behalf of a claimant should not have been made\u201d may, however, be entitled to reimbursement for those payments. Id. For a self-insured employer such as Extendicare, reimbursement is generally a dollar-for-dollar recoupment from the workers\u2019 compensation surplus fund. <em>State ex rel. Sysco Food Servs.of Cleveland, Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 612, 734 N.E.2d 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">{\u00b6 12} The surplus fund was created pursuant to R.C. 4123.34(B) to, among other things, help maintain the solvency of the larger state insurance fund. Self-insured employers are required to contribute to the surplus fund. R.C. 4123.34(B) and 4123.35(J) and Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-32. For many years, a self-insured employer\u2019s mandatory contribution was directed several ways, including a portion for disallowed-claim-or-condition reimbursement. Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-32(D), (E), and (F). In 2006, R.C. 4123.512(H) was amended to permit self-insured employers to opt out of this reimbursement program: \u201cOn and after the effective date of the employer\u2019s election, * * * the employer shall receive no money or credits from the surplus fund on account of those payments and shall not be required to pay any amounts into the surplus fund on account of this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">{\u00b6 13} Extendicare withdrew from the program effective July 1, 2007. Exten-dicare acknowledges that it cannot be reimbursed for any payments that it made on Owings\u2019s claim after it opted out. It asserts, however, that it has a right to recover compensation and benefits paid before that time, while it was still contributing to the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>{\u00b6 14} The bureau disagrees. It concedes that the common pleas judgment entry constitutes a final judicial determination that compensation and benefits related to the three disputed conditions should not have been made. The bureau, however, stresses that the judgment entry was issued, and Extendicare\u2019s application for reimbursement was filed after Extendicare had opted out. The bureau maintains that regardless of the dates of Extendicare\u2019s payments to and on behalf of Owings, a self-insured employer can receive no money from the surplus fund after it has opted out. It alternatively proposes that the temporary total disability compensation that Extendicare paid to Owings during the common pleas litigation was not related to the three disallowed conditions, but was instead related to the claim\u2019s originally allowed conditions, which were unaffected by the common pleas court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">{\u00b6 15} We have been asked to resolve two issues: (1) Does Extendicare\u2019s opt-out preclude all reimbursement? and (2) If not, what portion of Extendicare\u2019s expenditures are recoupable?</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">{\u00b6 16} Extendicare relies heavily on <em>State ex rel. First Natl. Supermarkets, Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 673, 660 N.E.2d 1205. At issue were the handicap reimbursement provisions of R.C. 4123.343. The handicap reimbursement program encourages the hiring of employees with disabilities by reimbursing employers for all or part of certain types of compensation if the worker is later injured on the job. This program, like the reimbursement program currently at issue, was partially funded by mandatory contributions from self-insured employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">{\u00b6 17} Self-insured First National Supermarkets, Inc., hired a disabled person who was later industrially injured. First National applied for handicap reimbursement and was granted a 70 percent reimbursement. Three years later, the statute was amended to permit, as here, a self-insured employer to opt out of the program. First National remained in the program for the next three and a half years, before opting out as of January 1,1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">{\u00b6 18} First National later sought reimbursement for temporary total disability compensation paid from March 31, 1989, through December 7, 1990. The commission denied its application, and First National commenced a mandamus action in the court of appeals. That court held that First National could not be reimbursed for temporary total disability compensation paid after it opted out but that it could recover compensation paid before the opt-out:</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cWe acknowledge that the commission informed self-insured employers who opted out that the employers needed to file applications for reimbursement prior to the opt-out date or lose the right to reimbursement. However, we are unwilling to make a company\u2019s right to reimbursement contingent solely on the date the paperwork is received by the commission.\u201d <em>State ex rel. First Natl. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number><em>Supermarkets, Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(May 19, 1994), 10th Dist. No. 93APD08-1203, 1994 WL 198795.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">{\u00b6 20} We affirmed that judgment, stressing that First National was \u201cseeking] reimbursement for outlays made <em>before </em>opt-out \u2014 when the employer was still actively participating in the handicap reimbursement program.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>First Natl., </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 674, 660 N.E.2d 1205.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">{\u00b6 21} Extendicare asserts that <em>First Natl, </em>is directly on point. The bureau tries to distinguish the case by alleging that because First National was granted handicap reimbursement before opting out, it had a vested right to reimbursement before the opt-out. The bureau proposes that Extendicare\u2019s right to reimbursement did not vest until the common pleas court denied the additional conditions, which happened after the opt-out.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">{\u00b6 22} The bureau reads too much into <em>First Natl. </em>The opinion said nothing about vested rights. It instead linked First National\u2019s eligibility for reimbursement solely to whether First National was contributing to the fund over the period for which reimbursement was sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">{\u00b6 23} The bureau\u2019s position is problematic from a practical standpoint as well. The reason that the judgment entry did not issue before Extendicare opted out is that Owings prolonged the litigation \u2014 and with it her receipt of temporary total disability compensation and medical-bill payments \u2014 by twice filing and twice dismissing her complaint. Extendicare appealed the additional allowance to the common pleas court on October 7, 2004 \u2014 nearly three years before its eventual opt-out. Owings, as required by R.C. 4123.512(D), filed her complaint on November 5, 2004, but then dismissed it on October 12, 2005. She refiled the complaint on September 25, 2006, and Extendicare timely replied. Owings dismissed her second complaint on October 1, 2007, which prompted Extendi-care\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law. By the time of Owings\u2019s second dismissal, however, Extendicare had already opted out.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">{\u00b6 24} This sequence of events secured Owings almost four additional years of temporary total disability compensation and medical-bill payments. Given that the delay in resolution was largely attributable to Owings, we are not convinced that Extendicare should be denied reimbursement of pre-opt-out expenses as a matter of law because Extendicare did not apply sooner or because its right, according to the bureau, did not \u201cvest\u201d sooner.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">{\u00b6 25} Extendicare also points to the language of the statute itself:</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cOn and after the effective date of the employer\u2019s election [to opt out of the reimbursement program], the self-insuring employer shall pay directly to an employee or to an employee\u2019s dependents compensation and benefits under this section * * * and the employer shall receive no money or credits from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>surplus fund on account of <em>those payments </em>and shall not be required to pay any amounts into the surplus fund on account of this section. The election made under this division is irrevocable.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 4123.512(H).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">{\u00b6 27} Extendicare focuses on the words \u201cthose payments\u201d and insists that they can refer only to the payments occurring after the opt-out date \u2014 i.e. \u201cthose paid directly to an employee on or after the effective date of the employer\u2019s election.\u201d Extendicare argues that if the General Assembly had desired to foreclose reimbursement for all expenditures both before and after the date of the election to opt out, it would have used the words \u201cany payments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">{\u00b6 28} The bureau does not address this argument. It instead focuses on the statute\u2019s reference to irrevocability and asserts that an employer forever loses the right to any reimbursement once it has elected to opt out. The bureau\u2019s interpretation is incorrect. The reference to irrevocability clearly \u2014 and only\u2014 means that once an employer opts out, it cannot later opt back in.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">{\u00b6 29} We accordingly find that Extendicare\u2019s opt-out does not automatically foreclose it from recouping expenditures made to or on behalf of Owings before it opted out of the reimbursement program. But this does not mean that all of Extendicare\u2019s pre-opt-out expenditures qualify for reimbursement. Only those payments that were attributable to the three disputed \u2014 but later disallowed\u2014 conditions can be reimbursed.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">{\u00b6 30} Extendicare seeks reimbursement of medical expenses as well as temporary total disability compensation. The common pleas court denied Ow-ings\u2019s right to participate in the workers\u2019 compensation system for the three contested conditions. Thus, payments for medical expenses related to them should not have been made. Extendicare is accordingly entitled to reimbursement for medical-bill payments that were related to any of those three conditions that were paid before it exercised the right to opt out of the reimbursement program.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">{\u00b6 31} Extendicare also seeks reimbursement for temporary total disability compensation that it paid to Owings between April 1, 2004, and June 30, 2007, before its opt-out date. Extendicare argues that Owings\u2019s inability to work was due to the three disputed conditions and that their later disallowance meant that temporary total disability compensation should not have been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">{\u00b6 32} This argument does not withstand scrutiny. First, there is no evidence that temporary total disability compensation was based on the three disallowed conditions. The C-84 physician reports on which compensation was based consistently attributed disability to the conditions allowed in the claim initially. Moreover, temporary total disability compensation was <em>already being paid </em>to Owings when the additional but disputed conditions were first allowed by the district hearing officer, so it could not have been based on those conditions.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b140-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Porter, Wright, Morris &amp; Arthur, L.L.P., Darrell R. Shepard, and Robert J. Stalter, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b140-12\">Richard Cordray, Attorney General, and Elise Porter and Gerald H. Waterman, Assistant Attorneys General, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">{\u00b6 33} Extendicare persists, claiming that temporary total disability compensation was implicitly based on the disputed conditions because Owings\u2019s originally allowed conditions had reached MMI and could not support temporary total disability compensation. This argument, however, ignores that the allowed conditions were never declared to have reached MMI. To the contrary, the commission denied both of Extendicare\u2019s MMI motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">{\u00b6 34} Extendicare notes that the staff hearing officer\u2019s July 20, 2004 order indicated that Owings had not reached MMI \u201cbecause of the newly allowed conditions in this order.\u201d Nevertheless, without a definitive declaration that the original conditions had reached MMI, we do not find that this passage is sufficient to establish that temporary total disability compensation was based on the disputed conditions, particularly given the C-84 evidence of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">{\u00b6 35} In conclusion, Extendicare is entitled to reimbursement for medical payments made before the July 1, 2007 opt-out date because they related to disallowed conditions. Extendicare is not entitled to reimbursement for temporary total disability compensation paid between April 1, 2004, and July 30, 2007, because that compensation related to her originally allowed conditions rather than the three disallowed conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">{\u00b6 36} Accordingly, a writ of mandamus is hereby issued that orders the bureau to vacate its order and to issue a new order that grants Extendicare reimbursement for pre-opt-out medical expenses only.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Limited writ granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b140-9\">Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b140-10\">Brown, C.J., not participating.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
