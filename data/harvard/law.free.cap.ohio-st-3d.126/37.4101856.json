Roper was working multiple jobs at the time of his industrial injury. We must determine which wages are to be included in the calculation of his average weekly wage (\u201cAWW\u201d) and full weekly wage (\u201cFWW\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-13\">{\u00b6 2} Roper began working part-time for appellant FedEx Ground Package System, Inc., in 2004. Roper generally made between $190 and $250 per week. In April 2006, Roper took a second job with Integrated Pest Control that paid considerably more than the job at FedEx. Roper was also operating a side business, Affordable Animal Removal, concurrently with the other two jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-14\">{\u00b6 3} On October 24, 2006, Roper was injured at FedEx. FedEx, a self-insured employer, set Roper\u2019s AWW at $160.45, and his FWW at $250.80, based solely on his earnings at FedEx. Roper moved appellee Industrial Commission of Ohio to reset his average and full weekly wages based on his combined earnings from FedEx and Integrated Pest Control.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-15\">{\u00b6 4} A district hearing officer, citing the \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d provision of R.C. 4123.61, granted Roper\u2019s motion and reset his AWW at $417.05, and FWW <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>at $457.36, based on income from both jobs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That order was administratively-affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">{\u00b6 5} FedEx filed a complaint in mandamus in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, alleging that the commission abused its discretion in increasing Roper\u2019s full and average weekly wages. The court of appeals disagreed and denied the writ, prompting FedEx\u2019s appeal to this court as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">{\u00b6 6} At issue is the commission\u2019s inclusion of Roper\u2019s additional wages from Integrated Pest Control when computing his full and average weekly wage. Our review supports these calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">{\u00b6 7} The AWW \u201cis the basis upon which to compute benefits,\u201d R.C. 4123.61, and \u201cshould approximate the average amount that the claimant would have received had he continued working after the injury as he had before the injury.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Erkard v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 55 Ohio App.3d 186, 188, 563 N.E.2d 310. The AWW must do the claimant \u201csubstantial justice\u201d without providing a windfall. <em>State ex rel. Logan v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 599, 600, 651 N.E.2d 1008.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">{\u00b6 8} R.C. 4123.61 refers to the claimant\u2019s \u201caverage weekly wage for the year preceding the injury,\u201d so the AWW is typically based on the employee\u2019s earnings for the year prior to injury divided by 52 weeks. <em>State ex rel. Clark v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 563, 565, 634 N.E.2d 1014. This formula can, however, be abandoned if there are \u201cspecial circumstances under which the average weekly wage cannot justly be determined\u201d by applying that formula. R.C. 4123.61. When that occurs, the administrator of the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation \u201cshall use such method as will enable the administrator to do substantial justice to the claimants.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">{\u00b6 9} Roper worked at FedEx and Integrated Pest Control concurrently. The district and staff hearing officers concluded that Roper\u2019s additional employment with Integrated Pest Control was a special circumstance that warranted inclusion of those earnings in the aggregate wages for the year preceding injury. The commission defends the amount set, but now states that the hearing officers erred in using the special-circumstances provision, because the standard calculation already demands inclusion of all wages earned in the year prior to injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">{\u00b6 10} FedEx argues that inclusion of wages from other, concurrent employment discourages claimants from continuing to work at the second job if they are medically able. The higher AWW that results from combining wages \u201ccreates a disincentive for employees to return to the workplace,\u201d FedEx claims. FedEx also believes that it is unfair to require an employer to pay weekly temporary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>total disability benefits that exceed the weekly amount that the claimant made while in its employ. FedEx urges us to exclude secondary wages in their entirety or at least limit their inclusion to situations where the two jobs are similar in character. We reject FedEx\u2019s position for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">{\u00b6 11} First, there is no statutory basis for excluding concurrent wages. R.C. 4123.61 refers to wages earned in the year prior to injury without qualification or exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">{\u00b6 12} Second, contrary to FedEx\u2019s representation, relevant case law does not limit the inclusion of concurrent wages to jobs involving \u201csimilar\u201d employment. FedEx\u2019s reliance on the 1933 decision in <em>State ex rel. Smith v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1933), 127 Ohio St. 217, 187 N.E. 768, is misplaced. <em>Smith </em>involved a predecessor version of R.C. 4123.61 that differed significantly from the current statute. G.C. 1465-84 provided no definition for the term \u201caverage weekly wage.\u201d 103 Ohio Laws 87. R.C. 4123.61, however, specifically states that the AWW includes wages for the year preceding injury without qualification or exclusion. Given this statutory change, <em>Smith </em>is not relevant to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">{\u00b6 13} FedEx\u2019s argument also fails from a practical standpoint. FedEx decries as inequitable the inclusion of wages from Roper\u2019s second job because those wages were significantly higher than his wages at FedEx. Similar jobs, however, can also have very disparate earnings. Limiting wages to jobs that are similar in character does not eliminate the potential wage differential to which FedEx objects.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">{\u00b6 14} Third, we are not persuaded by FedEx\u2019s assertion that inclusion of concurrent wages discourages employment. FedEx believes that combining concurrent wages could produce an AWW \u2014 and with it a weekly amount of temporary total disability compensation \u2014 that is high enough to discourage injured employees from continuing to work at the second job even if they are medically able. This proposition, however, ignores the fact that R.C. 4123.56(A) expressly prohibits temporary total disability compensation payments \u201cwhen work within the physical capabilities of the employee is made available by the employer or another employer.\u201d Accordingly, a claimant who is still physically capable of working the second job but chooses not to cannot receive temporary total disability compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">{\u00b6 15} Finally, inclusion of concurrent wages is not inherently unfair. FedEx argues that it is unfair to require it to pay temporary total disability compensation benefits that, based on combined wages, exceed Roper\u2019s wages at FedEx. This assertion fails for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">{\u00b6 16} First, if a claimant is so severely hurt at one job as to disable him or her from both, it is not unfair to compensate the claimant for that cumulative loss. Second, the inclusion of two sets of wages was not considered unfair by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>General Assembly when it promulgated R.C. 4123.61. Again, under R.C. 4123.61, income from a previous job must be included in an AWW computation if the employment occurred during the relevant 52-week period. FedEx does not persuasively explain why concurrent wages should be treated differently from consecutive ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">{\u00b6 17} We accordingly find that the commission did not abuse its discretion in including earnings from both FedEx and Integrated Pest Control in establishing Roper\u2019s AWW.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">{\u00b6 18} FedEx also challenges the amount of Roper\u2019s FWW. The Revised Code does not define \u201cfull weekly wage\u201d for workers\u2019 compensation purposes, and this silence has been construed as affording the commission discretion in setting the FWW. <em>State ex rel. Taylor v. Indus. Comm., </em>Franklin App. No. 05AP-803, 2006-Ohio-4781, 2006 WL 2627557, \u00b6 14. Consistent with this discretion, the commission and bureau in 1980 issued Joint Resolution No. R80-7-48:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-7\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cWHEREAS confusion and uncertainty [have] arisen regarding the computation of the full weekly wage of injured employees under Ohio Revised code section 4123.61, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-8\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cWHEREAS the Industrial Commission and [B]ureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation seek to achieve uniformity of treatment between state-fund and self-insuring employers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-9\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cTHEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the full weekly wage shall be computed in the following manner:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-10\">{\u00b622} \u201cFor employees who have been either continuously employed for six weeks prior to the date of injury or who have worked for at least seven days prior to the date of injury, the full weekly wage shall be the higher amount of either: {\u00b6 23} \u201ca) The gross wages (including overtime pay) earned over the aforementioned six week period divided by six, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-11\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cb) The employee\u2019s gross wages earned for the seven days prior to the date of injury (excluding overtime pay).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">{\u00b6 25} The staff hearing officer used the first formula to set Roper\u2019s FWW. FedEx challenges the commission\u2019s reliance on R80-7-48, alleging that it was superseded in 1993 by Am.Sub.H.B. No. 107. 145 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2990. This argument, however, was correctly rejected in <em>Taylor, </em>which emphasized that the only change that Am.Sub.H.B. No. 107 made to R.C. 4123.61 was the substitution of the bureau for the commission. The balance of the statute remained intact, prompting this conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-13\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c[I]n former R.C. 4123.61, as amended by (1993) Am.Sub.H.B. No. 107, the agency responsible for determining FWW was changed, and consequently, as applied to the commission, Joint Resolution No. R80-7-48 was superseded to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>limited extent. However, we find nothing in (1993) Am.Sub.H.B. No. 107 that abrogates the computation of FWW as contained in Joint Resolution No. R80-748. We also cannot conclude that the commission\u2019s recognition that Joint Resolution No. R80-7-48 was superseded to a limited extent, as applied to the commission, altered the formula for determining FWW. Furthermore, the commission\u2019s recognition that the joint resolution was superseded to a limited extent did not necessarily prohibit the commission from relying, in part, upon Joint Resolution No. R80-7-48 when it exercised its discretion in determining relator\u2019s FWW.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>2006-Ohio-4781, 2006 WL 2627557, \u00b6 14.</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"b163-9\">Eastman &amp; Smith, Ltd., John T.
