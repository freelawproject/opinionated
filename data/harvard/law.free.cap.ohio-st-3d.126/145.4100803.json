There is no exception in R.C. 5103.16(D) for adoption by legal custodians. Thus, we hold that the procedures in R.C. 5103.16(D) for placing a child for purposes of adoption with a prospective adoptive parent apply even when the child has been living with the prospective adoptive parents pursuant to an award of legal custody by order of the juvenile court.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-17\">{\u00b6 3} In January 2006, the Lorain County Juvenile Court adjudicated J.A.S. and J.N.S., minor children, neglected and dependent. Ten months later, the court determined that the mother had failed to complete the case plan for reunification and that she was unable to provide stability for her children. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>court granted legal custody of the children to the appellants, R.S. and S.E.S., and ordered monthly visits between the children and their mother, who retained residual parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">{\u00b6 4} Two years later, appellants filed a petition in the Lorain County Probate Court to adopt the children. They alleged that the children\u2019s biological parents had failed to communicate with or support the children for one year immediately preceding the filing of the adoption petition and that their consent to the adoption was therefore not required. The appellants also moved to dispense with the preadoption placement requirements of R.C. 5103.16(D). They alleged that the procedures were not necessary in this case, because the Lorain County Juvenile Court had placed the children in their home by order of legal custody and the children had been living with them. The probate court summarily denied the motion to dispense with the placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">{\u00b6 5} The Ninth District Court of Appeals affirmed the probate court\u2019s denial of appellants\u2019 motion to dispense with preadoption placement procedures. The appellate court concluded that R.C. 5103.16(D) makes no exception for legal custodians. The Second District Court of Appeals had reached the opposite conclusion in the conflict case, <em>In re Adoption of A.W.K., </em>Montgomery App. No. 22248, 2007-Ohio-6341, 2007 WL 4214631. There, the court concluded that \u201ca placement for adoption [under R.C. 5103.16(D)] need not precede an adoption petition where * * * the child is already living in the prospective adoptive parents\u2019 home pursuant to a grant of legal custody.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 19. The Ninth District Court of Appeals affirmed but also certified that its judgment was in conflict with the judgment of the Second District Court of Appeals in <em>In re Adoption of A.W.K.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">{\u00b6 6} We determined that a conflict exists, and we accepted appellants\u2019 discretionary appeal on the same issue. The cases have been consolidated. 123 Ohio St.3d 1492, 2009-Ohio-6015, 916 N.E.2d 1073, and 123 Ohio St.3d 1494, 2009-Ohio-6015, 916 N.E.2d 1074.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">{\u00b6 7} R.C. 5103.16 sets forth the procedure for independently placing a child for adoption when no public agency, certified institution or association, or foreign custodian is involved. R.C. 5103.16(D) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-8\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c(D) No child shall be placed or received for adoption or with intent to adopt unless placement is made by a public children services agency, an institution or association that is certified by the department of job and family services under section 5103.03 of the Revised Code to place children for adoption, or custodians in another state or foreign country, or unless all of the following criteria are met:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-9\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c(1) Prior to the placement and receiving of the child, the parent or parents of the child personally have applied to, and appeared before, the probate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>court of the county in which the parent or parents reside, or in which the person seeking to adopt the child resides, for approval of the proposed placement specified in the application and have signed and filed with the court a written statement showing that the parent or parents are aware of their right to contest the decree of adoption subject to the limitations of section 3107.16 of the Revised Code;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-6\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c(2) The court ordered an independent home study of the proposed placement to be conducted as provided in section 3107.031 of the Revised Code, and after completion of the home study, the court determined that the proposed placement is in the best interest of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-7\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c(3) The court has approved of record the proposed placement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">{\u00b6 12} Appellants contend that R.C. 5103.16(D) does not apply in this case. They urge us to adopt the reasoning in <em>AW.K. </em>and dispense with preadoption placement because there was judicial oversight when the juvenile court placed the children in their legal custody. We must determine whether R.C. 5103.16(D) preplacement requirements are necessary even when the child has been living with the prospective adoptive parents pursuant to a grant of legal custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">{\u00b6 13} R.C. 5103.16 was enacted to curb black-market adoptions by requiring some agency supervision or court approval of private placements. <em>In re Adoption of Zschach </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 648, 656, 665 N.E.2d 1070 (plurality opinion). The General Assembly wanted to prevent private independent placements that may involve fraud, misrepresentations, or the exchange of money to coerce parents to relinquish a baby. \u201cThe intent of the legislature in enacting R.C. 5103.16 was to provide some measure of judicial control over the placement of children for adoption which is not conducted under the auspices of a statutorily recognized and authorized agency. That measure of judicial control is accomplished by having the parents of the child personally appear before the proper probate court for approval of the placement and adoption.\u201d <em>Lemley v. Kaiser </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 258, 260, 6 OBR 324, 452 N.E.2d 1304.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">{\u00b6 14} R.C. 5103.16 does not apply in all private adoptions. The General Assembly has expressly excluded adoptions by a stepparent, a grandparent, or a guardian. Stepparents and grandparents have a family or biological connection to the birth parents, and a guardian is subject to ongoing court supervision and may exercise rights over a child only pursuant to a court order. R.C. 2151.011(B)(16); R.C. Chapter 2111. Thus, a private placement with any of those persons imposes less need for protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">{\u00b6 15} R.C. 5103.16(D) makes no exception for a legal custodian. A legal custodian has more independent discretion over the child, and there is no ongoing judicial supervision or oversight. The biological parents\u2019 residual rights have not been terminated. The General Assembly when amending R.C. 5103.16(D) did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>exclude a legal custodian from the statute\u2019s application, and we will not judicially add such an exception to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">{\u00b6 16} Appellants argue that it is unnecessary to apply R.C. 5103.16(D) because there was judicial oversight here. The Lorain County Children\u2019s Services was involved in the dependency action, and the juvenile court placed the children with the appellants when it awarded them legal custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">{\u00b6 17} There is a significant difference between a court\u2019s placement pursuant to an award of legal custody and a court\u2019s approval over the placement of a child in a prospective adoptive home. Here, the juvenile court\u2019s order that awarded legal custody of the children was in a child-dependency action. The county had intervened and removed the children from the home but had not pursued termination of parental rights. During the disposition hearing, the juvenile court advised the parties of their rights. The biological parents retained \u201cresidual parental rights, privileges, and responsibilities,\u201d which included reasonable visitation and the right to deny consent to adoption. R.C. 2151.011(B)(46). Appellants were awarded the right to physically care for and control the children, subject to the parents\u2019 residual rights and responsibilities. R.C. 2151.011(B)(19).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">{\u00b6 18} R.C. 5103.16(D), on the other hand, requires judicial control over the child\u2019s placement for purposes of adoption. With a private, independent adoption, this means that the biological parents must appear before and obtain approval from the probate court. See <em>Lemley, </em>6 Ohio St.3d at 260, 6 OBR 324, 452 N.E.2d 1304; <em>In re Proposed Adoption of a Child by Michael S. </em>(1998), 131 Ohio App.3d 358, 722 N.E.2d 574. Although J.A.S. and J.N.S. had been living with the appellants under an order of legal custody, the probate court had not formally placed the children with them for purposes of adoption. The juvenile court\u2019s order of legal custody is not a placement for adoption under R.C. 5103.16(D). No court has approved placement for purposes of adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">{\u00b6 19} Appellants also contend that the placement was not surreptitious, because it was part of the dependency action, and that biological parents are notified of the adoption process because their consent is necessary unless a statutory exception applies. R.C. 3107.05, 3107.06, and 3107.07. However, the dependency action did not sever the rights of the biological parents. The parents retained residual parental rights and may attempt to correct the situation that caused the court to remove the child in order to regain custody. Termination of parental rights and subsequent adoption were not issues in the juvenile court.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">{\u00b6 20} <em>A.W.K. </em>minimized concern for the lack of notice to the biological parents when R.C. 5103.16(D) procedures are not followed. 2007-0hio-6341, 2007 WL 4214631, \u00b6 16. The court in that case reasoned that the consent phase of the adoption process would afford the biological parents sufficient notice. Id. However, if prospective adoptive parents bypass the preadoption placement proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>dures in R.C. 5103.16(D), biological parents may be unaware that adoption is being pursued. In cases where the biological parents\u2019 consent is unnecessary, the parents may have no knowledge of the potential loss of their parental rights and the impending adoption until the court schedules a hearing on the lack of consent and termination of parental rights. R.C. 5103.16(D) ensures that the biological parents have notice of a prospective adoption placement when a public agency or other certified institution or association is not involved.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b271-11\">Rothgery &amp; Associates and Joel D. Fritz, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b271-12\">Elizabeth I. Cooke, for appellee J.W.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b271-13\">Flanagan, Lieberman, Hoffman <em>&amp; </em>Swaim and Richard Hempfling, urging reversal for amicus curiae Ohio Adoption Law Roundtable.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b271-14\">Voorhees &amp; Levy, L.L.D., and Michael R. Voorhees, urging reversal for amicus curiae American Academy of Adoption Attorneys.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">{\u00b6 21} Finally, appellants claim that R.C. 5103.16(D) procedures would require them to relinquish legal custody and the children to be physically removed from their home, so that the court may place the children with the prospective adoptive parents for adoption. However, placement under R.C. 5103.16(D) may be accomplished without physical movement of the children. Although the statute requires the biological parents to seek court approval of placement, this does not mean that the children must physically be with the biological parents in order for them to file. The purpose of the statute is to provide some judicial control over the placement for adoption; it does not require removing the children from their legal custodians just so they can be placed back in that home for a different purpose. As a practical matter, if the biological parents are not involved in or object to the placement, then the legal custodians must pursue termination of the parental rights in order to proceed with the adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">{\u00b6 22} We must strictly comply with the statutory requirements in R.C. 5103.16(D). <em>Lemley, </em>6 Ohio St.3d at 260, 6 OBR 324, 452 N.E.2d 1304. Therefore, the procedures in R.C. 5103.16(D) for placing a child for purposes of adoption with a prospective adoptive parent apply even when the child has been living with the prospective adoptive parents pursuant to an award of legal custody by order of the juvenile court. We answer yes to the certified question and affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b271-9\">Pfeifer, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b271-10\">Brown, C.J., not participating.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
