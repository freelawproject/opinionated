Bodyke, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 266, 2010-Ohio-2424, 933 N.E.2d 753, 2010 WL 2219064.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">{\u00b6 2} Appellee, state of Ohio, and amicus curiae Ohio Attorney General have filed a joint motion for reconsideration and/or clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">{\u00b6 3} The motion for reconsideration and/or clarification is denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b671-12\">Brown, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b671-13\">O\u2019Donnell and Cupp, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b671-14\">Cupp, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A7hU\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-15\">{\u00b6 4} I would grant the state\u2019s motion for clarification of this court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Bodyke, </em>to clarify that <em>Bodyke </em>does not apply to cases in which there is no prior court order classifying the defendant into a sex-offender category that existed under Megan\u2019s Law. The majority decision in <em>Bodyke </em>states that it was based on the concern that R.C. 2950.031 and 2950.032 \u201crequire the attorney general to reclassify sex offenders whose classifications have already been adjudicated by a court and made the subject of a final order.\u201d <em>Bodyke, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 266, 2010-Ohio-2424, 933 N.E.2d 753, 2010 WL 2219064, at \u00b6 61. To the extent that particular sex offenders have not been previously \u201cadjudicated by a court\u201d to be within a particular classification under prior law, those offenders are not affected by the <em>Bodyke </em>decision. I believe that the court should grant clarification for this limited purpose.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b672-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>Russell V.
