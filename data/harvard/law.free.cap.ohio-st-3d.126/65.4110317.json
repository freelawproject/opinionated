This statute, along with its related statutes, authorizes a common pleas court to exercise continuing jurisdiction over a criminal defendant who has been charged with a violent first- or second-degree felony and who has been found incompetent to stand trial and remains so after the expiration of R.C. 2945.38\u2019s one-year time frame for restoring competency. R.C. 2945.39 authorizes the common pleas court to order the involuntary commitment of such a person in a mental-health facility when the statutory criteria are met. For the reasons that follow, we determine that R.C. 2945.39 is a civil statute and that its provisions and those of related statutes do not violate principles of due process or equal protection. We therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeals, which held ,to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>I. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">{\u00b6 2} Defendant-appellee, Thonex Williams, was indicted for rape (a first-degree felony) and other offenses in December 2005. Williams entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity and underwent a mental-health evaluation. A judge of the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas determined, consistent with the report of the mental-health examiner, that Williams was incompetent to stand trial and that there was a substantial probability that he could be restored to competency within the one-year time period prescribed by R.C. 2945.38. The trial court committed Williams to Twin Valley Behavioral Healthcare for restorative treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">{\u00b6 3} The trial court\u2019s review of Williams\u2019s mental status six months later resulted in a determination that Williams remained incompetent to stand trial, and the court ordered continuing treatment. As the maximum time under R.C. 2945.38 for restoration approached, a mental-health-examination report indicated that Williams remained incompetent to stand trial and opined that he could not be restored to competency within the statute of limitations for his most serious charge, rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">{\u00b6 4} The state then orally moved at a hearing for the trial court to retain jurisdiction under R.C. 2945.39(A)(2). Williams moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the trial court\u2019s exercise of continuing jurisdiction pursuant to R.C. 2945.39 would deprive him of his rights to due process and equal protection. After the state responded by defending the constitutionality of the court\u2019s retaining jurisdiction, and after an oral hearing, the trial court denied the motion to dismiss and held that R.C. 2945.39 is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">{\u00b6 5} On November 30, 2007, the trial court held a hearing under R.C. 2945.39(A)(2) to decide whether to retain jurisdiction. The trial court found by clear and convincing evidence that (1) Williams committed the offense of rape with which he was charged, (2) he was a mentally ill person subject to hospitalization by court order, (3) he was not competent to stand trial, and (4) the statutory time limit for restoration treatment had expired. The court rejected Williams\u2019s arguments that the matter belonged in probate court for a commitment under R.C. Chapter 5122. The trial court retained jurisdiction subject to R.C. 2945.401 and 2945.402 and ordered Williams to remain hospitalized at Twin Valley.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">{\u00b6 6} Upon Williams\u2019s appeal, the Second District Court of Appeals reversed in a divided decision. The majority held that R.C. 2945.39 is unconstitutional on three grounds. First, the majority held that an involuntary commitment under that statute is \u201ccriminal, not civil in nature\u201d and that Williams\u2019s constitutional rights were therefore violated because he had not received all the procedural safeguards in his R.C. 2945.39 commitment hearing that he should have received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>as a criminal defendant undergoing prosecution. 179 Ohio App.3d 584, 2008-Ohio-6245, 902 N.E.2d 1042, \u00b6 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">{\u00b6 7} Second, the appellate majority held that R.C. 2945.39 violated Williams\u2019s right to equal protection because that statute\u2019s procedures for committing persons <em>under indictment </em>for a serious felony offense do not also apply to persons who have been <em>convicted </em>of the same offense and because the procedures for terminating commitment are more onerous for a person committed under R.C. 2945.39 than for a person committed under R.C. Chapter 5122. Id. at \u00b6 66-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">{\u00b6 8} Third, the appellate majority agreed with Williams\u2019s arguments that R.C. 2945.39 violated his right to due process because the common pleas court\u2019s retention of jurisdiction pursuant to the criminal indictment and the permitted length of the commitment \u2014 the maximum term that he could have received for the most serious offense in the indictment \u2014 are not reasonably related to the purpose of commitment, which is to protect society from dangerous persons who are mentally ill. Id. at \u00b6 79-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">{\u00b6 9} The dissenter disagreed with the majority\u2019s conclusions on each of the constitutional grounds considered and would have affirmed the trial court\u2019s commitment order. Id. at \u00b6 85-92 (Wolff, P.J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">{\u00b6 10} We accepted the state\u2019s appeal under our discretionary jurisdiction to review three propositions of law regarding whether an involuntary commitment under R.C. 2945.39 is civil or criminal in nature, whether such a commitment violates a defendant\u2019s equal-protection rights, and whether such a commitment violates a defendant\u2019s due-process rights. 121 Ohio St.3d 1438, 2009-0hio-1638, 903 N.E.2d 1222.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">II. The Relevant Statutes</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">{\u00b6 11} A summary of the several statutes applicable to cases in which a defendant charged with a serious offense of violence (here rape, a first-degree felony) is mentally ill is useful to an understanding of this matter. Under R.C. 2945.38(B)(1) and (C)(1), a common pleas court presiding over a criminal case involving a defendant charged with a violent first- or second-degree felony who has been found incompetent to stand trial pursuant to R.C. 2945.37 may require the defendant to undergo treatment for up to one year. One situation in which the court is authorized to order treatment is when it finds that there is a \u201csubstantial probability\u201d that the incompetent defendant will become competent to stand trial within one year while undergoing treatment. R.C. 2945.38(B)(1)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">{\u00b6 12} If the one-year time for treatment expires and the defendant remains incompetent to stand trial, R.C. 2945.38(H)(3) directs that further proceedings must occur under R.C. 2945.39, 2945.401, and 2945.402. R.C. 2945.39(A) provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>two options that can be pursued at that point for a defendant who is mentally ill. First, the court or prosecuting attorney may seek the defendant\u2019s civil commitment in probate court under R.C. Chapter 5122. R.C. 2945.39(A)(1). Second, the court or prosecuting attorney may seek to have the common pleas court retain jurisdiction over the defendant. R.C. 2945.39(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">{\u00b6 13} To retain jurisdiction, the trial court must find, by clear and convincing evidence after a hearing, both that the defendant committed the charged offense and that the defendant is a mentally ill person subject to hospitalization by court order. R.C. 2945.39(A)(2)(a) and (b). \u201cMentally ill person subject to hospitalization by court order\u201d has the same meaning as that set forth in R.C. 5122.01(B), and includes persons who, because of mental illness, represent a substantial risk of physical harm to others as manifested by evidence of recent violent behavior or present dangerousness. R.C. 2945.37(A)(7) and 5122.01(B)(2). See <em>In re Burton </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 147, 11 OBR 465, 464 N.E.2d 530, paragraph one of the syllabus (a totality-of-the-circumstances test governs whether a person who is alleged to be mentally ill should be hospitalized under R.C. 5122.01(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">{\u00b6 14} If the court does not make both R.C. 2945.39(A)(2) findings, it must dismiss the indictment and discharge the defendant unless the court or the prosecuting attorney files for the defendant\u2019s civil commitment in probate court under R.C. Chapter 5122. R.C. 2945.39(C). But \u201c[a] dismissal of charges under [R.C. 2945.39(C)] is not a bar to further criminal proceedings based on the same conduct.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">{\u00b6 15} If the court does make both R.C. 2945.39(A)(2) findings, then R.C. 2945.39(D)(1) directs the court to commit the defendant to a hospital operated by the Department of Mental Health or to another appropriate facility. The court must order that the defendant be placed in the least-restrictive commitment alternative available consistent with public safety and the defendant\u2019s welfare, \u201cgiv[ing] preference to protecting public safety.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">{\u00b6 16} Once a court commits a defendant under R.C. 2945.39(D)(1), all further proceedings are governed by R.C. 2945.401 (which include proceedings regarding the defendant\u2019s possible placement in nonsecured status; the termination of the commitment; periodic clinical reports and clinical recommendations on the defendant\u2019s competence, degree of confinement, and termination of commitment; and trial court hearing requirements) and 2945.402 (regarding the defendant\u2019s possible conditional release). R.C. 2945.39(D)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">{\u00b6 17} Under R.C. 2945.401(J)(l)(a) through (c), a commitment pursuant to R.C. 2945.39 terminates upon the earlier of (a) the trial court\u2019s determination that the defendant is no longer a mentally ill person subject to hospitalization by court order, (b) the expiration of the maximum prison term the defendant could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>received if the defendant had been convicted of the most serious offense charged,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or (c) the trial court\u2019s termination of the commitment under R.C. 2945.401(J)(2)(a)(ii), which requires findings that the defendant is competent to stand trial and is no longer a mentally ill person subject to hospitalization by court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">{\u00b6 18} If the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction is terminated pursuant to R.C. 2945.401(J)(l)(b) because the defendant\u2019s commitment ends upon the expiration of the maximum prison term the defendant could have received, the court or prosecuting attorney may seek the defendant\u2019s civil commitment in probate court under R.C. Chapter 5122. R.C. 2945.401(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">III. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">{\u00b6 19} Each of Williams\u2019s assignments of error in the court of appeals challenged the facial constitutionality of R.C. 2945.39. Williams did not challenge the way the trial court applied R.C. 2945.39 and related statutes to his situation. The resolution of this case, therefore, turns on the evaluation of R.C. 2945.39\u2019s facial constitutionality on each of the three grounds considered by the appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">{\u00b6 20} All statutes enjoy a strong presumption of constitutionality. <em>State v. Cook </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 404, 409, 700 N.E.2d 570, citing <em>State ex rel. Dickman v. Defenbacher </em>(1955), 164 Ohio St. 142, 57 O.O. 134, 128 N.E.2d 59, paragraph one of the syllabus. To overcome the presumption, one must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the statute is unconstitutional. <em>State v. Bloomer, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 200, 2009-Ohio-2462, 909 N.E.2d 1254, \u00b6 41; <em>State v. Ferguson, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 7, 2008-Ohio-4824, 896 N.E.2d 110, \u00b6 12. \u201cIn order for a statute to be facially unconstitutional, it must be unconstitutional in all applications.\u201d <em>Oliver v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co. Ltd. Partnership, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 278, 2009-Ohio-5030, 915 N.E.2d 1205, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">\n<em>A. Is R.C. 2915.39 Criminal in Nature?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">{\u00b6 21} The appellate court held that an involuntary commitment under R.C. 2945.39 is criminal rather than civil in nature and that Williams\u2019s constitutional rights were therefore violated because in his R.C. 2945.39 commitment hearing, he was not afforded the procedural safeguards required by the Constitution for criminal prosecutions. In so holding, it applied the \u201cintent/effects test\u201d employed by this court in <em>State v. Cook, </em>83 Ohio St.3d at 415, 700 N.E.2d 570, to consider whether sex-offender legislation enacted in 1996 was civil or criminal for purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>of conducting an analysis under the Ex Post Facto Clause, Section 10, Article I of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">{\u00b6 22} In applying the intent/effects test, a court first considers whether the legislature intended the statute to be remedial (and therefore civil) or penal (and therefore criminal). Id. If the intent was that the statute be penal and criminal, then the inquiry ends. However, if the intent was that the statute be remedial and civil, then the statute\u2019s specific effects must be examined. The statute may still be determined to be punitive and criminal if its effects negate a remedial intention. Id. at 417-418, 700 N.E.2d 570. See also <em>United States v. Ward </em>(1980), 448 U.S. 242, 248-249, 100 S.Ct. 2636, 65 L.Ed.2d 742.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">{\u00b6 23} The intent/effects test was also applied by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Kansas v. Hendricks </em>(1997), 521 U.S. 346, 117 S.Ct. 2072, 138 L.Ed.2d 501. In that case, the court evaluated the constitutionality of a Kansas statute permitting the state to institutionalize \u201csexually violent predators\u201d who had completed their criminal sentences but who had mental abnormalities or personality disorders, that indicated that they would likely reoffend. Id. at 350-353, 117 S.Ct. 2072, 138 L.Ed.2d 501. The court held that the statute was civil in nature and did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause or the Ex Post Facto Clause. Id. at 370, 371, 117 S.Ct. 2072, 138 L.Ed.2d 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">{\u00b6 24} The statute in <em>Hendricks </em>was determined to be civil for reasons that included the fact that the statutory provision was in the state\u2019s probate code and not in its criminal code, id. at 361,117 S.Ct. 2072,138 L.Ed.2d 501, the statute did not implicate retribution or deterrence, which are the primary goals of criminal punishment, id. at 361-363, 117 S.Ct. 2072, 138 L.Ed.2d 501, and the statute did not require a finding of scienter, id. at 362, 117 S.Ct. 2072, 138 L.Ed.2d 501. The appellate court in the case at bar distinguished <em>Hendricks, </em>pointing out that R.C. 2945.39 and other implicated statutes are in the state\u2019s criminal code and that there is no explicit indication of a civil purpose in R.C. 2945.39. 179 Ohio App.3d 584, 2008-Ohio-6245, 902 N.E.2d 1042, at \u00b6 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">{\u00b6 25} Although the appellate court here recognized that R.C. 2945.39 is meant to protect the public, it read the statute to \u201csuggest\u201d that \u201cprotecting the public from dangerous mentally ill persons is secondary to punishing those dangerous mentally ill persons who cannot be tried.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 45. In support of this view, the court noted that the criminal indictment remains pending after the trial court commits the defendant under R.C. 2945.39. Id. at \u00b6 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">{\u00b6 26} As to the requirement that the evaluator conducting the periodic reviews under the statutes must express an opinion as to whether the defendant remains incompetent to stand trial, the appellate court considered the requirement to be an indicator that a key statutory purpose is to confine the defendant in case he regains competency to be tried. Id. The court found fault with the way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>the relevant statutes link the maximum length of detention to the maximum criminal sentence the defendant could have received if convicted. It determined that this connection bears no relation to the purposes of civil commitment and shows that the charged offense is not used solely as evidence of dangerousness or mental illness in determining whether commitment is appropriate. Id. at \u00b6 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">{\u00b6 27} According to the appellate court, the statutory framework \u201cstrongly suggests that commitment procedures under R.C. Chapter 5122 are adequate to address society\u2019s interest in confining dangerous mentally ill persons.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 48. The appellate court stated that \u201calthough R.C. 2945.39 attempts to accomplish some of the same goals as civil commitment, the commitment procedures of R.C. 2945.39 reflect an overriding intent to confine incompetent defendants who have been charged with serious felonies as if they had been convicted or until they can be tried.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">{\u00b6 28} Because the appellate court found that the intent of R.C. 2945.39 is penal, and that the statute is criminal for that reason, it did not consider the \u201ceffects\u201d prong of the intent/effects test.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">{\u00b6 29} In contrast, the dissent agreed with the trial court that R.C. 2945.39 is civil in nature and functions as \u201cmerely a transfer of commitment authority to the criminal court from the probate court for mentally ill persons subject to hospitalization by court order, whose present dangerousness is demonstrated by the commission of a serious felony.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 87 (Wolff, P.J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">{\u00b6 30} Our consideration of R.C. 2945.39 and related statutes leads us away from the view that the commitment of an incompetent defendant under R.C. 2945.39 is the functional equivalent of criminally confining the defendant. We see no indication of an overriding intent to punish or confine criminal defendants within the statutory framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">{\u00b6 31} Rather, we view R.C. 2945.39 and related statutes as designed primarily for the purpose of protecting the public. In particular, we note that R.C. 2945.39(D)(1), which requires the trial court to order the least-restrictive commitment alternative available consistent with public safety and the defendant\u2019s welfare if it enters a commitment order under R.C. 2945.39, explicitly states that the court \u201cshall give preference to protecting public safety.\u201d This statement gives voice to the predominant intent underlying R.C. 2945.39.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">{\u00b6 32} The present dangerousness of a specific offender (who, as a threshold matter, must have been charged with a serious offense, R.C. 2945.38(C)(1), to be subject to the statutes at issue) is the critical component of an R.C. 2945.39 proceeding. The type of offense charged is a reasonable indicator of the level of the offender\u2019s dangerousness. The seriousness of the charged offense plays a permissible and highly relevant role in the trial court\u2019s determination whether the offender\u2019s commitment under R.C. 2945.39 is appropriate. See <em>Hendricks, </em>521 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>U.S. at 362, 117 S.Ct. 2072, 138 L.Ed.2d 501 (a person\u2019s prior conduct may permissibly be considered to support a finding of dangerousness).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">{\u00b6 33} Moreover, R.C. 2945.39, as with the statute under consideration in <em>Hendricks, </em>does not require a finding of scienter, nor does it implicate retribution or deterrence, which are the primary objectives of criminal punishment and the two most telling factors that a particular statute is criminal in nature. See id. at 361-363, 117 S.Ct. 2072, 138 L.Ed.2d 501. R.C. 2945.39 does not implicate retribution, because it does not affix culpability for prior criminal conduct. See id. at 362, 117 S.Ct. 2072, 138 L.Ed.2d 501. A trial court\u2019s determination by clear and convincing evidence under R.C. 2945.39(A)(2) that the defendant committed the offense does not require a finding of scienter and is merely a factor considered in determining the propriety of the commitment; it plays no role beyond that limited purpose. R.C. 2945.39 does not implicate deterrence, because a defendant to whom it applies is unlikely, by the very nature of his mental illness, to possess the ability to tailor his behavior to the requirements of the law upon the threat of commitment. See id. at 362-363, 117 S.Ct. 2072, 138 L.Ed.2d 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">{\u00b6 34} Although it is true that R.C. 2945.39 and its related statutes are contained within Title 29 of the Revised Code, that fact is not dispositive as to whether these statutes are civil or criminal. The sum of the statutory attributes must be examined. See <em>Cook, </em>83 Ohio St.3d at 417, 700 N.E.2d 570. Similarly, the fact that the statutes refer to the person being considered for commitment as the \u201cdefendant\u201d does not mean that proceedings under R.C. 2945.39 are necessarily criminal in nature. We view both of these statutory characteristics as naturally flowing from the reality that the person has been charged with a serious criminal offense and is subject to proceedings under R.C. 2945.38, and not as any particular indication of an intent to punish. Moreover, although periodic reviews of a person committed under R.C. 2945.39 include an assessment of his ability to stand trial, see R.C. 2945.401(C), that fact does not transform proceedings that are inherently civil into ones that are criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">{\u00b6 35} We therefore determine that R.C. 2945.39 is manifestly civil in its intent. As the dissent in the appellate court noted, \u201c[I]individuals committed under R.C. 2945.39 must be released when they have been found to be no longer a mentally ill person subject to hospitalization by court order. * * * [T]he release provision emphasizes that the primary purpose of R.C. 2945.39 is to provide stricter confinement for mentally ill persons who are particularly dangerous. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Hendricks, </em>the confinement of the dangerously mentally ill \u2018is a legitimate nonpunitive governmental objective and has been historically so regarded.\u2019 521 U.S. at 363, 117 S.Ct. 2072, 138 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>501.\u201d 179 Ohio App.3d 584, 2008-Ohio-6245, 902 N.E.2d 1042, \u00b6 87 (Wolff, P.J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">{\u00b6 36} The question that arises next, under the second prong of the intent/effects test, is whether the statute operates in such a way that the statute\u2019s effects negate the civil intent. We see nothing in the effects of the statutory framework that negates its civil intent. The same features that have caused us to conclude that the statute is intended to be remedial in nature with an overriding purpose of protecting the public also support the conclusion that the effects of the statute are remedial in nature and consistent with the remedial intent. In particular, R.C. 2945.39 does not implicate retribution or deterrence, does not require a finding of scienter, and provides that commitments under the statute must terminate when the person is no longer mentally ill and subject to hospitalization by court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">{\u00b6 37} We conclude that R.C. 2945.39 is a civil statute. Consequently, a person committed under the statute need not be afforded the constitutional rights afforded to a defendant in a criminal prosecution. The judgment of the court of appeals on this issue is therefore reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">\n<em>B. Equal-Protection Considerations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">{\u00b6 38} The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, \u201cNo State shall * * * deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d Ohio\u2019s Equal Protection Clause, Section 2, Article I of the Ohio Constitution, provides, \u201cAll political power is inherent in the people. Government is instituted for their equal protection and benefit * * These two equal-protection provisions are functionally equivalent and require the same analysis. <em>Eppley v. Tri-Valley Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn., </em>122 Ohio St.3d 56, 2009-Ohio-1970, 908 N.E.2d 401, \u00b6 11; <em>State v.

Pursuant to this level of review, a statute that does not implicate a fundamental right or a suspect classification does not violate equal-protection principles if it is rationally related to a legitimate government interest. <em>Eppley, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 56, 2009-Ohio-1970, 908 N.E.2d 401, at \u00b6 15, citing <em>Menefee v. Queen City Metro </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 27, 29, 550 N.E.2d 181; <em>Oliver, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 278, 2009-Ohio-5030, 915 N.E.2d 1205, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">{\u00b6 40} Ohio courts grant substantial deference to the legislature when conducting an equal-protection rational-basis review. <em>State v.

Thompkins </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 558, 561, 664 N.E.2d 926.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">{\u00b6 41} Appellee asserts, and the appeals court agreed, that \u201c[cjommitment under R.C. 2945.39 is substantially more restrictive\u201d than under R.C. Chapter 5122. 179 Ohio App.3d 584, 2008-Ohio-6245, 902 N.E.2d 1042, \u00b6 64. The court reasoned that R.C. 2945.39 applies only to persons who have been <em>accused </em>of committing serious violent offenses and not to persons who have been <em>convicted </em>of serious violent offenses or to persons who <em>have a history of committing </em>serious violent offenses but are not under indictment. Id. at \u00b6 66. The court then held, \u201cR.C. 2945.39 cannot reasonably effectuate the goal of providing more restrictive commitment to those who have committed dangerous crimes.\u201d Id. In addition, the court below saw no reasonable basis for the \u201cmore onerous procedures\u201d it perceived for terminating commitment under R.C. 2945.39 than for terminating an ordinary civil commitment under R.C. Chapter 5122. On that basis, the court found an equal-protection violation. Id. at \u00b6 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">{\u00b6 42} Appellee\u2019s arguments that R.C. 2945.39 violates his right to equal protection rely in large part on <em>Jackson v. Indiana </em>(1972), 406 U.S. 715, 92 S.Ct. 1845, 32 L.Ed.2d 435, and <em>Baxstrom v. Herold </em>(1966), 383 U.S. 107, 86 S.Ct. 760, 15 L.Ed.2d 620. In <em>Jackson, </em>the court held that the involuntary commitment of a defendant under an Indiana statute that amounted to \u201ccondemning him in effect to permanent institutionalization without the showing required for commitment or the opportunity for release afforded by\u201d statutes applicable to those not charged with offenses deprived the defendant of equal protection. Id. at 729, 92 S.Ct. 1845, 32 L.Ed.2d 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">{\u00b6 43} In <em>Baxstrom, </em>the court held that the involuntary commitment under a New York statute of a mentally ill person who had completed his criminal sentence violated equal protection because the person did not receive the benefit of a judicial hearing to determine whether he was dangerous, a hearing he would have had if he had not been in prison at the time the civil commitment proceeding was instituted. Id. at 110, 86 S.Ct. 760, 15 L.Ed.2d 620. The court stated that there was \u201cno conceivable basis for distinguishing the commitment of a person who is nearing the end of a penal term from all other civil commitments.\u201d Id. at 111-112, 86 S.Ct. 760,15 L.Ed.2d 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">\u00bb{\u00b6 44} The state argues that R.C. 2945.39 does not violate equal-protection rights, because its procedures are justified by the state\u2019s interest in restraining mentally ill persons subject to hospitalization who have committed a serious crime. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">{\u00b6 45} We accept as valid the arguments presented by the state and by the amicus curiae, the attorney general of Ohio, that a commitment under R.C. 2945.39 and related statutes has many of the same attributes as a commitment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>under R.C. Chapter 5122, and that the differences between the two are not as substantial as appellee asserts. For example, R.C. 2945.39(A)(2)(b) uses the term \u201cmentally ill person subject to hospitalization by court order\u201d and defines that term exactly as it is defined in R.C. 5122.01(B). See R.C. 2945.37(A)(7). Moreover, R.C. 2945.401(B) states that provisions of R.C. Chapter 5122 \u201cregarding hospitalization or institutionalization shall apply to the extent they are not in conflict with this chapter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">{\u00b6 46} This court in <em>In re Burton, </em>11 Ohio St.3d at 150-151, 11 OBR 465, 464 N.E.2d 530, upheld the constitutionality of R.C. Chapter 5122\u2019s standards for involuntary commitments in the face of due-process and equal-protection challenges. Certainly, to the extent that R.C. 2945.39 incorporates many of those same standards, it does not violate equal-protection principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">{\u00b6 47} R.C. 2945.39(A)(2)\u2019s specific requirement that a court must make a threshold finding (by clear and convincing evidence) that the defendant committed the crimes he is charged with before ordering the defendant\u2019s commitment is a requirement not found in R.C. Chapter 5122. But this does not create an equal-protection violation, because the standards for commitment in this regard under R.C. 2945.39 are actually <em>stricter </em>than those under R.C. Chapter 5122. This factor distinguishes this case from <em>Jackson, </em>in which an equal-protection violation was found in part because the accused person in that case was subjected to \u201ca more <em>lenient </em>commitment standard\u201d than was applicable to others. (Emphasis added.) 406 U.S. at 730, 92 S.Ct. 1845, 32 L.Ed.2d 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">{\u00b6 48} The state concedes that there are some differences between the procedures by which a person is involuntarily committed through the probate court under R.C. Chapter 5122 and those procedures by which a person is involuntarily committed under R.C. 2945.39, as well as in the respective procedures once the commitment has been ordered. For example, those committed by a probate court are given earlier initial review hearings, compare R.C. 5122.15(C) and (H) with R.C. 2945.401(C); do not face the same level of scrutiny as to public-safety concerns, compare, e.g., R.C. 5122.15(C) with R.C. 2945.39(A)(2) and (D)(1); can more easily have their restrictions within the institution reduced, compare R.C. 5122.20 with R.C. 2945.401(D); and have less stringent procedures for the termination of the commitment, including possible termination of commitment by a chief medical officer pursuant to R.C. Chapter 5122 without the probate court\u2019s approval, compare R.C. 5122.21(A) with R.C. 2945.401(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">{\u00b6 49} These statutory differences, however, are justified by the differing contexts of the two types of commitments. The fact that the subject of an R.C. 2945.39 commitment has been found to be a danger to others and <em>also </em>has been found to have committed a violent felony, such as the rape in this case, fundamentally distinguishes an R.C. 2945.39 commitment from one under R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>Chapter 5122. It is a distinction that may permissibly be taken into account. Public-safety concerns reasonably justify assigning to the common pleas court that entered the commitment order an important role in the committed person\u2019s possible reduction in restrictions and in the determination of whether the commitment should be terminated. Although a person committed under R.C. 2945.39 may have to wait longer to receive an initial review hearing than a person committed under R.C. Chapter 5122, see R.C. 2945.401(C), that difference is not unreasonable, because such a person has already been subjected to the extensive evaluation procedures of R.C. 2945.38.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">{\u00b6 50} Even though R.C. 2945.39 concerns only persons who are under indictment and does not include others with a history of committing serious felony offenses who are not under indictment, the General Assembly \u201ccould rationally conclude that an individual\u2019s present involvement in the criminal-justice system indicates a greater degree of dangerousness.\u201d 179 Ohio App.3d 584, 2008-Ohio-6245, 902 N.E.2d 1042, at \u00b6 88 (Wolff, P.J., dissenting). Moreover, \u201cbecause those committed under R.C. 2945.39 are particularly prone to commit serious felonies, the legislature could rationally distinguish [such persons from those] persons committed through the probate court for purpose of release procedures. * * * [S]ociety has a substantial interest in ensuring that those individuals who have been deemed particularly dangerous truly are no longer mentally ill persons subject to hospitalization by court order prior to their release from commitment.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">{\u00b6 51} Upon review, we hold that the procedures in R.C. 2945.39 and its related statutes that are less favorable to the person facing commitment than are the provisions governing a probate court commitment under R.C. Chapter 5122 are rationally related to legitimate government interests. Consequently, R.C. 2945.39 withstands equal-protection scrutiny, and appellee has not successfully borne his burden of establishing an equal-protection violation. See <em>State v. Bretz </em>(Dec. 30, 1999), 5th Dist. No. CA-98-001, 2000 WL 93739, *9 (holding that an involuntary commitment under R.C. 2945.39 does not violate equal-protection rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">{\u00b6 52} Because we hold that an involuntary commitment under R.C. 2945.39 does not violate equal protection, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed on this issue also.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">\n<em>C. Due-Process Considerations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">{\u00b6 53} The inquiry into whether R.C. 2945.39 violates due-process protections is also governed by the rational-basis standard. As stated in <em>Jackson v. Indiana, </em>406 U.S. at 738, 92 S.Ct. 1845, 32 L.Ed.2d 435, \u201cdue process requires that the nature and duration of commitment bear some reasonable relation to the purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>for which the individual is committed.\u201d See also <em>State v. Sullivan </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 502, 506, 739 N.E.2d 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">{\u00b6 54} A civil commitment for any purpose is a significant deprivation of liberty and due-process protections must be afforded to a person facing involuntary commitment. <em>Addington v. Texas </em>(1979), 441 U.S. 418, 425, 99 S.Ct. 1804, 60 L.Ed.2d 323. However, the right to be free from physical restraint is not absolute; the United States Supreme Court has consistently upheld statutes authorizing the forcible civil commitment of persons who are unable to control their behavior and who pose a danger to the safety of the public, \u201cprovided the confinement takes place pursuant to proper procedures and evidentiary standards.\u201d <em>Hendricks, </em>521 U.S. at 356-357, 117 S.Ct. 2072, 138 L.Ed.2d 501; <em>Foucha v. Louisiana </em>(1992), 504 U.S. 71, 80, 112 S.Ct. 1780, 118 L.Ed.2d 437.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">{\u00b6 55} In arguing that R.C. 2945.39 fails to comport with due process, appellee places great emphasis on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s statement in <em>Jackson, </em>406 U.S. at 738, 92 S.Ct. 1845, 32 L.Ed.2d 435, that \u201ca person charged by a State with a criminal offense who is committed solely on account of his incapacity to proceed to trial cannot be held more than the reasonable period of time necessary to determine whether there is a substantial probability that he will attain that capacity in the foreseeable future.\u201d Appellee also relies on this court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Sullivan, </em>90 Ohio St.3d 502, 739 N.E.2d 788. <em>Sullivan </em>held that former R.C. 2945.38, requiring all defendants found incompetent to stand trial to undergo treatment for a set amount of time for the purpose of restoring them to competency, violated due-process protections because the defendant\u2019s treatment could not be discontinued even if a court found that the defendant could not be restored to competency in the foreseeable future.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">{\u00b6 56} The state asserts that the court of appeals erred when it concluded by relying on <em>Sullivan </em>and other decisions that due process requires all efforts to restore competency to cease upon a court determination that a defendant is not restorable to competency within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">{\u00b6 57} The appellate court held that \u201c[b]ecause commitment under R.C. 2945.39 involves attempts at restoration to competency beyond a reasonable period of time,\u201d a commitment under that statute amounts to a due-process violation. 179 Ohio App.3d 584, 2008-Ohio-6245, 902 N.E.2d 1042, \u00b6 79. Due process requires that an indictment against a criminal defendant be dismissed upon a finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>the defendant cannot be restored to competency, the appeals court reasoned, because \u201cit is fundamentally unfair for an incompetent defendant to have charges pending indefinitely when there is little hope that he may [be] brought to trial and exonerated.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 81. Finally, the appellate court held that R.C. 2945.39(A)(2)(a)\u2019s use of a clear-and-convincing-evidence standard rather than a proof-beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard for determining whether an incompetent defendant committed the charged offense violates due process. Id. at \u00b6 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">{\u00b6 58} The appellate court\u2019s conclusions appear to be based on a belief that the statute\u2019s primary goals are to punish the defendant and restore his competency to stand trial. However, as discussed in our analysis above, R.C. 2945.39 is a civil statute with a primary goal of protecting the public. It is of great significance to our due-process inquiry that R.C. 2945.39(D)(1) requires the court to order the least-restrictive commitment alternative available consistent with public safety and the defendant\u2019s welfare, while also emphasizing that the court \u201cshall give preference to protecting public safety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">{\u00b6 59} It is apparent that a person committed under R.C. 2945.39 is not committed \u201csolely\u201d on account of his incapacity to proceed to trial, unlike the defendant in <em>Jackson, </em>406 U.S. at 738, 92 S.Ct. 1845, 32 L.Ed.2d 435. Rather, such a person is committed only after being found by clear and convincing evidence to be mentally ill and subject to hospitalization by court order under R.C. 5122.01(B), through the application of R.C. 2945.39(A)(2) and 2945.37(A)(7), and being found to be a danger to the public because he was determined to have committed the offense with which he was charged. See <em>Bretz, </em>5th Dist. No. CA-98-001, 2000 WL 93739, *7 (upholding the constitutionality of R.C. 2945.39, and distinguishing <em>Jackson </em>because in <em>Jackson, </em>\u201cthere was no \u2018affirmative proof that the accused had committed criminal acts or was otherwise dangerous\u201d). If the person at some point is no longer mentally ill and subject to hospitalization by court order, his commitment under R.C. 2945.39 will terminate, subject to additional court proceedings. R.C. 2945.401(J)(l)(a). These statutory features are similar to those of the statute upheld in <em>Hendricks. </em>See 521 U.S. at 352-353, 117 S.Ct. 2072,138 L.Ed.2d 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">{\u00b6 60} The clear-and-convincing-evidence standard of R.C. 2945.39(A)(2) for determining whether the defendant committed the crime charged does not violate the defendant\u2019s due-process rights. Instead, a trial court\u2019s finding under this evidentiary standard that the defendant has committed the offense charged is used only to determine the defendant\u2019s degree of dangerousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">{\u00b6 61} The state asserts that <em>Sullivan </em>does not support appellee\u2019s argument that his due-process rights were violated here. The purpose of the commitment in <em>Sullivan, </em>which involved the former version of R.C. 2945.38, was to restore the defendant to competency in order to stand trial. Because there was no probabili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>ty that competency could be restored within the time set by the former statute, the mandatory treatment period bore no rational relationship to the purpose of commitment, and, therefore, the defendant\u2019s due-process rights were violated. See <em>Sullivan, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 508, 739 N.E.2d 788. Our limited decision in <em>Sullivan, </em>however, has no application to this case, which involves the distinctly different procedures of R.C. 2945.39. The overriding purpose of this statute is to protect the public from a person who is dangerously mentally ill, has perpetrated felonious conduct, and cannot presently be tried because of his mental incompetency.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">{\u00b6 62} Thus, we conclude that R.C. 2945.39 and 2945.401 do not violate a defendant\u2019s due-process rights by allowing the indictment to remain intact, by allowing continued efforts to restore the defendant to competency, or by permitting a defendant to be committed for a term equal to the maximum term of imprisonment that he could receive for the most serious offense charged. \u201cAlthough * * * a defendant may be committed until the expiration of the maximum term of imprisonment that he could have received for the charged offense, due process is satisfied by the fact that he may be released sooner if he is no longer subject to hospitalization by court order.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>179 Ohio App.3d 584, 2008-Ohio-6245, 902 N.E.2d 1042, at \u00b6 90 (Wolff, P.J., dissenting). Moreover, as the dissent correctly observed, principles of due process do not prevent a person committed under R.C. 2945.39 from being reevaluated for competency. If competency is restored while the person is still mentally ill, he can \u201cbe tried on the offense while remaining committed for his mental illness. R.C. 2945.401(J)(2).\u201d Id. at \u00b6 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">{\u00b6 63} For the reasons expressed herein, we conclude that the nature and duration of the commitment that occurs under R.C. 2945.39 bear a reasonable relationship to the purpose for which the person is committed. See <em>Jackson, </em>406 U.S. at 738, 92 S.Ct. 1845, 32 L.Ed.2d 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">{\u00b6 64} We hold that an involuntary commitment under R.C. 2945.39 does not violate principles of due process. The judgment of the court of appeals is reversed on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">{\u00b6 65} The crux of appellee\u2019s arguments is that every involuntary commitment of the type at issue here should occur through a probate court proceeding under R.C. Chapter 5122, but we hold that such a practice is not constitutionally required. It is reasonable to provide, as R.C. 2945.39 does, that a common pleas court that already has had extensive interaction with a defendant under R.C. 2945.38 can continue to exercise jurisdiction over that defendant; an involuntary commitment in this situation need not be exclusively pursued in a probate court to be constitutional. And even though an R.C. Chapter 5122 commitment may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>one way to handle the involuntary commitment of a defendant who has committed a serious offense of violence and who is not presently competent to stand trial, the availability of procedures under R.C. Chapter 5122 does not stand in the way of the General Assembly\u2019s ability to create alternative procedures for persons who pose an especially high degree of risk to the safety of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">{\u00b6 66} We hold that because R.C. 2945.39 is civil in nature, a person committed under the statute need not be afforded the constitutional rights afforded to a defendant in a criminal prosecution. We also hold that an involuntary commitment under R.C. 2945.39 does not violate principles of equal protection or due process. The judgment of the court of appeals is reversed, and the judgment of the trial court is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b202-6\">Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b202-7\">Pfeifer and Lanzinger, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b202-8\">Brown, C.J., not participating.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b191-12\">.

Ohio already has a civil commitment process pursuant to R.C. Chapter 5122 regarding those who are mentally ill and R.C. Chapter 5123 regarding those who are developmentally disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-12\">{\u00b6 69} Second, tying the length of a criminal defendant\u2019s commitment to the maximum possible prison term for the most serious offense also indicates that the commitment is criminal in nature. If the maximum period of commitment is reached without the defendant\u2019s becoming competent to stand trial, he or she is discharged, unless the state seeks civil commitment. R.C. 2945.401(J)(l)(b). In other words, the general division of the common pleas court no longer has the authority to punish the defendant for the offense once the time has been served.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-13\">{\u00b6 70} Finally, unlike a person committed under the civil process, a defendant who is committed under R.C. 2945.39 remains under a pending indictment.
