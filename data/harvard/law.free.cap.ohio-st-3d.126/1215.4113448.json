Baker, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 1233, 2009-Ohio-1675, 905 N.E.2d 194, as having been improvidently certified and accepted. Our order contained the following statement: \u201cThe court orders that the opinion of the court of appeals may not be cited as authority except by the parties inter se.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Despite this order, the appellate court in this matter held: \u201cBecause this assignment of error involves the identical parties, our rejection of Baker\u2019s argument in a prior appeal remains applicable to the instant appeal.\u201d 2009-Ohio-2340, 2009 WL 1396435, \u00b6 18. The appellate court has misconstrued the meaning of this court\u2019s admonition in our order in <em>State v. Baker, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 1233, 2009-Ohio-1675, 905 N.E.2d 194. It is our intent that decisions as to which we give this admonition not be used as binding precedent except by the parties to that particular case and in the continuation of that particular case. Although this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1216\">*1216</page-number>case involves the same parties, it is a different case, and the court of appeals should not have cited its previous <em>Baker </em>decision as authority.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b652-9\">Sherri Bevan Walsh, Summit County Prosecuting Attorney, and Richard S.

Mark Segreti Jr., in support of appellant for amicus curiae, Timothy Reid.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">{\u00b6 4} As to the substantive legal issue, in <em>Old Chief v. United States </em>(1997), 519 U.S. 172, 117 S.Ct. 644, 136 L.Ed.2d 574, the United States Supreme Court determined that a defendant\u2019s conviction must be reversed if a past conviction is an element of the offense of which the defendant was convicted and the state refused to accept the defendant\u2019s stipulation regarding the conviction. Id. at 174. The certified question before us is: \u201cDoes the holding of <em>Old Chief v. United States </em>(1997), 519 U.S. 172, 117 S.Ct. 644, 136 L.Ed.2d 574, granting a right to a Defendant to stipulate to prior criminal convictions apply to state law prosecutions, or is it limited solely to prosecutions under federal law?\u201d 123 Ohio St.3d 1516, 2009-Ohio-6486, 918 N.E.2d 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">{\u00b6 5} Prior to this case, Baker had raised the <em>Old Chief </em>issue in our case Nos. 2008-1094 and 2008-1304, but after oral argument, just as in this case, this court dismissed those appeals as having been improvidently accepted and certified. Baker is now raising the <em>Old Chief </em>issue in a third case before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">{\u00b6 6} The majority may have believed that procedurally this case is not the vehicle in which to resolve the issue, because defense counsel did not object to the admission of the judgment entries of conviction as the defense in <em>Old Chief </em>did. However, the failure to object could be grounds for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel, in that prejudicial material was unnecessarily put before the jury. In addition, the appeal now before us presents a certified conflict that clearly shows a split between the Ninth District\u2019s view and that of other appellate districts. Therefore, the issue is squarely before us and has remained unresolved in Ohio for 13 years. The bench and bar of this state need clarification on this issue. The Ninth District needs a definitive answer from us on our interpretation. Therefore, I dissent from the dismissal of this case as having been improvidently certified, and I would adopt the holdings of <em>Old Chief </em>and apply the reasoning of <em>Old Chief </em>to the Ohio statute.</p>\n<judges id=\"b652-8\">Brown, C.J., and Pfeifer, J., concur in Part II of the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b651-16\">.
