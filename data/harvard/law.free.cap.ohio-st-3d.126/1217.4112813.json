I have considered the record, the merit briefs, and the oral arguments and have concluded that the trial court and the court of appeals based their decisions on a legal premise that this court should disaffirm. I therefore dissent from the dismissal of the appeal as having been improvidently accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-20\">{\u00b6 4} In this case, Marcella Christian had been appointed in West Virginia to serve as the guardian of her mother, Ethel Christian. On February 7, 2005, Ethel died. On April 15, 2005, and purportedly in her capacity as Ethel\u2019s guardian, Marcella filed a complaint against the defendants-appellees, River\u2019s Bend Health Care and River\u2019s Bend Health Care, L.L.C. (\u201cRiver\u2019s Bend\u201d or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1218\">*1218</page-number>\u201cdefendants\u201d), which operated a nursing home in South Point, Ohio. The complaint asserted tort claims against River\u2019s Bend based on Ethel\u2019s care during the period February 11, 2004, through April 25, 2004. The River\u2019s Bend defendants do not dispute that they were served process and answered the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">{\u00b6 5} On June 8, 2005, upon motion of the coadministrators of Ethel\u2019s estate, the trial court substituted Ethel\u2019s estate as the named plaintiff.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On March 6, 2006, the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed all claims as authorized by Civ.R. 41(A). The defendants do not deny that they never objected at any time during the pendency of these proceedings to the court\u2019s substitution of Ethel\u2019s estate as the named plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">{\u00b6 6} On February 27, 2007, the coadministrators of Ethel\u2019s estate filed a new complaint asserting claims similar to those stated in the earlier complaint. They asserted that Ohio law permitted them to refile the action within one year of the voluntary dismissal of the first complaint \u2014 a reference to the saving statute, R.C. 2305.19.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">{\u00b6 7} There is no dispute that as a matter of law, Marcella\u2019s status as a guardian terminated at the death of her mother and that the 2005 complaint was, when filed, defectively styled in identifying the plaintiff as \u201cEthel Y. Christian, by and through her Conservator and Guardian, Marcella E. Christian.\u201d In granting summary judgment to River\u2019s Bend in the refiled action, however, the trial court reasoned that the 2005 complaint was a \u201cnullity,\u201d rendering the saving statute unavailable to the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">{\u00b6 8} The court of appeals agreed in a split decision, accepting the premise that \u201cthe action commenced by the guardian, after her ward\u2019s death, is a nullity.\u201d <em>Whitley v. River\u2019s Bend Health Care, </em>183 Ohio App.3d 145, 2009-Ohio-3366, 916 N.E.2d 515, \u00b6 17. The majority determined that no civil action to which the saving statute could relate had been commenced before the statute of limitations expired on April 25, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">{\u00b6 9} I reject the contention that a civil action was not commenced in 2005 because the original complaint incorrectly identified the plaintiff as Ethel Christian, by and through her former guardian, rather than the estate of Ethel Christian. Civ.R. 3(A) specifically provides that \u201c[a] civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with the court, if service is obtained within one year.\u201d Similarly, for purposes of the saving statute, \u201c[a]n action is commenced * * * by filing a petition in the office of the clerk * * *, if service is obtained within one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1219\">*1219</page-number>year.\u201d R.C. 2305.17. Here the River\u2019s Bend defendants do not deny that a complaint was filed in the common pleas court in 2005 and that service was obtained within one year thereafter. Accordingly, application of the express text of Civ.R. 3(A) and R.C. 2305.17 compels the conclusion that an action was commenced. It is a separate, legal question whether that action, having been commenced, was vulnerable to attack for having been brought by a person lacking the necessary capacity to prosecute the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">{\u00b6 10} Civ.R. 17(A) provides: \u201cEvery action shall be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest. * * * No action shall be dismissed on the ground that it is not prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest until a reasonable time has been allowed after objection for ratification of commencement of the action by, or joinder or substitution of, the real party in interest. Such ratification, joinder, or substitution shall have the same effect as if the action had been commenced in the name of the real party in interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">{\u00b6 11} Adoption of the nullity theory is logically inconsistent with the express terms of Civ.R. 17(A). Here, had the Christian family neglected to substitute the estate as plaintiff, River\u2019s Bend could have objected to the prosecution of Ethel Christian\u2019s tort claims by her former guardian on the basis that the former guardian was not the \u201creal party in interest.\u201d Had River\u2019s Bend objected, Civ.R. 17(A) would have precluded dismissal of the action until \u201ca reasonable time [had] been allowed\u201d to correct that error. Instead, counsel for the Christian family corrected the acknowledged pleading error, and the trial court substituted the estate of Ethel Christian as the plaintiff, apparently without objection by the defendants. Accordingly, the substitution by the trial court was fully consistent with the letter and the spirit of Civ.R. 17(A). Similarly, pursuant to Civ.R. 17(A), after the trial court\u2019s substitution of the estate as plaintiff, the action was thereafter to be considered \u201cas if the action had been commenced in the name of the real party in interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">{\u00b6 12} The trial court and the majority in the court of appeals accepted the premise that a complaint is a nullity if filed by a former guardian on behalf of a deceased person who possessed a cause of action, rather than by the personal representatives of the estate. The genesis of that premise in Ohio is <em>Barnhart v. Schultz </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 59, 7 O.O.3d 142, 372 N.E.2d 589, which held that once the statute of limitations has expired, a plaintiff who has named a deceased person as sole defendant cannot amend the complaint to substitute the personal representative of the deceased defendant, even if service on the representative was obtained within one year of filing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">{\u00b6 13} The <em>Barnhart </em>case, however, was expressly overruled in 1983. <em>Baker v. McKnight </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St.3d 125, 4 OBR 371, 447 N.E.2d 104, syllabus. This court found it \u201cpreferable to overrule <em>Barnhart </em>outright than to nibble away for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1220\">*1220</page-number>years at the overly technical and unnecessarily severe rule of law announced in that case.\u201d Id. at 129, 4 OBR 371, 447 N.E.2d 104. In <em>Baker, </em>this court expressly rejected the nullity theory, holding that a plaintiff who improperly names in the complaint a deceased person as the sole defendant has, in fact, commenced an action pursuant to Civ.R. 3(A). In rejecting the nullity theory, the <em>Baker </em>court quoted with approval the appellate court\u2019s opinion in <em>Barnhart:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c \u2018The original complaint in this case, in our opinion, did not name the <em>wrong party </em>as a defendant. Rather, the correct party was designated, but the designation amounted to a <em>misnomer </em>in light of the fact that the named defendant was then deceased. The eventual substitution of the fiduciary of the alleged tortfeasor\u2019s estate was not a new cause of action and did not involve an entire change in any of the parties. On the contrary, the amendment simply substituted the legal successor of the decedent.\u2019 (Emphasis <em>sic).\u201d Baker, 4 </em>Ohio St.3d at 128, 447 N.E.2d 104, fn. 3, quoting <em>Barnhart v. Schultz </em>(Jan. 26, 1977), Hamilton App. No. C-75377, 1977 WL 199632.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">{\u00b6 15} The <em>Baker </em>court further observed that the substituted defendant had timely notice of the claim before the statute of limitations had expired and suffered no prejudice through her substitution as the personal representative of the decedent. Quoting <em>Hardesty v. Cabotage </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 114, 117, 1 OBR 147, 438 N.E.2d 431, the <em>Baker </em>court noted, \u201c \u2018Such a result comports with the purpose of the Civil Rules. \u201cThe spirit of the Civil Rules is the resolution of cases upon their merits, not upon pleading deficiencies.\u201d <em>Peterson v. Teodosio </em>(1973), 34 Ohio St.2d 161, 175, [63 O.O.2d 262, 269], 297 N.E.2d 113. Decisions on the merits should not be avoided on the basis of mere technicalities; pleading is not \u201c \u2018a game of skill in which one misstep by counsel may be decisive to the outcome[;] * * * [rather] the purpose of pleading is to facilitate a proper decision on the merits.\u2019 <em>Conley v. Gibson </em>[1957], 355 U.S. 41, 48 [78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80].\u201d <em>Forman </em>[sic, Foman] <em>v. Davis </em>(1962), 371 U.S. 178, 181-182 [83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222].\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">(\u00b6 16} In my view, the substitution of the estate of Ethel Christian in the 2005 proceedings was appropriate and consistent with the express authority provided by the Civil Rules and with this court\u2019s legal analysis in <em>Baker. </em>Moreover, the Civil Rules \u201cshall be construed and applied to effect just results by eliminating delay, unnecessary expense and all other impediments to the expeditious administration of justice.\u201d Civ.R. 1(B). In interpreting the rules, this court should place emphasis upon \u201cliberal construction rather than upon technical interpretation.\u201d 1970 Staff Notes, Civ.R. 1(B). See also <em>Peterson v. Teodosio, </em>34 Ohio St.2d at 175, 63 O.O.2d 262, 297 N.E.2d 113; <em>Patterson v. V &amp; M Auto Body </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 573, 577, 589 N.E.2d 1306; <em>LaNeve v. Atlas Recycling, Inc., </em>119 Ohio St.3d 324. 2008-0hio-3921. 894 N.E.2d 25. at \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1221\">*1221</page-number>{\u00b6 17} Since the 1983 <em>Baker </em>case, a plaintiff in Ohio may amend a complaint to substitute an estate as the named defendant in the place of the deceased original defendant. I see no logical impediment to extending the reasoning of <em>Baker </em>to the factual circumstances at issue here, i.e., where the complaint improperly names as plaintiff a former guardian instead of correctly naming as plaintiff the formal representatives of the decedent\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">{\u00b6 18} Under the nullity theory adopted by the majority of the court of appeals and contrary to the express language of Civ.R. 17, when a putative legal representative lacks legal capacity to act on behalf of the plaintiffs estate in filing a complaint, a trial court would lack authority to allow the amendment of pleadings and the substitution of a correct party \u2014 there being no legally recognizable complaint and no pending legal action, there would be no complaint that could be amended nor any action in which parties could be substituted. Presumably, the only remedy to correct the initial pleading error would be the filing of a separate, new complaint and the commencement of a new action. That result is inconsistent with the spirit of the Civil Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">{\u00b6 19} Moreover, if a nullity analysis is accepted, a defendant could preserve the defense of lack of capacity to prosecute claims without specifically pleading it, as illustrated by the result reached by the trial court and the court of appeals in this case. That result directly contradicts the express language of Civ.R. 9(A), which states, \u201cWhen a party desires to raise an issue as to the legal existence of any party or the capacity of any party to sue or be sued or the authority of a party to sue or be sued in a representative capacity, he shall do so by specific negative averment * * In addition, the logical extension of the nullity theory would permit a defendant to participate in \u201cnull\u201d proceedings after the filing of a defectively styled complaint and thereafter collaterally attack a resulting judgment. None of these possible consequences is consistent with the \u201cexpeditious administration of justice\u201d that the Civil Rules were adopted to ensure.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">{\u00b6 20} This court should therefore expressly disapprove the application of a nullity theory in factual circumstances such as those presented here. Should the nullity theory remain viable,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> unfortunate and unintended consequences will likely occur in future eases. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b657-8\">Pfeifer, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"b658-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1222\">*1222</page-number>Elk &amp; Elk Co., Ltd., Peter D.

Mazella, had been appointed to serve as coadministrators of the estate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b657-9\">. Both the Third and the Fifth Appellate Districts have, in my view improperly, sanctioned application of the nullity theory. <em>Estate of Newland v. St. Rita\u2019s Med. Ctr., </em>Allen App. No. 1-07-53, 2008-Ohio-1342, 2008 WL 755308, at \u00b6 22; <em>Simms v. Alliance Community Hosp., </em>Stark App. No. 2007-CA-00225, 2008-Ohio-847, 2008 WL 555362, at \u00b6 22. Therefore, even if this court forbids citation of the opinion of the Fourth District in the case at bar as authority in other cases, the doctrine may well continue to be raised in future Ohio cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
