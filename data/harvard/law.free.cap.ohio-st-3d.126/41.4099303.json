Because the court and judge patently and unambiguously lack jurisdiction to proceed in the pending civil case because the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio has exclusive initial jurisdiction over rate- and service-related claims, we grant a peremptory writ of prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">{\u00b6 2} Relator, Duke Energy Ohio, Inc. (\u201cDuke Energy\u201d), is a public-utility corporation that supplies gas and electricity to customers throughout southwestern Ohio. Duke Energy is a wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy Corporation, which is not a public utility. Proposals, L.L.C. (\u201cProposals\u201d) is a limited-liability company that invests in real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-11\">{\u00b6 3} Duke Energy provides gas and electricity to two separate parcels of real estate owned by Proposals \u2014 832 Oak Street, in Cincinnati, Ohio, and 609 18th Street, in Middletown, Ohio. Proposals rented the upstairs and downstairs units at its Cincinnati property, under terms that required each tenant to pay the gas and electric bills for the area they used, including the basement. Duke Energy inspected the property and informed Proposals that certain lighting fixtures needed to be rewired. After Proposals finished the rewiring, Duke Energy credited the tenants with over $9,000 previously charged to them and billed Proposals for this amount. Duke Energy billed some of this amount to Proposals\u2019 Middletown property and notified Proposals that it would disconnect utility service if the amount was not paid by February 26, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-12\">{\u00b6 4} On February 19, 2010, Proposals filed a complaint in respondent Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas against Duke Energy\u2019s parent corporation. In addition to filing the complaint, Proposals filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to prevent the parent corporation \u201cfrom cutting off utility service at 609 18th Street in Middletown, Ohio, until such time as the Court shall have a full opportunity to rule on the merits.\u201d In its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>motion, Proposals argued that Duke Energy\u2019s actions violated R.C. 4933.122(B). The parent corporation opposed the motion and moved to dismiss the civil action on the basis that the court lacked jurisdiction over the service-related complaint. On February 23, respondent Judge Norbert A. Nadel of the common pleas court granted Proposals\u2019 motion and issued an order restraining the parent corporation from cutting off utility service at Proposals\u2019 property. Judge Nadel scheduled a March 10 hearing on Proposals\u2019 request for a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">{\u00b6 5} On February 26, 2010, Proposals filed a complaint with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio based on the identical facts and claims in its civil action. More specifically, Proposals described its commission complaint against Duke Energy as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cThe property in question is a 130 year old duplex with two gas and two electric meters. Proposals, LLC purchased the property in Sep \u201907 and leases to two tenants. Duke Energy did an inspection July \u201909 after one tenant had their gas and electric disconnected for lack of payment. They verbally informed us that the basement was considered a common area and the lights therein had to be either on a separate meter or separately switched from within the tenants apartments. We rewired the single basement light switch into two. Duke reinspected and stated they were satisfied but were going to bill us back all gas and electric since the tenants moved in totaling $9047.73 and refund same to the tenants. We called PUCO and were told Duke was in error since such master metering only applied to commercial properties[.] Duke has refused to give us any inspection reports or further billing for 6 months and we have retained an attorney for discovery. Duke is now threatening disconnection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">{\u00b6 7} The parent corporation renewed its motion to dismiss the civil case and advised Judge Nadel of Proposals\u2019 pending complaint before the commission. Judge Nadel refused to dismiss the case and instructed the parties that the prehminary-injunction hearing would go forward as scheduled. Judge Nadel also allowed Proposals to amend its complaint to add Duke Energy as an additional defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">{\u00b6 8} In its amended complaint, Proposals claimed that Duke Energy and its parent corporation unlawfully charged it $9,047.73 for the provision of gas and electricity to its Cincinnati property and illegally threatened to terminate utility service for its Middletown property in violation of R.C. 4933.122(B). Proposals requested (1) an injunction preventing Duke Energy and its parent corporation from cutting off service to any of its properties in order to collect the disputed charge, (2) a declaratory judgment that it does not owe Duke Energy and its parent corporation the $9,047.73 claimed, (3) a declaratory judgment that neither Duke Energy nor its parent corporation is authorized to interfere with its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>constitutionally protected contractual relationships, and (4) an award for its damages and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">{\u00b6 9} Duke Energy filed this action for a writ of prohibition to prevent the common pleas court and Judge Nadel from exercising jurisdiction over the civil case and from restraining Duke Energy from disconnecting utility services because certain services provided by Duke Energy had not been paid for by Proposals. The common pleas court and Judge Nadel filed a motion to dismiss. Duke Energy filed a memorandum in opposition. In addition, William Flax, the attorney for Proposals, filed a motion for leave to file an amicus curiae memorandum in support of respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">{\u00b6 10} This cause is now before the court for our S.Ct.Prac.R. 10.5 determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">\n<em>Motion for Leave to File Amicus Curiae Memorandum</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">{\u00b6 11} The attorney for Proposals seeks leave to file an amicus curiae memorandum in support of the common pleas court and Judge Nadel. Under S.Ct.Prac.R. 10.8 and 6.6, an amicus curiae may file a merit brief in an original action without leave of court. See <em>State ex rel. Citizen Action for a Livable Montgomery v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 437, 2007-Ohio-5379, 875 N.E.2d 902, \u00b6 24. But the Supreme Court Rules of Practice do not specifically authorize amici curiae to file memoranda before an alternative writ is granted, so leave must be sought. See <em>State ex rel. Vaughn Industries, L.L.C. v. Reece, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 1212, 2007-Ohio-6670, 878 N.E.2d 1050, \u00b63 (granting motion of amicus curiae for leave to file a memorandum opposing respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss in prohibition case).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">{\u00b6 12} We grant Proposals\u2019 motion for leave to file the memorandum because it is the plaintiff in the underlying action that Duke Energy seeks to prevent, and the memorandum will assist us in our S.CtPrac.R. 10.5 determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">\n<em>S.CtPrac.R. 10.5 Standard</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">{\u00b6 13} We must determine whether dismissal, an alternative writ, or a peremptory writ is appropriate. S.CtPrac.R. 10.5. Dismissal, which the common pleas court and Judge Nadel request in their motion, is required if it appears beyond doubt, after presuming the truth of all material factual allegations of Duke Energy\u2019s complaint and making all reasonable inferences in its favor, that Duke Energy is not entitled to the requested extraordinary relief in prohibition. <em>State ex rel. Finkbeiner v. Lucas Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 462, 2009-Ohio-3657, 912 N.E.2d 573, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>{\u00b6 14} If, however, after so construing the complaint, it appears that its prohibition claim may have merit, we will grant an alternative writ and issue a schedule for the presentation of evidence and briefs. <em>State ex rel. Mason v. Burnside, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 1, 2007-Ohio-6754, 881 N.E.2d 224, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">{\u00b6 15} Finally, if the pertinent facts are uncontroverted and it appears beyond doubt that Duke Energy is entitled to the requested extraordinary relief in prohibition, a peremptory writ will be granted. <em>State ex rel. Sapp v. Franklin Cty. Court of Appeals, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 368, 2008-Ohio-2637, 889 N.E.2d 500, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">\n<em>Prohibition Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">{\u00b6 16} To be entitled to the requested writ of prohibition, Duke Energy must establish that (1) Judge Nadel and the common pleas court are about to exercise judicial power, (2) the exercise of that power is unauthorized by law, and (3) denying the writ would result in injury for which no other adequate remedy exists in the ordinary course of law. <em>State ex rel. Cordray v. Marshall, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 229, 2009-Ohio-4986, 915 N.E.2d 633, \u00b6 25. Judge Nadel and the common pleas court are exercising judicial power in the underlying civil case.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">{\u00b6 17} For the remaining requirements, \u201c[i]f a lower court patently and unambiguously lacks jurisdiction to proceed in a cause, prohibition * * * will issue to prevent any future unauthorized exercise of jurisdiction and to correct the results of prior jurisdietionally unauthorized actions.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Mayer v. Henson, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 276, 2002-Ohio-6323, 779 N.E.2d 223, \u00b6 12. \u201cWhere jurisdiction is patently and unambiguously lacking, [a relator] need not establish the lack of an adequate remedy at law because the availability of alternate remedies like appeal would be immaterial.\u201d <em>Sapp, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 368, 2008-Ohio-2637, 889 N.E.2d 500, at \u00b6 15. Therefore, the dispositive issue is whether Judge Nadel and the common pleas court patently and unambiguously lack jurisdiction to proceed in the underlying civil claims against Duke Energy.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">\n<em>Rate- and Service-Related Public-Utility Complaints</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cThe General Assembly has created a broad and comprehensive statutory scheme for regulating the business activities of public utilities. R.C. Title 49 sets forth a detailed statutory framework for the regulation of utility service and the fixation of rates charged by public utilities to their customers. As part of that scheme, the legislature created the Public Utilities Commission and empowered it with broad authority to administer and enforce the provisions of Title 49.\u201d <em>Kazmaier Supermarket, Inc. v. Toledo Edison Co. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 147, 150, 573 N.E.2d 655.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">{\u00b6 19} R.C. 4905.22 specifies that \u201c[e]very public utility shall furnish necessary and adequate service\u201d and that charges for public-utility services must be \u201cjust, reasonable, and not more than the charges allowed by law or by order of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>public utilities commission.\u201d R.C. 4905.26 confers exclusive jurisdiction on the commission to determine whether any charge or service rendered by a public utility \u201cis in any respect unjust, unreasonable, * * * or in violation of law.\u201d See also <em>State ex rel. Illum. Co. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Court of Common Pleas, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 69, 2002-Ohio-5312, 776 N.E.2d 92, \u00b6 18; <em>State ex rel. Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. v. Henson, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 349, 2004-Ohio-3208, 810 N.E.2d 953, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">{\u00b6 20} Therefore, a \u201cCourt of Common Pleas is without jurisdiction to hear a claim alleging that a utility has violated R.C. 4905.22 by charging an unjust and unreasonable rate and wrongfully terminating service, since such matters are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Public Utilities Commission.\u201d <em>Milligan v. Ohio Bell Tel. Co. </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 191, 10 O.O.3d 352, 383 N.E.2d 575, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">{\u00b6 21} To determine whether the commission has exclusive jurisdiction over the underlying case, we must determine (1) whether the commission\u2019s administrative expertise is required to resolve the disputed issue and (2) whether the act complained of constitutes a practice normally authorized by the utility. <em>Corrigan v. Illum. Co., </em>122 Ohio St.3d 265, 2009-Ohio-2524, 910 N.E.2d 1009, \u00b6 11. If either requirement is not met, \u201cthe claim is not within PUCO\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co., </em>119 Ohio St.3d 301, 2008-Ohio-3917, 893 N.E.2d 824, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">{\u00b6 22} First, the commission\u2019s administrative expertise is required to resolve this dispute. Proposals\u2019 claims in the civil action involve Duke Energy\u2019s charge of $9,047.73 to it for the provision of gas and electricity to its Cincinnati property and the threatened termination of service at Proposals\u2019 Middletown property if the disputed charge is not paid. These claims are manifestly rate- and service-related complaints, which are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the commission. <em>Henson, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 349, 2004-Ohio-3208, 810 N.E.2d 953; <em>Illum. Co., </em>97 Ohio St.3d 69, 2002-Ohio-5312, 776 N.E.2d 92; and <em>Milligan, </em>56 Ohio St.2d 191, 10 O.O.3d 352, 383 N.E.2d 575. In fact, in its amended complaint in the common pleas court, Proposals alleges that Duke Energy violated R.C. 4933.122, which specifies the procedures for public utilities to terminate service. Cf., e.g., <em>Henson, </em>\u00b6 23 (alleged violations of R.C. 4933.12 are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the commission).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">{\u00b6 23} Second, the acts complained of \u2014 Duke Energy\u2019s threatened disconnection of utility service to Proposals\u2019 property and the charge of $9,047.73 to Proposals for utility service previously provided to its tenants \u2014 constitute practices normally authorized by the utility, i.e., the termination of utility service for nonpayment. Ohio Adm.Code 4901:1-18-07 specifies the procedures for a utility company to \u201cdisconnect utility service of individuals whose utility services are included in rental payments and of consumers residing in a multi-unit dwelling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>(i.e., tenants who receive master-metered services) for which the customer is the landlord.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b169-12\">Eberly McMahon, L.L.C., and Robert A. McMahon, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b169-13\">Joseph T. Deters, Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney, and Christian J. Schaefer and Charles W.
