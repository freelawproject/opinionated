McDonnell, to vacate his sentence in <em>State v. McGrath, </em>Cuyahoga Cty. C.P. case No. CR-04-449129ZA. Appellant failed to attach the required affidavits to his petition pursuant to R.C. 2969.25. \u201cThe requirements of R.C. 2969.25 are mandatory, and failure to comply with them subjects an inmate\u2019s action to dismissal.\u201d <em>State ex rel. White v. Bechtel, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 11, 2003-Ohio-2262, 788 N.E.2d 634, \u00b6 5; <em>State ex rel. Hawk v. Athens Cty., </em>106 Ohio St.3d 183, 2005-Ohio-4383, 833 N.E.2d 296, \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-12\">{\u00b6 2} McGrath failed to file an affidavit containing a description of each civil action or appeal of a civil action that he had filed in the previous five years in any state or federal court, in violation of R.C. 2969.25(A). Furthermore, he failed to include in his affidavit of indigency a statement setting forth the balance in his inmate account for each of the preceding six months, as certified by the institutional cashier, in violation of R.C. 2969.25(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-13\">{\u00b6 3} Notwithstanding McGrath\u2019s claims to the contrary, R.C. 2969.25 applies to his mandamus complaint because he is an inmate,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and his mandamus case is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>civil case for purposes of R.C. 2969.21(B)(1)(a), which addresses inmate actions against government entities. See <em>Fuqua v. Williams, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 211, 2003-Ohio-5533, 797 N.E.2d 982, \u00b6 7 (\u201cunder Ohio law, state writ actions are civil actions\u201d); <em>Hawk, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 183, 2005-Ohio-4383, 833 N.E.2d 296, \u00b6 3 (applying R.C. 2969.25 to mandamus case instituted in court of appeals). McGrath has also failed to establish how the requirements of R.C. 2969.25(A) and (C) violate his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination. These requirements do not compel McGrath to answer questions that \u201cmight incriminate [him] in future criminal proceedings.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Verhovec v. Mascio </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 334, 336, 691 N.E.2d 282. Therefore, dismissal of McGrath\u2019s mandamus claim was appropriate.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b634-7\">Joseph McGrath, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b634-8\">William D.

Although McGrath listed a Gates Mills residential address when he filed his complaint in the court of appeals, he was actually incarcerated at Lake Erie Correctional Institution on that date and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>remains there. See http://www.dre.ohio.gov/OffenderSearch/Seareh.aspx. In fact, McGrath lists the prison\u2019s address on his appellate brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
