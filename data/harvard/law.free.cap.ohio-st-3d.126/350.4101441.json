The issue presented here concerns whether R.C. 2901.13(G), which provides that the statute of limitations shall not run during any time when the accused purposely avoids prosecution, tolls the limitations period for all offenses the accused committed, or whether it applies only to those offenses for which an indictment has been returned or underlying criminal activity has been discovered before the accused absconds.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">{\u00b6 2} Nothing in this statute limits its application to only those crimes that had been discovered at the time the accused avoided prosecution. Rather, R.C. 2901.13(G) tolls the statute of limitations for <em>all </em>offenses committed by an accused during the time when the accused purposely avoids prosecution for any offense. Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed, and the indictment is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">{\u00b6 3} In the early 1980s, Larry Bess began living with Theresa Ogden, and the couple married in 1986. Theresa had two children from a prior relationship: a son and a daughter. They lived at the Sunrise Cove Condominiums in North Royalton, where Bess began sexually abusing Theresa\u2019s daughter. The abuse continued until February 1989, when the daughter revealed it to a school counselor, who then reported the abuse to law-enforcement personnel and children\u2019s services.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">{\u00b6 4} Bess also allegedly sexually abused Theresa\u2019s son during this same time period, but when Detective Allen Napier of the North Royalton Police Department interviewed him as part of the investigation of his sister\u2019s claims, he said that his sister had lied, and he denied having been sexually abused by Bess.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">{\u00b6 5} When Bess became aware of the investigation, he began making plans to change his identity and leave town. He told Theresa that he planned to leave and assume a new identity because he did not believe that he could defend himself against her daughter\u2019s allegations and did not want to go to jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">{\u00b6 6} Bess and Theresa sold their home in North Royalton and split the proceeds. Bess then purchased a van, loaded his belongings, and left. When asked why she had not told authorities about Bess\u2019s plans to abscond, Theresa testified, \u201cHe hadn\u2019t been indicted or \u2014 you know. Nobody asked.\u201d She did not try to stop him from leaving, because she did not believe that he had sexually abused her daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">{\u00b6 7} On November 2, 1989, after Bess left the jurisdiction, a Cuyahoga County grand jury indicted him on three counts of rape and seven counts of gross sexual imposition in connection with the abuse of Theresa\u2019s daughter. The Cuyahoga <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>County Court of Common Pleas issued a capias for his arrest on November 27, 1989, when he failed to appear in court. Bess successfully concealed his identity and his whereabouts until March 5, 2007, when the FBI arrested him in Bogart, Georgia, where he had been living under an alias of Norman E. Weatherby.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">{\u00b6 8} Following Bess\u2019s apprehension, Detective David Sword of the North Royalton Police Department began looking for witnesses in the case. He met with Theresa\u2019s son, who eventually revealed that Bess had sexually abused him from 1982 to 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">{\u00b6 9} Based on his statements, the state obtained a second indictment against Bess, charging him with six counts of rape, two counts of gross sexual imposition, and one count each of attempted rape and complicity in the commission of rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">{\u00b6 10} The trial court tried Bess for the offenses committed against Theresa\u2019s daughter, which were not time-barred, because he had purposely avoided that prosecution, and a jury subsequently found him guilty of those charges. The court of appeals affirmed. See <em>State v. Bess, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 91560, 2009-Ohio-2032, 2009 WL 1156970.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">{\u00b6 11} Bess moved to dismiss the indictment that charged crimes against Theresa\u2019s son, arguing that the six-year statute of limitations established by former R.C. 2901.13(A)(1)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> had expired. The state objected, contending that R.C. 2901.13(G)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> tolled the statute of limitations during the time when Bess had purposely avoided prosecution. The trial court granted Bess\u2019s motion and dismissed the indictment relating to charges involving crimes against Theresa\u2019s son, finding that Bess had not purposely avoided prosecution for those alleged crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">{\u00b6 12} On appeal, the court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Relying on <em>State v. McGraw </em>(June 16, 1994), Cuyahoga App. No. 65202, 1994 WL 264401, the author of the appellate court opinion<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> concluded that Bess\u2019s flight and his concealment from prosecution for the sexual abuse of Theresa\u2019s daughter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>tolled the statute of limitations for those crimes, but did not toll the statute of limitations for charges related to the sexual abuse of Theresa\u2019s son, which the state learned about after Bess\u2019s apprehension.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">{\u00b6 13} The state appealed, and we agreed to address the following proposition of law: \u201cThe statute of limitations upon criminal offenses is tolled pursuant to former R.C. \u00a7 2901.13(G) when the accused purposely avoids prosecution for an offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">{\u00b6 14} The state contends that R.C. 2901.13(G) tolls the statute of limitations for \u201cany and all prosecutions against an accused who purposely avoids prosecution,\u201d noting that this statute contains no language that expressly limits tolling to those prosecutions that the accused specifically intended to avoid. According to the state, the purpose of the statute of limitations is to discourage inefficient or dilatory law enforcement, not to permit offenders to evade responsibility for criminal conduct; thus, tolling should not apply when the offender\u2019s action causes the delay in prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">{\u00b6 15} Bess, on the other hand, asserts that R.C. 2901.13(G) tolls the statute of limitations only when the evidence shows that \u201cthe accused left the jurisdiction purposefully to avoid the offense charged.\u201d He maintains that both the rule of lenity, which requires criminal statutes to be strictly construed against the state and liberally construed in favor of the accused, and the purpose of a statute of limitations in general \u2014 to protect the accused from having to defend against stale charges \u2014 support his construction of the statute. Bess also notes that Theresa\u2019s son did not report abuse to anyone before Bess was apprehended, which he now suggests shows that he could not have purposely avoided prosecution for those charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">{\u00b6 16} Thus, the issue is whether R.C. 2901.13(G) tolls the limitations period of all crimes allegedly committed by an accused during the time the accused purposefully avoids prosecution, or whether it applies only to the offenses the accused specifically intended to avoid at the time the accused absconded.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">Law and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b475-11\">{\u00b6 17} R.C. 2901.13(G) provides: \u201cThe period of limitation shall not run during any time when the accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused departed this state or concealed the accused\u2019s identity or whereabouts is prima-facie evidence of the accused\u2019s purpose to avoid prosecution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-12\">{\u00b6 18} This case presents a question of statutory interpretation of the term \u201cprosecution\u201d as used in R.C. 2901.13(G). As we explained in <em>State v. Buehler, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 114, 2007-Ohio-1246, 863 N.E.2d 124, in construing statutes, \u201c \u2018our paramount concern is the legislative intent in enacting the statute.\u2019 <em>State ex rel. Steele v. Morrissey, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 355, 2004-Ohio-4960, 815 N.E.2d 1107, \u00b6 21. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>Furthermore, \u2018[i]n determining this intent, we first review the statutory language, reading words and phrases in context and construing them according to the rules of grammar and common usage.\u2019 Id.\u201d <em>Buehler </em>at \u00b6 29. Thus, as the court stated in <em>State v. Teamer </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 490, 491, 696 N.E.2d 1049, \u201c[w]e must give effect to the words of a statute and may not modify an unambiguous statute by deleting words used or inserting words not used.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">{\u00b6 19} As Bess argues, the word \u201cprosecution\u201d could refer to a particular prosecution, that is, \u201c[a] criminal proceeding in which an accused person is tried.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Ed.2004) 1258. If \u201cprosecution\u201d is defined this way, tolling occurs only when a person avoids prosecution for specific charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">{\u00b6 20} The word \u201cprosecution,\u201d however, could also refer to the more general process by which an accused is tried and punished for criminal activity. See <em>Thomas v. Peoria </em>(C.A.7, 2009), 580 F.3d 633, 638-639 (\u201c \u2018Prosecution\u2019 * * * just means law enforcement by public officers\u201d); Merriam-Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary (11th Ed.2003) (defining \u201cprosecution\u201d to mean \u201cthe act or process of prosecuting\u201d). If this more general definition of \u201cprosecution\u201d was intended by the General Assembly, then the statute encompasses all offenses committed by the accused and tolls the crimes\u2019 statute of limitations when an accused leaves the state or conceals his or her identity or whereabouts with the purpose of avoiding <em>being prosecuted </em>for any crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">{\u00b6 21} The context in which the word \u201cprosecution\u201d is used in R.C. 2901.13(G) reveals that the word refers to the more general process by which an accused is tried and punished for alleged criminal activity, not a specific proceeding against an accused, and the statute of limitations is tolled when an accused acts to purposely avoid being prosecuted for any offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">{\u00b6 22} While this is a question of first impression in our court, federal courts interpreting similar language in Section 1073, Title 18, U.S.Code, have defined the words \u201cto avoid prosecution\u201d to mean \u201c \u2018to avoid being prosecuted.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Frank </em>(C.A.3, 1988), 864 F.2d 992, 1007, quoting <em>United States v. Bando </em>(C.A.2, 1957), 244 F.2d 833, 843; see also <em>Lupino v. United States </em>(C.A.8, 1959), 268 F.2d 799, 801; <em>United States v. McKinney </em>(D.Md.1992) 785 F.Supp. 1214, 1218. These courts have explained that Section 1073, which criminalizes crossing state lines with the intent to avoid prosecution, does not require the existence of a pending prosecution, but rather \u201c[i]t is sufficient if the fleeing felon is \u2018subject to prosecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bando, </em>244 F.2d at 843. Cf. <em>State v. Gleason </em>(Iowa 1988), 431 N.W.2d 363, 364 (defining unlawful flight \u201cto avoid prosecution\u201d in an Iowa statute to mean flight \u201cwhich was to prevent even the occurrence of prosecution\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">{\u00b6 23} Notably, R.C. 2901.13(G) contains no language suggesting that its application should be limited only to those cases when the accused sought to avoid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>a particular prosecution. Nor is there language suggesting a limitation to only those prosecutions that had been commenced before the accused absconded or to those cases when the state can prove that the accused intended to avoid prosecution for a specific crime. The lack of any qualifying or limiting language reveals the legislature\u2019s intent to toll the statute of limitations with respect to <em>all </em>offenses during the time when an accused purposely avoids prosecution for any offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">{\u00b6 24} Moreover, the manifest purpose of R.C. 2901.13(G) is to prevent the accused from benefiting from the statute of limitations when he or she has purposely acted to avoid being prosecuted, thereby causing the state to fail to commence a timely prosecution. Importantly, it is the actions of the accused in avoiding prosecution, not the actions of the state in commencing a prosecution, that triggers the tolling of the statute of limitations. Thus, the General Assembly did not intend to limit tolling to only those offenses that authorities knew about at the time the accused absconded while allowing the statute of limitations to run on undiscovered crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">{\u00b6 25} Our construction of R.C. 2901.13(G) accords with the General Assembly\u2019s intent in enacting the statute of limitations in R.C. 2901.13(A). As we explained in <em>State v. Climaco, Climaco, Seminatore, Lefkowitz &amp; Garofoli Co., L.P.A. </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 582, 709 N.E.2d 1192, the purpose of a statute of limitations is \u201cto discourage inefficient or dilatory law enforcement rather than to give offenders the chance to avoid criminal responsibility for their conduct.\u201d Id. at 586, 709 N.E.2d 1192, citing <em>State v. Hensley </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 136,138, 571 N.E.2d 711. A statute of limitations \u201c \u2018protects] individuals from having to defend themselves against charges when the basic facts may have become obscured by the passage of time and to minimize the danger of official punishment because of acts in the far-distant past.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Toussie v. United States </em>(1970), 397 U.S. 112, 114-115, 90 S.Ct. 858, 25 L.Ed.2d 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">{\u00b6 26} These statutory purposes are not furthered, however, when the accused purposely avoids prosecution, because it is the conduct of the accused, not a lack of diligence on the part of the state, that causes the delay in the prosecution. Thus, an accused who purposefully avoids prosecution cannot complain of prejudice resulting from the failure of the state to promptly commence the prosecution or from the unavailability of evidence as a result of the passage of time. Just as the statute of limitations creates an incentive for the prompt investigation of suspected criminal activity, tolling of the limitations period during any time when the accused purposely avoids prosecution reduces the incentive for the accused to abscond from justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">{\u00b6 27} Federal caselaw construing Section 3290, Title 18, U.S.Code, the federal tolling statute, provides further support for our interpretation of R.C. 2901.13(G). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>We recognize that Section 3290, which provides that \u201c[n]o statute of limitations shall extend to any person fleeing from justice,\u201d is phrased differently from R.C. 2901.13(G). However, federal courts hold that Section 3290 tolls the federal statute of limitations when \u201cthe defendant concealed himself with the <em>intent to avoid </em>prosecution.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>United States v. Greever </em>(C.A.6, 1998), 134 F.3d 777, 780; see also <em>Streep v. United States </em>(1895), 160 U.S. 128, 133, 16 S.Ct. 244, 40 L.Ed. 365 (\u201cIn order to constitute a fleeing from justice, * * * [i]t is sufficient that there is a flight with the intention of avoiding being prosecuted, whether a prosecution has or has not been actually begun\u201d). Thus, because Section 3290 is substantively equivalent to R.C. 2901.13(G), federal caselaw analyzing Section 3290 provides persuasive authority in construing R.C. 2901.13(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">{\u00b6 28} Federal appellate courts have held that Section 3290 tolls the statute of limitations for all federal crimes during the time of a person\u2019s flight from justice, even if the person intended to avoid prosecution only on <em>unrelated </em>state or federal crimes. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals has explained that \u201cthe fact that appellee was fleeing prosecution from unrelated state crimes offers him no assistance in his attempt to take advantage of the federal statute of limitations. Appellee was fleeing justice \u2014 be it state or federal \u2014 and thereby triggered the tolling provision of \u00a7 3290; he cannot now have the privilege of the federal statute of limitations.\u201d <em>United States v. Morgan </em>(C.A.10, 1991), 922 F.2d 1495, 1499. See also <em>United States v. Hoffman </em>(C.A.6, 1997), 124 F.3d 200 (Table), 1997 WL 476513 (holding that the accused\u2019s flight to avoid prosecution on state child-abuse charges in California tolled the statute of limitations for a federal tax offense); <em>United States v. Rivera-Ventura </em>(C.A.2, 1995), 72 F.3d 277, 283 (\u201cwhen a defendant has been indicted by a federal grand jury in one district and is unaware of that indictment, his flight to avoid prosecution in a different federal district under an unrelated federal indictment of which he is aware tolls the running of the statute on the charges of which he is unaware\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">{\u00b6 29} Federal courts thus do not require a specific intent to avoid a particular prosecution for Section 3290 to toll the statute of limitations. Rather, as the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals stated in <em>United States v. Marshall </em>(C.A.7, 1988), 856 F.2d 896, 900, \u201c[t]he tolling statute reflects the congressional belief that where the defendant impedes the discovery and prosecution of his criminal conduct by \u2018fleeing from justice,\u2019 his right to avoid prosecution for distant offenses is diminished while the government\u2019s need for additional discovery time is strengthened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">{\u00b6 30} For these reasons, we hold that R.C. 2901.13(G) tolls the statute of limitations for <em>all </em>offenses committed by an accused during the time when the accused purposely avoids prosecution for any offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">{\u00b6 31} The legislature has mandated that the period of limitations <em>shall not run </em>during any time when the accused purposely avoids prosecution. The word \u201cprosecution\u201d means the process of bringing those who commit crimes to justice, and in the context of the statute, that definition is not limited to the crimes of which the authorities are aware or for which the accused has been indicted. In this case, if Bess committed the alleged crimes against Theresa\u2019s son, then he knew that when he fled, but his motivations in fleeing the jurisdiction are known only to him. The General Assembly, however, did not intend to require the state to prove the accused\u2019s specific intent in absconding, nor did it intend to toll the statute of limitations as to crimes known to the state but not toll it as to crimes unknown to the state. If we interpreted the statute otherwise, an accused would benefit from absconding from prosecution of crimes unknown to the state. This would be an illogical interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">{\u00b6 32} Thus, R.C. 2901.13(G) tolls the statute of limitations for <em>all </em>offenses committed by an accused during the time when the accused purposely avoids prosecution for any offense, regardless of whether an indictment has been returned or whether underlying criminal activity has been discovered. Because the court of appeals concluded that the statute of limitations had expired in this case notwithstanding Bess\u2019s conduct in avoiding prosecution, that judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b479-9\">Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"ASV\">Pfeifer and Lanzinger, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b479-10\">Brown, C.J., not participating.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b474-10\">.

Majority opinion at \u00b6 19. Yet in spite of the fact that this is a reasonable construction of the statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>the majority continues by adopting the more favorable position for the state\u2014 that is, the general fugitive-from-justice interpretation that applies to a federal statute, Section 1073, Title 18, U.S.Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">{\u00b6 35} In enacting Section 1073, Title 18, U.S.Code, Congress elected to provide a number of different instances in which an alleged offender is deemed to be a fugitive from justice and may be prosecuted for fleeing. The language used in the federal statute suggests that Congress wanted the statute to be interpreted broadly, which it since has been. See <em>United States v. Frank </em>(C.A.3, 1988), 864 F.2d 992,1007.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">{\u00b6 36} But R.C. 2901.13(G) tolls the statute of limitations when \u201cthe accused purposely avoids prosecution.\u201d The word \u201caccused\u201d implies that the person already has been implicated in a crime by someone. The mental state of \u201cpurposely\u201d is defined in R.C. 2901.22(A): \u201cA person acts purposely when it is his specific intention to cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to accomplish thereby, it is his specific intention to engage in conduct of that nature.\u201d The statute of limitations also explains when a \u201cprosecution\u201d begins: \u201cA prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or on the date a warrant, summons, citation, or other process is issued, whichever occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance of a warrant, summons, citation, or other process, unless reasonable diligence is exercised to execute the same.\u201d R.C. 2901.13(E). The tolling of the statute of limitations therefore begins when an alleged offender purposely flees the jurisdiction to avoid a particular indictment or information.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">{\u00b6 37} The language chosen by the General Assembly comports with the position advanced by the defense: tolling occurs when a person avoids prosecution for specific charges. Although a case may be, and has been, made for the state\u2019s alternative theory, I cannot subscribe to the idea that the limitations period is tolled for all crimes that an accused may have committed before the period that an accused avoids prosecution for a specific charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">{\u00b6 38} Bess was convicted of three counts of rape and two counts of gross sexual imposition as a result of his stepdaughter\u2019s accusations that were made in 1989. <em>State v. Bess, </em>8th Dist. No. 91560, 2009-Ohio-2032, 2009 WL 1156970. He purposely avoided that prosecution. When Bess left, there was no thought of an investigation into possible crimes against his stepson. The stepson had been interviewed and had denied even the possibility that his sister\u2019s accusations were true.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b481-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>William D.

The accused would need only know that an investigation is taking place or is likely to take place and that by leaving the jurisdiction, he or she is avoiding prosecution for that specific crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">{\u00b6 40} Bess\u2019s absence from Ohio never prevented or interfered with an investigation from proceeding on this matter, for there had been no accusation relating to crimes against his stepson. Bess could not have purposely avoided prosecution for alleged crimes that were unknown to authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">{\u00b6 41} A prosecution against a person based on evidence that is obtained almost 20 years after the alleged crime was committed is exactly the kind of prosecution the statute of limitations is designed to bar. <em>Toussie v. United States </em>(1970), 397 U.S. 112, 114-115, 90 S.Ct. 858, 25 L.Ed.2d 156 (a statute of limitations \u201cprotects] individuals from having to defend themselves against charges when the basic facts may have become obscured by the passage of time\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">{\u00b6 42} R.C. 2901.13(G) cannot toll the statute of limitations for a prosecution that has not yet been commenced against an accused. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b481-9\">Pfeifer, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
