The court of appeals affirmed Arnold\u2019s conviction, holding that Marshall did not act as an agent of the police when she questioned M.A. and that M.A.\u2019s statements during the interview were nontestimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-15\">{\u00b6 2} In interviewing M.A. at the CCFA, Marshall occupied dual capacities: she was both a forensic interviewer collecting information for use by the police and a medical interviewer eliciting information necessary for diagnosis and treatment. We hold that statements made to interviewers at child-advocacy centers that are made for medical diagnosis and treatment are nontestimonial and are admissible without offending the Confrontation Clause. Thus, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals to the extent that M.A.\u2019s statements to Marshall for the purpose of medical treatment and diagnosis were properly admitted. We further hold that statements made to interviewers at child-advocacy centers that serve primarily a forensic or investigative purpose are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>testimonial and are inadmissible pursuant to the Confrontation Clause. We agree with Arnold that the trial court erred in admitting the forensic statements made by M.A. to Marshall and reverse the court of appeals insofar as it held that these forensic statements were admissible. However, because the court of appeals did not consider whether the admission of M.A.\u2019s forensic statement to Marshall was harmless, we remand this case to the court of appeals to consider this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Relevant Background</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">{\u00b6 3} In December 2005, Arnold and Wendy Otto lived together in Hilliard, Ohio, with their two young children. Otto testified that upon awakening one night, she discovered that Arnold and their four-year-old daughter, M.A., were locked in a bedroom. Otto demanded that Arnold unlock the door, and when he did, she observed that his boxer shorts were halfway off. Otto also observed that M.A.\u2019s underwear was around her ankles. She suspected sexual abuse, demanded that Arnold leave the premises, and called 9-1-1. Arnold left immediately. By the time paramedics arrived, many police officers were present. M.A. told firefighter-paramedic Charles Fritz that she had been touched in her private area.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">{\u00b6 4} Paramedics took Otto and M.A. to Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital, where evidence for a rape kit was collected. While at the hospital, Otto was advised to take M.A. to the CCFA the next day. The record is unclear whether this advice came from the police, paramedics, hospital personnel, or some other source. At some point that night, M.A. was released.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">{\u00b6 5} The next morning, Otto took M.A. to the CCFA. The CCFA is part of Children\u2019s Hospital and is located across the street from the main hospital. At the CCFA, Marshall, a Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital employee, interviewed M.A. M.A.\u2019s responses to Marshall\u2019s questions indicated that she had been sexually abused. This interview is at the heart of Arnold\u2019s Confrontation Clause claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">{\u00b6 6} The interview yielded a variety of relevant information. For example, M.A. stated that Arnold\u2019s \u201cpee-pee\u201d went inside her \u201cpee-pee\u201d and that Arnold\u2019s mouth touched her \u201cpee-pee.\u201d These statements were necessary for M.A.\u2019s medical evaluation and treatment. But M.A. also answered questions that related to the ongoing investigation. For example, in response to Marshall\u2019s questions, M.A. stated that Arnold closed and locked the bedroom door before raping her and that Arnold removed her underwear.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">{\u00b6 7} After the interview with Marshall, M.A. was physically examined by a pediatric nurse practitioner, Gail Horner, a hospital employee who worked in the CCFA. Horner found two abrasions to M.A.\u2019s hymen, which she concluded had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>been caused by acute trauma, likely from penetration, within the previous 24 to 72 hours. Horner testified that the abrasions were \u201cdiagnostic\u201d of sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">{\u00b6 8} Based on this and other information, including Otto\u2019s testimony, Arnold was indicted on two counts of rape in violation of R.C. 2907.02. The first count charged rape by vaginal intercourse; the second charged rape by cunnilingus.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">{\u00b6 9} At trial, the court determined that M.A. was unavailable to testify. After watching the DVD recording of M.A.\u2019s interview with Marshall, the court determined that the statements had been made for the purpose of medical diagnosis and were admissible hearsay under Evid.R. 803(4). The court also determined that the statements were not barred by the Confrontation Clause. Accordingly, the DVD was played for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">{\u00b6 10} The jury found Arnold guilty of rape by vaginal intercourse, but not guilty of rape by cunnilingus. R.C. 2907.02. Arnold was sentenced to life in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">{\u00b6 11} On appeal, the Tenth District affirmed Arnold\u2019s conviction. <em>State v. Arnold, </em>Franklin App. No. 07AP-789, 2008-Ohio-3471, 2008 WL 2698885. We accepted Arnold\u2019s discretionary appeal to determine whether, in a criminal prosecution, the out-of-court statements made by a child to an interviewer employed by a child-advocacy center violates the right to confront witnesses provided by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 10, Article I of the Ohio Constitution. <em>State v. Arnold, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 1452, 2008-Ohio-6813, 898 N.E.2d 967.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">\n<em>Confrontation Clause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause provides that, \u2018[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right * * * to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u2019 We have held that this bedrock procedural guarantee applies to both federal and state prosecutions. <em>Pointer v. Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400, 406, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 13 L.Ed.2d 923 (1965).\u201d <em>Crawford v. Washington </em>(2004), 541 U.S. 36, 42,124 S.Ct. 1354,158 L.Ed.2d 177. \u201cSection 10, Article I [of the Ohio Constitution] provides no greater right of confrontation than the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>State v. Self </em>(1990), 56 Ohio St.3d 73, 79, 564 N.E.2d 446.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">{\u00b6 13} In <em>Crawford, </em>the Supreme Court of the United States considered whether the introduction of a hearsay statement admissible under state law violated a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him. The court held that out-of-court statements violate the Sixth Amendment when they are testimonial and the defendant has had no opportunity to cross-examine the declarant. 541 U.S. at 68,124 S.Ct. 1354,158 L.Ed.2d 177. See also <em>State v. Siler, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 39, 2007-Ohio-5637, 876 N.E.2d 534, \u00b6 21-26. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>court did not comprehensively define \u201ctestimonial\u201d but stated that the core class of testimonial statements includes statements \u201c \u2018that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 52, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177, quoting Brief of Amicus Curiae National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers 3. Accord <em>State v. Stahl, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 186, 2006-Ohio-5482, 855 N.E.2d 834, paragraph one of the syllabus. The court emphasized that the objective-witness test was but one of many possible ways to determine whether a statement is testimonial, and it expressly stated, \u201cWe leave for another day any effort to spell out a comprehensive definition of \u2018testimonial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crawford, 541 </em>U.S. at 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">{\u00b6 14} Two years later, in <em>Davis v. Washington </em>(2006), 547 U.S. 813, 821, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224, the court considered whether a caller\u2019s responses to a dispatcher\u2019s interrogation during a 9-1-1 telephone conversation were testimonial when the caller failed to appear to testify at trial. The court stated (1) that the statements described the events as they were happening, as opposed to explaining events that had happened in the past, (2) that any reasonable listener would conclude that the statements were made in the face of an ongoing emergency, (3) that the interrogation was objectively necessary to resolve the ongoing emergency, and (4) that the interrogation was informal because it was conducted over the phone and the answers were provided frantically while in an unsafe environment. Id. at 827. The court concluded that the circumstances surrounding the interrogation \u201cobjectively indicate [that] its primary purpose was to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency. [The caller] simply was not acting as a <em>witness; </em>she was not <em>testifying.\u201d </em>(Emphasis sic.) Id. at <em>828. </em>Accordingly, the court concluded that the caller\u2019s hearsay statements were not testimonial and, therefore, that they were not barred by the Sixth Amendment. Id. at 829.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">{\u00b6 15} In <em>Davis, </em>the court also considered a second case in which a domestic-violence complainant did not appear at trial. Id. at 819-820. The police officer who interviewed the victim at the scene of the incident and who witnessed her complete and sign an affidavit concerning the abuse testified at trial in order to authenticate the affidavit. Id. at 820. The court determined (1) that the interrogation sought to determine what had happened, not what was happening, (2) that there was no ongoing emergency, (3) that the interrogation was not needed to resolve an emergency, and (4) that the interrogation was \u201cformal enough\u201d that it was conducted in a room separate from the complainant\u2019s husband. Id. at 830. The court concluded that \u201c[i]t is entirely clear from the circumstances that the interrogation was part of an investigation into possibly criminal past conduct \u2014 as, indeed, the testifying officer expressly acknowledged.\u201d Id. at 829. Accordingly, the court concluded that the hearsay evidence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>testimonial and, therefore, that it was barred by the Sixth Amendment. Id. at 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">{\u00b6 16} The court held that \u201c[statements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency. They are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\u201d Id. at 822. Accord <em>Siler, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 39, 2007-Ohio-5637, 876 N.E.2d 534, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\"><em>Stahl, Muttart, </em>and <em>Siler</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">{\u00b6 17} In <em>Stahl, </em>this court considered whether hearsay statements by a rape victim to a nurse practitioner during a medical examination at a hospital DOVE<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> unit were admissible when the victim was not available to testify at trial. <em>Stahl, 111 </em>Ohio St.3d 186, 2006-Ohio-5482, 855 N.E.2d 834, at \u00b6 1. The defendant argued that the statements violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses. Id. at \u00b6 1, 9. This court distinguished <em>Davis, </em>stating: \u201cThey involve statements made to law-enforcement officers, while the statement at issue here covers one made to a medical professional at a medical facility for the <em>primary </em>purpose of receiving proper medical treatment and not investigating past events related to criminal prosecution.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id. at \u00b6 25. We concluded that the primary purpose of the examination was to receive medical treatment, not to investigate past events, applied the objective-witness test outlined in <em>Crawford, </em>and held that the challenged statements were nontestimonial. Id. at \u00b6 47, 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">{\u00b6 18} In <em>State v. Muttart, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 5, 2007-Ohio-5267, 875 N.E.2d 944, a child victim of sexual abuse was interviewed by a social worker at a child-advocacy center. Id., \u00b6 14-15. As in the case before us now, the social worker interviewed the child before she was examined by a doctor. Id., \u00b6 15. During the interview, the child disclosed to the social worker that her father had put his penis in her mouth and had \u201c \u2018put his pee-pee in her pee-pee.\u2019 \u201d Id., \u00b6 16. The child also disclosed that similar conduct had happened \u201c \u2018a whole bunch of times.\u2019 \u201d Id. We held that the child\u2019s statements were nontestimonial because \u201c[s]tatements made to medical personnel for purposes of diagnosis or treatment are not inadmissible under <em>Crawford.\u201d </em>Id., \u00b6 63. This is true because statements for medical diagnosis and treatment \u201care not even remotely related to the evils that the Confrontation Clause was designed to avoid.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>{\u00b6 19} In <em>Siler, </em>we considered whether statements made by a child to a sheriffs deputy in the course of a police interrogation were testimonial. <em>Siler, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 39, 2007-Ohio-5637, 876 N.E.2d 534, at \u00b6 2. We concluded that \u201cthe statements made to the deputy sheriff were testimonial because the circumstances objectively indicate that no ongoing emergency existed and that the primary purpose of the police interrogation was to establish past events potentially relevant to a later criminal prosecution.\u201d Id. We held that courts in Ohio should apply the primary-purpose test set forth in <em>Davis </em>to determine \u201cwhether a child declarant\u2019s statement made in the course of police interrogation is testimonial or nontestimonial.\u201d Id. at paragraph one of the syllabus, citing <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 821-822, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">\n<em>Other State Supreme Comi Decisions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">{\u00b6 20} Since <em>Crawford, </em>many state supreme courts have considered whether statements made by children during interviews at child-advocacy centers, or their functional equivalent, are testimonial and whether statements by child victims of sexual abuse for medical diagnosis and treatment are testimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">{\u00b6 21} We recognize that a number of those decisions held that statements by child-sexual-abuse victims at child-advocacy centers or their functional equivalent are testimonial and, therefore, inadmissible pursuant to the Confrontation Clause and <em>Crawford </em>when the defendant has no opportunity to cross-examine the victim at trial. See, e.g., <em>State v. Contreras </em>(Fla.2008), 979 So.2d 896; <em>State v. Hooper </em>(2007), 145 Idaho 139, 176 P.3d 911; <em>In re Rolandis G. </em>(2008), 232 Ill.2d 13, 327 Ill.Dec. 479, 902 N.E.2d 600; <em>State v. Bentley </em>(Iowa 2007), 739 N.W.2d 296; <em>State v. Henderson </em>(2007), 284 Kan. 267, 160 P.3d 776; <em>State v. Snowden </em>(2005), 385 Md. 64, 867 A.2d 314; <em>State v. Justus </em>(Mo.2006), 205 S.W.3d 872; <em>State v. Blue, </em>2006 ND 134, 717 N.W.2d 558. But in each of these cases, the interviews were conducted solely for forensic purposes. The situation we are presented with in this case is distinct from those considered in the above-cited cases. Here we are asked to determine whether statements that contain distinct forensic and medical diagnostic information. and were made to a social worker during one interview implicate the Confrontation Clause. For example, in <em>Contreras, </em>the Florida Supreme Court held that a statement taken by the coordinator of a \u201cchild protection team\u201d (\u201cCPT\u201d) was testimonial. Id. at 905. The interview was conducted and videotaped at a shelter for victims of domestic violence, and a police officer was connected electronically to the CPT coordinator in order to suggest questions. Id. There was no evidence that the child received medical treatment based on the interview. The court held that \u201cthe primary, if not the sole, purpose of the CPT interview was to investigate whether the crime of child sexual abuse had occurred, and to establish facts potentially relevant to a later criminal prosecution.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>{\u00b6 22} Similarly, the Illinois Supreme Court excluded statements made in a forensic interview when there was \u201cabsolutely no indication that * * * [the] interview * * * was conducted, to a substantial degree, for treatment rather than investigative purposes.\u201d <em>In re Rolandis G., </em>232 Ill.2d at 33, 327 Ill.Dec. 479, 902 N.E.2d 600. In that case, after stating that an older child forced him to perform fellatio, a six-year-old was taken to a child-advocacy center and was interviewed by a child advocate. Id. at 19. The interview was video recorded and observed by a detective through a one-way mirror. Id. As with <em>Contreras, </em>there was no indication that the child received a medical evaluation or treatment based on the interview. The Illinois Supreme Court concluded that \u201cthe interview took place at the behest of the police so that a more detailed account of the alleged sexual abuse could be obtained by a trained interviewer and memorialized on videotape\u201d and held that the child\u2019s statements were testimonial. Id. at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">{\u00b6 23} In <em>Hooper, </em>the Idaho Supreme Court excluded statements in a video-recorded forensic interview taken at a Sexual Trauma Abuse Response Center (\u201cSTAR\u201d). 145 Idaho at 141,176 P.3d 911. In that case, a child was taken to the STAR center after her mother discovered the child and her father locked in the bathroom and suspected sexual abuse. Id. at 140. Upon arrival at the STAR center, the child met with a doctor and the doctor conducted a sexual-abuse examination. Id. at 141. After the medical examination, a forensic interviewer conducted a video-recorded interview with the child, which a detective observed via a closed-circuit system. Id. Because the interview occurred after the child met with and was examined by the physician, the subsequent interview served a forensic, not a medical or treatment-oriented, purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">{\u00b6 24} In the same vein, the Kansas Supreme Court held that a child\u2019s statements during an interview conducted by a detective and a social worker, both members of the Exploited and Missing Children Unit, were testimonial. <em>Henderson, </em>284 Kan. at 294, 160 P.3d 776. In <em>Henderson, </em>a mother took her three-year-old daughter to a medical clinic after noticing discharge from the child\u2019s vagina and after the child complained that her \u201cpotty place\u201d hurt. Id. at 269. Test results revealed that the child had gonorrhea. Id. After learning about the test results, the detective and social worker interviewed the child, who disclosed that her mother\u2019s boyfriend had \u201ctouched her \u2018potty in a bad way.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 270. This interview was video and audio recorded. Id. Again, there is no indication that the child received additional medical treatment based on the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">{\u00b6 25} These cases that stand for the proposition that the admission of statements obtained during interviews at CACs or their functional equivalents result in violations of the Confrontation Clause when the declarant is unavailable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>at trial arise from scenarios in which the statements at issue were solely for forensic purposes, rather than for ameliorative or therapeutic ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">{\u00b6 26} In the latter category, our sister courts hold that statements made by child-sexual-abuse victims for the purpose of medical diagnosis and treatment are not testimonial and, therefore, do not implicate the Confrontation Clause even if they are used subsequently by the state in a prosecution. <em>Seely v. State </em>(2008), 373 Ark. 141, 282 S.W.3d 778 (holding that a child\u2019s statements about abuse to a social worker at a children\u2019s hospital before the child was examined by a doctor were nontestimonial); <em>State v. Arroyo </em>(2007), 284 Conn. 597, 935 A.2d 975 (holding that statements made to a social worker were nontestimonial because the primary purpose of the interview was to provide medical assistance to the child); <em>State v. Krasky </em>(Minn.2007), 736 N.W.2d 636 (holding that a child\u2019s statements to a nurse alleging sexual abuse were nontestimonial because the nurse\u2019s primary purpose was to assess and protect the child\u2019s health and welfare); <em>State v. Spencer, </em>339 Mont. 227, 2007 MT 245, 169 P.3d 384 (holding that statements to a counselor regarding sexual abuse were nontestimonial); <em>People v. Vigil </em>(Colo. 2006), 127 P.3d 916 (holding that responses to questions by a doctor as part of a sexual-assault examination were nontestimonial); <em>Commonwealth v. DeOliveira </em>(2006), 447 Mass. 56, 849 N.E.2d 218 (holding that statements to a physician were made for the purposes of medical evaluation and treatment and were not testimonial); <em>Hobgood v. State </em>(Miss.2006), 926 So.2d 847 (holding that a child\u2019s description of sexual abuse to his doctor was not given for the purpose of prosecuting the accused and was not testimonial); <em>State v. Vaught </em>(2004), 268 Neb. 316, 682 N.W.2d 284 (holding that a child\u2019s statements to an emergency-room physician identifying the perpetrator of sexual assault were nontestimonial).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">{\u00b6 27} With this background in mind, we turn to whether M.A.\u2019s statements to Marshall were testimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">{\u00b6 28} Pursuant to <em>Stahl, Muttart, </em>and <em>Siler, </em>to determine whether M.A.\u2019s statements to Marshall were testimonial, we must identify the primary purpose of the statements. Statements made for the purpose of medical diagnosis and treatment are nontestimonial. <em>Muttart, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 5, 2007-Ohio-5267, 875 N.E.2d 944, \u00b6 63. However, statements made to agents of the police for the primary purpose of forensic investigation are testimonial. <em>Siler, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 39, 2007-Ohio-5637, 876 N.E.2d 534, at \u00b6 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">\n<em>Child-Advocacy Centers and the CCFA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">{\u00b6 29} The objective of a child-advocacy center like the CCFA is neither exclusively medical diagnosis and treatment nor solely forensic investigation. \u201c \u2018The purpose of a Children\u2019s Advocacy Center is to provide a comprehensive, culturally competent, multidisciplinary response to allegations of child abuse in a dedicated, child friendly setting.\u2019 \u201d Nancy Chandler, Children\u2019s Advocacy Cen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>ters: Making a Difference One Child at a Time (2006), 28 Hamline J.Pub.L. &amp; Policy 315, quoting National Children\u2019s Alliance, Accreditation Guidelines for Children\u2019s Advocacy Centers (2004) 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cPrior to the development of the Children\u2019s Advocacy Center model, \u2018traditional child abuse investigations often subject(ed) the child to multiple interviews.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 332, quoting Lisa Snell, Child Advocacy Centers: One Stop on the Road to Performance-Based Child Protection (June 2003) 1.

These interdisciplinary teams often include law-enforcement professionals, prosecutors, medical and mental-health personnel, and child advocates. Id. at 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">{\u00b6 31} At the CCFA, Marshall, a social worker employed by Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital, interviews children who are suspected victims of physical or sexual abuse. The purpose of the interview is to gather as much information as possible. The interview is both recorded on a DVD and transmitted to another room via closed-circuit television. Typically, a nurse practitioner or doctor, a children\u2019s services caseworker, and a law-enforcement representative watch the interview from a separate room. Marshall does not inform the child that the team members are watching the interview, but does tell him or her that he or she will be examined by a doctor or nurse after the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">{\u00b6 32} After Marshall interviews the child, she meets with the doctor or nurse practitioner who will perform the medical examination to review the child\u2019s statements. The nurse or doctor conducts the appropriate medical examination based on the child\u2019s statements during the interview. The nurse or doctor relies on information obtained during Marshall\u2019s interview to determine what examination and tests are needed. For example, information regarding the identity of the perpetrator, the age of the perpetrator, the type of abuse alleged, and the time frame of the abuse allows the doctor or nurse to determine whether to test the child for sexually transmitted infections.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">\n<em>The Interviewer\u2019s Dual Capacity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">{\u00b6 33} Child-advocacy centers are unique. Multidisciplinary teams cooperate so that the child is interviewed only once and will not have to retell the story multiple times. Most members of the team retain their autonomy. Neither police officers nor medical personnel become agents of the other. However, to ensure that the child victim goes through only one interview, the interviewer must elicit as much information from the child as possible in a single interview <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>and must gather the information needed by each team member. Thus, the interview serves dual purposes: (1) to gather forensic information to investigate and potentially prosecute a defendant for the offense and (2) to elicit information necessary for medical diagnosis and treatment of the victim. The interviewer acts as an agent of each member of the multidisciplinary team.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">{\u00b6 34} Certainly, some of the statements that M.A. made to Marshall primarily served a forensic or investigative purpose. Those statements include M.A.\u2019s assertion that Arnold shut and locked the bedroom door before raping her; her descriptions of where her mother and brother were while she was in the bedroom with Arnold, of Arnold\u2019s boxer shorts, of him removing them, and of what Arnold\u2019s \u201cpee-pee\u201d looked like; and her statement that Arnold removed her underwear. These statements likely were not necessary for medical diagnosis or treatment. Rather, they related primarily to the state\u2019s investigation. Marshall effectively acted as an agent of the police for the purpose of obtaining these statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">{\u00b6 35} Because Marshall acted as an agent of the police in obtaining these statements, pursuant to <em>Davis </em>and <em>Siler, </em>we must employ the primary-purpose test to determine whether the primary purpose of the interrogation was \u201c \u2018to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.\u2019 \u201d <em>Siler, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 39, 2007-Ohio-5637, 876 N.E.2d 534, at paragraph one of the syllabus, quoting <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 822, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224. We hold that it was not. First, the statements involved a description of past events. The alleged abuse occurred the previous evening, and the questioning specifically attempted to obtain a description of the abuse. Second, a reasonable observer would not perceive an ongoing emergency at the time of questioning. The patient had been discharged from the hospital the previous evening. At oral argument, counsel conceded that no medical emergency existed at the time of Marshall\u2019s interview. Third, the questioning was not objectively necessary to resolve an emergency because there was no ongoing emergency. Finally, the interview was rather formal, more akin to the videotaped, planned interview of <em>Crawford </em>than to the frantic 9-1-1 call or the sequestered but spur-of-the-moment interview recounted in <em>Davis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">{\u00b6 36} The primary purpose of that portion of the interview was not to meet an ongoing emergency but, rather, to further the state\u2019s forensic investigation. Thus, these statements were testimonial in nature and their admission without a prior opportunity for cross-examination is prohibited by the Confrontation Clause. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 68,124 S.Ct. 1354,158 L.Ed.2d 177.</p>\n<p id=\"AOn\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>2</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">{\u00b6 37} Although the statements obtained during Marshall\u2019s interview of M.A. that related primarily to the state\u2019s forensic investigation are testimonial and thus inadmissible pursuant to <em>Crawford, </em>other statements provided information that was necessary to diagnose and medically treat M.A. The history obtained during the interview is important for the doctor or nurse practitioner to make an accurate diagnosis and to determine what evaluation and treatment are necessary. For example, the nurse practitioner conducts a \u201chead to toe\u201d examination of all children, but only examines the genital area of patients who disclose sexual abuse. That portion of the exam is to identify any trauma or injury sustained during the alleged abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">{\u00b6 38} M.A.\u2019s statements that described the acts that Arnold performed, including that Arnold touched her \u201cpee-pee,\u201d that Arnold\u2019s \u201cpee-pee\u201d went inside her \u201cpee-pee,\u201d that Arnold\u2019s \u201cpee-pee\u201d touched her \u201cbutt,\u201d that Arnold\u2019s hand touched her \u201cpee-pee,\u201d and that Arnold\u2019s mouth touched her \u201cpee-pee\u201d were thus necessary for the proper medical diagnosis and treatment of M.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">{\u00b6 39} In his dissent, Justice Pfeifer states that he is troubled by our conclusion that these statements were medically necessary because M.A. had been examined at the hospital on the night of the rape. However, although M.A. was taken to the hospital on the night of the rape, the record establishes only that a rape-kit examination was performed, not that she was examined for medical diagnosis or treated. M.A. was referred to the CCFA for further medical examination and treatment. Justice Pfeifer also contends that the nurse practitioner who examined M.A. after the interview would have asked all medically relevant questions during the examination. This is not true. The history obtained during Marshall\u2019s interview was necessary for the nurse practitioner to make an accurate diagnosis and to determine what treatment was necessary. Horner, the nurse practitioner who examined M.A., testified that the \u201cforensic interview guides my exam in that it lets me know whether or not I need to test the child for sexually transmitted infection. For instance, if a child says that a penis touched their vagina, it means to me that I need to test to make sure that child didn\u2019t get a sexually transmitted infection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">{\u00b6 40} In eliciting these medically necessary statements, Marshall acted as an agent of the nurse practitioner who examined M.A., not of the investigating police officers. Because Marshall did not act as an agent of the police in obtaining these statements, they are not inadmissible pursuant to <em>Davis. Stahl, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 186, 2006-Ohio-5482, 855 N.E.2d 834, at \u00b6 25, 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">{\u00b6 41} Statements made for medical diagnosis and treatment are nontestimonial. <em>Muttart, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 5, 2007-Ohio-5267, 875 N.E.2d 944, \u00b6 63. There is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>basis in the law for concluding that Marshall\u2019s dual capacity renders statements made by M.A. for the purpose of medical diagnosis and treatment inadmissible pursuant to the Confrontation Clause. Indeed, in <em>Davis, </em>the United States Supreme Court acknowledged that the same interview or interrogation might produce both testimonial and nontestimonial statements. <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 828-829, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224. As the court stated in <em>Davis, </em>\u201cThis presents no great problem.\u201d Id. at 829. \u201c[TJrial courts will recognize the point at which, for Sixth Amendment purposes, statements in response to interrogations become testimonial. Through <em>in limine </em>procedure, they should redact or exclude the portions of any statement that have become testimonial, as they do, for example, with unduly prejudicial portions of otherwise admissible evidence.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">{\u00b6 42} Both dissents criticize our reliance on <em>Davis </em>in support of our conclusion that although M.A.\u2019s forensic statements to Marshall were testimonial, her statements for the purpose of medical diagnosis and treatment were properly admitted. First, Justice Pfeifer argues that pursuant to <em>Davis, </em>when evidence includes testimonial and nontestimonial statements, the testimonial statements must be redacted or excluded to avoid violating the defendant\u2019s right to confront witnesses against him. We agree that M.A.\u2019s testimonial statements should have been excluded, and we remand the case to the court of appeals to determine whether the admission of M.A.\u2019s testimonial statements was harmless error. Next, both dissents argue that our reliance on <em>Davis </em>is erroneous because we examine the statements on a question-by-question basis and the testimonial and nontestimonial statements were interspersed, rather than being obtained in separate and distinct portions of the interview. Justice Pfeifer argues that this will make it difficult to distinguish the statements that should be redacted from those that may be properly admitted. However, our guiding consideration is the purpose for which the statements are made, not the order in which they are obtained. Finally, both dissents note that unlike in <em>Davis, </em>there was no ongoing emergency in this case and, therefore, there was no occasion for the questioning in this case to evolve from nontestimonial to testimonial. Our decision is not based on the evolution of M.A.\u2019s statements, but on the fact that the statements were made for different purposes. The fact that <em>Davis </em>involved an evolution from nontestimonial to testimonial statements does not preclude its application in instances in which an interview simultaneously serves dual purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">{\u00b6 43} Further, the fact that police officers watched the interview and that it was recorded does not change the fact that the statements were necessary for M.A.\u2019s medical diagnosis and treatment. Similarly, the fact that information gathered for medical purposes is subsequently used by the state does not change the fact that the statements were made for medical diagnosis and treatment. <em>Muttart, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 5, 2007-Ohio-5267, 875 N.E.2d 944, \u00b6 62. M.A.\u2019s state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>ments that were necessary for medical diagnosis and treatment were nontestimo-nial and were properly admitted without violating Arnold\u2019s Confrontation Clause rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">{\u00b6 44} When Marshall interviewed M.A. at the CCFA, she occupied dual capacities: she was both a forensic interviewer collecting information for use by the police and a medical interviewer eliciting information necessary for diagnosis and treatment. We hold that statements made to interviewers at child-advocacy centers that are made for medical diagnosis and treatment are nontestimonial and are admissible without offending the Confrontation Clause. Thus, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals to the extent that M.A.\u2019s statements to Marshall for the purpose of medical treatment and diagnosis were properly admitted. We further hold that statements made to interviewers at child-advocacy centers that serve primarily a forensic or investigative purpose are testimonial and are inadmissible pursuant to the Confrontation Clause when the declarant is unavailable for cross-examination at trial. We agree with Arnold that the trial court erred in admitting the forensic statements made by M.A. to Marshall and reverse the court of appeal\u2019s judgment insofar as it held that these forensic statements were admissible. However, because the court of appeals did not consider whether the admission of M.A.\u2019s forensic statement to Marshall was harmless, see <em>State v. Conway, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 214, 2006-Ohio-791, 842 N.E.2d 996, we remand the case to the court of appeals to consider this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b425-9\">Lundberg Stratton, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"axr-dedup-0\">Pfeifer and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b425-10\">Brown, C.

I conclude that a forensic interview cannot be both testimonial and nontestimonial without violating a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-13\">{\u00b6 46} The majority opinion ably explains the law of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause as elucidated by various federal and Ohio cases. I will not redescribe these cases. The majority opinion also fairly characterizes the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>law from other states that it summarizes in the section titled \u201cOther State Supreme Court Decisions.\u201d I dissent, not based on the majority opinion\u2019s understanding of the law, but because of the way the majority opinion applies the law to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">{\u00b6 47} The majority opinion acknowledges that many of the questions asked by the forensic interviewer, Kerri Marshall, were asked \u201cto gather forensic information\u201d and are, therefore, testimonial. In <em>Davis v. Washington </em>(2006), 547 U.S. 813, 828-829, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224, the court held that statements of a witness who is unavailable for cross-examination should be redacted or excluded to avoid violating the defendant\u2019s right to confront witnesses against him. The testimonial statements in this case were not redacted or excluded. Furthermore, the testimonial statements in this case are different from those discussed in <em>Davis. </em>In <em>Davis, </em>the testimonial statements were made after a series of nontestimonial statements had concluded. Id. The interrogator in that case had elicited statements to assist the police in meeting an ongoing emergency: those statements were nontestimonial, and their admission as evidence was permissible. Id. After eliciting the initial statements, the interrogator asked a series of questions attempting to elicit information about the alleged crime. Id. at 828. The court found \u201cno great problem\u201d with this approach because the nontestimonial statements were separate and distinct from the testimonial statements. Id. at 829. The court stated that questioning could evolve from addressing an emergency to eliciting forensic information. Id. at 828. According to the Supreme Court, testimonial statements may not be introduced as evidence and if they are part of a transcript or other document, they must redacted. Id. at 829.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">{\u00b6 48} The majority opinion makes creative use of the <em>Davis </em>opinion. First, it concludes that the concept of nontestimonial statements evolving into testimonial statements applies when an interrogator has a dual purpose. <em>Davis </em>does not support this conclusion. The interrogator in <em>Davis </em>did not have dual purposes: she had two separate purposes. She completed the questions regarding the ongoing emergency and then moved on to elicit information that could be used as evidence. Marshall\u2019s questions, which elicited, in the opinion of the majority, both testimonial and nontestimonial statements, were interspersed, rendering it difficult to distinguish those that should be redacted from those that need not be redacted. Second, in this case there was no ongoing emergency. The emergency occurred the night before, so there was no occasion for the questioning to evolve from eliciting nontestimonial statements to eliciting testimonial ones. Third, the testimonial statements in this case, which the majority opinion concedes exist, were not redacted. The majority opinion relies on <em>Davis, </em>but only to the extent that <em>Davis </em>suits its purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>{\u00b6 49} Although remanding the cause to enable the court of appeals to determine whether the error is harmless is better than finding it harmless, we should do neither. It is clear from the record that the error in this case was not harmless. In <em>State v. Conway, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 214, 2006-Ohio-791, 842 N.E.2d 996, \u00b6 78, we stated that the determination of whether a constitutional error is harmless \u201cis not simply an inquiry into the sufficiency of the remaining evidence. Instead, the question is whether there is a reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction.\u201d It is patently obvious that the testimonial statements in this case \u201cmight have contributed to the conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">{\u00b6 50} Another troubling aspect of the majority opinion is its implicit conclusion that Marshall\u2019s questions were medically necessary. Although I concede that they may have been helpful, they were not necessary. First, a doctor had examined M.A. the previous evening. That doctor would have done and asked everything necessary to treat M.A. at that time. See <em>State v. Hooper </em>(2007), 145 Idaho 139, 141, 176 P.3d 911, about which the majority opinion states, \u201cBecause the interview occurred after the child met with and was examined by the physician, the subsequent interview served a forensic, not a medical or treatment-oriented, purpose.\u201d Majority opinion at \u00b6 23. Second, as discussed below, a nurse practitioner examined M.A. after Marshall\u2019s questioning. She would have asked all medically relevant questions during her examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">{\u00b6 51} The testimonial statements in this case were neither redacted nor harmless. Nevertheless, the majority opinion concludes that the testimonial statements do not violate the defendant\u2019s right to confront witnesses. I will now explain why I believe that all of the statements elicited by Marshall were testimonial and, therefore, improperly admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Marshall\u2019s Interview with M.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">{\u00b6 52} Kerri Marshall is a licensed social worker employed by CCFA as a medical forensic interviewer. Marshall described her job duties as interviewing children who are alleged to be victims of sexual or physical abuse. She testified that law-enforcement personnel customarily observe the interviews that she conducts and that the children are not aware that they are being observed. Marshall\u2019s interview with M.A. was contemporaneously broadcast to another room over closed-circuit television, where it was viewed by several people, including a police detective. It was also recorded on a DVD.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">{\u00b6 53} During her interview with M.A., Marshall asked many questions about the events of the previous evening. Some of the questions were not relevant to an ongoing medical emergency or to medical treatment. For example, Marshall asked M.A., \u201cHow did your underwear get off?\u201d \u201cDid daddy\u2019s pee-pee touch your pee-pee?\u201d and \u201cWere you laying down or sitting up when daddy played pee-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>pees with you?\u201d Marshall subsequently prepared a report of the interview, entitled \u201cMedical Forensic Interview Summary.\u201d In this report, Marshall noted that Arnold \u201cfled the home by stealing [Otto\u2019s] purse and her car\u201d after Otto confronted him. Marshall recommended that M.A. be \u201cprotected from any contact with alleged perpetrator as this investigation continues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Statement made in the course of a police interrogation</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">{\u00b6 54} The issue in this case, as it was in <em>Stahl </em>and <em>Siler, </em>is to determine whether the hearsay statements that were offered by the prosecution and that the defendant argued violated his right under the Sixth Amendment to confront a witness are testimonial. A threshold question, however, is whether the statements were made in the course of a police interrogation. See <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 822, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224; <em>Siler, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 39, 2007-Ohio-5637, 876 N.E.2d 534, at \u00b6 30-31. What constitutes \u201cpolice interrogation\u201d for purposes of Confrontation Clause analysis has not been addressed by the United States Supreme Court. See <em>Davis </em>at 823, fn. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">{\u00b6 55} It is, of course, plainly obvious that a police officer did not conduct the interrogation in this case; social worker Kerri Marshall conducted the interrogation. The question becomes: was Marshall an agent of law enforcement when she conducted the interrogation? Id. For the reasons that follow, I conclude that she was.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">{\u00b6 56} Although the state argues that <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis </em>apply only when the interviewer is a law-enforcement officer, the cases do not support such a narrow interpretation. I am persuaded that <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis </em>define a broader constitutional protection from out-of-court statements that are obtained primarily to assist in a criminal prosecution, regardless of whether the interrogator is a police officer or an agent of the police. <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 822-823, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224; <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51-53, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. See <em>Crawford </em>at 50 (the principal evil at which the Confrontation Clause was directed was the civil-law mode of criminal procedure, and particularly its use of ex parte examinations as evidence against the accused).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">{\u00b6 57} In <em>Siler, </em>we stated that courts have consistently applied the primary-purpose test to statements that a child declarant made to police or those determined to be police agents. <em>Siler, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 39, 2007-Ohio-5637, 876 N.E.2d 534, at \u00b6 29. In one of those cases, the Supreme Court of North Dakota stated. \u201cIn cases since <em>Crawford, </em>other states with the functional equivalent of the Children\u2019s Advocacy Center (\u2018CAC\u2019) involved in this case have held that similar statements made by a child with police involvement inevitably are testimonial.\u201d <em>State v. Blue </em>(2006), 199 N.D. 50, 717 N.W.2d 558, \u00b6 15. A Florida court of appeals has considered four factors to determine whether the interrogation at issue was \u201cthe functional equivalent of a police interrogation. These four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>factors are (1) the effect of the Florida statutes pertinent to the establishment and functioning of the CPT [the Florida equivalent of a CAC], (2) the nature and extent of law enforcement involvement in the examination of the child by [the nurse practitioner] at [the hospital], (3) the purpose of the examination performed by [the nurse practitioner] in her capacity as a member of the CPT, and (4) the absence of any ongoing emergency at the time [the nurse practitioner] conducted her examination of the child.\u201d <em>Hernandez v. State </em>(Fla.App.2007), 946 So.2d 1270,1280. Although I would not adopt this four-part test, the factors are helpful in determining whether Marshall was acting as an agent of the police when she interrogated M.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">{\u00b6 58} First, the statutory scheme that authorized the creation of CACs contains provisions that establish a link between the CACs and law enforcement. R.C. 2151.426 and 2151.427. See Ohio Adm.Code 5101:2-33-26. Second, a police detective watched the interrogation as it was happening and the interrogation was recorded and saved to a DVD. Third, focusing primarily on issues that were not medical, the interview was memorialized as a \u201cMedical Forensic Interview Summary,\u201d suggesting that the purpose was forensic, not medical. Fourth, there was no ongoing emergency while the interview was conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">{\u00b6 59} Furthermore, Marshall is not a medical professional; her job title is \u201cmedical forensic interviewer.\u201d \u201cForensic\u201d means \u201c[u]sed in or suitable to courts of law or public debate.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (9th Ed.2009) 721. The Michigan Department of Human Services has stated that \u201c[t]he goal of a forensic interview is to obtain a statement from a child * * * that will support accurate and fair decision-making in the criminal justice and child welfare systems,\u201d and that \u201cthe interview is not part of a treatment process.\u201d State of Michigan, Forensic Interviewing Protocol, at http://www.michigan.gov/documents/dhs/DHS-PUB-0779_211637_7.pdf (accessed May 25, 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">{\u00b6 60} I conclude that Marshall was an agent of the police when she conducted her forensic interview of M.A. See <em>Blue, </em>2006 ND 134, 717 N.W.2d 558, \u00b6 14-16, and the cases cited therein; <em>State v. Mack </em>(2004), 337 Or. 586, 593, 101 P.3d 349 (Department of Human Services caseworker was a proxy for the police).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">Application of the primary-purpose test</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">{\u00b6 61} The next step is to determine whether the primary purpose of the interrogation was to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency. <em>Siler, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 39, 2007-Ohio-5637, 876 N.E.2d 534, at paragraph one of the syllabus, quoting <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 822, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224. First, the interview involved a description of past events. The alleged abuse had occurred the previous evening, and the questioning specifically attempted to obtain a description of the abuse. Second, a reasonable observer would not perceive an ongoing emergency at the time of questioning. The patient had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>discharged from the hospital the previous evening. At oral argument, counsel conceded that no medical emergency existed at the time of Marshall\u2019s interview. Third, the questioning was not necessary to resolve an emergency because there was no ongoing emergency. Finally, the interview was rather formal, more akin to the videotaped, planned interview of <em>Crawford </em>than to the frantic 9-1-1 call or the sequestered but spur-of-the-moment interview recounted in <em>Davis. </em>Each factor independently suggests that there was no ongoing emergency; collectively, the conclusion is manifest.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">{\u00b6 62} Because the primary purpose of the Marshall interview was not to meet an ongoing emergency, the next step is to evaluate the entirety of the factual circumstances surrounding the interview to establish whether its primary purpose was \u201cto establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 822, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">{\u00b6 63} A CAC can be established only by a children\u2019s services agency, law enforcement, or a prosecutor, and the CAC is responsible for assembling a multidisciplinary team. R.C. 2151.426 and 2151.427(A). The multidisciplinary team must include law enforcement and prosecuting attorneys as members. Id. The statutory connection between CACs and law enforcement suggests that CACs are not solely medical-treatment providers and that a CAC interviewer can be an agent of the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">{\u00b6 64} The circumstances of the interview indicate that its primary purpose was \u201cto establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 822, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224. See <em>Siler, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 39, 2007-Ohio-5637, 876 N.E.2d 534, paragraph one of the syllabus. Police observed the interview, which the state concedes is a customary practice. A DVD recording of the interview was preserved, a strong indication that the purpose of the interview was to obtain evidence for use by the prosecution. I am unaware of doctors videotaping patient interviews to assist them in medical treatments or of doctors allowing police officers to routinely observe them when they examine their patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">{\u00b6 65} Furthermore, many of the questions asked were investigatory in nature and similar to the questions asked in a direct examination in a judicial proceeding. See <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 830, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224. For example, questions about how the underwear was removed, who did so, and the specific positions \u2014 standing up or lying down \u2014 in which the alleged abuse occurred represent an attempt to gain specific details of past events. If the questions have a medical purpose, it is secondary to their investigatory purpose. I might view Marshall\u2019s questions differently if she were a nurse, as in <em>Stahl, </em>but she is not. Furthermore, the nurse practitioner would have made all inquiries relevant to medical treatment during the physical examination after the social worker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>questioned M.A. That the nurse practitioner stated that Marshall\u2019s interview \u201cguides my exam\u201d is no doubt true to some degree. But nurse practitioners are highly educated professionals; they do not need an intermediary. In my opinion, the intermediary was interjected in order to elicit forensic evidence, not to assist in the medical examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">{\u00b6 66} It is objectively apparent from the record that Marshall asked questions to assist in the police investigation. The circumstances of this case are quite different from <em>State v. Muttart, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 5, 2007-Ohio-5267, 875 N.E.2d 944, \u00b6 62, in which hearsay statements obtained by medical personnel in the course of treatment survived a Sixth Amendment challenge. In <em>Muttart, </em>police did not observe the interview and the interview was not videotaped. The state argues that the questions that Marshall asked M.A. helped to assess the need for future counseling but fails to show whether any counseling occurred. Even if it had occurred, a recommendation for counseling alone would be insufficient to establish that the interview was primarily for medical purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">{\u00b6 67} The critical evidence in this case is Marshall\u2019s report, something the majority opinion does not address. It uses the words \u201cperpetrator\u201d and \u201callegations\u201d and includes a witness list, an item typically not found in a medical report. The report states that the patient should have no contact with the \u201calleged perpetrator as this investigation continues.\u201d The report indicates that Marshall believed that she was assisting an ongoing investigation targeting a particular criminal suspect. When interviewers believe themselves to be participants in an investigation that has targeted a particular criminal suspect, they conduct precisely the type of ex parte examinations that the Confrontation Clause protects against. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 50-53, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Conclusions reached by sister states</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">{\u00b6 68} Since <em>Crawford </em>was decided, many state supreme courts have addressed the issue before us. In at least eight cases, state supreme courts have concluded that out-of-court statements by child sexual-assault victims to various non-law-enforcement personnel were nontestimonial. <em>Seely v. State </em>(2008), 373 Ark. 141, 282 S.W.3d 778; <em>People v. Vigil </em>(Colo.2006), 127 P.3d 916; <em>State v. Arroyo </em>(2007), 284 Conn. 597, 935 A.2d 975; <em>Commonwealth v. DeOliveira </em>(2006), 447 Mass. 56, 849 N.E.2d 218; <em>State v. Krasky </em>(Minn.2007), 736 N.W.2d 636; <em>Hobgood v. State </em>(Miss.2006), 926 So.2d 847; <em>State v. Spencer </em>(2007), 339 Mont. 227, 2007 MT 245, 169 P.3d 384; <em>State v. Vaught </em>(2004), 268 Neb. 316, 682 N.W.2d 284. Each of these cases turned on factual determinations that are not present in this case. See, e.g., <em>Seely, </em>373 Ark. at 156, 282 S.W.3d 778 (the primary purpose of an interview conducted by a social worker \u201cwas medical treatment\u201d); <em>Vigil, </em>127 P.3d at 927 (statements to doctor were for purposes of medical diagnosis); <em>Hobgood, </em>926 So.2d at 852 (statements were made to people who \u201cwere not working in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>connection with the police\u201d or were made for the purpose of seeking medical treatment).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">{\u00b6 69} At least nine state supreme courts have concluded that out-of-court statements by child sexual-assault victims to non-law-enforcement personnel are testimonial. <em>State v. Contreras </em>(Fla.2008), 979 So.2d 896; <em>Hooper, </em>145 Idaho 139, 176 P.3d 911; <em>In re Rolandis G., </em>232 Ill.2d 13, 327 Ill.Dec. 479, 902 N.E.2d 600; <em>State v. Bentley </em>(Iowa 2007), 739 N.W.2d 296; <em>State v. Henderson </em>(2007), 284 Kan. 267, 160 P.3d 776; <em>State v. Snowden </em>(2005), 385 Md. 64, 867 A.2d 314; <em>State v. Justus </em>(Mo.2006), 205 S.W.3d 872; <em>Blue, </em>2006 ND 134, 717 N.W.2d 558; <em>Mack, </em>337 Or. 586, 101 P.3d 349. Each of these cases involves an interviewer who performed in circumstances substantially similar to the facts before us. See, e.g., <em>Blue, </em>2006 ND 134, 717 N.W.2d 558, \u00b6 2-3 (a forensic interviewer conducted the interview while a police officer watched; the officer was given a videotaped recording of the interview); <em>Contreras, </em>979 So.2d at 905 (interview by child-protection-team coordinator was watched by police officer and recorded); <em>Bentley, </em>739 N.W.2d at 297, 300 (interview by counselor at child-protection center was watched by police officers, who took videotaped copy of interview with them). My conclusion in this case is bolstered by the fact that the majority of our sister courts that have considered substantially the same issue have reached the same conclusion that I reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">{\u00b6 70} I conclude that the primary purpose of Marshall\u2019s forensic interview was to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution. I conclude, therefore, that the statements were testimonial and that their admission violated the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. I would reverse the decision of the court of appeals. I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b432-7\">O\u2019Donnell, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ast\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">{\u00b6 71} The issue in this case concerns whether the trial court violated Michael Arnold\u2019s constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him when it admitted hearsay statements that Arnold\u2019s four-year-old daughter, M.A., made to Kerri Marshall, a medical forensic interviewer at the Center for Child and Family Advocacy at Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital, who interviewed M.A. as part of the investigation into allegations of sexual abuse. I agree with the majority that Marshall acted as an agent of law enforcement when she interviewed M.A. because Marshall had a purpose to collect information for use by the police. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>However, because the majority also decides that Marshall simultaneously acted as an agent of medical professionals, rendering M.A.\u2019s statements relevant to diagnosis and treatment nontestimonial, notwithstanding Marshall\u2019s primary purpose to collect that same information for the police, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">{\u00b6 72} Michael Arnold and Wendy Otto married in their teens and had two children: a girl, M.A., who was four years old at the time relevant to this case, and a boy, M.S.A., who was five. The couple had a volatile relationship, which included physical violence, accusations of infidelity, and an unsubstantiated claim that Arnold had abused M.S.A. According to Arnold\u2019s mother, Wendy had made up stories involving the children to get back at Arnold for cheating on her. After Wendy filed for divorce in July 2005, Arnold moved to Ohio. However, the two reconciled, and in November 2005, she followed him to Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">{\u00b6 73} On the evening of December 7, 2005, Wendy fell asleep in the living room with M.S.A., but noises upstairs woke her, and she went to the bedroom to investigate. Arnold, however, had locked the bedroom door, and she yelled for him to open it. Once he did, she saw his \u201cboxers halfway off on his side\u201d and M.A. lying on the couple\u2019s air mattress. She pulled a blanket off of M.A. and discovered her daughter\u2019s underwear around her ankles. At that point, she told Arnold to leave. He told Wendy that nothing happened, but he left the house when she called 9-1-1. Paramedics and officers responded, and M.A. told firefighter-paramedic Charles Fritz that someone touched her private area. Fritz took Wendy and both children to the emergency room at Children\u2019s Hospital, where authorities performed a rape-kit examination on M.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">{\u00b6 74} Wendy received instructions to take M.A. to the Center for Child and Family Advocacy at Children\u2019s Hospital (the \u201cCCFA\u201d) the next morning. The CCFA is a child-advocacy center, which is defined by R.C. 2151.425(A) to mean \u201ca center operated by participating entities * * * to perform functions and activities and provide services * * * regarding reports * * * of alleged sexual abuse of a child or another type of abuse of a child.\u201d Pursuant to R.C. 2151.426(A), the participating entities operating a child-advocacy center may include children\u2019s services, law enforcement, and the prosecuting attorney. The Columbus Police Department, the prosecutor, and children\u2019s services all have offices in the CCFA building.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">{\u00b6 75} Kerri Marshall, a medical forensic interviewer working for the CCFA, interviews children when there are allegations of sexual or physical abuse. These interviews are recorded on DVD and observed on closed-circuit television by the nurse or doctor who will perform a physical examination, law enforcement, a children\u2019s services caseworker, and sometimes a prosecutor. According to Marshall, her interview is for purposes of medical diagnosis and treatment. Howev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>er, she also explained the purpose of having doctors, nurses, detectives, children\u2019s services caseworkers, and prosecutors watch the interview: \u201cBefore we were all in the same building. You know, we would do the same process. I would interview the children. They would have their medical exam done. We would forward our reports on to medical services, law enforcement. They will have to review [ \u2014 ] law enforcement may have to interview the child. So in this way we set it up so the child will have to go through one interview. The child won\u2019t have to relive the story again. So that\u2019s really the purpose of having the other \u2014 the other people there watching the interview.\u201d Thus, the interview had a goal to obtain enough information so that law enforcement would not have to reinterview the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">{\u00b6 76} In this case, Gail Horner, a nurse practitioner, Monte Nommay, a police detective, Joelle Nielson, a victim advocate, and Vanise Dunn, a children\u2019s services caseworker, observed the interview. Marshall interviewed M.A. in a separate room with DVD cameras. She explained to M.A. that she would ask her some questions and that a nurse would give her a check-up, and she attempted to build a rapport with introductory questions; however, the interview quickly focused on the prior night\u2019s events:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-5\">{\u00b6 77} \u201cAnd who takes care of you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">{\u00b6 78} \u201cA.

How come him got in jail? What did daddy do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-12\">{\u00b6 84} \u201cA. Nothing. He just got in jail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-13\">{\u00b6 85} Marshall continued asking M.A. why Arnold had gone to jail, and M.A. explained that he had done something to Wendy and that they had been fighting. M.A. also stated that Arnold had locked the bedroom door and that neither she nor Wendy were in the room, but upon further questioning, M.A. revealed that she had been in the bedroom with Arnold sleeping on the bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-14\">{\u00b6 86} When that line of questioning stalled, Marshall asked M.A. whether she had ever been to a doctor for a check-up. M.A. responded, \u201cToday.\u201d When Marshall asked why, M.A. said, \u201cBecause my legs were hurting.\u201d Marshall did not explore the source of M.A.\u2019s medical complaint, but instead returned the focus to Arnold\u2019s arrest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>{\u00b6 87} \u201cYour legs were hurting?

Because them was fighting.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-12\">{\u00b6 94} Marshall asked why Otto had to call the police, and continued:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-13\">{\u00b6 95} \u201cI don\u2019t understand what your mom and dad were fighting about. Were they fighting about something that happened to you? Yeah? Okay. I just want you to tell the truth, that\u2019s all I want you to do. Okay. You are not in any trouble. Okay? I am going to tell you the truth, [M.A.], and I want you to tell me the truth. Okay? So your mom and your dad were fighting about something that happened to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-14\">{\u00b6 96} \u201cA. I can\u2019t \u2014 I can\u2019t say it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-15\">{\u00b6 97} Marshall then brought out a picture of a girl and had M.A. identity the parts of her body. She then continued questioning M.A.:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-16\">{\u00b6 98} \u201c[W]hat would you do if someone touched one of your private parts? What would you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-17\">{\u00b6 99} \u201cA. You get in trouble.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-18\">{\u00b6 100} \u201cQ.

Him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-20\">{\u00b6 102} Upon further questioning, M.A. denied that anyone had touched or put anything in her private parts. Marshall then asked whether anyone had asked her to keep a secret:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-21\">{\u00b6 103} \u201cHas your mom ever told you to keep a secret?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-22\">{\u00b6 104} \u201cA.

According to Horner\u2019s testimony, she would have conducted a head-to-toe examination of M.A. regardless of M.A.\u2019s answers to Marshall\u2019s questions, but she explained that \u201cthat forensic interview guides my exam in that it lets me know whether or not I need to test the child for sexually transmitted infection.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>physical exam of M.A. revealed abrasions on the hymen consistent with a penetrating injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">{\u00b6 130} Based on this interview, the state charged Arnold with two counts of rape in violation of R.C. 2907.02. Over objection, the trial court found M.A. to be unavailable for trial and that her hearsay statements to Marshall were nontesti-monial and admissible. The state played the video recording of the interview for the jury, which subsequently found Arnold guilty of vaginal rape. The Tenth District affirmed, holding that Marshall was not an agent of the police and that M.A.\u2019s statements were not testimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">{\u00b6 131} We accepted Arnold\u2019s appeal to determine whether Marshall\u2019s interview elicited testimonial statements subject to the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The Confrontation Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">{\u00b6 132} The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right * * * to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d Prior to 2004, the Supreme Court of the United States had interpreted the Confrontation Clause to permit the state to use the hearsay statements of a declarant who did not appear at trial if the hearsay fell within \u201ca firmly rooted hearsay exception\u201d or if it otherwise bore \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Ohio v. Roberts </em>(1980), 448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597. Thus, statements made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment were admissible notwithstanding the inability of the accused to cross-examine the declarant. <em>White v. Illinois </em>(1992), 502 U.S. 346, 356-357, 112 S.Ct. 736, 116 L.Ed.2d 848, and fn. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">{\u00b6 133} In <em>Crawford v. Washington </em>(2004), 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177, however, the court recognized that the interpretation of the Sixth Amendment articulated in <em>Roberts </em>could not be reconciled with the historical underpinnings of the Confrontation Clause. It held that the Sixth Amendment \u201ccommands, not that [hearsay] evidence be reliable, but that reliability be assessed in a particular manner: by testing in the crucible of cross-examination.\u201d <em>Crawford </em>at 61. Because the Sixth Amendment guarantees the accused\u2019s right to confront those who \u201cbear testimony,\u201d the Confrontation Clause bars admission of testimonial statements unless the witness appears at trial or, if the witness is unavailable, the accused had a prior opportunity for cross-examination. Id. at 51. The court explained that \u201c[w]hatever else the term [\u2018testimonial\u2019] covers, it applies at a minimum to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial; and to police interrogations.\u201d Id. at 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">{\u00b6 134} The Supreme Court revisited the issue in <em>Davis v. Washington </em>(2006), 547 U.S. 813, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224. The court held, \u201cStatements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>stances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency. They are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>Davis </em>at 822. The court held that statements to a 9-1-1 operator made during a police interrogation conducted in response to an ongoing emergency are nontestimonial; however, statements made to police after the emergency had ended are testimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\"><em>Stahl, Muttart, </em>and <em>Siler</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">{\u00b6 135} This court has previously applied <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis </em>to determine whether statements admitted at trial were testimonial or nontestimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">{\u00b6 136} In <em>State v. Stahl, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 186, 2006-Ohio-5482, 855 N.E.2d 834, we considered whether statements made by a rape victim to a DOVE-unit nurse in the presence of a police officer were testimonial. There, we \u201cadopt[ed] the \u2018objective witness\u2019 test in Ohio. For Confrontation Clause purposes, a testimonial statement includes one made \u2018under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 36, quoting <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 52, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. We concluded that the victim\u2019s statements to the nurse were nontestimonial because the victim could reasonably have assumed that repeating to a nurse or other medical professional the same information provided to police served a separate and distinct medical purpose from the criminal investigation. Id. at \u00b6 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">{\u00b6 137} Following <em>Stahl, </em>in <em>State v. Muttart, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 5, 2007-Ohio-5267, 875 N.E.2d 944, we examined the issue whether a child\u2019s statements to a social worker at the Child Maltreatment Clinic at Mercy Children\u2019s Hospital in Toledo were testimonial. We held that \u201c[statements made to medical personnel for purposes of diagnosis or treatment are not inadmissible under <em>Crawford, </em>because they are not even remotely related to the evils that the Confrontation Clause was designed to avoid.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 63. We also noted that \u201c[t]he fact that the information gathered by the medical personnel in this case was subsequently used by the state does not change the fact that the statements were not made for the state\u2019s use.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 62. Notably, however, law enforcement had not been involved in the interview or examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">{\u00b6 138} The court distinguished <em>Stahl </em>in <em>State v. Siler, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 39, 2007-Ohio-5637, 876 N.E.2d 534, and, relying on <em>Davis, </em>held that the primary-purpose test applies to a child declarant\u2019s statements made to police or those determined to be police agents: \u201c \u2018[Statements] are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no * * * ongoing emergency, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 30, quoting <em>Davis v. Washington, </em>547 U.S. at 822, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224. The court rejected the argument that because of a child\u2019s limited understanding of the system of criminal justice, the child could not reasonably expect his or her statements to be used at a later trial, and therefore, the child\u2019s statements to police interrogators are nontestimonial under the primary-purpose test.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">{\u00b6 139} Our cases applying <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis </em>thus recognize the use of different standards when the interviewer is an agent of law enforcement and when the interviewer is an agent of a medical provider. When the questioner is an agent of law enforcement, the court, in accordance with <em>Siler, </em>looks to whether the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution. When the questioner is a medical professional not related to law enforcement, the court, following <em>Stahl, </em>applies the objective-witness test and determines whether the circumstances would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">\n<em>The Majority\u2019s Dual-Capacity Test</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">{\u00b6 140} Today\u2019s majority, however, charts a course different from the Confrontation Clause jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of the United States and adopts its own dual-capacity test in which the interrogation is examined on a question-by-question basis to determine whether the interviewer acted as an agent of law enforcement or as an agent of some other entity when eliciting a particular statement. Applying this test, it finds that testimonial and nontestimo-nial statements are interspersed throughout Marshall\u2019s interview and that Marshall acted variously as an agent of law enforcement and as a medical examiner. This analysis is contrary to United States Supreme Court jurisprudence, which directs that we should look to the <em>primary </em>purpose of the interrogation, not the secondary or tertiary purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">{\u00b6 141} Here, Marshall acted as an agent of law enforcement when she interviewed M.A., as she asked questions on behalf of the police in the absence of an ongoing emergency to establish or prove past events relevant to later criminal prosecution. The interview she conducted focused solely on confirming the single instance of sexual abuse that Wendy had accused Arnold of committing: the child\u2019s medical history went no further than the night before, Marshall did not ask M.A. about any prior instances of sexual abuse she had experienced, and Marshall did not evaluate whether it would be safe to return the child to live with Wendy. Further, as the majority explains, \u201cthe interview was rather formal, more akin to the videotaped, planned interview of <em>Crawford </em>than to the frantic 9-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>1-1 call or the sequestered but spur-of-the-moment interview recounted in <em>Davis.\u201d </em>Majority opinion at \u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">{\u00b6 142} The majority therefore properly holds that M.A.\u2019s statement that Arnold locked the bedroom door with her inside, her descriptions of where her mother and brother were and what Arnold\u2019s boxer shorts and \u201cpee-pee\u201d looked like, and her statements that Arnold had removed both his and her underwear are testimonial because \u201c[t]hese statements likely were not necessary for medical diagnosis or treatment. Rather, they related primarily to the state\u2019s investigation.\u201d Majority opinion at \u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">{\u00b6 143} Yet the majority determines that Marshall acted as an agent of medical providers when she asked questions in any way relevant to medical diagnosis and treatment, so that the statements that \u201cdescribed the acts that Arnold performed, including that Arnold touched her \u2018pee-pee,\u2019 that Arnold\u2019s \u2018pee-pee\u2019 went inside her \u2018pee-pee,\u2019 that Arnold\u2019s \u2018pee-pee\u2019 touched her \u2018butt,\u2019 that Arnold\u2019s hand touched her \u2018pee-pee,\u2019 and that Arnold\u2019s mouth touched her \u2018pee-pee,\u2019 were thus necessary for the proper medical diagnosis and treatment of M.A.\u201d According to the majority, \u201c[i]n eliciting these medically necessary statements, Marshall acted as an agent of the nurse practitioner who examined M.A., not of the investigating police officers.\u201d Majority opinion at \u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">{\u00b6 144} In my view, it is not enough that these statements were relevant for medical diagnosis; rather, the question is whether the totality of the circumstances <em>objectively indicate </em>that the <em>primary purpose </em>of the interview was to facilitate medical diagnosis and treatment or whether it was to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">{\u00b6 145} It is manifest that Marshall\u2019s questions sought to confirm the allegations of sexual abuse and that proving these past events would be relevant at a criminal prosecution, and the totality of the circumstances indicates that the whole interview served primarily an investigative and prosecutorial purpose. Notably, M.A. revealed the abuse in response to a series of questions asking why her parents were fighting, why the police had come to her house, and why Arnold had gone to jail, and M.A. stated that Arnold \u201cwas doing pee-pees\u201d with her and that \u201c[t]hat\u2019s why he got in jail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">{\u00b6 146} Thus, M.A.\u2019s recorded statements \u201care functionally identical to live, in-court testimony, doing \u2018precisely what a witness does on direct examination.\u2019 \u201d <em>Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts </em>(2009), \u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 2527, 2532, 174 L.Ed.2d 314, quoting <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 830, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224. Her statements share the same \u201c \u2018striking resemblance\u2019 of the <em>Crawford </em>statement to civil-law <em>ex parte </em>examinations\u201d that the court recognized in <em>Davis: </em>Marshall separated M.A. from her mother for the interview but not for the physical exam, M.A. \u201cdeliberately recounted, in response to police questioning, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>how potentially criminal past events began and progressed,\u201d and the interview occurred after the incident and any related exigencies had ended. <em>Davis </em>at 830. Further, the CCFA perpetuated the interview for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">{\u00b6 147} The fact that the answers to Marshall\u2019s questions may also be used for a nontestimonial purpose does not mean that M.A.\u2019s statements are not testimonial or that the nontestimonial purpose takes precedence. As the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals explained in <em>United States v. Bordeaux </em>(C.A.8, 2005), 400 F.3d 548, 556, \u201cThat [the child\u2019s] statements may have also had a medical purpose does not change the fact that they were testimonial, because <em>Crawford </em>does not indicate, and logic does not dictate, that multi-purpose statements cannot be testimonial.\u201d Accord <em>State v. Henderson </em>(2007), 284 Kan. 267, 293, 160 P.3d 776, (\u201cwhile one purpose of the interview was to enable some assistance to [the child victim], the circumstances of this case objectively indicate that its primary purpose was to establish past events potentially relevant to a later criminal prosecution of Henderson\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Juvenile Dept. of Multnomah Cty. v. S.P. </em>(2009), 346 Or. 592, 624, 215 P.3d 847 (recognizing that statements to a child-abuse-evaluation team served dual purposes of providing treatment to the victim and obtaining evidence against the accused, but holding that \u201cstatements in a formal setting, in response to structured questions about past events\u201d asked by persons who were proxies for law enforcement, were testimonial).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">{\u00b6 148} Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, <em>Davis </em>does not support the proposition that \u201c[t]here is no basis in the law for concluding that Marshall\u2019s dual capacity renders statements made by M.A. for the purpose of medical diagnosis and treatment inadmissible pursuant to the Confrontation Clause.\u201d Majority opinion at \u00b6 41. Rather, the United States Supreme Court in <em>Davis </em>emphasized that it had <em>not </em>held that \u201ca conversation which begins as an interrogation to determine the need for emergency assistance cannot, as the Indiana Supreme Court put it [in <em>Hammon v. State], \u2018evolve into testimonial statements\u2019 </em>829 N.E.2d, at 457, once that purpose has been achieved.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 828, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">{\u00b6 149} However, by the majority\u2019s reckoning, the <em>converse </em>occurred here: an interrogation eliciting testimonial statements (i.e., that Arnold locked the door and pulled down M.A.\u2019s underwear) evolved into a conversation to obtain medically necessary statements (i.e., Arnold raped the child). Further, the United States Supreme Court in <em>Davis </em>did not perform the question-by-question analysis that the majority undertakes in this case; rather, the court focused on whether the totality of the circumstances indicate that \u201cthe primary purpose <em>of the interrogation </em>is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>Davis </em>at 822, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b442-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Ron O\u2019Brien, Franklin County Prosecuting Attorney, and Kimberly Bond, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b442-8\">Yeura R.

Accordingly, M.A.\u2019s statements are testimonial and their admission at trial without a prior opportunity to cross-examine M.A. violated Arnold\u2019s right to confront the witnesses against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">{\u00b6 151} Tellingly, this view that statements elicited by interviewers cooperating with law enforcement are testimonial is supported by the weight of authority addressing similar circumstances. See, e.g., <em>Bordeaux, </em>400 F.3d at 556; <em>People v. Sisavath </em>(2004), 118 Cal.App.4th 1396, 1402, 13 Cal.Rptr.3d 753; <em>State v.

Mack </em>(2004), 337 Or. 586, 593, 101 P.3d 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">{\u00b6 152} The Confrontation Clause ensures that \u201cevidence admitted against an accused is reliable and subject to the rigorous adversarial testing that is the norm of Anglo-American criminal proceedings.\u201d <em>Maryland v. Craig </em>(1990), 497 U.S. 836, 845-846, 110 S.Ct. 3157, 111 L.Ed.2d 666. Because the principal evil at which the Confrontation Clause is directed is the use of ex parte examinations as evidence against the accused such as occurred in this case, I would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b436-22\">.
