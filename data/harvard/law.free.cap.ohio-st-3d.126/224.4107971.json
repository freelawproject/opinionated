Rocker claims to have been one of his victims. Because the court of appeals erred in holding that all of the withheld records were exempt from disclosure under the R.C. 149.43(A)(2)(a) uncharged-suspect exception to the Ohio Public Records Act, we reverse the judgment and remand the cause for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">{\u00b6 2} In January 2008, Rocker reported to the sheriffs office that she had been sexually assaulted in the early 1990s, when she was a child. Rocker claimed that the priest of the church she had attended as a child was the perpetrator of the crime. The matter was submitted to a grand jury, but no indictment was returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">{\u00b6 3} On October 1, 2008, after the investigation had concluded, Rocker, through counsel, made a public-records request \u201cfor the entire contents of the investigative file and any documents reviewed during or related to the investigation.\u201d The sheriffs office provided Rocker with a copy of the incident report, but denied her access to the remaining investigative records.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-12\">{\u00b6 4} A few months later, Rocker filed a complaint in the Court of Appeals for Guernsey County for a writ of mandamus to compel the sheriffs office to provide her with access to \u201call documents reviewed during, related to, or prepared concerning the criminal investigation\u201d of the suspect. After the sheriffs office filed a response, the court ordered the office to submit copies of all the requested records under seal for an in camera inspection. Pursuant to the court\u2019s order, the parties submitted briefs on whether the various categories of investigative records withheld by the sheriffs office are disclosable under the Public Records Act, R.C. 149.43.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-13\">{\u00b6 5} On December 2, 2009, the court of appeals denied the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cMandamus is the appropriate remedy to compel compliance with R.C. 149.43, Ohio\u2019s Public Records Act.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Physicians Commt. for Responsible Medicine v. Ohio State Univ. Bd. of Trustees, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 288, 2006-Ohio-903, 843 N.E.2d 174, \u00b6 6; R.C. 149.43(C)(1). We construe the Public Records Act liberally in favor of broad access and resolve any doubt in favor of disclosure of public records. <em>State ex rel. Perrea v. Cincinnati Pub. Schools, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 410, 2009-Ohio-4762, 916 N.E.2d 1049, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cExceptions to disclosure under the Public Records Act, R.C. 149.43, are strictly construed against the public-records custodian, and the custodian has the burden to establish the applicability of an exception. A custodian does not meet this burden if it has not proven that the requested records fall squarely within the exception.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Cincinnati Enquirer v. Jones-Kelley, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 81, 2008-Ohio-1770, 886 N.E.2d 206, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">{\u00b6 8} The sheriffs office claimed, and the court of appeals determined, that the remaining requested records are exempt from disclosure as confidential law-enforcement investigatory records under R.C. 149.43(A)(1)(h) and (2). \u201cThe applicability of the R.C. 149.43(A)(2) confidential-law-enforcement-investigatory-record exemption requires, first, that the records pertain to a law enforcement matter of a criminal, quasi-criminal, civil, or administrative nature, and, second, that the release of the records would create a high probability of disclosure of any of the four types of information specified in R.C. 149.43(A)(2).\u201d <em>State ex rel. Ohio Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Assn. v. Mentor </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 440, 444, 732 N.E.2d 969.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">{\u00b6 9} The sheriffs office established the first requirement for the exemption because the records pertain to a law-enforcement matter of a criminal nature. Id. at 445, 732 N.E.2d 969. The investigative records were generated by claims of alleged sexual misconduct by a priest.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">{\u00b6 10} For the second requirement, the court of appeals held that the release of the investigative records would probably reveal the identity of an uncharged suspect under R.C. 149.43(A)(2)(a). The claimed perpetrator of the sexual assault is an uncharged suspect because he has never been charged with a criminal offense. See <em>State ex rel. Musial v. N. Olmsted, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 459, 2005-Ohio-5521, 835 N.E.2d 1243, \u00b6 25 (suspect investigated by police department was an uncharged suspect for purposes of exemption because the grand jury issued a no bill instead of an indictment). \u201cThe uncharged suspect exception applies despite the passage of time, the lack of enforcement action, or a prosecutor\u2019s decision not to file formal charges.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Master v. Cleveland </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 23, 30, 661 N.E.2d 180. Public knowledge of the accused and the alleged criminal conduct also does not preclude application of the exemption \u201cbecause release of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>the records would subject suspects to additional adverse publicity and might compromise subsequent efforts to resolve the matter.\u201d <em>Ohio Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Assn., </em>89 Ohio St.3d at 447, 732 N.E.2d 969.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">{\u00b6 11} Nevertheless, this exception applies only to those portions of records that, if released, would create a high probability of disclosure of the suspect\u2019s identity. We have held that records are exempt under the uncharged-suspect exception when \u201cthe protected identities of uncharged suspects are inextricably intertwined with the investigatory records.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Master v. Cleveland </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 340, 342, 667 N.E.2d 974.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">{\u00b6 12} The court of appeals determined, in effect, that every part of the requested records was inextricably intertwined with the identity of the priest accused of sexual assault and that the records were thus not subject to disclosure under R.C. 149.43.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">{\u00b6 13} Rocker argues on appeal that the court of appeals \u201cseems to have bypassed a thorough analysis of the nature of each document, and instead focused on references within them to [the suspect].\u201d The sheriffs office, citing <em>Master, </em>76 Ohio St.3d 340, 667 N.E.2d 974, contends that the court of appeals acted correctly in refusing to compel the disclosure of any part of the withheld investigative records because the suspect\u2019s identity is inextricably intertwined with all of the records.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">{\u00b6 14} We have reviewed the sealed records and conclude that some of the withheld records are subject to disclosure under the Public Records Act because they are not inextricably intertwined with the suspect\u2019s protected identity. For most of these records, if the sheriffs office redacts the priest\u2019s name, the name, location, and diocese of the church where he worked, and other specific identifying information, the disclosure of the records will not create a high probability of disclosure of the priest\u2019s identity. For example, after the priest\u2019s name and specific identifying information are redacted, the call record does not disclose the priest\u2019s identity. Notably, in <em>Master, </em>76 Ohio St.3d at 342, 667 N.E.2d 974; <em>Ohio Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Assn., </em>89 Ohio St.3d at 448, 732 N.E.2d 969, and <em>Musial, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 459, 2005-Ohio-5521, 835 N.E.2d 1243, at \u00b6 29, we did not hold that the claimed uncharged-suspect exemption applied to <em>all </em>the requested records.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">{\u00b6 15} Therefore, the court of appeals erred in concluding that all the withheld investigative records were covered by a blanket uncharged-suspect exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">{\u00b6 16} Based on our independent review of the sealed investigative records, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the cause so that the court can review the sealed records and order the disclosure of those records following the redaction of those portions of the record that are subject to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>uncharged-suspect exemption, e.g., the priest\u2019s name, his address, the name, location, and diocese of the church where he worked, and other specific, identifying information. By so holding, we adhere to our strict construction of exceptions to the Public Records Act as well as our duty to resolve any doubt in favor of access to public records.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b350-5\">Brown, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Connor, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b350-6\">Lundberg Stratton and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b350-7\">Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Anq\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">{\u00b6 17} Because I believe that this case represents a weakening of the uncharged suspect exception to the Public Records Act, R.C. 149.43(A)(2)(a), and, correspondingly, makes it more difficult for trial courts to determine which parts of particular records are exempt from disclosure, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">{\u00b6 18} First, under the uncharged suspect exception to the Public Records Act, I believe that the requested sealed investigative records should be excluded from disclosure in their entirety because the documents are \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with records whose release would result in a \u201chigh probability\u201d of disclosure of the suspect\u2019s identity. Although it is true that the Public Records Act is liberally construed in favor of broad access to public records, I believe that disclosure of the sealed records in question would create a \u201chigh probability\u201d of disclosure of the suspect\u2019s identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">{\u00b6 19} The majority\u2019s decision to attempt to redact the suspect\u2019s name, address, and place and dates of employment creates a new standard that is not only onerous to trial courts but, as in this case, as a practical matter, is unworkable. The reality is that just redacting the uncharged suspect\u2019s name, place of employment, dates he or she worked for the organization, and other specific identifying information will not prevent the high probability of disclosure of the uncharged suspect\u2019s identity in a less populous county such as the one in this case, where the suspect involved may be the only person in the county during the time in question to have held the position of leadership that he or she held and may have been employed at the only organization of its kind in that county.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c[0]ne of the purposes for the public records exception * * * is to avoid the situation in which the release of confidential law enforcement investigatory records would subject a person to adverse publicity where he may otherwise never have been identified with the matter under investigation.\u201d <em>State ex rel. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number><em>Thompson Newspapers, Inc. v. Martin </em>(1989), 47 Ohio St.3d 28, 30, 546 N.E.2d 939. Accord <em>State ex rel. Polovischak v. Mayfield </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 51, 552 N.E.2d 635, syllabus; <em>State ex rel. Moreland v. Dayton </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 129, 131, 616 N.E.2d 234. Moreover, as the court of appeals noted, \u201c[t]he uncharged-suspect exemption may still apply even though the accusation of criminal conduct is already public knowledge;\u201d <em>State ex rel. Rocker v. Guernsey Cty. Sheriffs Office, </em>Guernsey App. No. 09-CA-4, 2009-Ohio-6336, 2009 WL 4456210, at \u00b6 14, citing <em>State ex rel. Master v. Cleveland </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 340, 342, 667 N.E.2d 974, and <em>State ex rel. Ohio Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Assn. v. Mentor </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 440, 446-447, 732 N.E.2d 969.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">{\u00b6 21} As for the jeopardy to law enforcement, this court has held in <em>State ex rel. Master v. Cleveland, </em>76 Ohio St.3d at 343, 667 N.E.2d 974, that another of the exception\u2019s purposes is to \u201cprevent compromising subsequent efforts to reopen and solve inactive cases.\u201d Releasing information about uncharged suspects in inactive criminal investigations could compromise later efforts to reopen and solve those inactive cases. On occasion, police cannot secure enough evidence to convict a suspect until years after the initial investigation was opened. See <em>State ex rel. Moreland v. Dayton, </em>67 Ohio St.3d at 131, 616 N.E.2d 234. The statute of limitations has not yet run on this investigation. See R.C. 2901.13(A)(3). Disclosure of these records might interfere with law enforcement efforts to further investigate this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">{\u00b6 22} Second, I would find that the requested records are exempt from disclosure under the specific confidential investigatory techniques or procedures or specific investigatory work product exception to the Public Records Act. See R.C. 149.43(A)(2)(c). In my view, this court\u2019s decision in <em>State ex rel. Steckman v. Jackson </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 420, 639 N.E.2d 83, is relevant to this analysis. In <em>Steckman, </em>we held that \u201cexcept as required by Crim.R. 16, information assembled by law enforcement officials in connection with a probable or pending criminal proceeding is, by the work product exception found in R.C. 149.43(A)(2)(c), excepted from required release as said information is compiled in anticipation of litigation.\u201d Id. at 435, 639 N.E.2d 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">{\u00b6 23} For the reasons outlined above, I dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the cause. The court of appeals has already reviewed the disputed sealed documents and found them to be confidential law enforcement investigatory records, each of which is exempt from disclosure, concluding that release of the disputed records would \u201cundoubtedly reveal the identity of the uncharged suspect.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Rocker v. Guernsey Cty. Sheriffs Office, </em>2009-Ohio-6336, 2009 WL 4456210, at \u00b6 16. As the court noted, \u201c[n]ot only do most of the records reveal the name of the suspect, they also reveal facts unique to him which would have a high probability of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>revealing his identity.\u201d Id. Despite the majority\u2019s attempt to redact some of this identifying information, I continue to believe that the release of these documents will create a high probability of revealing the uncharged suspect\u2019s identity.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b352-7\">Kircher, Arnold &amp; Dame, L.L.C., Konrad Kircher, and Michael P. Arnold, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b352-8\">Daniel G. Padden, Guernsey County Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">{\u00b6 24} Absent an abuse of discretion, we should not second-guess these findings and substitute our own opinion for that of the lower courts. The court below followed our case law. Some on this court merely disagree with the factual conclusions. I believe that the uncharged suspect\u2019s identity is \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the investigatory records requested, such that redaction is an insufficient safeguard against disclosure. Therefore, I would affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b352-6\">O\u2019Donnell, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
