Brown had an adequate remedy by way of direct appeal from his criminal convictions and sentence to raise his claims that he was denied his right to be physically present and to have counsel present at a critical stage in his trial, as well as to have the portion of the trial in which the trial court issued supplemental jury instructions open to the public. See <em>Bozsik v. Hudson, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 245, 2006-Ohio-4356, 852 N.E.2d 1200, \u00b6 7-9; <em>State v.
