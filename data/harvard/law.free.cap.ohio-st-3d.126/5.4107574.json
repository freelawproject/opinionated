Appellant, Mark Jenney, argues that it is impossible for a police officer to visually estimate the exact speed of a moving object. He asks the court to establish a bright-line rule that an officer\u2019s visual estimation of speed, without other evidence to support it, is insufficient to sustain a conviction for speeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-15\">{\u00b6 2} A rational trier of fact could find testimony by a police officer who is trained, certified by the Ohio Peace Officer Training Academy (\u201cOPOTA\u201d) or a similar organization, and experienced in visually estimating vehicle speed that he estimated a vehicle\u2019s speed to be in excess of the posted limit sufficient evidence to establish a violation of R.C. 4511.21(D) beyond a reasonable doubt. We therefore hold that a police officer\u2019s unaided visual estimation of a vehicle\u2019s speed is sufficient evidence to support a conviction for speeding in violation of R.C. 4511.21(D) without independent verification of the vehicle\u2019s speed if the officer is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>trained, is certified by the Ohio Peace Officer Training Academy or a similar organization that develops and implements training programs to meet the needs of law-enforcement professionals and the communities they serve, and is experienced in visually estimating vehicle speed.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Relevant Background</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">{\u00b6 3} On July 3, 2008, Officer Christopher R. Santimarino was in a marked patrol car running stationary radar at southbound traffic on State Route 21 in Copley Township, Ohio. The posted speed limit in that location is 60 miles per hour. Santimarino observed Jenney driving a black SUV in the left lane of Route 21 in moderate to heavy traffic. Santimarino determined that Jenney was traveling faster than the posted speed limit, initiated a traffic stop, and issued Jenney a citation for traveling 79 miles per hour in a 60-mile-per-hour zone in violation of R.C. 4511.21.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">{\u00b6 4} The case proceeded to trial in the Barberton Municipal Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">{\u00b6 5} At trial, Santimarino testified that he had been employed as a patrolman with the Copley Police Department for 13 years. He testified that he was certified by OPOTA and had been working in traffic enforcement since 1995. Santimarino testified that as part of his OPOTA training, he was trained to visually estimate the speed of a vehicle. In order to be certified by OPOTA, Santimarino was required to show that he could visually estimate a vehicle\u2019s speed to within three to four miles per hour of the vehicle\u2019s actual speed, which he did. Further, Santimarino testified that since becoming a police officer in 1995, he had performed hundreds of visual estimations. Santimarino testified that based on his training and experience, he had estimated that Jenney\u2019s vehicle was traveling 70 miles per hour on July 3, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">{\u00b6 6} Santimarino also testified that in addition to his training and experience in visually estimating vehicle speed, he was trained and certified to use the Python brand Doppler radar unit that he was using on July 3, 2008. Santimarino testified on direct examination that after he visually estimated the speed of Jenney\u2019s vehicle, he observed that the radar unit indicated that Jenney\u2019s vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>was traveling at 82 miles per hour.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Santimarino could not produce a copy of his radar-training certification when defense counsel requested he do so on the day of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">{\u00b6 7} Santimarino also testified that Jenney was traveling at an unreasonable speed for the conditions, given the other traffic in close proximity to his vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">{\u00b6 8} In light of both his visual estimation and the radar reading, Santimarino initiated a traffic stop and issued Jenney a citation for traveling 79 miles per hour in a 60 mile per hour zone in violation of R.C. 4511.21. Santimarino testified that he reduced the rate of speed to 79 miles per hour to \u201cgive [Jenney] a break on the personal appearance in court,\u201d which is required for speeds 20 miles per hour or more over the speed limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">{\u00b6 9} At the conclusion of the city\u2019s case, Jenney moved for an acquittal pursuant to Crim.R. 29, arguing that the city had failed to meet its burden of proof. The trial court overruled Jenney\u2019s motion. Jenney then testified that before he was pulled over, he had been traveling in the right lane of traffic, not the left lane as Santimarino had testified, and that he had been traveling at the speed limit, 60 miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">{\u00b6 10} The trial judge found Jenney guilty of traveling over the posted speed limit. Based on Santimarino\u2019s visual estimation, which the trial court found to be his \u201cstrongest\u201d testimony, the court amended the citation to state that Jenney had been traveling 70 miles per hour in a 60-mile-per-hour zone and imposed a $50 fine plus court costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">{\u00b6 11} Jenney appealed his conviction to the Ninth District Court of Appeals, arguing that the trial court had erroneously permitted the city to amend the traffic citation and that his conviction was not supported by sufficient evidence and was against the manifest weight of the evidence. Jenney argued that the radar results were not admissible because the city had failed to establish a proper foundation for admission. Jenney maintained that without the radar results, the city had failed to present sufficient evidence of his speed and his conviction could not stand. The court of appeals held that because Santimarino could not produce his certificate to operate the radar unit on the day of trial, the state had not proved that he was qualified to operate the radar unit and the trial court had erred in permitting him to testify regarding the radar results.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Id., \u00b6 8. Howev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>er, the Ninth District held that the admission of Santimarino\u2019s testimony regarding the radar results was harmless error because his visual estimation of the vehicle\u2019s speed was sufficient to support Jenney\u2019s conviction. Id., \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">{\u00b6 12} We accepted review of Jenney\u2019s discretionary appeal to determine whether a police officer\u2019s unaided visual estimation of a vehicle\u2019s speed, by itself, is sufficient to support a conviction for violation of R.C. 4511.21(D). <em>Barberton v. Jenney, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 1406, 2009-Ohio-5031, 914 N.E.2d 204. We hold that a police officer\u2019s unaided visual estimation of a vehicle\u2019s speed is sufficient evidence to support a conviction for speeding in violation of R.C. 4511.21(D) without independent verification of the vehicle\u2019s speed if the officer is trained, is certified by the Ohio Peace Officer Training Academy or a similar organization that develops and implements training programs to meet the needs of law-enforcement professionals and the communities they serve, and is experienced in visually estimating vehicle speed.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">{\u00b6 13} The trial court found appellant guilty of \u201ctraveling over the speed limit.\u201d Pursuant to R.C. 4511.21(D)(6), \u201c[n]o person shall operate a motor vehicle * * * upon a street or highway * * * [a]t a speed exceeding the posted speed limit * * Jenney does not dispute that he was operating a motor vehicle on a street or highway and that the posted speed limit was 60 miles per hour. The only element of the offense that Jenney challenges as not supported by sufficient evidence is the speed at which he was driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c \u2018 \u201c[SJufficiency\u201d is a term of art meaning that legal standard which is applied to determine whether the case may go to the jury or whether the evidence is legally sufficient to support the jury verdict as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386, 678 N.E.2d 541, quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed.1990) 1433. \u201cIn essence, sufficiency is a test of adequacy. Whether the evidence is legally sufficient to sustain a verdict is a question of law.\u201d Id. In reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, \u201c \u2018[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Diar, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 460, 2008-Ohio-6266, 900 N.E.2d 565, \u00b6 113, quoting <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cVisual observation has long been held a valid means of determining the speed of a moving vehicle as long as the witness has a reliable opportunity to view the vehicle.\u201d <em>State v. Harkins </em>(Aug. 5, 1987), 4th Dist. No. 431, 1987 WL 15492, at *3. A majority of the appellate districts that have considered the issue have held that an officer\u2019s testimony that in his opinion, a defendant was traveling in excess of the speed limit is sufficient to sustain a conviction for speeding. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number><em>Kirtland Hills v. Logan </em>(11th Dist.1984), 21 Ohio App.3d 67, 69, 21 OBR 71, 486 N.E.2d 231; <em>State v. Dawson, </em>5th Dist. No. 03-COA-061, 2004-Ohio-2324, 2004 WL 1043220, \u00b6 21-23; <em>Cincinnati v. Dowling </em>(1st Dist.1987), 36 Ohio App.3d 198, 199-200, 521 N.E.2d 1140; <em>State v. Gellenbeck, </em>12th Dist. No. CA2008-08-030, 2009-Ohio-1731, 2009 WL 975746, \u00b6 19-20; <em>Columbus v. Bravi </em>(Mar. 5, 1991), 10th Dist. No. 90AP-1135, 1991 WL 33095; <em>State v. Wilson </em>(Nov. 20, 1996), 9th Dist. No. 95CA006285, 1996 WL 668993, at *1. In so holding, many of these courts have considered the testifying officer\u2019s training and experience visually estimating vehicle speed. <em>Dawson </em>at \u00b6 21-23 (noting that the trooper had received training at the Ohio Highway Patrol Academy on how to accurately estimate the speed of moving vehicles, had passed the test at the academy, and had been a trooper for four and a half years); <em>Dowling </em>at 199-200, 521 N.E.2d 1140 (noting that the officer was trained in visually estimating vehicle speed and had 29 years of experience); <em>Gellenbeck </em>at \u00b6 19-20 (noting that the trooper testified regarding his training to accurately visually estimate vehicle speed); <em>Kirtland Hills </em>at 69, 21 OBR 71, 486 N.E.2d 231 (noting that the officer\u2019s testimony regarding his visual estimation was based on his knowledge and expertise).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">{\u00b6 16} Jenney relies on decisions by the Second, Third, and Eighth Districts to support his argument that an officer\u2019s visual estimation of a vehicle\u2019s speed, alone, is insufficient to support a conviction pursuant to R.C. 4511.21(D). <em>See Middleburg Hts. v. Campbell, </em>8th Dist. No. 87593, 2006-Ohio-6582, 2006 WL 3630780; <em>State v. Saphire </em>(Dec. 8, 2000), 2d Dist. No. 2000 CA 39, 2000 WL 1803852; <em>State v. Meyers </em>(Dec. 29, 2000), 2d Dist. No. 2000 CA 49, 2000 WL 1879104; <em>State v. Westerbeck </em>(June 19, 1987), 3d Dist. No. 17-86-18, 1987 WL 13063.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">{\u00b6 17} The Eighth District held that an officer\u2019s visual estimation of a vehicle\u2019s speed, alone, is insufficient to support a conviction for speeding, stating that \u201cthe mere educated guess of the arresting officer as to the speed of a vehicle is insufficient to overcome the presumption of innocence and the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt for conviction.\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>2006-Ohio-6582, 2006 WL 3630780, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-12\">{\u00b6 18} Although Jenney\u2019s reliance on the Eighth District\u2019s decision in <em>Campbell </em>is sound, his reliance on the Second District\u2019s decisions in <em>Saphire </em>and <em>Meyers </em>and the Third District\u2019s decision in <em>Westerbeck </em>is misplaced. After its decisions in <em>Saphire </em>and <em>Meyers, </em>the Second District held that testimony regarding an officer\u2019s visual estimation of speed, alone, may be sufficient to support a conviction for speeding upon an adequate showing of the officer\u2019s training and ability to accurately visually estimate the speed of vehicles. <em>State v. Konya, </em>2d Dist. No. 21434, 2006-Ohio-6312, 2006 WL 3462119, \u00b6 7-8, 14. In <em>Konya, </em>the court held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>that based on the trooper\u2019s 12 years of experience in law enforcement and extensive training in visually estimating the speed of vehicles, along with the fact that he had had an unobstructed view of the vehicle in question for more than a mile, his testimony was sufficient, in and of itself, to establish the defendant\u2019s speed. Id. Similarly, the Third District recently explained that its decision in <em>Westerbeck </em>is limited to cases in which the officer\u2019s testimony is \u201ctoo vague and indefinite for a finding of guilt,\u201d stating that courts that have interpreted <em>Westerbeck </em>as holding that visual-estimation testimony is insufficient as a matter of law have misconstrued its holding. <em>State v. Harris, </em>3d Dist. No. 9-09-03, 2009-Ohio-2616, 2009 WL 1579250, \u00b6 13, fn. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">{\u00b6 19} The Eighth District stands alone in holding that an officer\u2019s visual estimation of the speed of a vehicle is insufficient to support a finding of guilt, and we agree with the courts that have found the opposite. Rational triers of fact could find a police officer\u2019s testimony regarding his unaided visual estimation of a vehicle\u2019s speed, when supported by evidence that the officer is trained, certified by OPOTA or a similar organization, and experienced in making such estimations, sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt the defendant\u2019s speed. Independent verification of the vehicle\u2019s speed is not necessary to support a conviction for speeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">{\u00b6 20} The officer\u2019s credibility remains an issue for the trier of the facts. <em>State v. Diar, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 460, 2008-Ohio-6266, 900 N.E.2d 565, \u00b6 120, quoting <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212, paragraph one of the syllabus. \u201cBecause the trier of fact sees and hears the witnesses and is particularly competent to decide \u2018whether, and to what extent, to credit the testimony of particular witnesses,\u2019 we must afford substantial deference to its determinations of credibility.\u201d <em>Konya, </em>2006-Ohio-6312, 2006 WL 3462119, \u00b6 6, quoting <em>State v. Lawson </em>(Aug. 22, 1997), 2d Dist. No. 16288, 1997 WL 476684, *4.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">{\u00b6 21} At the time of the traffic stop, Santimarino had been employed as a patrolman with the Copley Police Department for 13 years. He is trained to visually estimate vehicle speed to within three to four miles per hour of the vehicle\u2019s actual speed, he is certified by OPOTA in visually estimating vehicle speed, and he has performed hundreds of visual estimations since becoming a police officer in 1995. Santimarino testified that based on his training and experience, he visually estimated that Jenney was traveling 70 miles per hour at the time of the traffic stop. Santimarino\u2019s testimony was sufficient to support Jenney\u2019s conviction for traveling at a speed above the posted limit in violation of R.C. 4511.21(D). Further, the trial court found Santimarino\u2019s testimony credible and based its finding of guilt on the officer\u2019s visual estimation, noting that his testimony on the estimated speed was his \u201cstrongest\u201d testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>{\u00b6 22} Given Santimarino\u2019s training, OPOTA certification, and experience in visually estimating vehicle speed, his estimation that Jenney was traveling 70 miles per hour was sufficient to support Jenney\u2019s conviction for driving over the posted speed limit of 60 miles per hour in violation of R.C. 4511.21(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">{\u00b6 23} A police officer\u2019s unaided visual estimation of a vehicle\u2019s speed is sufficient evidence to support a conviction for speeding in violation of R.C. 4511.21(D) without independent verification of the vehicle\u2019s speed if the officer is trained, is certified by the Ohio Peace Officer Training Academy or a similar organization that develops and implements training programs to meet the needs of law-enforcement professionals and the communities they serve, and is experienced in visually estimating vehicle speed. Given Santimarino\u2019s training, OPOTA certification, and experience in visually estimating vehicle speed, his estimation that Jenney was traveling at 70 miles per hour was sufficient to support a conviction for driving over the posted speed limit of 60 miles per hour in violation of R.C. 4511.21(D). We therefore affirm the judgment of the court of appeals and uphold Jenney\u2019s conviction and fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b133-7\">Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b133-8\">O\u2019Donnell, J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b133-9\">Brown, C.J., not participating.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b128-9\">. In issuing the citation, Santimarino inadvertently failed to check any of the boxes specifying under which subsection Jenney was charged, but the trial court permitted the state to amend the citation to allege that Jenney violated both R.C. 4511.21(A) (operating a motor vehicle at a greater speed than is reasonable and proper under the circumstances) and 4511.21(D)(6) (operating a motor vehicle at a speed exceeding the posted speed limit). On appeal, the Ninth District Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s grant of the city\u2019s motion to amend the citation. <em>Barberton v. Jenney, </em>Summit App. No. 24423, 2009-0hio-1985, 2009 WL 1139347, \u00b6 4. We declined to review Jenney\u2019s proposition relating to the amendment. <em>Barberton v.

This difference is immaterial to our analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b129-10\">. The city did not appeal the Ninth District\u2019s decision that the radar results were inadmissible. Because the issue is not before us, we do not consider whether Santimarino\u2019s testimony regarding his training and certification in operating the radar unit was sufficient evidence to prove that he was qualified to operate the unit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b133-10\">O\u2019Donnell, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AqP\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">{\u00b6 24} I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-12\">{\u00b6 25} While a police officer who is trained, certified by the Ohio Peace Officer Training Academy, and experienced in estimating a vehicle\u2019s speed may, as any other expert witness, offer an opinion of the speed of a moving vehicle during testimony in a court proceeding, I do not agree that such testimony per se is sufficient evidence to support a conviction for speeding. Like any other witness, a police officer\u2019s credibility is to be determined by the jury or other fact-finder. <em>State v. Diar, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 460, 2008-Ohio-6266, 900 N.E.2d 565, \u00b6 120, quoting <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212, paragraph one of the syllabus (\u201c \u2018[T]he weight to be given the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses are primarily for the trier of the facts\u2019 \u201d). In fact, jury instructions given regularly by trial judges advise that a jury is privileged to believe all, part, or none of the testimony of any witness. See, e.g., <em>State v. Group, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 248, 2002-Ohio-7247, 781 N.E.2d 980, \u00b6 120 (citing jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>instruction stating that jurors may believe or disbelieve all or any part of the testimony of any witness).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b134-5\">Michelle Banbury, City of Barberton Law Department Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b134-6\">John Kim, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b134-7\">Richard Cordray, Attorney General, Benjamin C. Mizer, Solicitor General, and Emily S. Schlesinger, Deputy Solicitor, urging affirmance for amicus curiae, Ohio Attorney General.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">{\u00b6 26} Thus, I would assert that a broad standard as postulated by the majority that a trained, certified, and experienced officer\u2019s estimate of speed is sufficient evidence to support a conviction for speeding eclipses the role of the fact-finder to reject such testimony, and thus such testimony, if found not to be credible, could, in some instances, be insufficient to support a conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
