Here, Defendant contends the State failed to present sufficient evidence to support his conviction for felony fleeing to elude arrest. Because the evidence supported finding the section 20-141.5(b) aggravating factors of driving more than fifteen miles per hour over the speed limit and reckless driving, we affirm Defendant's conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The facts tend to show that in June 2004 while patrolling in Buncombe County, Officer William Cummings received information that \"a subject wanted on [two felony] warrants\" was possibly in the area, and that he was \"operating ... a powder blue Nissan or Datsun 280-Z[.]\" Upon seeing a powder blue Datsun 280-Z \"passing cars on the double yellow line\" about an hour later, Officer Cummings \"turned on the overhead lights\" to his squad car and pursued the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The vehicle passed through a construction zone nearly striking a gasoline truck, rounded a curve in the road and stopped. Thereafter, \"a white male, average weight, [average height] . . . dressed in all black or all dark clothing\" with \"dark hair\" exited the vehicle, ran across the road, jumped over an approximate ten-foot wall and disappeared into the woods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Officer Cummings determined that the blue Datsun from which the suspect fled was registered to Brenda Darlene Lovelace in Canton, North Carolina. He summoned other officers to form a perimeter around the area, since there were \"limited places [for the suspect] to come out.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Upon receiving a call that \"[the subject] had been picked up by his wife in a green jeep with a black rag top on it\", Officer Cummings spotted the vehicle and initiated a felony traffic stop. The female driver who identified herself as \"Miss Lovelace,\" drove a vehicle registered to the same address as the blue Datsun. The passenger in the vehicle, Defendant Jerry Dale Smith, was dressed \"in dark clothing, completely soaked from head to toe,\" and \"had trouble walking.\" Officer Cummings asked Defendant if he needed an ambulance to which he responded that \"he possibly hurt [his ankle] when he jumped over the wall,\" but that \"he'd be fine\" without an ambulance. Officer Cummings then took him into custody and placed him in the back of the patrol car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Officer Cummings testified that during the ride to the Buncombe County Detention Center, he \"closed the shield on the cage\" between Defendant and himself and took care not to speak with Defendant. But Defendant initiated conversation with Officer Cummings and essentially confessed to the crime. Officer Cummings explained:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As he was riding in the back seat he stated several times that he was sorry, that he was scared, that he knew he was wanted, that he figured that when we passed him that we were looking for him. I told him he about hit the tanker truck. He stated he was a good driver, that wouldn't have happened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant was charged and later found guilty of felonious operation of a vehicle to elude arrest and being an habitual felon. The trial court sentenced Defendant to a minimum of 133 imprisonment. Defendant appeals contending the trial court erred by denying his motions to (I) dismiss the charge of felonious operation of a vehicle to elude arrest, (II) suppress his confession, and (III) continue his trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"When a defendant moves to dismiss a charge against him on the ground of insufficiency of the evidence, the trial court must determine `whether there is substantial evidence of each essential element of the offense charged and of the defendant being the perpetrator of the offense.'\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Gen.Stat. \u00a7 20-141.5(a)-(b) (2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant contends the State failed to present sufficient evidence to support the aggravating factors necessary to support a conviction for felony fleeing to elude arrest. However, a review of the record reveals that Officer Cummings testified that Defendant sped \"at least in excess of sixty [miles per hour]\" in speed-zone areas of thirty-five and forty-five miles per hour. This evidence supports finding that Defendant drove more than fifteen miles per hour over the speed limit as required for a charge under section 20-141.5(b)(1) of the North Carolina General Statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As to the second aggravating factor of reckless driving, section 20-140 of the North Carolina General Statutes defines \"reckless driving\" as (a) driving \"carelessly and heedlessly in willful or wanton disregard of the rights or safety of others\"; or (b) driving \"without due caution and circumspection and at a speed or in a manner so as to endanger or be likely to endanger any person or property.\" N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 20-140(a)-(b) (2005). The record reveals that Officer Cummings\n   testified that it was rainy that day and that during the high-speed chase, Defendant came extremely close to hitting an oil tanker at speeds in excess of sixty miles per hour. Officer Cummings further testified that he observed Defendant crossing double yellow lines shortly after he passed Defendant's car. This evidence was sufficient to show that Defendant's actions satisfied the definition of \"reckless driving\" under section 20-140 which is referenced by section 20-141.5(b) of the North Carolina General Statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In sum, the State presented sufficient evidence to withstand Defendant's motion to dismiss the felonious fleeing to elude arrest charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The record shows Defendant failed to preserve for appellate review the issue of whether his confession should have been suppressed. To preserve a question for appellate review, North Carolina Rule of Appellate Procedure 10(b)(1) requires a party to state the \"specific grounds\" for the desired ruling. N.C. R.App. P. 10(b)(1). \"Our Supreme Court has long held that where a theory argued on appeal was not raised before the trial court, the law does not permit parties to `swap horses between courts in order to get a better mount' in the appellate courts.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

OLESIUK: Due process, your Honor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   At the end of the hearing, the trial court gave defense counsel an opportunity to clarify the grounds for the motion to suppress, and even specifically asked defense counsel whether Defendant was moving to suppress on grounds related to the voluntariness of his confession:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   COURT: [Y]ou said due process.

Undisputed evidence in the record establishes that Defendant initiated the confession and that his confession was not made in response to any questioning by Officer Cummings:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Mr. Hess: And, did you ask [Defendant] any questions?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Officer Cummings: No, I never asked him anything other than his name.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Officer Cummings further testified that it was his practice to never ask questions of suspects until after booking, and that he closed the shield on the police car's cage after placing Defendant in the back seat. Defendant did not rebut any of this evidence, and he did not provide any evidence suggesting that his statement was involuntary, or that Officer Cummings had questioned him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Nonetheless, Defendant argues on appeal that because he was in custody when he confessed, his confession is equivalent to the coercion inherent in \"interrogation\" for which\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings are required. However, the United States Supreme Court explicitly rejected this argument in\n   <em>\n    Innis,\n   </em>\n   explaining that\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   protection is only triggered by \"a measure of compulsion above and beyond that inherent in custody itself.\"\n   <em>\n    Innis,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182222\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/291/#p301\">\n    446 U.S. at 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182222\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/291/#p301\">\n    100 S.Ct. at 1689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182222\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/291/#p301\">\n    64 L.Ed.2d at 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the\n   <em>\n    Innis\n   </em>\n   Court held that a defendant's voluntary confession made in custody while riding in a police car where the officers were suggestively discussing the defendant's crime was not \"interrogation\", Defendant's argument in this case, that he was subjected to any \"interrogation\" for\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   purposes, is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Defendant further argues that the trial court erred by denying his motion for a continuance. The standard of review for a trial court's ruling on a motion for a continuance\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   is addressed to the discretion of the trial court, and absent a gross abuse of that discretion, the trial court's ruling is not subject to review. When a motion to continue raises a constitutional issue, the trial court's ruling is fully reviewable upon appeal. Even if the motion raises a constitutional issue, a denial of a motion to continue is grounds for a new trial only when defendant shows both that the denial was\n   erroneous and that he suffered prejudice as a result of the error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    State v.
