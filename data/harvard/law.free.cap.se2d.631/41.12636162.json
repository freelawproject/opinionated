U.S. CONST. amend. V. In this case, Defendant argues that the Fifth Amendment protects him from producing (1) his medical records and (2) factual information regarding medications that he may have been under the influence of at the time of the accident. We uphold the order to produce his medical records but reverse the order compelling him to disclose factual information regarding his use of medications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The facts indicate that on 7 March 2004, Defendant Mickey Hayes's vehicle collided with a tractor trailer driven by Mark Joseph Horn and owned by Plaintiff Roadway Express, Inc. As a result of the collision, the tractor trailer struck a bridge guardrail causing the tractor to detach from the trailer, fall off the bridge and overturn before landing on an embankment below the bridge. Mr. Horn died at the scene of the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs Roadway Express, Inc. and Constance Horn, widow of the truck driver, brought an action against Mr. Hayes and Inzone, Inc. Plaintiffs alleged that Mr. Hayes was legally intoxicated from beverages that he had consumed at Inzone nightclub/sports bar from which Plaintiffs sought recovery based on its alleged willful, wanton, and reckless disregard for the rights of others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During discovery, Plaintiff Roadway Express requested all medical records regarding Defendant Hayes's medical treatment after the accident. Defendant objected to the discovery request, arguing that his medical records were protected by the physician-patient privilege and his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The trial judge ordered Defendant to produce the requested medical records under seal and conducted an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   inspection. Afterwards, on 17 June 2005, the trial judge ordered Defendant to provide copies of the records to Plaintiff on the condition that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The records and the information contained therein are not to be shared with anyone other than experts retained by the parties (but not if such experts are also retained by the State to assist with the criminal prosecution of Hayes arising out of the subject collision).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff also served a set of admissions on Defendant to:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   1. Admit that on March 6, 2004, you took the prescription medication diazepam.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   2. Admit that on March 7, 2004, you took the prescription medication diazepam.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   3. Admit that during the early morning of March 7, 2004, you were under the influence of the prescription medicine diazepam.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   4. Admit that on March 7, 2004, the prescription medication diazepam was present in your system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   5. Admit that you consumed alcoholic beverages during the late evening of March 6, and the early morning of March 7, 2004, while knowing diazepam was present in your system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Additionally, Plaintiff, through interrogatories, asked whether Defendant had been taking any prescription medications at the time of the accident, including diazepam. Defendant refused to respond to Plaintiff's request for admissions or interrogatories relating to any prescription drugs he may have been under the influence of at the time of the accident, arguing that such information was protected under the physician-patient privilege and the Fifth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On 23 June 2005, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel production of Defendant's responses to Plaintiff's request for admissions and interrogatories. On 30 June 2005, the trial judge granted Plaintiff's motion to compel and ordered Defendant to serve complete responses to Plaintiff's request for admissions and interrogatories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   From the 17 June 2005 order to produce his medical records, and the 30 June 2005 order to respond to Plaintiff's request for admissions and interrogatories, Defendant appeals. But we note that discovery orders are interlocutory and therefore not immediately appealable unless they affect a substantial right.\n   <em>\n    Isom v.

In the initial order ordering the production of Defendant's medical records under seal for an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review, the trial judge limited the scope of the production by requesting only those medical records that mention or reflect the results of any tests performed to\n   determine Defendant's blood alcohol content and the presence of controlled substances in his body. It was only after the trial judge reviewed the medical records and determined their relevance to the matter that he ordered Defendant to produce them to Plaintiff.

Plaintiff argues that the trial judge's statement in the order compelling Defendant to respond to the discovery requests that \"the information is not to be shared with anyone other than experts retained by the parties (but not if such experts are also retained by the State to assist with the criminal prosecution of Hayes arising out of the subject collision) and persons assisting with the prosecution or defense of the action[,]\" cures any concerns about the production of this evidence in any other proceeding, including a criminal matter. We hold, however, that this limitation is insufficient to ensure that Defendant's Fifth Amendments rights are protected and that there is no possibility of danger of self-incrimination. We, therefore, conclude the trial court erred when ordering Defendant to respond to Plaintiff's second request for admissions\n   and interrogatories. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court's 30 June 2005 order compelling Defendant to respond to Plaintiff's second request for admissions and second set of interrogatories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Notwithstanding, Defendant's refusal to respond to Plaintiff's request for admissions and interrogatories related to any prescription drugs he may have been under the influence of at the time of the accident may preclude him from asserting certain affirmative defenses.\n   <em>\n    McKillop v.
