We take this occasion to respond to the two issues Alliant has called to our attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-4\">Alliant first contends that the reference in the disputes clause to \u201cclaims arising under\u201d the contract does not apply to the breach of contract claim it made in this case. For that reason, Alliant argues, it was not required to continue performance pending resolution of that claim. Alliant argues that only the alternate disputes clause set forth at 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 52.233-1, which refers to \u201cclaims arising under or relating to\u201d the contract, covers contractor claims for breach of contract, and that only if Alliant\u2019s contract had contained the alternate disputes clause would Alliant have had to perform pending the resolution of its claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">Alliant\u2019s challenge fails because, even assuming Alliant is right that breach of contract claims are not covered by the standard disputes clause \u2014 an issue we do not decide \u2014 Alliant did not present its claim as one for breach of contract. Instead, it sought a ruling that under the terms of the contract it was not required to perform the option. Neither of the letters that Alliant submitted to the contracting officer mentioned breach of contract, and Alliant\u2019s complaint in the Court of Federal Claims did not allege that the government breached the contract or request any damages for breach. What Alliant alleged was that the government\u2019s attempted option exercise was \u201cinvalid\u201d because it did not comport with the option clause, and that the government was therefore not entitled to invoke its rights under that clause. While our original opinion considered whether the government had committed a breach by imposing a cardinal change, that analytical step did not change the nature of Alliant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">Alliant traces the language of the two alternative disputes clauses to the jurisdictional distinction between the boards of contract appeals and the Court of Claims prior to the Contract Disputes Act (CDA). Government contracts at that time included provisions under which the boards had jurisdiction only over cases \u201carising under this contract.\u201d <em>See United States v. Utah Constr. Co., </em>384 U.S. 394, 397-98, 86 S.Ct. 1545, 16 L.Ed.2d 642 (1966). Alliant suggests that the boards\u2019 jurisdiction was limited to disputes concerning equitable adjustments; implicit in that suggestion is the conclusion that the boards\u2019 jurisdiction did not encompass requests for declaratory judgments on issues of contract interpretation. That position, however, does not comport with the cases decided by the boards. In <em>Catalytic Engineering and Manufacturing Corp., </em>72-1 B.C.A. \u00b6 9342, at 43,354 (ASBCA 1972), for example, the board concluded that contract interpretation \u201cis a question cognizable under the contract\u201d and thus within its jurisdiction. Alliant\u2019s request for interpretation of its contract therefore did \u201carise under the contract\u201d as the pre-CDA boards of contract appeals understood those terms. <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp., </em>83-1 B.C.A. \u00b6 16,377, at 81,421 (ASBCA 1983) (\u201chistorically and traditionally, the Board has assumed jurisdiction over issues involving disputes as to the interpretation of contract provisions and determination of the rights and obligations of the parties under the provisions of a contract\u201d). In particular, the boards\u2019 pre-CDA jurisdiction, although limited to claims \u201carising under\u201d the contract, included the authority to interpret contract provisions governing the exercise of options in order to determine whether options were validly exercised. <em>Id. </em>(citing pre-CDA board decisions). Accordingly, even accepting Alliant\u2019s contention that the two alternative disputes clauses must be read in light of their preCDA interpretations, the standard \u201carising under\u201d disputes clause in Alliant\u2019s contract required Alliant to continue performance pending the disposition of its claim, as discussed in our original opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">Alliant\u2019s second argument on rehearing is that because the Court of Federal Claims issued a declaratory judgment that differed in some respects from the contracting officer\u2019s interpretation of Alli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1381\">*1381</page-number>ant\u2019s obligations under the option clause, Alliant was freed of its obligations under the disputes clause. In making that argument, Alliant points to the requirement of the disputes clause that the contractor shall \u201ccomply with any decision of the Contracting Officer.\u201d The disputes clause, however, also requires the contractor to \u201cproceed diligently with performance of [the] contract pending final resolution of any request for relief, claim, appeal, or action arising under the contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">As we explained in the original opinion, Alliant was not obligated to act in accordance with the contracting officer\u2019s original decision to the extent that performance under the contract, as declared by the trial court, did not require it. But the other side of that coin is that to the extent the court upheld the contracting officer\u2019s decision, Alliant was obligated to perform in compliance -with that decision, at least pending further review. The contracting officer\u2019s decision was upheld in part by the Court of Federal Claims, and the disputes clause required Alliant to \u201ccomply with [the] decision of the contracting officer\u201d to the extent that it was sustained. If the rale were otherwise, a party in Alliant\u2019s position could seek review of a contracting officer\u2019s decision and then disregard both the contracting officer\u2019s decision and the court\u2019s order if the court\u2019s order departed from the contracting officer\u2019s decision in any respect, no matter how minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">The petition for rehearing is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
