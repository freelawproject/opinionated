We find petitioner\u2019s procedural due process rights violated and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-12\">Waters\u2019 dependency claim petition was filed October 27, 1983, alleging that Waters\u2019 decedent Paul T. Waters suffered a heart attack related to his employment with respondent Island Transportation Company and subsequently died. Waters claimed her dependency and that of her four children, all under the age of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>eighteen. Island filed an answer denying compensability. Following the exchange of answered interrogatories on the issue of causal relationship and dependency, the matter was pretried on June 24, 1985. The pretrial order listed Waters\u2019 medical expert as Herbert B. Silberner. Island apparently did not have a medical expert and the pretrial memorandum simply indicates, \u201cTo be supplied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Testimony commenced before the judge of compensation on December 9, 1985, and was thereafter continued to February 3, 1986. At the conclusion of testimony on the latter date, the judge opined, \u201cone admonition, next time I want all the lay testimony in. I don\u2019t want this to drag out with a witness a month program. Let\u2019s finish it up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The procedural history then indicates that following the February 3, 1986 hearing, the attorney for Island requested several adjournments because Island and its representatives failed to cooperate and appear for scheduled hearings. Counsel for Waters appeared on each occasion. Island\u2019s insurance carrier then went into bankruptcy and further prosecution of the case was delayed. After several months, on August 8, 1986, Waters\u2019 counsel wrote to the Director of the Division of Compensation seeking a status report. Chief Judge Napier responded and forwarded a letter inquiry to New Jersey Manufacturers Insurance Company (NJM). When this letter went unanswered, Waters\u2019 counsel again wrote to NJM who responded on October 24, 1986, indicating that the case would be listed on NJM\u2019s list in the usual course. Oh February 11, 1987, the matter was listed on the compensation judge\u2019s list as partial # 1; however, it was not moved since NJM wanted additional records. On April 22, 1987, Waters was finally able to continue with the presentation of her witnesses. The matter was recycled for May 13, 1987, however, NJM indicated its expert Dr. Burke was not available and the matter was adjourned.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">As of this date Island inexplicably had not produced its expert report, although frequently promised. On April 22, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>1987, a representative of NJM advised that the report of Dr. Burke would be forwarded prior to the next scheduled hearing. Waters\u2019 counsel was promised that Island would inform him by telephone exactly when Dr. Burke would appear. The matter was relisted for June 3, 1987, however, the promised telephone call was not made and the report was not supplied. Since the report is dated April 27, 1987, no excuse appears for counsel\u2019s failure to supply it or for the compensation judge\u2019s tacit sanction of this egregious conduct. Island had all of Waters\u2019 medical evidence while Waters had nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">On June 3, Waters\u2019 counsel, who appeared at each prior listing and who actually tried the proceedings to that date, was required to attend Superior Court ordered depositions involving nurses, doctors and five attorneys. Since Island\u2019s counsel<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> had failed to give notice of Dr. Burke\u2019s time of appearance and had not supplied his report, trial counsel sent his associate who, unfamiliar with workers\u2019 compensation practice and procedure, appeared in the court house building at 8:50 a.m. and waited in the hall. He apparently stepped into the assigned judge\u2019s court room moments after the call of the list began. Waters\u2019 case was called and he remained in the court room.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">The novice associate explained trial counsel\u2019s dilemma but was denied a postponement and ordered to proceed. This was the first postponement requested by Waters from December 1985 to June 1987. Waters\u2019 trial counsel telephoned the judge and urged him to reconsider the denial of the requested continuance. He emphasized his need to review the physician\u2019s report and conduct the critical cross-examination. The trial judge was unyielding and directed the proceeding to continue. He then allowed Dr. Burke\u2019s medical testimony and after completion of the direct and cross-examination of the physician, permitted trial counsel\u2019s associate to place on the record his objections to the proceedings including the fact that he received the April 27, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>1987 medical report only <em>moments </em>before Dr. Burke\u2019s direct testimony commenced. The judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-5\">Well, Counsel, this is the number one case on the list. It is a partially tried case, and therefore concerns priority. As to your complaint that you weren\u2019t notified, you ought to know from practice as well in this division that there\u2019s no formal notice required to be produced. If you wanted to do that, you could have ascertained the list from Mr. MacDermid<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and requested an adjournment then. You did not in fact do that. This is the number one written case. You missed the call, and appeared late. The doctor was already en route and your adversary was here, and it seemed only fair to me. And also, there\u2019s no requirement that you review the doctor\u2019s report in advance. So I don't see any merits from the argument. But as far as my proceeding with the case, you have to understand that the Supreme Court of this State, of this division and the Administrative Office all will proceed with the same rule, which is <em>justice delayed is justice denied. </em>It\u2019s all part of my job. As to the conclusion, I don\u2019t see anything that\u2019s manifested on the fair proceeding today. It\u2019s my understanding, Mr. Ferrara, that the license from the State of New Jersey to practice law, you appeared here, the doctor was here, and no steps were taken in advance in order to adjourn the matter, and I see no reason why it should be adjourned. I see no point for the doctor to have to come in a second time. He was already here. The doctor was here for about a half hour before he took the stand. I see no reason I shouldn\u2019t take his testimony. His testimony will remain on the Record. [Emphasis in original].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The detailed procedural history, Island\u2019s numerous adjournments and the communications between the parties respecting Dr. Burke\u2019s report are not contested. Island\u2019s position is simply that Waters is not entitled to recover and hence the dismissal should be upheld. We therefore examine Island\u2019s failure to produce its medical expert\u2019s report before the June 3 hearing; the resultant prejudice to Waters occasioned by the judge\u2019s failure to continue the matter as requested, and his requirement that an associate who was inexperienced and unfamiliar with compensation practice, heart cases and with this case in particular, proceed with the extremely difficult cross-examination of Island's medical expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">The primary focus of the administration of justice, be it in the traditional courts of justice or before administrative agencies, is the same: the delivery of quality justice, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>elements of which are (1) due process or fairness which includes an opportunity for adequate pretrial preparation; (2) expeditious disposition, and (3) economically effective operation. The court must balance these elements and never favor the latter two above the first, fair play. <em>Georgis v. Scarpa, </em>226 <em>N.J.Super. </em>244 (App.Div.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Preliminarily, we observe that a workers\u2019 compensation judge is not strictly bound by rules of evidence and procedure but must respect and insure due process and fundamental rights of litigants. <em>Jasaitis v. City of Paterson, </em>48 <em>N.J.Super. </em>103, 109 (App.Div.1957), aff\u2019d 31 <em>N.J. </em>81 (1959). These fundamental rights entitle all parties in workers\u2019 compensation proceedings to present testimony in critical areas such as medical issues involving causation. <em>Vaughn v. State, </em>151 <em>N.J.Super. </em>251, 253-254 (App.Div.1977). Inherent in this right is not only the ability to present medical testimony but the right to cross-examine adverse experts. <em>Paco v. American Leather Mfg. Co., </em>213 <em>N.J.Super. </em>90, 93 (App.Div.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Cross-examination is perhaps the single, most important tool of the trial lawyer; the effective use of this tool in the hands of the skilled examiner often is the difference between victory and defeat in the court room. Professor Wigmore said this of cross-examination: \u201cFor two centuries past, the policy of the Anglo-American system of evidence has been to regard the necessity of testing by cross-examination as a vital feature of the law.... [I]t [Cross-examination] is beyond any doubt the greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth.\u201d 5 <em>Wigmore, Evidence </em>\u00a7 1367 (Chadbourn rev. 1974) at page 32. <em>See also Georgis, </em>226 <em>N.J.Super </em>at 256; <em>Perry v. Crunden, </em>79 <em>N.J.Super. </em>285, 292 (Law Div.1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">The rules pertaining to workers\u2019 compensation hearings provide that medical reports are to be exchanged at <em>the pretrial conference, N.J.A.C. </em>12:235-5.9, and they <em>require </em>that a party give the judge and opposing counsel a <em>written curriculum vitae of its witness prior to that witness\u2019s testimony. N.J.A. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number><em>C. </em>12:235\u20145.10(j); (emphasis supplied). While the trial judge correctly noted in his decision denying the continuance that there is no \u201crequirement\u201d in the workers\u2019 compensation rules that counsel review an adverse medical expert\u2019s report prior to the testimony, there are, however, numerous New Jersey cases addressing the failure of civil litigants to produce the name and/or report of their expert witnesses and appropriate sanctions for failure to do so. <em>R. </em>4:17-4(e) of the Rules of Civil Procedure adopted in September 1987, allows a party to move for an order fixing a specific date for furnishing the other party\u2019s expert\u2019s name and report and further provides that as a part of its order, the court may prohibit the expert witness from testifying unless the report is provided pursuant to its order. <em>See also R. </em>4:17-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">In <em>Fanfarillo v. East End Motor Co., </em>172 <em>N.J.Super. </em>309, 312 (App.Div.1980), this court held that a party has a continuing duty to disclose the opinions of his expert and a failure to do so may, in the judge\u2019s discretion, result in the exclusion of that expert\u2019s opinion evidence. Even if no written report is prepared, we have held that a party must disclose the substance of its expert\u2019s opinion in advance of trial. <em>Clark v. Fog Contracting Co., </em>125 <em>N.J.Super. </em>159, 161-162 (App.Div.), certif. den. 64 <em>N.J. </em>319 (1973). The purpose of supplying an expert\u2019s report in advance is to \u201cforewarn the propounding party of the expected contents of the expert\u2019s testimony in order to enable preparation to counter such opinions with other opinion material.\u201d <em>Maurio v. Mereck Construction Co., Inc., </em>162 <em>N.J.Super. </em>566, 569 (App.Div.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Most of the litigation pertaining to production of expert witness reports is initiated by the party whose expert witness was precluded from testifying and appellate courts are understandably reluctant to uphold such a drastic sanction. <em>See, e.g., Hamilton v. Letellier Construction Co., </em>156 <em>N.J.Super. </em>336, 338 (App.Div.1978) (order of exclusion was abuse of discretion since it was tantamount to dismissal of plaintiff\u2019s claim); <em>Maurio, </em>162 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 570 (reversed trial court decision because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>we were reluctant to visit the consequences of an attorney\u2019s dereliction upon his client). In instances, however, where a party has failed to produce its expert report despite repeated orders or demands, this court has upheld the trial court decision barring the expert from testifying, <em>See, e.g., Calabrese v. Trenton State College, </em>162 <em>N.J.Super. </em>145, 151 (App.Div.1978), aff\u2019d 82 <em>N.J. </em>321 (1980). <em>See also Hamilton, </em>156 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 338 (if information regarding the expert report is willfully, or deliberately withheld, a court should take \u201cmore stringent measures\u201d). In <em>O\u2019Connor v. Altus, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>106, 130 (1975), the Supreme Court held that plaintiff\u2019s psychiatric expert should not have been allowed to testify on the grounds that a copy of his report was not submitted to the adverse party, despite several demands therefore. Respondents, who prevailed both at trial and on appeal were obviously not prejudiced by the admission of the expert\u2019s testimony so it was unnecessary for the Supreme Court to fashion a remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">In <em>Gilborges v. Wallacc, </em>153 <em>N.J.Super. </em>121 (App.Div.1977), aff\u2019d 78 <em>N.J. </em>342 (1978), plaintiff called an actuarial expert to testify. The expert was contacted by plaintiff the previous evening and had no written report. The trial judge allowed the expert to testify and respondent appealed. We upheld the trial court's ruling, finding that the trial court equitably treated plaintiff\u2019s last minute expert witness in a manner which did not result in any prejudice to respondents. The trial court extended the time for cross-examination until defense counsel had an opportunity to prepare by recessing while the witness gave defense counsel a memorandum made to prepare for testimony and an oral statement of his conclusions including the theory upon which they were based. Defense counsel then had a three-day weekend to prepare for cross-examination. <em>Id. </em>at 135-136.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">In essence, the cases demonstrate that, absent flagrant violations of an order to produce an expert\u2019s report, courts are reluctant to sanction the delinquent party by precluding an expert witness from testifying. However, the court must con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>sider the prejudice to the adverse party who has no advance time to review the expert\u2019s report and should allow a continuance or even a mistrial to ensure a just result. <em>See Gittleman v. Central Jersey Bank and Trust Co., </em>103 <em>N.J.Super. </em>175, 179 (App.Div.1967), rev\u2019d, dissent aff\u2019d 52 <em>N.J. </em>503 (1968). In effect, the court is called upon to balance expedient disposition against fair play and in almost every instance the latter prevails.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">While New Jersey court rules do not directly control the actions of a compensation judge, nevertheless, the Supreme Court observed in <em>City of Hackensack v. Winner, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>1, 29 (1980), \u201csince there are pronounced similarities in the exercise of judicial and quasi-judicial powers, it has been recognized that court-fashioned doctrines for the handling of litigation do in fact have some genuine utility and relevance in administrative proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29. In <em>Hyman v. Essex Cty. Carpet Cleaning Co., </em>157 <em>N.J.Super. </em>510 (App.Div.1978), we observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-5\">We have no doubt at all as to the affirmative answer to the first of these inquiries.' <em>Irrespective of the absence of express statutory authority and a one-year limitation imposed upon such a reopening in certain circumstances, N.J.S.A. 34:15-54, it is abundantly clear that the Division has the inherent power, \u201ccomparable to that possessed by </em>the courts <em>(R. R. 4:62-2 [now R. 4:50]), to reopen judgments for fraud, mistake, inadvertence, or other equitable ground. \u201d Beese v. First National Stores, </em>52 <em>N.J. </em>196, 200 (1968). See also <em>Estelle v. Red Bank Bd. of Ed., </em>14 <em>N.J. </em>256 (1954); <em>Stone v. Dugan Brothers of N.J., </em>1 <em>N.J.Super. </em>13 (App.Div.1948).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-6\">On the other hand, it is equally clear that a decision to reopen must not be arbitrary or based on whim. The presence of a legally adequate motivating element must be manifest. <em>We are satisfied, as we were almost three decades ago in Stone, supra, that the practice in the Division is this respect ought to be tailored after that to which the courts adhere in response to R. 4:50. It follows that in consideration of such procedure, attention to the equities involved is imperative. Beese v. First National Stores, supra </em>52 <em>N.J. </em>at 200-201. [id. at 516].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Here we find the compensation judge\u2019s actions a clear . abuse of discretion by his refusal to continue the matter for another cycle. Island agreed to produce the name and report of its expert witness in the pretrial memorandum dated <em>June 24, 1985. </em>On <em>April 22, 1987, </em>Island agreed aid the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>ordered Island to produce its expert\u2019s name and report before the next hearing scheduled for May 13, 1987. It did not. Dr. Burke prepared his written report sometime before April 27, 1987, and apparently signed it on that date. By June 3, 1987, when Dr. Burke appeared to testify, shockingly, Island had still not given Waters\u2019 a copy of his report. Island\u2019s failure to produce the report is inexcusable. Waters fully and promptly prepared and presented this case. Waters was given a definite date by which a report was to be received and in light of the impact this witness\u2019s testimony might have on Waters\u2019 claim, the compensation judge should have made some accommodations for Waters\u2019 counsel, most probably by continuing the case to another cycle.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">None of the reasons advanced by the compensation judge are even marginally significant enough to justify proceeding immediately with Dr. Burke\u2019s testimony. Trial counsel\u2019s associate, because of his inexperience, mistakenly waited in the wrong place and missed part of the call. We cannot see how justice is served by punishing Waters or counsel for this understandable mistake when balanced against the carrier\u2019s egregious actions, violation of the compensation rules and its inordinate delay. Dr. Burke had apparently not yet arrived and probably could have been called and told not to appear. At worst, the only time Dr. Burke would have wasted would be a round trip to the compensation court and in that event costs could have been assessed against the appropriate party. The judge\u2019s comment that <em>\u201cjustice delayed is justice denied </em>\u201d is wholly inappropriate given the numerous delays and favored adjournments granted Island.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Here, Island delayed, sought and received continuances and failed to comply with concepts of fundamental fairness in dealing with Waters\u2019 counsel. Ironically, it is the diligent Waters who was punished. It is more accurate to say justice in the final phase of this compensation trial was rushed so as to deny Waters her day in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>After careful review of the medical testimony and the judge\u2019s opinion, we find the judge\u2019s decision allowing Dr. Burke to testify without giving Waters\u2019 counsel an opportunity to review his report clearly prejudicial. We observe that the judge quoted extensively from Dr. Burke\u2019s testimony to support his finding of no causation. <em>Cf. Nelson v. American Container Corp., </em>145 <em>N.J.Super. </em>448 (App.Div.1976) (harmless error where employer was unable to complete the cross-examination of the injured workman where it was apparent the compensation judge placed no substantial reliance on the employee\u2019s testimony). Additionally, the associate\u2019s unfamiliarity with the prior testimony in the case and with workers\u2019 compensation heart cases in general clearly resulted in prejudice to petitioner. Indeed, the most experienced and talented practitioner would not undertake such a task of cross-examination without extensive preparation. To order an associate unfamiliar with a case to proceed may be appropriate under some conditions, however, under these circumstances it was a gross abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">As the court opined in <em>Allegro v. Afton Village Corp., </em>9 <em>N.J. </em>156 (1952):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-5\">[C]ourts exist for the sole purpose of rendering justice between parties according to law. While the expedition of business and the full utilization of their time is highly to be desired, the duty of administering justice in each individual case must not be lost sight of as their paramount objective. [Id. at 161].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">In <em>Santos v. Estate of Santos, </em>217 <em>N.J.Super. </em>411 (App.Div.1987), we recounted what Judge Bigelow said in <em>Pepe v. Urban, </em>11 <em>N.J.Super. </em>385 (App.Div.), <em>cert. </em>den. 7 <em>N.J. </em>80 (1951).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-7\">We must never forget that courts exist for the sole purpose of rendering justice according to law. No eagerness to expedite business, or to utilize fully the court\u2019s time, should be permitted to interfere with our high duty of administering justice in the individual case. <em>Id. </em>at 389.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-8\"><em>See also Allegro, </em>9 <em>N.J. </em>at 161. There is an absolute need to remember that the primary mission of the judiciary is to see justice done in individual cases.

Accordingly, the judgment under review must be reversed and a new trial ordered in accordance with the parameters established in <em>Hellwig v.
