The contested regulation permits physical therapists to engage in examination and instruction without physician direction and authorizes modification of treatment, previously prescribed by a physician, when such modification is consistent with the directed treatment. Appellants contend that the regulation exceeds the scope of the Board\u2019s delegated authority and is <em>ultra vires. </em>We agree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">A brief description of the applicable statutory and regulatory provisions is necessary for a full understanding of the issue presented. The State Board of Physical Therapy (Board) was created by the Physical Therapist Licensing Act of 1983 <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>45:9-37.11 <em>et seq.). </em>The Board is under the Division of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:9-37.15. The articulated objective of the statutory scheme and the principal function of the Board is the \u201cregulation of the practice of physical therapy and the establishment of clear licensure standards.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:9-37.12. In its findings, the Legislature declared that the Act was designed to protect the health and welfare of our citizens by \u201cidentifying to the public those individuals who are qualified and legally authorized to practice physical therapy.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In order to effectuate this statutory policy, the Board was empowered to \u201c[r]eview the qualifications of applicants for licensure, [i]nsure the proper conduct and standards of examinations, [i]ssue and renew, [sjuspend, revoke or [refuse] to renew [licenses], [m]aintain [appropriate] records, ... and [promulgate rules and regulations necessary for the performance of its duties and the implementation of [the] [A]ct.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:9-37.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Under the Act, a \u201cphysical therapist\u201d is defined as \u201ca person who is licensed to practice physical therapy ... [and who] shall provide physical therapy treatment to an individual upon the direction of a licensed physician, dentist or other health care practitioner authorized to prescribe treatment.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:9-37.13(b). The term \u201cphysical therapy\u201d is defined by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:9-37.13(d) as the \u201chealth specialty concerned with the prevention of physical disability and the habilitation and rehabilitation of congenital or acquired physical disabilities resulting from, or secondary to, injury or disease.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:9-37.14 defines the phrase \u201cpractice of physical therapy.\u201d That section provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-5\">a. The practice of physical therapy shall include examination, treatment or instruction to detect, assess, prevent, correct, alleviate and limit physical disability, bodily malfunction and pain from injury, disease or other physical condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">Physical therapy shall also include the evaluation, administration and modification of treatment and instruction, including, but not limited to, the use of physical measures, activities, agents and devices for preventive and therapeutic purposes; neurodevelopmental procedures; the performance and evaluation of tests and measurements; and the provision of consultative, educational and other advisory services for the purpose of preventing or reducing the incidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>and severity of physical disability, bodily malfunction and pain consistent with the practice of physical therapy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-6\">b. Nothing in this section shall authorize the diagnosis of disease or the practice of medicine and surgery or chiropractic by any person not licensed to do so pursuant to chapter 9 of Title 45 of the Revised Statutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-7\">c. Nothing in this section shall authorize the practice of dentistry by any person not licensed to do so pursuant to chapter 6 of Title 45 of the Revised Statutes. <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>45:9-37.14].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">Pursuant to its rule-making authority, the Board proposed the promulgation of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:39A-2.2 which, as originally drafted, read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-9\">(a) A licensed physical therapist may initiate physical therapy treatment, but only after having received physician direction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-10\">(b) A licensed physical therapist may engage in the following activities and practices without physician direction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-11\">1. Physical therapy examination;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-12\">2. Physical therapy instruction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-13\">3. Modification of physical therapy treatment previously initiated upon physician direction. [17 <em>N.J.R. </em>2356]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-14\">Following public comments, the Board proposed a revised version of the rule, permitting a physical therapist to conduct electromyographic testing, to the extent his or her training qualified him or her to do so, and to modify a physician\u2019s directed course of treatment where such modification is consistent with the initially prescribed treatment. 18 <em>N.J.R. </em>1177(b). On October 14, 1986, after another period of public comment, the Board rejected subsection (a) of the proposed rule, but adopted subsection (b). The rule ultimately adopted reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-15\">(b) A licensed physical therapist may engage in the following activities and practices without physician direction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-16\">1. Physical therapy examination, excluding electromyographic testing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-17\">2. Physical therapy instruction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-18\">3. Modification of physical therapy treatment previously initiated upon physician direction provided that the modification is consistent with that physician direction (for example, the physical therapist, in the exercise of his or her discretion, may determine to utilize a variety of modalities to effectuate the direction given by the physician). If the physical therapist wishes to alter a therapeutic plan in a manner not consistent with the initial physician direction, contact must be made with the patient\u2019s physician for the purpose of obtaining additional direction. <em>[N.J.A.C. </em>13:39A-2.2(b)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>The term \u201cphysical therapy examination\u201d is defined by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:39A-2.1 as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-5\">includ[ng] a taking of a patient\u2019s history of complaint, a hands-on evaluation or assessment of objective symptoms presented as well as the utilization of tests and measures to assist the physical therapist in the evaluation of the patient\u2019s objective signs and symptoms including, but not limited to, the use of tests to assess postural alignment; joint mobility and function; muscle and nerve function, including electropbysiologic status; movement skill; gait; necessity for assistive devices; fit of orthoses and prostheses; cardiopulmonary status; sensory and motor function, including related pain and tenderness; and performance of activities required in daily living; but does not include the examination of any person conducted for the purpose of diagnosing any disease or organic condition. Nothing herein is intended to preclude a physical therapist from conducting an examination within the scope of his practice, consistent with his education credentials or taking a history which is designed to ascertain if contraindications to therapy may be present and thus the referral to a plenary licensed physician is warranted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-6\"><em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:39A-2.1 defines \u201cphysical therapy instruction\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-7\">includpng] the provision of consultative, educational or other advisory services for the purpose of preventing or reducing the incidence and severity of physical disability, bodily malfunction or pain from injury, disease or other physical condition or for the purpose of providing information to patients or groups of interested persons regarding the value of physical therapy agents and measures in general or with regard to specific physical conditions. Physical therapy instruction shall not be construed to include activities designed to offer specific therapeutic effect or benefit to a specified person. To the extent that instruction may involve any hands-on contact between the physical therapist and the person receiving physical therapy instruction, that contact shall be for demonstration purposes only.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">The same rule defines \u201cphysical therapy treatment\u201d in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-9\">\u2018Physical therapy treatment\u2019 includes the administration of physical therapy measures, activities, agents or devices, including but not limited to postural correction; joint mobilization; range of motion exercise; muscle and soft tissue stretching; muscle strengthening exercise; balance and coordination exercises; massage techniques; pre and post-natal exercises; growth and development programs; biofeedback techniques; perceptual training; electrophysiologic tests and modalities; pulmonary hygiene treatment; breathing exercises; postural drainage; gait training; hydrotherapy and paraffin bath when used for preventative and therapeutic purposes to correct or limit physical disorders or dysfunctions. <em>[N.J.A.C. </em>13:39A-2.1],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">Finally, \u201cphysician direction\u201d is defined by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:39A-2.1 as any of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>1. Written prescription of a plenary licensed physician, or a dentist or a podiatrist, to the extent that the treatment prescribed is within the scope of his or her practice, or such other health \u00abare; practitioner authorized to prescribe treatment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-6\">2. Documentation of physician clearance for the patient for treatment which may include a countersigning of the physical therapist\u2019s proposed plan of treatment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-7\">8. Verbal prescription, in person or via telephone, which shall be memorialized by the prescriber in writing within two weeks. But, in no ease, will physician direction be construed to have been provided on the basis of a patient\u2019s representation that he or she has obtained a physician's clearance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">Against this statutory and regulatory backdrop, the sole issue presented by this appeal is whether, as appellants contend, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:39A-2.2(b) constitutes an <em>ultra vires </em>act by permitting a physical therapist to engage in examination or instruction without physician direction and by allowing modification of a course of treatment prescribed by a physician when such alteration is consistent with the directed treatment. Appellants argue that the regulation contravenes the statutory mandate, requiring that a physical therapist \u201cshall provide physical therapy treatment to an individual [only] upon the direction of a licensed physician....\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:9-37.13(b). They also contend that the regulation far exceeds the contemplation of the enabling statute by permitting physical therapists to engage in the unauthorized practice of medicine, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:9-5.1. Conversely, the Board argues that the statutory definition of the \u201cpractice of physical therapy\u201d contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:9-37.11 consists of three wholly distinct and severable components, <em>is., </em>examination, treatment and instruction. Bo posited, the Board asserts that the restrictive language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:9\u201487.18(b), requiring that \u201cphysical therapy treatment\u201d be administered only \u201cupon the direction of a licensed physician,\u201d does not apply to examination and instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">We approach the issue presented keenly aware of the limited scope of our review powers. In a lengthy series of opinions, our Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized that \u201c[a]dministrative rules and regulations have in their support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>the rebuttable presumption of validity if they come within the ambit of [the agency\u2019s] delegated authority.\u201d <em>In re Weston, </em>36 <em>N.J. </em>258, 263 (1961), <em>cert. </em>den. 369 <em>U.S. </em>864, 82 <em>S.Ct. </em>1029, 8 <em>L.Ed. 2d </em>84 (1962). <em>See also New Jersey Guild of Hearing Aid Dispensers v. Long, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>544, 561-564 (1978); <em>In re Regulation F-22, Office of Milk Industry, New Jersey, </em>32 <em>N.J. </em>258, 261-262 (1960); <em>Flanagan v. Civil Service Department, </em>29 <em>N.J. </em>1, 12 (1959). <em>Cf. Franklin v. New Jersey Dept. of Human Services, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>1, 16 (1988). Although an administrative regulation \u201cmust be within the fair contemplation of the delegation of the enabling statute,\u201d <em>Southern Jersey Airways v. Nat. Bk. of Secaucus, </em>108 <em>N.J. Super. </em>369, 383 (App.Div.1970), the legislative grant of authority \u201cis to be liberally construed in order to enable the agency to accomplish its statutory responsibilities.\u201d <em>New Jersey Guild of Hearing Aid Dispensers v. Long, supra, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>at 562. Toward that end, the courts \u201creadily imply such incidental powers as are [reasonably] necessary to effectuate fully the legislative intent.\u201d <em>Ibid. See also In re Suspension of Heller, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>292, 303 (1977); <em>Cammarata v. Essex County Park Comm\u2019n, </em>26 <em>N.J. </em>404, 411 (1958). In sum, regulations issued by an administrative agency are cloaked with a presumption of legitimacy and should be sustained unless clearly <em>ultra vires </em>on their face. <em>In re Regulation F-22, Office of Milk Industry, New Jersey, supra, </em>32 <em>N.J. </em>at 261-262.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Within this conceptual framework, our inquiry necessarily focuses upon whether the administrative regulation falls within the boundaries of the legislative delegation. <em>Swede v. City of Clifton, </em>22 <em>N.J. </em>303, 312 (1956). Administrative action \u201cis of necessity restrained by the declared policy and spirit of the statute and the criteria and standards therein laid down, for a grant not thus confined would constitute a delegation of essential legislative power in contravention of constitutional limitations.\u201d <em>Abelson\u2019s, Inc. v. N.J. State Board of Optometrists, </em>5 <em>N.J. </em>412, 423 (1950). It is a corollary of this principle that \u201cthe rules and regulations ... cannot subvert or enlarge upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>statutory policy....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 424. The distinction is between the making and the execution of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Applying these principles, we are convinced that <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:39A-2.2(b) constitutes an \u201c[e]xtrajurisdictional administrative act\u201d and is thus void. <em>Swede v. City of Clifton, supra, </em>22 <em>N.J. </em>at 312. Contrary to the Board\u2019s contention, we perceive nothing in the Act or in its statutory history suggestive of a legislative design to recognize three hermetically sealed, watertight components of physical therapy, <em>i.e., </em>examination, treatment and instruction. By creating this ethereal distinction, the Board seeks to remove the physician from perhaps the most critical aspect of the medical care of patients, <em>i.e., </em>the determination of the need for and lack of contraindication of physical therapy. Neither the statutory language nor the legislative history support such an abrupt and major change of our law.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">The first legislative recognition of the role of physical therapists in our health care system can be traced to a 1903 amendment to the 1894 statutory scheme, regulating the practice of medicine. <em>L. </em>1903, <em>c. </em>228. The amendment provided in pertinent part that a \u201cmasseur or electrician, operating in each particular case under the specific direction of a regularly licensed physician or surgeon\u201d was excepted from the general prohibition against the unlicensed practice of medicine. This limitation on the practice of physical therapy, requiring physician direction, was subsequently carried over and retained in various amendments adopted in 1915 <em>(L. </em>1915, <em>c. </em>271, \u00a7 6), 1921 <em>(L. </em>1921, c. 221, \u00a7 3), 1935 <em>(L. </em>1935, c. 226, \u00a7 2), 1939 <em>(L. </em>1939, <em>c. </em>115), 1943 <em>(L. </em>1943, c. 74), 1944 <em>(L. </em>1944, c. 167), and 1953 <em>(L. </em>1953, <em>c. </em>421).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">In 1963, the Legislature established an examination and registration scheme for the regulation of physical therapists to be administered by the Board of Medical Examiners <em>(L. </em>1963, <em>c. </em>169). The statute created a \u201cphysical therapy advisory committee\u201d in the Division of Consumer Affairs to assist the Board of Medical Examiners in establishing standards of practice. <em>(L. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>1963, c. 169, \u00a7 10). The legislation retained the restriction, as in prior statutes, that a \u201cregistered physical therapist\u201d can administer care only \u201cunder the specific direction of a regularly licensed physician or surgeon.\u201d (L. 1963, <em>c. </em>169, \u00a7 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The last legislative modification of the statutory scheme, prior to enactment of the present Act, occurred in 1975. The statute defined \u201cphysical therapist\u201d as \u201ca person who practices physical therapy, under the direction and supervision of a licensed physician, or a person who renders physical therapy services upon the direction of a licensed physician.\" <em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:9-37.1(d). The phrase \u201cphysical therapy\u201d was defined in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-6\">'Physical therapy\u2019 or \u2018physiotherapy\u2019 shall mean and include treatment of a human being by the use of exercise, massage heat, cold, water, radiant energy, electricity, or sound for the purpose of correcting or alleviating any physical condition or preventing the development of any physical disability; or the performance of appropriate tests and measurements, authorized by the State Board of Medical Examiners, to assess the extent of body malfunction provided, however, that physical therapy shall not include radiology or electrosurgery. <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>45:9-87.1(c)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">While we recognize that the Legislature, in adopting the 1983 Act, changed the definition of \u201cphysical therapist\u201d <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>45:9-37.13(b), \u201cphysical therapy\u201d <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>45:9-37.13(d), and \u201cpractice of physical therapy\u201d <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>45:9-37.14), we discern no clearly stated legislative purpose to permit examination and instruction without physician direction. Nor do we perceive a legislative design to permit modification of treatment modalities previously prescribed by a physician without his or her specific direction. Such a radical recasting of the physical therapist's role should not be inferred absent explicit legislative language authorizing this major change. <em>See DeFazio v. Haven Savings and Loan Ass\u2019n., 22 N.J. </em>511, 519 (1966); <em>Carlo v. The Okonite Callender Cable Co., </em>3 <em>N.J. </em>253, 265 (1949); <em>Marley v. Palmyra Bor., </em>193 <em>N.J. Super. </em>271, 292 (Law Div.1988). Rather, we glean from our review of the predecessor statutes a clearly expressed intent, reiterated over the course of many years in numerous amendments, to require physician direction of physi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>cal therapy services. While we do not doubt that the practice of physical therapy requires the exercise of some independent discretion, <em>see, e.g., Matter of Promulgation of N.J.A.C. 13:35-6.14, </em>205 <em>N.J. Super. </em>492, 497 (App.Div.1985), we find nothing to suggest that the Legislature contemplated such a radical dissipation of the physician\u2019s role, as urged by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The evidence abounds the other way. In the <em>Statement of the Senate Labor Industry and Professions Committee, </em>which accompanied the bill, it was said that \u201c[a] physical therapist would be permitted to provide physical therapy treatment to patients upon the direction of a physician, dentist or otherwise qualified health professional. Nothing in the bill authorizes a physical therapist ... to practice medicine, surgery, chiropractic or dentistry.\u201d Significantly, in adopting the 1983 Act, the Legislature did not modify or alter <em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:9-21(k), which excepts from the prohibitory provisions barring unlicensed individuals from practicing medicine, a \u201cphysical therapist ... while operating under the specific direction of a regularly licensed physician or surgeon.\u201d In a similar vein, the <em>Statement of the Assembly Higher Education and Regulated Professions Committee </em>is devoid of anything to suggest a legislative intent to change the requirement, which has existed for well over three quarters of a century, mandating physician direction. According to the Committee, the bill\u2019s major provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-7\">1. Define the practice of physical therapy (section 3);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-8\">2. Establish a nine member State Board of Physical Therapy in the Department of Law and Public Safety to regulate the practice of physical therapy and to examine and license physical therapists and physical therapist assistants (section 5);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-9\">3. Prohibit fee splitting (section 11);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-10\">4. Establish criteria for licensure as a physical therapist or physical therapist assistant for graduates of both United States and foreign schools of physical therapy (sections 12 and 13);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-11\">5. Provide for licensure reciprocity with states with education and experience requirements substantially similar to New Jersey (section 18);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>6. Allow the temporary licensure of an applicant pending examination or of an out-of-state physical therapist temporarily on assignment in this State (section 11); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-5\">7. Allow the licensure without examination of currently registered physical therapists and physical therapist assistants (section 22).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Our thorough review of the Act convinces us that the principal objective of the Legislature was to strengthen licensure requirements. In our view, the Legislature never intended to authorize physical therapy examination and instruction without physician direction, or modification of treatment modalities previously prescribed by a physician. We thus hold that the Board exceeded its delegated powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">Accordingly, the action of the Board in promulgating <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:39A-2.2(b) is reversed and the regulation is declared void.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
