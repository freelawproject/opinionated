He also was required to pay the \u201c$25 lab analysis fee\u201d pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-20b, the mandatory Drug Enforcement and Demand Reduction (DEDR) fine of $1000 for third degree drug offenses pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-15(a)(3), and deprived of his privilege to secure a driver\u2019s license for six months after he reached the age of 17 years pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-16. He appeals from the imposition of that sentence, based solely on the assertion that the manda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>tory nature of the penalty required by the DEDR statute is constitutionally infirm for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">The facts are not in dispute. On Wednesday, September 2, 1987, L.M. then 14 years old, was standing with two others, Kenneth Nero, an adult, and R.G., another juvenile, within 1000 feet of Paterson School Number 6. Paterson police officers on surveillance observed an unidentified black male approach Nero and R.G. and after a brief conversation, hand Nero some money. Nero then directed the black male to L.M., who handed him a small object which he placed in his pants pocket and walked away. Upon observing a second similar transaction, the police moved in to arrest L.M. and his associates. L.M. was observed to place several vials into his mouth but the officers forced him to spit out the vials which were found to contain \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">L.M. argues that the mandatory DEDR penalties unconstitutionally discriminate between those juveniles who are adjudicated delinquent for committing drug offenses and those whose adjudications are based on any other offense because the latter are not subject to mandatory fines even if they have committed \u201cmore serious offenses.\u201d Further, he claims that the penalty provisions are fundamentally unfair and violate constitutional principles of due process by placing an unjustifiably heavy burden on a juvenile\u2019s liberty and property interests and amount to cruel and unusual punishment. Finally, he contends that both <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-15 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-16 are violative of the prohibition against statutory amendment and incorporation by reference contained in Art. IV, \u00a7 VII, par. 5 of the 1947 New Jersey Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">The State answers that the mandatory penalties required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-15 are rationally related to the State\u2019s legitimate interest in deterring the possession, use and distribution of controlled dangerous substances by juveniles as well as adults; that L.M.\u2019s arguments concern \u201conly an administrative problem for the State\u201d in collecting the DEDR penalties and not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>a constitutional infirmity in the imposition of these penalties; that the mandatory penalty scheme is neither arbitrary nor discriminatory; and that the penalties are not excessive simply because of L.M.\u2019s particular inability to pay them, especially in light of the alternative methods of payment or punishment which are available, nor are they \u201cshocking\u201d or \u201cdisproportionate\u201d to the offenses committed. Finally, the State contends that the statutory provisions in question are not the type of fraudulent or deceptive legislation that would offend the prohibition on amendment or incorporation by reference contained in Art. IV, \u00a7 VII, par. 5 of the New Jersey Constitution. We agree with the State and reject L.M.\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">First, the mandatory DEDR penalties of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-15 do not discriminate against juveniles in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as well as Art. I, par. 1, of the New Jersey Constitution. Equal protection claims under the Fourteenth Amendment are subject to a three-tier analysis, depending upon the type of right affected. Governmental action which purports to regulate a \u201cfundamental right\u201d or disparately treats a \u201csuspect class\u201d is subject to strict <em>scrutiny\u2014i.e., </em>the action must further a compelling state interest and must be the least restrictive available means of accomplishing that objective. <em>San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, </em>411 <em>U.S. </em>1, 16, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>1278, 1287, 36 L.Ed.2d 16, reh\u2019g den, 411 <em>U.S. </em>959, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>1919, 36 L.Ed.2d 418 (1973); <em>Barone v. Dept. of Human Services, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>355, 364-65 (1987). \u201cIntermediate scrutiny\u201d is applied in analyzing such actions which regulate a \u201csemi-suspect class\u201d or affect a fundamental right in an indirect <em>manner\u2014i.e., </em>the action complained of must serve an \u201cimportant\u201d governmental objective and be \u201csubstantially related\u201d to the achievement of that objective. <em>Craig v. Boren, </em>429 <em>U.S. </em>190, 197, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>451, 456, 50 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>397 (1976) reh\u2019g den. 429 <em>U.S. </em>1124, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>1161, 51 L.Ed.2d 574 (1977); <em>Barone, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>at 365. If neither \u201csuspect\u201d or \u201csemi-suspect\u201d classifications nor fundamental rights are involved, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>the governmental action complained of is subjected only to a \u201crational basis\u201d <em>analysis\u2014i.e., </em>the action must be rationally related to the achievement of a legitimate state interest. <em>Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement v. Murgia, </em>427 <em>U.S. </em>307, 312, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>2562, 2566, 49 L.Ed.2d 520 (1976); <em>Barone, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>at 365; <em>Rubin v.

Corbitt, </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>379, 401 (1977), aff\u2019d 439 <em>U.S. </em>212, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>492, 58 <em>L.Ed. </em>2d 466 (1980). \u201c[I]n the area of classification of criminal or penal offenders for purposes of penalty or punishment the Legislature may provide for differences of treatment so long as there is some rational connection between the classification and a proper legislative purpose.\u201d 74 <em>N.J. </em>at 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">The statement of policy accompanying the enactment of the Comprehensive Drug Reform Act of 1986 declares in pertinent part that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-10\">It is the intention of the Legislature to provide for the strict punishment, deterrence and incapacitation of the most culpable and dangerous drug offenders, and to facilitate where feasible the rehabilitation of drug dependent persons so as ultimately to reduce the demand for illegal control of dangerous substances and the incidence of drug related crime. It is also the policy of this state to afford special protection to children from the perils of drug trafficking, to insure that all schools and areas adjacent to schools are kept free from drug distribution activities, and to provide a especially stern punishment for those drug offenders who operate on or near schools and school buses, who distribute to juveniles, or who employ juveniles in a drug distribution scheme. <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-1.1(c)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">As was noted by the New Jersey Supreme Court in <em>State v. Smith, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>202 (1971),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>The Legislature has wide discretion in the creation or recognition of different classes of offenders for separate treatment. In pursuing a legitimate objective it may recognize degrees of harm or possible harm and strike at what it feels more urgently needs repression. If there is some reasonable basis for the recognition of separate classes, and if the disparate treatment of the classes has a rational relation to the objective sought to be achieved by the lawmakers, the Constitution is not offended. The transgression arises only when the classification rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to achievement of the State's objectives; the separate treatment must admit of but one conclusion beyond a rational doubt, <em>i.e., </em>that the basis therefore is arbitrary and unreasonable and without relevance to the legislative goal. [58 <em>N.J. </em>at 207].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Viewing the basic scheme of the mandatory DEDR penalties there can be no cognizable argument that the Legislature\u2019s decision to deal harshly with drug law offenders as a class is constitutionally defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">However, regarding L.M.\u2019s complaints directed solely to the penalty provisions, we start with the observation that juveniles, like adults, cannot be incarcerated for involuntary failure to pay the mandatory penalties provided for in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-15, <em>Bearden v. Georgia, </em>461 <em>U.S. </em>660, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>2064, 76 L.Ed.2d 221 (1983); <em>State in Interest of D.G.W., </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>488, 505 n. 4 (1976); <em>State v. DeBonis, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>182 (1971). We need not address what recourse may be available to the State in the event a juvenile is unable to pay the fine.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agu\">States are not required to convince the courts of the correctness of their legislative judgments. Rather, those challenging the legislative judgment must convince the court that the legislative facts on which the classification is apparently based could not reasonably be conceived to be true by the governmental decision maker. <em>[Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co., </em>449 <em>U.S. </em>466, 464, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>715, 724, 66 L.Ed.2d 659 (1981)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>L.M. also contends that the DEDR mandatory penalties prescribed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-15 violate those provisions of the New Jersey Constitution which are the equivalent of the federal equal protection clause. In such eases, a balancing test is applied to consider \u201cthe nature of the affected right, the extent to which the governmental restriction intrudes upon it, and the public need for the restriction.\u201d <em>Barone, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>at 368. The focus is on whether an appropriate governmental interest is suitably furthered by the disparate treatment embodied in the action complained of. <em>Ibid. </em>Although our State Constitution in some cases may provide greater protection than the federal equal protection clause, the considerations which guide an analysis of the State afforded protections are to a large extent, implicit in the three-tier federal approach. <em>Ibid. </em>Thus the determination of the \u201cnature of the affected right\u201d under state constitutional analysis, which in turn determines the proper degree of scrutiny to be applied, is phrased in the same \u201csuspect class\u201d\u2014\u201cfundamental right\u201d terminology used in federal equal protection analysis. <em>See Barone, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>at 369; <em>Right to Choose v. Byrne, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>287, 305-06 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">As noted earlier, the treatment accorded to both juveniles and adults as drug offenders under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-15 does not amount to a \u201csuspect classification\u201d, nor does the juvenile drug offender\u2019s claimed entitlement to the same treatment as non-drug offenders constitute a \u201cfundamental right.\u201d Since the legislative classification embodied in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-15 is clearly \u201crationally related\u201d to the legitimate governmental purpose of eliminating and deterring drug use and distribution to and by minors, particularly in close proximity to schools, it is clear that a system of substantial mandatory financial penalties can rationally be said to further that purpose. \u201cAs long as the Legislature rationally advances a legitimate governmental objective, it need not be the wisest, the fairest or the one we would chose. It is not for the court to determine if there is a better way ...\u201d <em>Barone, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>at 370. Accordingly, we conclude that the mandatory DEDR penalties of <em>N.J.S.A. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>2C:35-15 as applied to juveniles do not violate the equal protection guarantees of either the federal or state constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">L.M. also argues that the mandatory DEDR penalties of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-15 violate his due process rights under the federal and state constitutions, \u201cby placing an unjustifiably heavy burden on a juvenile\u2019s property and liberty interests.\u201d He relies primarily upon <em>State in Interest of D. G. W, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>488 (1976), for the proposition that a juvenile offender, has a \u201cfundamental right\u201d to be free from financial penalties which are imposed mandatorily and without regard for his immediate ability to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">We regard <em>D.G.W </em>to be inapposite. It involved a juvenile who, upon pleading guilty to three charges of breaking and entering, was placed on probation for one year conditioned upon the juvenile\u2019s making restitution to the victims of the offenses. 70 <em>N.J. </em>at 492. The Court undertook to examine whether the trial court could attach restitution as a condition of the juvenile\u2019s probation. <em>Id. </em>at 493. In ruling affirmatively, it noted that while fines are essentially punitive in nature, the statutory policy embodied in the State\u2019s juvenile offender laws at the time was \u201cto correct and rehabilitate rather than punish,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 495, and that at least one of the purposes of restitution was to aid in the rehabilitation of the offender. <em>Id. </em>at 500. Nevertheless, the <em>D.G.W. </em>court went on to determine that although the imposition of restitution was proper, the procedure utilized had been deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">L.M., however, makes no claim that there were procedural deficiencies in the imposition of the fines. Quite the contrary, he simply contends that he has a fundamental right to be free from the imposition of financial penalties without any realistic assessment of his ability to pay. Yet no fundamental right is thus at stake. Neither the federal nor the state constitutions prohibits the imposition of sanctions upon juvenile offenders, purely for their punitive effect and without regard to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>their rehabilitative value, whether monetary, probationary, or custodial.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The Legislature has elected to enact mandatory penalties and is within its authority to make certain of these provisions applicable to juvenile offenders.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-15 and 16. <em>See State in Int. of M.L., </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>438 (1974). <em>See also State v. Des Marets, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>62, 65-66 (1983), where the New Jersey Supreme Court declined to upset the imposition of a mandatory three-year prison term upon a youthful offender under the Graves Act, observing that that was \u201ca matter solely for the Legislature to decide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">The intent to impose such mandatory sanctions of upon juveniles is clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-8\">In addition to any disposition authorized by this title, the provisions of [2A:4A-43], or any other statute indicating the dispositions that can be ordered for an adjudication of delinquency, every person convicted of or adjudicated delinquent for a violation of any offense defined in this chapter of Chapter 36 of this title, and every person placed in supervisory treatment pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-12 who is charged with any offense defined in this chapter or Chapter 36 of this title, shall be assessed for each such offense a penalty .... <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-15(a)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">L.M.\u2019s basic claim that he has a fundamental right to be free from such mandatory penalties is meritless. <em>See, e.g., State v. Fearick, </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>32, 38-39 (1976), where the Court upheld, against equal protection and due process challenges, the imposition of a mandatory minimum jail term of 45 days upon any driver whose license had been suspended and who had become involved in an accident which resulted in injuries under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-40. <em>See also State v. Gantt, </em>186 <em>N.J.Super. </em>262, 272 (Law Div.1982), aff\u2019d 195 <em>N.J.Super. </em>114 (App.Div.1984), aff\u2019d 101 <em>N.J. </em>573 (1986) (the mandatory sentencing provisions of the Graves Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6c, \u201cwill not be considered violative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>of due process unless not rationally related to [a] governmental objective such as strong deterrence of armed crime.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Consistent with that approach we hold that the mandatory DEDR provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-15 as applied to juveniles particularly are neither arbitrary nor discriminatory, and offend neither the substantive nor procedural due process guarantees of the federal and state constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">L.M. contends that the mandatory DEDR penalties of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-15, as imposed upon juvenile offenders, are \u201cexcessive and unrealistic,\u201d \u201cshocking to the general conscience, grossly disproportionate to the offense and clearly violate the principles of fundamental fairness,\u201d constituting cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Art. I, par. 12 of the New Jersey Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Under the Eighth Amendment, a punishment is presumed valid, but may be deemed \u201cexcessive\u201d and unconstitutional if it (1) involves the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain, or (2) is grossly out of proportion to the severity of the crime. <em>Gregg v. Georgia, </em>428 <em>U.S. </em>153, 169-77, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>2909, 2923-27, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976). However, outside the context of capital punishment, it has been observed that \u201csuccessful challenges to the proportionality of particular sentences have been exceedingly rare.\u201d <em>Rummel v. Estelle, </em>445 <em>U.S. </em>263, 272, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>1133, 1138, 63 L.Ed.2d 382 (1980). The test under the New Jersey Constitution \u201cis generally the same as that applied under the federal constitution.\u201d <em>State v. Ramseur, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>123, 169 (1987). <em>See also State v. Des Marets, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>62, 82 (1983). Unless a \u201csubstantial showing\u201d is thus made a reviewing court must respect the Legislature\u2019s will. <em>Des Marets, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>at 82; <em>State v. Muessig, </em>198 <em>N.J.Super. </em>197, 201 (App.Div.1985), certif. den. 101 <em>N.J. </em>234 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">Fines alone can amount to cruel and unusual punishment under certain circumstances but the situation is rare. Generally the fines are found to be proportionate and fair. <em>See e.g. Whitney Stores, Inc. v. Summerford, </em>280 <em>F.Supp. </em>406 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>(D.S.C.), aff'd per curiam 393 <em>U.S. </em>9, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>44, 21 L.Ed.2d 9 (1968). <em>See also Traylor v. State, </em>458 <em>A. </em>2d 1170 (Del.1983) (holding that the imposition of a $75,000 fine on conviction for trafficking in illegal drugs did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment); <em>Wheatt v. State, </em>410 So.2d 479 (Ala.Crim.App.1982) (holding that a $25,000 fine imposed on conviction for trafficking in marijuana did not \u201cshock the court\u2019s sense of justice and was not disproportionate to the offense committed\u201d); <em>Paras v. State, </em>247 <em>Ga. </em>75, 274 <em>S.E.2d </em>451 (1981) (holding that a mandatory minimum $250,000 fine for trafficking in cocaine did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment). Likewise, in this ease we are not convinced that the schedule of mandatory penalties provided in the DEDR even approach the grossly disproportionate level necessary to invalidate them on this basis. The imposition of a $1000 penalty upon an offender found guilty of a drug offense constituting a crime of the third degree clearly does not amount to such an excessive or disproportionate penalty that it is cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">L.M. finally asserts that the mandatory penalty provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-15 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-16 effectively undertake to amend the dispositional provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-48 in violation of the prohibition against amendment and incorporation by reference contained in Art. IV, \u00a7 VII, par. 5, of the New Jersey Constitution. Specifically, L.M. contends that <em>N.J.S.A, </em>2A:4A-48 exclusively enumerates all potential dispositions to which a juvenile adjudicated delinquent may be subjected. Since no provision is made therein for any additional dispositions, L.M. asserts that <em>N.J.S.A, </em>2A:4A-43 Is required to be specifically amended if it is to include the mandatory penalties contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-15 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Substantially the same argument was rejected by this court in <em>State v. Martin, </em>222 <em>N.J.Super, </em>66 (App.Div.1987). There, the defendant was convicted of distribution of a controlled dangerous substance in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:21-19a(1), and sentenced under that provision to an eight year term of impris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>onment. 222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 67. However, the trial judge imposed a parole disqualifier on one-half of that eight-year sentence, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6b. Defendant challenged the imposition of the parole disqualifier under the same constitutional provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">In <em>Martin </em>we noted that the Title 2C provisions allowing the imposition of parole ineligibility terms challenged there did not in any way amend or alter the provisions of Title 24. Because Title 2C is complete legislation in itself, and therefore \u201cone need not consult [Title 24] to understand and apply [Title 2C] or consult [Title 2C] to understand and apply [Title 24],\u201d we determined that the Title 2C provisions challenged need not set forth the provisions of Title 24 at length in order to pass constitutional muster. 222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 70. Similarly, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-15 and -16 do not seek to \u201camend\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-43b which continues in effect notwithstanding the provisions of the DEDR law. See note 4, <em>supra. </em>We adhere to the analysis in <em>Martin, </em>and basically for those same reasons we reject the challenge here to the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-15 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-16 as being violative of Art. IV, \u00a7 VII, par. 5 of the New Jersey Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b122-11\"> Although the legislative materials indicate that this is the title of the legislation, the act was passed and' became effective in 1987.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b125-12\"> Age has not been declared a suspect class for purposes of equal protection analysis. <em>See Johnson v.

In this regard we do not find it necessary to address and decide the consequence of the provisions of the Juvenile Code like N.J.S.A. 2A:4A-43b(8) and 2A:4A-47 on the Legislative scheme providing for mandatory penalties under the DEDR. We are confident that the Legislature, having been alerted to the problems, will address them in amendatory legislation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b129-12\"> We note that the State concedes that the mandatory incarceration provisions of the drug law are not applicable to juveniles, fortifying the conclusion that juveniles are treated somewhat differently.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
