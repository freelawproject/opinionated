The plaintiff\u2019s notice of appeal from the order entered January 14, 1991, is deemed a premature notice of appeal from the judgment (CPLR 5520 [c]).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>Ordered that the judgment and the order are affirmed, with one bill of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-3\">The record supports the Supreme Court\u2019s determination that the plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case that she sustained \"serious injury\u201d within the meaning of Insurance Law \u00a7 5102 (d). The affirmations of the plaintiff\u2019s physician consisted of conclusory allegations based on subjective complaints of pain. Summary judgment should be granted to the defendants where the plaintiff\u2019s evidence is limited to conclusory assertions tailored to meet statutory requirements <em>(see, Lopez v Senatore, </em>65 NY2d 1017, 1019). Moreover, under the circumstances of this case, the court properly denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion to renew. In any event, were we to consider the \"new\u201d evidence, we would nonetheless conclude that the plaintiff did not establish a prima facie case of serious injury <em>(see, Partlow v Meehan, </em>155 AD2d 647).
