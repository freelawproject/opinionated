Although he placed his prior conviction for possession of a controlled dangerous substance with intent to distribute before the jury in his direct examination, he contends on appeal that the trial court erred when it ruled that the evidence of his conviction was admissible for impeachment purposes. The question we must decide in this case is whether a defendant waives the right to challenge on appeal the propriety of the trial court ruling when the defendant introduces the prior conviction in his direct testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Petitioner and a co-defendant were charged with assaulting Damon Mitchell, a correctional officer, as Mitchell was walking toward his home. At the conclusion of the State\u2019s case in chief, defense counsel argued to the court that although petitioner\u2019s 1993 criminal conviction fell within the universe of crimes admissible for impeachment purposes under Maryland Rule 5-609,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. The court ruled that the conviction was more probative than prejudicial and that the State would be permitted to impeach petitioner with the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Petitioner elected to testify on his own behalf. During his direct examination, petitioner admitted that he had been convicted of the criminal offense of possession with intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance. On cross-examination, in response to the State\u2019s question, petitioner confirmed the conviction. The jury convicted petitioner and the trial court sentenced him to a term of imprisonment of eight years.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Brown noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. In an unreported opinion, that court affirmed, holding, <em>inter alia, </em>that when a party introduces evidence of a criminal conviction during his or her direct testimony, any objection to the admissibility is waived. Chief Judge Murphy, in a concurring opinion, would have held that the issue was preserved for appeal but that the trial judge did hot abuse his discretion in finding that the probative value outweighed the prejudicial effect. We granted Brown\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number><em>Brown v. State, </em>369 Md. 570, 801 A.2d 1031 (2002). We shall affirm the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Petitioner argues before this Court that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of his prior conviction for impeachment purposes. Petitioner asserts that he is entitled to introduce evidence of his prior conviction in order to minimize the prejudicial impact before the jury, and that application of the waiver rule is fundamentally unfair. On the merits, he contends that the trial court erred in admitting the conviction for impeachment purposes because the prejudicial effect substantially outweighed the probative value. Petitioner acknowledges that waiver ordinarily is a bar when a party offers evidence and on appeal objects to its introduction. Petitioner argues for an exception to the waiver rule to allow a defendant to \u201cdraw the sting\u201d by preemptively offering evidence of prior convictions where the trial court has already \u201cclearly and unequivocally\u201d ruled on their admissibility.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The act of preemptively disclosing evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior convictions on direct examination has been variously characterized as \u201cdrawing the sting,\u201d \u201clancing the boil,\u201d and \u201cinoculating the jury.\u201d L. Timothy Perrin, <em>Pricking Boils, Preserving Error: On the Horns of a Dilemma After Ohler v. United States, </em>34 U.C. Davis L.Rev. 615, 616 (2001). Regardless of terminology, the process of eliciting such testimony is a trial strategy designed to achieve one or more tactical advantages. The most common reasons for such disclosure include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqa\">\u201c(1) the trier of fact is more likely to trust and respect an advocate or a witness who \u2018volunteers\u2019 harmful information;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Asq\">(2) the disclosure avoids the risk that the trier of fact will believe that the party or witness concealed the damaging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>material; and (3) the advocate retains a measure of control over the disclosure of the perceived weaknesses and can couch the disclosure as sympathetically as possible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 616-17. The prevailing attitude amongst both practitioners and scholars of trial advocacy is that preemptive disclosure is a common and effective tactic for dealing with the threat of impeachment by prior conviction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">It has been a long held principle of common law and the law of this State, however, that \u201ca party introducing evidence cannot complain on appeal that the evidence was erroneously admitted.\u201d <em>Ohler v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 753, 755, 120 S.Ct. 1851, 1853, 146 L.Ed.2d 826 (2000), citing 1 J. Weinstein &amp; M. Berger, Weinstein\u2019s Federal Evidence \u00a7 103.14, 103-30 (2d ed.2000); <em>Mills v. State, </em>310 Md. 33, 69, 527 A.2d 3, 20 (1987), <em>judgment vacated on other grounds, </em>486 U.S. 367, 108 S.Ct. 1860, 100 L.Ed.2d 384 (1988) (holding that defendant could not complain of the inadmissibility of evidence he had introduced on direct examination); <em>Hillard v. State, </em>286 Md. 145,155-56, 406 A.2d 415, 421 (1979) (reaffirming \u201cthe longstanding rule in this State ... that the admission of improper evidence cannot be used as grounds for reversal where the defendant gives testimony on direct examination that establishes the same facts as those to which he objects\u201d); <em>Peisner v. State, </em>236 Md. 137, 146, 202 A.2d 585, 590 (1964) (noting that \u201c[wjhatever advantages the best evidence rule might have afforded the [defendant] were waived and discarded by the [defendant] himself\u2019); <em>Bean v. State, </em>234 Md; 432, 444, 199 A.2d 773, 779 (1964) (holding that \u201c[h]aving brought up the subject, the [defendant] is hardly in a position to claim that the testimony ... was not admissible\u201d); <em>Jensen v. State, </em>127 Md.App. 103, 126-27, 732 A.2d 319, 331-32 (1999) <em>cert, denied, </em>356 Md. 178, 738 A.2d 855 (1999) (refusing to consider effect of alleged prejudicial \u201cbad acts\u201d evidence \u201cbecause [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>defendant] introduced this evidence, she cannot now complain about its admission\u201d); <em>Johnson v. State, </em>9 Md.App. 166, 177, 263 A.2d 232, 239 (1970) <em>aff'd after remand, </em>9 Md.App. 436, 265 A.2d 281 (1970) (observing that \u201cif the prior conviction was introduced by the defendant himself rather than the State, he thereby waives objection\u201d). Maryland courts consistently have applied the waiver rule in civil cases as well. <em>See e.g., Reed v. Baltimore Life Ins. Co., </em>127 Md.App. 536, 559, 733 A.2d 1106, 1118 (1999) (holding that appellant could not complain on appeal about the source of evidence when he provided the information to the court himself). This rule, recognized repeatedly by this Court, is stated in 1 J. Strong, <em>McCormick on Evidence, </em>\u00a7 55 (5th ed.1999):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-5\">\u201cIf a party who has objected to evidence of a certain fact himself produces evidence from his own witness of the same fact, he has waived his objection.... However, when his objection is made and overruled, he is entitled to treat the ruling as the \u2018law of the trial\u2019 and to explain or rebut, if he can, the evidence admitted over his protest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The issue petitioner presents for our review in the instant case was considered by the Supreme Court in <em>Ohler v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 753, 120 S.Ct. 1851, 146 L.Ed.2d 826 (2000). The Court, in a five-to-four decision based on non-constitutional grounds, held that a defendant waives any error in the trial court\u2019s preliminary ruling permitting impeachment by a prior conviction when the defendant preemptively introduces the evidence in her own testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 760, 120 S.Ct. at 1855, 146 L.Ed.2d 826. Although not binding on this Court, we agree with the majority\u2019s reasoning in <em>Ohler. </em>In a motion <em>in limine, </em>the Government sought a preliminary ruling by the trial court to determine whether the defendant\u2019s prior conviction was admissible as impeachment evidence. The trial court determined that the conviction was admissible for impeachment purposes. On direct examination, Ohler admitted her prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">On appeal, Ohler argued that it would be unfair to apply the waiver rule. She argued that although one cannot complain on appeal of evidence introduced by that person, the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>should create an exception where the conviction would be presented by the prosecution in any event. The Supreme Court declined to create such an exception, holding that \u201ca defendant who preemptively introduces evidence of a prior conviction on direct examination may not on appeal claim that the admission of such evidence was error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 760, 120 S.Ct. at 1855, 146 L.Ed.2d 826.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The Court noted that whatever merits Ohler\u2019s contentions may have, \u201cthey tend to obscure the fact that both the Government and the defendant in a criminal trial must make choices as the trial progresses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 757, 120 S.Ct. at 1854, 146 L.Ed.2d 826. The defendant must choose whether to take the stand and testify, and if she decides to testify, she must choose whether to remove the sting or take her chances. Similarly, the Government must choose whether or not to use the defendant\u2019s prior conviction against her. As a result, \u201cany possible harm flowing from a [trial court\u2019s] <em>in limine </em>ruling permitting impeachment by a prior conviction is wholly speculative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 759,120 S.Ct. at 1854,146 L.Ed.2d 826 (quoting <em>Luce v. United States, </em>469 U.S. 38, 41, 105 S.Ct. 460, 463, 83 L.Ed.2d 443 (1984) (holding defendant who chose not to testify at trial waived the right to appeal an <em>in limine </em>ruling permitting the Government to impeach with evidence of prior conviction)). In addition the Court observed that Ohler\u2019s position would deprive a trial judge of the opportunity to change its mind during the course of the trial after hearing all of the defendant\u2019s testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 758 n. 3, 120 S.Ct. at 1854 n. 3, 146 L.Ed.2d 826.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The Court of Special Appeals in the instant case agreed with the reasoning set out in <em>Ohler. </em>Judge Getty, writing for the panel, noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-7\">\u201cWe fail to see how the decision in <em>Ohler </em>was unfair to an accused who unquestionably seeks to present to the jury an image of one who is credible and willing to admit his earlier transgressions and then abandons that approach on appeal and claims, \u201cI wuz robbed!\u201d Where the question of prior conviction arises, and the court rules that a prior conviction is admissible, both sides have decisions to make. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>defendant can admit the offense and hope the admission will favorably impress the jury, or he can conclude that the State will not offer the evidence and, if they do so, he can object and attack the court\u2019s ruling on appeal. The State must also resolve whether to offer the evidence and run the risk of reversal or to rely instead on the strength of the testimony produced at trial The court ought not allow the accused to gain whatever advantage preemption bestows and then allow him redress for self-inflicted wounds.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The precise issue in the instant case was addressed, in <em>dicta, </em>by Judge Orth, in <em>Johnson v. State, </em>9 Md.App. 166, 263 A.2d 232 (1970). Rejecting the defendant\u2019s position, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">\u201cIf timely objection is not made below the question of the admissibility of a prior conviction is not preserved for appeal.... And we observe that if the prior conviction was introduced by the defendant himself rather than by the State, he thereby waives objection. If he so offers the conviction, probably as a matter of trial strategy to soften the anticipated blow in the eyes of the trier of fact, he cannot be heard to complain that his own act of offering such evidence violated his constitutional rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 177, 263 A.2d at 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">Our reasoning in <em>Jordan v. State, </em>323 Md. 151, 591 A.2d 875 (1991) is analogous and therefore instructive. In <em>Jordan, </em>the defendant\u2019s confession, although voluntary, was inadmissible in the State\u2019s case in chief because the defendant had not knowingly waived his right to counsel. The trial court ruled the confession was admissible <em>if </em>the defendant testified, for impeachment purposes only. The defendant did not testify at trial. On appeal, Jordan challenged the ruling as to the admissibility of the statement. We held that the trial court\u2019s ruling as to the admissibility of the statement for impeachment purposes was not preserved for appeal where, for tactical reasons, the defendant chose not to testify, thereby precluding the State from utilizing the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 156, 591 A.2d at 877. We stated there could be no review of a ruling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>allowing for the admission of evidence unless the evidence were actually introduced at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 158-59, 591 A.2d at 878-79. Any harm from an erroneous ruling by the trial court was speculative, because the State might have chosen not to use the \u201carguably inadmissible\u201d evidence to impeach. <em>Id. </em>at 158-59, 591 A.2d at 878 (quoting <em>Luce, </em>469 U.S. at 42, 105 S.Ct. at 463, 83 L.Ed.2d at 448).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Petitioner\u2019s position also runs counter to the requirement in Maryland for a contemporaneous objection to the admission of evidence. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 4-323(a). Although petitioner initially objected to the use of the conviction prior to testifying, there obviously was no objection when he introduced the conviction in his direct examination. Further, when the State asked him about the conviction, there was no objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">In a split decision, this Court recently reaffirmed its commitment to the requirement of a contemporaneous objection to the admissibility of evidence in order to preserve an issue for appellate review. <em>See Reed v. State, </em>353 Md. 628, 728 A.2d 195 (1999). We reiterated the general rule in Maryland that \u201cwhere a party makes a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude irrelevant or otherwise inadmissible evidence, and that evidence is subsequently admitted, the party who made the motion ordinarily must object at the time the evidence is actually offered to preserve [its] objection for appellate review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 637, 728 A.2d at 200 (quoting <em>Prout v. State, </em>311 Md. 348, 356, 535 A.2d 445, 449 (1988)). We held that where a motion <em>in limine </em>has the effect of admitting evidence at trial, \u201cfailure to object results in the non-preservation of the issue for appellate review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 637, 728 A.2d at 200. Discussing the contemporaneous rule, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">\u201cthe [contemporaneous objection] rule generally promotes consistency and judicial efficiency.... Much can happen in a trial prior to the offering of disputed evidence that can affect its admissibility. When the contemporaneous objection rule applies, the subsequent course of the trial as to admissibility issues generally will be controlled by the rulings of the trial judge, rulings generated by the events as they have unfolded during the trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 641-43, 728 A.2d at 202-03. The same rule was expressed in <em>Klauenberg v. State, </em>355 Md. 528, 735 A.2d 1061 (1999). Judge Cathell, writing for the Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\">\u201c[P]ursuant to Maryland Rule 4-323(a), \u2018an objection to the admission of evidence shall be made at the time the evidence is offered or as soon thereafter as the grounds for objection become apparent. Otherwise, the objection is waived.\u2019 In addition, we recently have reaffirmed that when a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude evidence is denied, the issue of the admissibility of the evidence that was the subject of the motion is not preserved for appellate review unless a contemporaneous objection is made at the time the evidence is later introduced at trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 539-40, 735 A.2d at 1067 (citations omitted). <em>See also, Prout v. State, </em>311 Md. 348, 356-57, 535 A.2d 445, 449 (1988); <em>Hickman v. State, </em>76 Md.App. 111, 116-17, 543 A.2d 870, 873 (1988) (Bell, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">We hold that petitioner may not now complain that the evidence that he introduced himself in his direet testimony was not admissible. By introducing the evidence of his prior convictions in his direct testimony, he has waived the issue for appellate review. There was no objection to the testimony; it is speculative as to whether the State would have introduced the evidence; and the trial court was deprived of the opportunity to hear petitioner\u2019s entire testimony in context to reevaluate its decision as to whether the prejudice of the conviction substantially outweighed the probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">Petitioner argues that he is entitled to \u201cplay down\u201d the significance of adverse evidence, and that the implementation of the waiver rule will give him a \u201cHobson\u2019s choice of either mitigating the damage to his witness by introducing impeachment evidence on direct examination, or preserving for review on appeal the error of a ruling already made.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>that precluding an appeal following preemptive disclosure presents a defendant with a dilemma. Nonetheless, to overcome the waiver rule, a defendant must be faced with more than a strategic decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">In contrast to petitioner, the defendant in <em>Beverly v. State, </em>349 Md. 106, 707 A.2d 91 (1998) <em>was </em>faced with a Hobson\u2019s choice. The defendant had worked out a plea agreement with the State but the trial judge mistakenly believed he could not implement the terms of the agreement. The defendant was permitted to withdraw the guilty plea, and following a trial, he was convicted. On appeal, the State argued that the defendant\u2019s withdrawal of the plea constituted a waiver of the issue. Finding waiver not applicable, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">\u201cWe do not believe that the defendant, having been told that the court could not legally follow the plea agreement, should be required to plead guilty in order to challenge the trial judge\u2019s legal conclusion, knowing that the court would not follow the plea agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 119, 707 A.2d at 97. In <em>Beverly, </em>it was not the case of a defendant making a tactical decision as to his trial strategy; rather, a defendant is not required to relinquish a constitutional right to a trial solely to contest an erroneous legal ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">In <em>United States v. Williams, </em>939 F.2d 721 (9th Cir.1991), a case pre-dating <em>Ohler, </em>the defendant, faced with an adverse ruling on the admissibility of a conviction for impeachment purposes, chose to present evidence of the conviction in his direct testimony. The court held that the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court erred in allowing impeachment by prior conviction was waived by defendant\u2019s preemptive testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 723. \u201cWhile the choice between preempting the prosecution and preserving the ... objection for appeal may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>perilous, it is no more so than many other decisions defense attorneys must make at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 725. The court was influenced by the Supreme Court\u2019s discussion in <em>Luce v. United States, </em>469 U.S. 38, 105 S.Ct. 460, 83 L.Ed.2d 443 (1984), and the holding that in order to preserve for review the claim of improper impeachment with a prior conviction, a defendant must first testify. <em>Id. </em>at 724 (citing <em>Luce, </em>469 U.S. at 43, 105 S.Ct. at 464, 83 L.Ed.2d 443). The court relied in part on the following quote from <em>Luce:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-5\">\u201cA reviewing court is handicapped in any effort to rule on subtle evidentiary questions outside a factual context. This is particularly true under Rule 609(a)(1), which directs the court to weigh the probative value of a prior conviction against the prejudicial effect to the defendant. To perform this balancing, the court must know the precise nature of the defendant\u2019s' testimony, which is unknowable when, as here, the defendant does not testify.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-6\"><em>Luce, </em>469 U.S. at 41, 105 S.Ct. at 463, 83 L.Ed.2d 443. The same reasoning holds true when a party presents evidence of a criminal conviction in direct testimony. The trial court is deprived of the opportunity to change its ruling after hearing the testimony in context. As the Supreme Court stated, \u201cthere is nothing \u2018unfair\u2019 ... about putting petitioner to [his] choice in accordance with the normal rules of trial.\u201d <em>Ohler, </em>529 U.S. at 759,120 S.Ct. at 1855,146 L.Ed.2d 826.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Petitioner urges this Court to follow the lead of several of our sister states that have rejected the Supreme Court approach adopted in <em>Ohler. </em>We decline to accept his invitation. The holding in those cases was consistent with the general approach in those states that a party has a right to introduce mitigating evidence and is not precluded from appealing the admissibility of that evidence even though he introduced the evidence himself. <em>See e.g., State v. Daly, </em>623 N.W.2d 799, 801 (Iowa 2001) (holding that defendant may introduce preemptively evidence of criminal convictions without waiver of right to assert error on appeal; under Iowa law, however, \u201cthe rule of waiver is contrary to established precedent\u201d); <em>State v. Thang, </em>145 Wash.2d 630, 41 P.3d 1159, 1168 (2002) (holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>defendant may introduce mitigating evidence preemptively; \u201c[i]n Washington, case law indicates a tendency to protect the defendant\u2019s right to introduce mitigating testimony\u201d); <em>People v. Carpenter, </em>21 Cal.4th 1016, 90 Cal.Rptr.2d 607, 988 P.2d 531, 556 (1999) (holding that defendant could introduce the convictions first rather than wait until presented by prosecution and still appeal; under California law, however, pre-trial objection need not be renewed at trial to preserve error); <em>State v. Mueller, </em>319 S.C. 266, 460 S.E.2d 409, 410-11 (App. 1995) (holding that defendant could bring out conviction on direct examination and then challenge validity of ruling on appeal; under South Carolina law, however, defendant need not renew earlier objection to admission of testimony to preserve issue for appeal). As we have discussed <em>supra, </em>Maryland jurisprudence is otherwise. The Vermont Supreme Court simply declined to follow the reasoning in <em>Ohler, </em>concluding that it was an extension of the Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Luce. See State v. Reiser, </em>807 A.2d 378, 388 (Vt.2002). In our view, the ruling does not extend <em>Luce, </em>but rather, is a consistent application of <em>Luce. </em>Furthermore, the ruling in <em>Ohler </em>and our holding today are consistent with our jurisprudence on appellate procedure, specifically, the traditional rules on waiver and the requirements of preservation of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Because petitioner waived his right to appeal the trial court\u2019s ruling, we need not decide whether the trial court erred when it determined that petitioner\u2019s prior conviction for possession of a controlled dangerous substance with intent to distribute was admissible for impeachment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED, WITH COSTS.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Announcing the judgment of the Court HARRELL, J. concurs in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Concurring opinion by</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b272-7\">.

As he explains, I agree with Part (2) of the Dissent rejecting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>majority view in <em>Ohler v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 753, 120 S.Ct. 1851, 146 L.Ed.2d 826 (2000) and instead concluding that there was no waiver in the instant case (Dissent, op. at 257-66), but I would hold that the evidence of Brown\u2019s prior conviction for possession of CDS with intent to distribute was admissible. Other than stating that I do <em>not </em>support overruling <em>State v. Giddens, </em>335 Md. 205, 642 A.2d 870 (1994) or <em>State v. Woodland, </em>337 Md. 519, 654 A.2d 1314 (1995), I need elaborate only why I believe the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of Brown\u2019s prior conviction. <em>See </em>Dissent, op. at 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The trial judge explicated his ruling to allow use of Brown\u2019s prior conviction as impeaching evidence as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-6\">THE COURT: As I\u2019m sure the State intended to refer me to <em>Jackson v. State,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the guidelines that are set forth therein in determining whether a prior conviction is admissible under Maryland Rule 5-609,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that\u2019s a series of questions that the Court is to answer. First, is the prior conviction within the universe too admissible. That is, infamous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>crimes or crimes relevant to [the] witnesses] credibility. Of course, the <em>Jackson v. State Court </em>said that drug felonies are such offenses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-5\">The second is a conviction less than fifteen years old. Yes, as the parties agree, a conviction is timely in that sense.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-6\">So finally we\u2019re left to weigh the probative value versus unfair prejudice to the Defendant. And in looking at -the things that <em>Jackson v. State </em>sets forth including, one, the impeachment value of the prior crime, we have to take the Court of Appeals at its word that drug felonies are impeachables. They do impeach one\u2019s credibility. So, yes, it is one that is recognized although perhaps not universally recognized as reflecting upon the witness\u2019 honesty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-7\">The time in conviction of the earlier offense is over six years ago, tends to lessen its prejudicial value. The similarity between the earlier crime and the charged crime, the similarity would weigh against admission, and in this case they\u2019re not similar. So it weighs in favor of admission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-8\">Upon consideration of the items enumerated in <em>Jackson v. State, </em>I find that the conviction is more probative and accordingly will permit the State to impeach.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">Given the unquestioned applicability of the Rule 5-609 factors and the now renewed vitality of <em>Giddens </em>and <em>Woodland, </em>the trial court\u2019s analysis and conclusions as to the legal considerations (eligibility of prior conviction to be used and eligible conviction must be less than 15 years old) are flawless. The only other factor requiring comment is the weighing of probity versus unfair prejudice. Deliberation regarding this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>factor is committed in the first instance to the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Giddens, </em>335 Md. at 214, 642 A.2d at 874. Although a strong presumption of correctness attaches to the trial judge\u2019s conclusion reached after engaging in this balancing test <em>(Woodland, </em>337 Md. at 526, 654 A.2d at 1317; <em>Beales v. State, </em>329 Md. 263, 273, 619 A.2d 105, 110 (1993)), we are not reluctant to overturn such a conclusion where an abuse of discretion or error of law is found.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">A brief reflection on the abuse of discretion standard of appellate review is in order.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-5\">\u201cAbuse of discretion\u201d is one of those very general, amorphous terms that appellate courts use and apply with great frequency but which they have defined in many different ways. It has been said to occur \u201cwhere no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the [trial] court,\u201d or wdien the court acts \u201cwithout reference to any guiding rules or principles.\u201d It has also been said to exist when the ruling under consideration \u201cappears to have been made on untenable grounds,\u201d when the ruling is \u201cclearly against the logic and effect of facts and inferences before the court,\u201d when the ruling is \u201cclearly untenable, unfairly depriving a litigant of a substantial right and denying a just result,\u201d when the ruling is \u201cviolative of fact and logic,\u201d or when it constitutes an \u201cuntenable judicial act that defies reason and works an injustice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-6\">There is a certain commonality in all of these definitions, to the extent that they express the notion that a ruling reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard will not be reversed simply because the appellate court would not have made the same ruling. The decision under consideration has to be well removed from any center mark imagined by the reviewing court and beyond the fringe of what that court deems minimally acceptable. That kind of distance can arise in a number of ways, among which are that the ruling either does not logically follow from the findings upon which it supposedly rests or has no reasonable relationship to its announced objective. That, we think, is included within the notion of \u201cuntenable grounds,\u201d \u201cvolatile of fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>and logic,\u201d and \u201cagainst the logic and effect of facts and inferences before the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-5\"><em>North v. North, </em>102 Md.App. 1, 14, 648 A.2d 1025, 1032 (1994) (internal citations omitted). Similarly, in <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 3598, </em>347 Md. 295, 701 A.2d 110 (1997), we described \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-6\">Judicial discretion was defined in <em>Saltzgaver v. Saltzgaver, </em>182 Md. 624, 635, 35 A.2d 810, 815 (1944) (quoting Bowers\u2019 Judicial Discretion of Trial Courts at P 10) as \u201cthat power of decision exercised to the necessary end of awarding justice and based upon reason and law, but for which decision there is no special governing statute or rule.\u201d It has also been defined as a \u201creasoned decision based on the weighing of various alternatives.\u201d There is an abuse of discretion \u201cwhere no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the [trial] court,\u201d or when the court acts \u201cwithout reference to any guiding rules or principles.\u201d An abuse of discretion may also be found where the ruling under consideration is \u201cclearly against the logic and effect of facts and inferences before the court,\u201d or when the ruling is \u201cvolatile of fact and logic.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-7\">Questions within the discretion of the trial court are \u201cmuch better decided by the trial judges than by appellate courts, and the decisions of such judges should only be disturbed where it is apparent that some serious error or abuse of discretion or autocratic action has occurred.\u201d In sum, to be referenced \u201cthe decision under consideration has to be well removed from any center mark imagined by the reviewing court and beyond the fringe of what that court deems minimally acceptable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">347 Md. at 312-13, 701 A.2d at 118-19 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">Regarding the probity versus unfair prejudice analysis and conclusion in the instant case, I cannot say that the trial judge abused his discretion or erred as a matter of law. Although the danger of unfair prejudice is heightened where the prior conviction and pending charge are identical or similar <em>{Jack</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number><em>son, </em>340 Md. at 715, 668 A.2d at 13), that was not the case here. Brown was on trial for second degree assault. The impeaching prior conviction was for possession of CDS with intent to distribute. These offenses manifestly are neither identical nor similar. While it is true that the contextual background of the charged crime for which Brown was tried and convicted involved allegations of earlier friction between Brown, the co-defendant (Avon Brown), and others with the victim over the former\u2019s drug-selling in the victim\u2019s neighborhood, it was not an abuse of the trial judge\u2019s discretion to view the attenuated relationship of a prior CDS conviction to the background facts of this case as not presenting the most heightened danger of unfair prejudice previously recognized in our cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">Regarding the weighing of the fourth and fifth considerations mentioned in <em>Jackson </em>\u2014 importance of the defendant\u2019s testimony and centrality of the defendant\u2019s credibility \u2014 , we said \u201c[w]here credibility is the central issue, the probative value of impeachment is great, and thus weighs heavily against the danger of unfair prejudice.\u201d 340 Md. at 721, 668 A.2d at 16 (internal citations omitted). Here, Brown\u2019s credibility and that of the co-defendant were as central to the case as the victim\u2019s. The Dissent\u2019s recounting of the competing evidence from the State and the defense (Dissent, op. at 252-57) clearly makes that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Therefore, as Chief Judge Murphy stated in his concurring opinion in the Court of Special Appeals in this case, \u201c[the trial judge] neither erred nor abused his discretion in permitting the impeachment by conviction evidence at issue in this case.\u201d I join in this Court\u2019s judgment affirming the judgments of the Court of Special Appeals and the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Dissenting opinion by</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b283-7\">. <em>Jackson v.

Judge Raker\u2019s opinion announces the judgment of the Court. She would hold that by revealing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>his prior conviction on direct examination, petitioner waived any right to complain about the trial court\u2019s earlier ruling that evidence of that conviction was admissible. Only two other judges share that view, however. I disagree with it, as do Chief Judge Bell and Judge Eldridge. Although Judge Harrell agrees that the issue was not waived, he would hold that evidence of the conviction was nonetheless admissible. I disagree with that as well; so do Chief Judge Bell and Judges Eldridge and Raker. When coupled with Judge Raker\u2019s view that petitioner\u2019s complaint was waived, however, Judge Harrell\u2019s conclusion as to admissibility suffices to create four votes to affirm the judgment. Ultimately, therefore, this opinion is a dissenting one. Four judges, and therefore the Court, would affirm the judgment; I would reverse it.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">\n<em>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Judge Raker\u2019s opinion, resting solely on the notion of waiver, does not consider the underlying facts of the case. They <em>are </em>important, however, even on the question of waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">There was legally sufficient evidence adduced in this case to show that Damon Mitchell, the victim, was assaulted by six people, including petitioner, as he was returning to his home. How the affray commenced and proceeded, Mitchell\u2019s role in it, and the degree of petitioner\u2019s participation were in substantial dispute, however, and, in judging even the waiver issue before us, we need to look at the evidence in a light most favorable to the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">The issue of petitioner\u2019s prior drug dealing surfaced initially in the context of a pre-trial motion <em>in limine. </em>The State intended to present evidence that the motive behind the assault was that, for a two-month period preceding the assault, petitioner and others were continually on Mitchell\u2019s property engaging in drug transactions and that Mitchell had repeatedly called the police. The assault, theorized the State, was in retaliation for that effort. Both petitioner and his co-defendant, Avon Brown (Avon), moved to exclude that evidence, which they regarded as unduly prejudicial evidence of prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>bad acts. Seemingly of the view that the citizens of Baltimore City were so accustomed to drug dealing in their neighborhoods that evidence of it would not be unduly prejudicial, the court denied the motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">That ruling opened the way for Mr. Mitchell and his wife to testify about a group of \u201cguys,\u201d including petitioner, who \u201chung around\u201d in front of his house and engaged in transactions with passing motorists that, by almost necessary implication, constituted drug dealing. Petitioner, he said, usually stayed across the street but occasionally came to his steps to talk with Mitchell\u2019s 18-year-old daughter, Gloria. Petitioner and Gloria were more than friends; he was the father of her child. Mitchell warned petitioner against selling drugs in front of his house and threatened to call the police. He did call the police \u2014 sometimes seven times a night five days a week, he said \u2014 but the group scattered whenever they saw the police arriving. On one occasion, he led the police into the alley where the group ran, leading to the discovery of some capsules. It was never clear whose capsules they were or what, if anything, they contained.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Mitchell said that the assault occurred as he and his wife were returning by separate cars to Mitchell\u2019s home.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mrs. Mitchell arrived first and waited for him on the steps to his house. As he neared the house after parking his car, Avon, whom he did not know, approached, pulled a knife, asked whether Mitchell wanted to die, and commented, \u201cYou like calling the cops on people.\u201d Mitchell was a correctional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>officer, approximately seven inches taller than Avon and accustomed to confrontations, and he knew he might be facing some trouble. He therefore removed his glasses in preparation for the coming fray. Someone else, whom he said he did not know \u2014 thus excluding petitioner, whom he <em>did </em>know\u2014 then hit him, knocking him to his knees. As he got up, he heard his wife scream and saw Avon grab her, at which point Mitchell seized Avon by the throat. \u201cNext thing I know,\u201d he said, \u201cit was six, seven, eight guys on top of me.\u201d One of them was petitioner, who hit him in the face. It appears from Mitchell\u2019s testimony that the worst of the assault \u2014 kicking and stomping \u2014 was committed by Avon Brown and that petitioner did not strike him until after he had grabbed Avon by the throat.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Some of the force of Mitchell\u2019s direct examination was eroded both on his cross-examination and by other evidence. Mr. Mitchell admitted that it was only Avon Brown who initially approached him \u2014 that the others stood back against a car. He admitted that he had asked the State to drop the charges against petitioner and that, in describing the attack to the officer who first responded, he did not mention petitioner and did not mention anyone having a knife. On cross-examination, he said that he grabbed Avon from behind when he saw Avon <em>approach </em>his wife, not grab her. Mrs. Mitchell stated that Wade Spriggs was initially in the group, although she said he was not involved in the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Mrs. Mitchell\u2019s testimony also cast the affray as being initially between her husband and Avon. He was the one who approached Mr. Mitchell, pulled a knife, and accused him of calling the police. While the two were arguing, someone \u201cout of nowhere\u201d punched Mitchell, She said that, when Avon \u201ccame towards me,\u201d she hollered and Mitchell grabbed him and \u201cput him in a choke hold.\u201d At that point, petitioner hit Mitchell and someone else began to kick him. The final witness for the State was Detective Wallace, who saw Mitchell at the hospital after the attack. Mitchell identified Avon and petitioner as two of the assailants. Wallace confirmed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>the initial police report made by the first officer on the scene did not mention petitioner as an assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">When the State rested, petitioner moved to preclude the State from introducing evidence of his 1993 conviction for possession with intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance. He conceded that, under existing case law <em>(State v. Woodland, </em>337 Md. 519, 654 A.2d 1314 (1995)), such a conviction was within the universe of crimes admissible as impeachment evidence and noted that, under ordinary circumstances, he would not be concerned, in an assault case, that a drug conviction would be unduly prejudicial, there being no similarity between the two crimes. Given that the court, over objection, permitted the State to offer evidence of petitioner\u2019s drug dealing as underlying the alleged motive for the assault, however, counsel urged that there <em>was </em>an affinity that would make evidence of the conviction particularly prejudicial and beyond remedy by a curative instruction. Because the conviction was more than six years old and occurred when petitioner was a teenager, counsel argued that the probative value was not great and that its prejudicial effect \u2014 the danger that the jury might take it as propensity evidence to bolster Mitchell\u2019s testimony about the drug dealing \u2014 would outweigh its probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Though acknowledging that the evidence would be \u201csomewhat prejudicial,\u201d the State nonetheless insisted that it was admissible and the court agreed, concluding that \u201cthe conviction is more probative than prejudicial and accordingly [the court] will permit the State to impeach.\u201d That ruling, as noted, came at the end of the State\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Avon, the co-defendant, testified before petitioner. He said that he and petitioner were in front of Mitchell\u2019s home talking to two girls, who lived either in Mitchell\u2019s house or next door, when Mrs. Mitchell arrived and stood on the steps. He then saw Mr. Mitchell walking toward the house, apparently angry, and mumbling, in somewhat inelegant language, about people in front of his house. Avon said that he asked Mitchell whether Mitchell was talking to him, at which point Mitchell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>took off his glasses and said that he had had enough. Mrs. Mitchell then threw some keys at Avon, and, as he turned toward her, Mitchell grabbed him. Avon cried for help, and someone hit Mitchell, throwing them both to the ground. Avon denied ever displaying, or even having, a knife (no knife was ever found). He also recounted a conversation with Mitchell that occurred at an earlier hearing in the case, in which Mitchell allegedly acknowledged that Avon was not involved in the assault and suggested that Wade Spriggs had \u201cset him up.\u201d A neighbor, who had accompanied Avon to that hearing, corroborated that conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Petitioner then testified, as the last witness. He told essentially the same story as Avon, except that he denied any part in the scuffle. His story was that Mitchell started choking Avon \u2014 \u201cgot a good choke hold around him\u201d \u2014 and that Avon called for help, whereupon Cecil White hit Mitchell, causing them both to fall.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At that point, he said, the \u201cguys\u201d from across the street ran over to lend their assistance to Avon. Petitioner said that he remained on the step and did not get involved. When he finished his story, he was asked, and he admitted, that in 1993, when he was nineteen, he was convicted of possession with intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance and that he had served his penalty. The prosecutor, on cross-examination, had him repeat the fact of his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The evidence created a clear and genuine jury issue: who started the fight; why would petitioner, who knew Mitchell and was known by him, who knew his daughter and fathered his grandchild, who lived and was known in the neighborhood, attack him? The only motive, the only explanation, offered by the State was that the attack was in retaliation for Mitchell\u2019s interference with petitioner\u2019s drug business, carried on in front of Mitchell\u2019s home. Aside from the testimony from the Mitchells, there was no corroboration that petitioner was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>selling drugs. The defense offered some alternative explanations for the affray, \"each of which was supported by some testimony: that the attack was set up by Mrs. Mitchell\u2019s young boyfriend, Spriggs, or that Mitchell was angry and was spoiling for a fight, and that he was attacked only after he grabbed Avon Brown by the throat and Avon cried out for help. This was the setting in which the court overruled petitioner\u2019s objection to evidence of the prior conviction and made clear that, if he testified, that evidence would be admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AxU\">(1) <em>Introduction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">My view of the matter is this: First, as most States that have had the opportunity to consider the matter have done, I would reject the view of the majority in <em>Ohler v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 753, 120 S.Ct. 1851, 146 L.Ed.2d 826 (2000), which is not binding on us, and hold that, <em>in the circumstances of this case, </em>petitioner did not, by drawing the sting, waive his right to complain about the court\u2019s ruling that evidence of his prior conviction was admissible. Second, I would overrule <em>State v. Giddens, </em>335 Md. 205, 642 A.2d 870 (1994), and <em>State v. Woodland, </em>337 Md. 519, 654 A.2d 1314 (1995), which I believe were wrongly decided, and hold that possession with intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance has no clear relationship to one\u2019s credibility as a witness and therefore is not within the universe of crimes that is admissible for impeachment purposes under Maryland Rule 5-609. Third, I would hold that, even if <em>Giddens </em>and <em>Woodland </em>were to remain as precedent, the court erred in concluding, in the circumstances of this case, that the prejudicial effect of that conviction was outweighed by its probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">(2) <em>Waiver: Ohler v. United States</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Judge Raker weaves three generally valid principles of law together to find a waiver in this case: (1) that a party who introduces evidence in a case may not complain on appeal that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>the evidence was erroneously admitted; (2) that, under Maryland Rule 4-323, an objection to the admission of evidence in a criminal case is waived unless it is made at the time the evidence is offered or as soon thereafter as the ground for objection becomes apparent; and (3) that <em>ordinarily, </em>a pretrial motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude evidence does not suffice to constitute or preserve an objection to the evidence \u2014 the objection must be made when the evidence is offered. Those principles are not absolute, however, and, when they have the effect of creating undue prejudice to a testifying defendant in a criminal case, they must yield. Maryland Rule 5-102, which states the general purpose of the rules of evidence, makes clear that one of the functions of those rules is \u201cthat the truth may be ascertained and proceedings justly determined.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Maryland Rule 5-609 permits evidence of a criminal conviction \u201c[f]or the purpose of attacking the credibility of a witness\u201d if the crime is either an infamous one or one that is \u201crelevant to the witness\u2019s credibility,\u201d certain other requirements are met, and the court determines that the probative value of admitting the evidence outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice to the witness or the objecting party. Any witness, of course, is subject to being impeached with prior criminal convictions under the Rule, but because of the particularly acute danger of prejudice when used, or threatened to be used, against a defendant in a criminal case, we have viewed their use in that context with special caution. <em>See Ricketts v. State, </em>291 Md. 701, 436 A.2d 906 (1981); <em>Beales v. State, </em>329 Md. 263, 619 A.2d 105 (1993); <em>Jackson v. State, </em>340 Md. 705, 668 A.2d 8 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The threatened use may affect the defendant\u2019s decision to testify, which he or she has a Constitutional right to do and, as a practical matter, may need to do in order to meet the State\u2019s evidence and establish a defense. If the defendant testifies, evidence of prior criminal convictions, despite limiting instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>tions, may be taken by a jury not as simply weakening the credibility of the defendant\u2019s testimony, but as propensity evidence \u2014 if he engaged in that conduct once, he likely did it again \u2014 or as establishing the defendant as a bad and disreputable person generally deserving of punishment whether or not he or she committed the crime currently at issue. Indeed, given the lessons learned from common human experience, those are the more likely ways in which such evidence may be used. Lay people, and, I expect, even \u2022 lawyers, may have considerable difficulty in putting what they regard as logic and common experience aside and treat this powerful experiential evidence as affecting only one\u2019s credibility as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">It is this very likelihood that makes evidence of prior convictions so troublesome for defendants in criminal cases and so popular with prosecutors. It is rare, I expect, that a prosecutor will decline to offer a prior conviction even potentially admissible under the Rule because of any concern over whether, despite a limiting instruction from the judge, the jury might use the conviction as substantive propensity evidence. It is common, then, for defendants, before they decide to testify, to determine which convictions the State intends to offer and to seek to exclude those that may be particularly prejudicial. The device for presenting the issue to the court in a timely fashion \u2014 before the defendant is forced to cross the Rubicon by either testifying or electing not to do so, is the motion <em>in limine, </em>in which the court is asked to determine whether disputed evidence likely to be offered will, or will not, be admitted. If the court concludes that the conviction is admissible, it is necessarily determining that the conviction (1) is relevant to the defendant\u2019s credibility and (2) has' substantial probative value as to that issue \u2014 sufficient probative value to outweigh any prejudice to the defendant. If the defendant then decides- to testify, he or she must reasonably expect that the jury will conclude likewise \u2014 that, even if it does not use the conviction for any improper purpose, once the conviction is brought to its attention, it may well determine that the defendant is not a credible person and that his or her testimo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>ny, to the extent it is inconsistent with other evidence, is not worthy of belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Some defendants, though convinced that the court erred in its ruling that the prior conviction was admissible, have attempted to gain the best of both worlds by declining to testify, thereby avoiding revelation of the conviction, and then raising the issue on appeal, complaining that the court\u2019s allegedly erroneous decision effectively prevented them from testifying. The courts generally have rejected that attempt and have concluded that, because the prior conviction was never presented, any harm to the defendant from the <em>in limine </em>ruling was too speculative to entitle him or her to relief. The Supreme Court reached that conclusion in <em>Luce v. United States, </em>469 U.S. 38, 105 S.Ct. 460, 83 L.Ed.2d 443 (1984), a case relied upon in <em>Ohler </em>and therefore worthy of comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">In <em>Luce, </em>the defendant, charged with possession with intent to distribute cocaine, moved <em>in limine </em>to preclude the Government from impeaching him with a prior conviction of simple possession of a controlled substance. Under Federal law, such a conviction was regarded as a serious crime and was therefore within the universe of crimes admissible under F.R.E. 609, and the question became whether its probative value outweighed its prejudicial effect.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In addressing <em>that issue, </em>the Supreme Court observed that when the defendant does not testify, (1) a reviewing court does not have a complete factual record from which to determine the likely impact of the prior conviction, (2) any possible harm flowing from the trial court\u2019s <em>in limine </em>ruling is entirely speculative, in that the ruling might have changed had the actual testimony been different from what was contained in the defendant\u2019s proffer, (3) the reviewing court has no way of knowing whether the Government would, in fact, have used the conviction as im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>peachment evidence, and (4) there is no way of knowing whether, if the <em>in limine </em>ruling was erroneous, the error was harmless. <em>Id. </em>at 41-42, 105 S.Ct. at 463-64, 83 L.Ed.2d at 447-48. For all of those reasons, the Court concluded that, to preserve for appellate review the claim of improper impeachment with a prior conviction, the defendant must testify and the conviction must be admitted into evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 43, 105 S.Ct. at 464, 83 L.Ed.2d at 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Like <em>Ohler, Luce </em>was not a Constitutional ruling but one based on the Court\u2019s interpretation or implementation of F.R.E. 609. Although we have not had occasion to consider precisely the same question, we reached a similar conclusion with respect to a challenged confession. In <em>Jordan v. State, </em>323 Md. 151, 591 A.2d 875 (1991), the defendant moved, before trial, to suppress a statement he had given to the police, on the ground that it was both involuntary and given without a waiver of counsel. The trial court ruled that the statement was voluntary but that Jordan had not waived his right to counsel, and that, as a result, the confession could not be used in the State\u2019s case-in-chief but could, under <em>Harris v. New York, </em>401 U.S. 222, 91 S.Ct. 643, 28 L.Ed.2d 1 (1971), be used as impeachment evidence if Jordan testified. Faced with that ruling, Jordan decided not to testify but nonetheless raised the issue on appeal. Following somewhat the reasoning used in <em>Luce, </em>and indeed citing <em>Luce, </em>we concluded that the alleged injury was remote and speculative, in that there was no way to tell whether the State would actually have used the confession had Jordan testified. Blinding our eyes to reality, we suggested the prospect that Jordan may have testified consistently with the confession, thereby depriving the confession of any impeachment value. We were not inclined, we said, \u201cto review a trial court\u2019s decision authorizing the State to use particular evidence when, as a result of a tactical decision by the defendant, the State ultimately was precluded from utilizing that same evidence.\u201d <em>Jordan, supra, </em>323 Md. at 156, 591 A.2d at 877.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Despite the obvious differences between the Luce-Jordan situation and the one now before us, the <em>Ohler </em>Court regarded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number><em>Luce </em>as a \u201csimilar, but not identical, situation,\u201d <em>Ohler, </em>529 U.S. at 759,120 S.Ct. at 1854,146 L.Ed.2d at 832, and Judge Raker in this case regards <em>Jordan </em>as \u201canalogous and therefore instructive.\u201d Any similarity, in my view, is merely facial, not real.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">In <em>Ohler, </em>the defendant was charged with importation of, and possession with intent to distribute, marijuana. The Government moved <em>in limine </em>to admit her prior conviction for possession of methamphetamine, a conviction, as noted, that was admissible under the Federal rule but would be inadmissible in Maryland. The trial court ruled that the conviction was admissible. Ohler testified and, on direct examination, drew the sting by admitting the conviction, but on appeal she challenged the <em>in limine </em>ruling. She sought to avoid the consequences of the general rule precluding a party who introduces evidence from complaining that the evidence was wrongfully admitted by arguing, among other things, that to apply a waiver rule in that situation would be unfair. It would be unfair, she said, because it \u201ccompels a defendant to forgo the tactical advantage of pre-emptively introducing the conviction in order to appeal the <em>in limine </em>ruling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 757, 120 S.Ct. at 1853, 146 L.Ed.2d at 831-32. If a defendant is forced to wait for the conviction to be revealed on cross-examination, she complained, \u201cthe jury will believe that the defendant is less credible because she was trying to conceal the conviction.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Evoking aspects of the somewhat outmoded and discredited \u201csporting theory of justice,\u201d the Court responded that both sides in a criminal trial must make tactical decisions as the case progresses. <em>Id. </em>at 757, 120 S.Ct. at 1854, 146 L.Ed.2d at 831. The defendant must choose whether to testify and whether, if he or she does, to draw the sting. <em>Id. </em>at 757-58, 120 S.Ct. at 1854, 146 L.Ed.2d at 831. The Government, on the other hand, must make the tactical decision whether to use the conviction, the Court suggesting that, if the defendant does not mount a plausible defense, the Government may decide not to risk reversal from its use. <em>Id. </em>at 758, 120 S.Ct. at 1854,146 L.Ed.2d at 831. Ohler\u2019s approach, the Court said, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>would deprive the Government of its right to wait until the defendant testifies before making that decision. <em>Id. </em>at 758, 120 S.Ct. at 1854, 146 L.Ed.2d at 832. Judge Raker finds that response compelling. I do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">It is important to note that, prior to <em>Ohler, </em>the majority of State courts and a number of Federal courts had held that drawing the sting by revealing a prior conviction, <em>after the prosecutor has clearly indicated an intent to use the conviction for impeachment and the court, over the defendant\u2019s objection, has ruled that the conviction would be admitted, </em>does not preclude the defendant from challenging the <em>in limine </em>ruling on appeal. <em>See Eubanks v.

Justice Souter, writing for the dissent, noted that \u201c[w]ith neither precedent nor principle to support its chosen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>rule, the majority is reduced to saying that \u2018there is nothing \u201cunfair\u201d... about putting petitioner to her choice in accordance with the normal rules of trial.\u2019 Things are not this simple, however.\u201d <em>Ohler, supra, </em>529 U.S. at 763, 120 S.Ct. at 1857, 146 L.Ed.2d at 834. When convictions are revealed for the first time on cross-examination, he observed, \u201c[t]he jury may feel that in testifying without saying anything about the convictions the defendant has meant to conceal them,\u201d and its assessment of the defendant\u2019s testimony \u201cmay be affected not only by knowing that she has committed crimes in the past, but by blaming her for not being forthcoming when she seemingly could have been.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 764, 120 S.Ct. at 1857, 146 L.Ed.2d at 835. Justice Souter concluded that \u201c \u2018[cjreating such an impression of current deceit by concealment is very much at odds with any purpose behind Rule 609, being obviously antithetical to dispassionate factfinding in support of a sound conclusion,\u201d that the chance to create that impression may be a tactical advantage for the Government but \u201cdis-serves the search for truth,\u201d and that allowing the defendant to draw the sting promotes the fairness of trial without depriving the Government \u201cof anything to which it is entitled.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">The Federal courts, of course, are bound by <em>Ohler, </em>but we are not, and, although we necessarily give any decision of the United States Supreme Court great respect, there is good reason not to give this one very much weight. It is not based on sound reasoning, and, as Judge Souter complained, it is antithetical to the search for truth by necessarily placing the defendant in a false light before the jury. Nor is it really supported by <em>Luce. </em>The points made in <em>Luce </em>and <em>Jordan </em>are, for the most part, legitimate. If the defendant does not testify, it is usually impossible for an appellate court to know for certain why \u2014 whether the admissibility of the conviction was the determining factor \u2014 much less what effect the conviction might have had if it had been revealed to the jury. In this situation, there is no mystery, no speculation. It was clear that the State intended to use the conviction, and, from the closeness of the case, there can be little doubt that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>would have been compelled to do so. There was no doubt as to the court\u2019s ruling or to the finality of that ruling. It was not made before trial but at the close of the State\u2019s case. Petitioner <em>did </em>testify, and the Court thus has a full factual record from which to judge the correctness of the trial judge\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Other States have declined to follow <em>Ohler. See State v. Daly, </em>623 N.W.2d 799 (Iowa 2001) (where issue is fully argued and trial court, apprised of defendant\u2019s objection, rules evidence of prior conviction admissible, defendant need not abandon all trial tactics to preserve error); <em>State v. Reiser, </em>807 A.2d 378 (Vt.2002); <em>State v. Thang, </em>145 Wash.2d 630, 41 P.3d 1159 (2002); <em>compare State v. Dunlap, </em>346 S.C. 312, 550 S.E.2d 889 (App.2001), where the defendant revealed his prior conviction in opening statement, before the ruling on its admissibility was final.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">I would adhere generally to the contemporaneous objection rule, because it is a useful rule. I would bend it in this situation, however, because, when rigidly applied, it fails to serve the ends of either fairness or the search for truth. Bending it in this limited setting advances the cause of justice and creates no problem, either for the courts or for the State. The limited setting is where (1) the State makes clear that it intends to offer the conviction if the defendant testifies, (2) the defendant makes a clear objection to the evidence, (3) the court makes a definitive ruling, intended to be final, that the evidence will be admitted, and (4) the defendant testifies and, to blunt the force of the conviction, reveals it on direct examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">For the reasons stated, I would hold that there was no waiver in this case \u2014 that petitioner did not lose his right to challenge the court\u2019s ruling that the conviction was admissible by revealing the conviction during direct examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">(3) <em>Admissibility of the Conviction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">As noted, despite its disagreement on the issue of waiver, three judges would hold that the prior conviction was admissi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>ble. That holding rests on two prongs: (1) that possession with intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance is a crime relevant to credibility and is therefore within the universe of crimes admissible for impeachment purposes, and (2) that in this case, the probative value of that conviction, as impeachment evidence, outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice to petitioner. 1 disagree with both conclusions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Until 1995, this Court had not ruled whether a conviction for possession with intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance is within the universe of crimes admissible for impeachment purposes under Rule 5-609. In <em>Lowery v. State, </em>292 Md. 2, 437 A.2d 193 (1981), we held, and in <em>Morales v. State, </em>325 Md. 330, 339, 600 A.2d 851, 855 (1992), we confirmed, that mere possession of a controlled dangerous substance (PCP) was neither an infamous crime nor one relevant to credibility and was therefore inadmissible as impeachment evidence. In <em>Morales, </em>we concluded that possession with intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance was not an infamous crime but found it unnecessary in that case to determine whether a conviction for that offense could \u201cever be used to impeach a witness.\u201d <em>Morales, supra, </em>325 Md. at 339, 600 A.2d at 855.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">In <em>Giddens v. State, </em>97 Md.App. 582, 631 A.2d 499 (1993), the question arose whether a conviction for distribution of cocaine was usable as impeachment evidence under the predecessor rule to Rule 5-609. Because it was clear that the offense was not an infamous crime, the particular question was whether it had any relevance to credibility. Germane to that determination was the fact that, in <em>Foster v. State, </em>304 Md. 439, 499 A.2d 1236 (1985), <em>cert, denied, </em>478 U.S. 1010, 106 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>S.Ct. 3310, 92 L.Ed.2d 723 (1986), this Court adopted what appears to be the majority rule that, when presenting evidence of a conviction under Rule 5-609, only the fact of the conviction \u2014 the name of the crime, the date, and the court\u2014 may be disclosed and that \u201cordinarily one may not go into the details of the crime by which the witness is being impeached.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 470, 499 A.2d at 1252 (quoting <em>State v. Finch, </em>293 N.C. 132, 235 S.E.2d 819, 824-25 (1977)). That principle was confirmed in <em>State v. Woodland, </em>337 Md. 519, 524-25, 654 A.2d 1314, 1317 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The Court of Special Appeals noted that the criminal code listed over 200 substances as controlled dangerous substances, plus various salts, isomers, derivatives, and compounds of those substances, and that a person could violate the law by selling a ton of cocaine to sub-dealers throughout a community or by giving a friend a marijuana cigarette. <em>Giddens, sUpra, </em>97 Md.App. at 591, 631 A.2d at 503. The distribution could occur in an open air drug market or in the privacy of one\u2019s home, furtively in the back of a car or on a public street in broad daylight; it could be part of a secret business enterprise or simply a gift to an acquaintance. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe net,\u201d the court said, \u201cis very large and encompasses a wide variety of conduct, and therein lies the problem.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The court pointed out that, in <em>Ricketts v. State, </em>291 Md. 701, 436 A.2d 906 (1981), this Court had declared a conviction for indecent exposure inadmissible for just that reason \u2014 -that the name of the crime \u201csays little about the conduct for which the person was convicted\u201d and that \u201cthe gamut of offenses and circumstances that fall within the ambit of the crime are so widely varied that, while one person may indeed have shown a moral depravity sufficient to impact upon his credibility, another may have committed a very minor infraction indicative of nothing more than momentary poor judgment perhaps dictated by necessity.\u201d <em>Giddens v. State, </em>97 Md.App. at 591, 631 A.2d at 503 (quoting <em>Ricketts, supra, </em>291 Md. at 710, 436 A.2d at 911). We concluded in <em>Ricketts </em>that the crime \u201cis so ill-defined that it causes the factfinder to speculate as to what conduct is impacting on the defendant\u2019s credibility, it should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>be excluded,\u201d that \u201csince the issue is always the truth of the witness, where there is no way to determine whether a crime affects the defendant\u2019s testimony simply by the name of the crime that crime should be inadmissible for purposes of impeachment.\u201d <em>Ricketts, </em>291 Md. at 713, 436 A.2d at 913.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">That concern, the Court of Special Appeals concluded, was equally justified with respect to the crime of distribution, which \u201cdoes not, inherently and of itself, indicate that the person is not to be believed.\u201d <em>Giddens v. State, </em>97 Md.App. at 591, 631 A.2d at 503. Although the behavior is criminal, it is not necessarily dishonest and \u201cdoes not necessarily involve surreptitious conduct or moral depravity sufficient to suggest a lack of credibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Citing Department of Justice statistics from 1990, the court pointed out that there were nearly 112,000 convictions for drug trafficking in State courts in 1988 and posited that many of those convictions were of \u201cof low-level street dealers who are caught because they openly sell drugs to undercover police officers on public streets, sidewalks, and parking lots or are observed in such places openly selling to other passerby.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 592, 631 A.2d at 503-04.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">This Court disagreed with the intermediate appellate court\u2019s conclusion. In <em>State v. Giddens, </em>335 Md. 205, 642 A.2d 870 (1994), though confirming our earlier holdings that convictions for mere possession of controlled dangerous substances had no bearing on credibility and were therefore inadmissible as impeachment evidence, we held, <em>without noting any supporting empirical evidence, </em>that \u201can individual convicted of cocaine distribution would be willing to lie under oath.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 217, 642 A.2d at 876. We cited <em>United States v. Ortiz, </em>553 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>F.2d 782, 784 (2d Cir.1977) for the proposition that \u201ca narcotics trafficker lives a life of secrecy and dissembling in the course of that activity, being prepared to say whatever is required by the demands of the moment, whether the truth or a lie,\u201d and, on that premise, held that a prior conviction for distribution of cocaine was relevant to credibility and therefore admissible under Rule 5-609. <em>Giddens, supra, </em>335 Md. at 217, 642 A.2d at 876.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">In retrospect, <em>Ortiz </em>does not appear to me to be a particularly persuasive case. For one thing, it was a two-to-one decision authored by a District Court judge over the dissent of a Court of Appeals judge. Moreover, <em>Ortiz </em>was a case like <em>Luce </em>and <em>Jordan, </em>in which, on the basis of an <em>in limine </em>ruling that prior convictions of heroin distribution would be admissible, the defendant never testified and the convictions never got into evidence. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals never should have reached the merits and, under <em>Luce, </em>could not do so today. Finally, the court did not make a determination as a matter of law because, at the time, the Federal rule did not directly require that the conviction be relevant to credibility. It required only that the crime be punishable by death or more than a year in prison and that the probative value of the conviction outweigh its prejudicial effect. In looking at that balance, the appellate court said that the trial judge, in his discretion, was \u201centitled to recognize that a narcotics trafficker lives a life of secrecy and dissembling in the course of that activity, being prepared to say whatever is required by the demands of the moment....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Acknowledging that the crime of distribution \u201cmay include activity that would have little bearing on a witness\u2019s credibility,\u201d <em>State v. Giddens, </em>335 Md. at 217, 642 A.2d at 876, we nonetheless somehow took judicial notice, without citing any evidence in support, that \u201cthose convicted of cocaine distribution are almost always \u2018drug dealers\u2019 in the traditional sense\u201d and then jumped to the ultimate conclusion that \u201cit is reasonable to conclude that a person is less credible because he or she is a convicted drug dealer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 218, 642 A.2d at 876. That was quite a leap, of course, from making assumptions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>about cocaine dealers and then applying those assumptions to any \u201cconvicted drug dealer,\u201d including one who distributed a marijuana cigarette to a Mend.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">Apart from that unwarranted leap, the cases cited for that proposition, to me, are anything but persuasive. The first, other than <em>Ortiz, </em>was <em>State v. Pierce, </em>107 Idaho 96, 685 P.2d 837 (App.1984), in which the Idaho court, though acknowledging that it would be a strain to characterize delivery of heroin as a crime of dishonesty, concluded that, when coupled with two other felonies of which the defendant had been convicted \u2014 escape and disruption of a jail \u2014 showed \u201ca pattern of disrespect for law and lawful authority\u201d and that \u201csuch established disrespect is relevant to evaluating whether Pierce would take an oath seriously as a witness and whether he would hesitate to testify untruthfully if it seemed advantageous to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 844. The test in Maryland is not \u201ca pattern of disrespect for law and lawful authority,\u201d but whether the particular crime is relevant to credibility. The second case cited, <em>People v. Washington, </em>85 Ill.App.3d 522, 40 Ill.Dec. 954, 407 N.E.2d 185 (1980), followed the Illinois law that unlawful <em>possession </em>or delivery was probative of credibility. That, too, runs counter to our case law. The third case, <em>State v. Lagares, </em>247 N.J.Super. 392, 589 A.2d 630 (App.Div.1991), <em>aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>127 N.J. 20, 601 A.2d 698 (1992), applied the New Jersey law that the conviction \u201cof any crime\u201d was admissible as impeachment evidence and allowed evidence of convictions for both simple possession of marijuana and possession with intent to distribute marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">What <em>State v. Giddens </em>reveals to me is an unwarranted and uncritical acceptance of assumptions that are simply too general and decisions in other jurisdictions that follow different rules than we do. We compounded that error, in both logic and judgment, in <em>State v. Woodland, </em>337 Md. 519, 654 A.2d 1314 (1995), in which we blindly followed <em>Giddens </em>and held that, as distribution of CDS was an impeachable offense, so was possession with intent to distribute such a substance. Parroting the statement from <em>Ortiz </em>that a narcotics trafficker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>lives a life of secrecy and dissembling and is prepared to say whatever is required, we concluded that \u201c[o]ur reasoning in <em>Giddens </em>is therefore as applicable to possession with intent to distribute drugs as to distribution.\u201d <em>Woodland, </em>at 524, 654 A.2d at 1316.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">For the reasons noted, I do not accept the conclusion stated in <em>Ortiz </em>as a universal proposition. To me, the Court of Special Appeals got it right in <em>Giddens v. State. </em>The majority of convicted drug traffickers \u2014 convicted either of distribution or possession with intent to distribute \u2014 I expect are the low-level street dealers who carry on their business quite openly. The very numbers suggest that to be the case. I seriously doubt that we are convicting close to 200,000 druglords each year in State courts, especially, in light of long mandatory sentences applicable to such persons, on guilty pleas.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The drug importers and kingpins may well possess the attributes ascribed in <em>Ortiz, </em>but they do not constitute the majority (or even a sizable minority) of the people appearing in the State courts. If there <em>was </em>some validity to the <em>Ortiz </em>notion, moreover, it would apply as well to nearly <em>any </em>criminal. Most people who commit crimes, other perhaps than episodic crimes of passion, do so in ways that will avoid discovery, and, in that sense, most convicted criminals, regardless of the crime, can be said to act furtively and in manners that will avoid the truth coming to light. Persons who simply possess drugs unlawfully do not advertise the fact; they secrete the drugs and, upon confrontation, are as likely to dissemble as those who possess drugs as part of a trafficking scheme. If we do not accept that possession is relevant to credibility, what makes possession with intent to distribute relevant?</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The Court, I fear, went out of bounds in <em>State v. Giddens </em>and extended that march in <em>State v. Woodland. </em>Juries, I think, are quite capable of judging credibility without our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>throwing into the credibility mix evidence that really has no relevance, or, at best, only the most marginal relevance, to credibility. We should reverse <em>Giddens </em>and <em>Woodland </em>and hold that these crimes are not admissible under Rule 5-609.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Finally, even if <em>Giddens </em>and <em>Woodland </em>are to remain the law, it is clear to me that, in this case, the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that the probative value of the conviction outweighed its prejudicial impact. As noted, the conviction was more than six years old and occurred while petitioner was a teenager. We do not know what substance he possessed with intent to distribute or any of the circumstances surrounding the offense. We do not know whether the conviction was based on a guilty plea, which might show some openness rather than secretiveness and dissembling. Under the circumstances, the probative value as to credibility, to me, was virtually nil. On the other hand, given the State\u2019s theory of the case and the significant conflict in the evidence, the danger of the jury using the evidence improperly was great. Despite the limiting instruction, which runs counter to most human experience, the jury could very well have concluded from the conviction that petitioner was, indeed, conducting a drug operation in front of the Mitchell home, which would bolster the prosecutor\u2019s argument as to the motive for the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">For these reasons, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and direct that court to reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court. Chief Judge Bell and Judge Eldridge have authorized me to state that they join in this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b289-7\">. The court said that it was \u201cconvinced actually that \u2014 for most Baltimore citizens it\u2019s perhaps one of the sad consequences of having the huge quantity of drug sales going on. But the act itself is just not any longer the sort of thing that automatically inflames ... I just can't say that allegations or hints of drug sales or, I guess, the victim's assumptions about drug sales to be more precise, are in themselves so inflammatory as to deny the defense a fair trial.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b289-8\">. Mitchell and his 37-year-old wife were then separated. Indeed, there was evidence that she was dating a 19-year-old friend of petitioner, one Wade Spriggs, who figured prominently in the defense theory of what occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b292-7\">. White had been charged as a co-defendant. On the morning of trial, pursuant to a plea agreement, While pled guilty to second degree assault.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b294-5\">. The issue of whether a defendant waives appellate review of an <em>in limine </em>ruling that evidence of a prior conviction is admissible by revealing the conviction on direct examination was commented on, though not directly raised, in <em>Giddens v. State, 91 </em>Md.App. 582, 631 A.2d 499 (1993), a case that will be discussed in greater detail below. Giddens was charged with assault. At the end of the State\u2019s case, he stated his intention to testify, at which point the prosecutor indicated her intention to impeach his testimony with a prior conviction of distribution of cocaine. Giddens objected, arguing that the conviction was not admissible for that purpose. The court overruled the objection and determined that the conviction was admissible, whereupon Giddens revealed it during his direct examination and then complained about the ruling on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">At the time, the relevant rule governing the admission of prior convictions as impeachment evidence was Maryland Rule 1-502, the predecessor rule to current Rule 5-609. That rule allowed certain convictions to be used for impeachment purposes \"if elicited from the witness or established by public record during cross-examination.\u201d A Committee Note to the rule stated that the requirement that the conviction, when offered for purposes of impeachment, be brought out during cross-examination \u201cis for the protection of the witness and is not intended either to authorize or to preclude the party calling the witness from bringing out the conviction on direct examination.\u201d The Court of Special Appeals regarded the Committee Note as demonstrating this Court\u2019s \"awareness of the practice of bringing out this kind of evidence on direct examination to remove the sting of the impeachment\u201d and thus as \"an implicit determination by [this] Court that, while there may be circumstances in which revelation of prior convictions ought not to be done on direct examination, the Rule itself does not prohibit that tactic.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 587, 631 A.2d at 501 n. 1. The intermediate appellate court noted that the State had not argued waiver in that case but also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>observed that ''fi]t is evident from the prosecutor\u2019s initial presentation of the issue that, had appellant not confessed the conviction on direct examination, the Stale would have disclosed it during cross-examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court of Special Appeals addressed the issue and ruled that the conviction was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">In <em>State v. Giddens, </em>335 Md. 205, 642 A.2d 870 (1994), this Court also addressed the issue on the merits, and, although disagreeing that the conviction was inadmissible, never commented on the implicit determination by the Court of Special Appeals that drawing the sting by revealing the conviction on direct examination, following a ruling that the conviction was admissible, was permissible and did not necessarily preclude the defendant from complaining about that ruling on appeal. When this Court adopted Rule 5-609, it deleted the requirement that the conviction be brought out on cross-examination and noted, in a Committee Note that \u201d[t]he requirement that the conviction, when offered for purposes of impeachment, be brought out during examination of the witness is for the protection of the witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">Because the State did not argue waiver in <em>Giddens, </em>the fact that we addressed the issue on the merits is obviously not a direct holding with respect to waiver. It does indicate an awareness and blessing of the practice, however, and constitutes an instance in which we <em>did </em>address the merits of the complaint despite the fact that the evidence was first revealed by the defendant on direct examination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b297-7\">. In Maryland, of course, such a conviction would <em>not </em>be within that universe and would be inadmissible under our equivalent Rule 5-609 as a matter of law. <em>See Morales v. State, </em>325 Md. 330, 600 A.2d 851 (1992); <em>State v. Giddens, supra, </em>335 Md. at 216, 642 A.2d at 875 (1994) (prior conviction for simple possession of narcotics has no bearing on credibility).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b303-7\">. A prior conviction may be used to impeach in several different ways. If, for example, a defendant testifies that he/she has led a completely blameless life or had never before been in any trouble, a prior conviction may be used as direct impeachment of that statement. That is not the context here. The issue now before us is whether the conviction is admissible under Rule 5- 609, to impeach the witness's general credibility, not any particular statement. In speaking of admissibility of convictions as impeachment evidence, I have only that context in mind.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b305-7\">. There has been a dramatic increase in the number of such convictions since 1988. The DOT Sourcebook for 2000 shows that, in 1996, there were over 212,000 felony convictions in State courts for drug trafficking, 92% of which (over 196,000) were based on guilty pleas. 1998 showed a modest decline. There were 195,183 convictions in State courts for felony drug trafficking, 95% of which (185,427) were based on guilty pleas. <em>See </em>U.S. Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Statistics Bulletin, <em>Felony Sentences in State Courts, 1998, </em>Table 9 at 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b308-7\">. The Department of Justice statistics bear that out as well. In 1998, the mean maximum sentence of a drug trafficker convicted in State court was 41 months \u2014 less than three-and-a-half years. <em>See Felony Sentences in State Courts, 1998, supra, </em>Table 8 at 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
