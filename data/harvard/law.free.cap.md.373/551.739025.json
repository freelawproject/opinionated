The Montgomery County Department of Health and Human Services (the \u201cDepartment\u201d) initiated the proceedings on 26 February 1997 by filing a petition with the District Court alleging that Yve S. was a Child in Need of Assistance (\u201cCINA\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On 10 June 1997, following three days of hearings, the juvenile court found Yve S. to be a CINA and committed her to the Department for foster care. After 13 months, on 31 July 1998, Yve S. was returned, temporarily as it turned out, to her mother, Yvonne S., under an Order for Protective Supervision. Eleven days later, on 11 August 1998, the juvenile court held an emergency hearing and, again, placed Yve S. in the Department\u2019s custody and returned her to foster care.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>A little over 7 months later, in March of 1999, the juvenile court convened a permanency planning hearing for Yve S. At the end of four non-consecutive days of hearings, the court ordered, on 20 September 1999, that the goal of the permanency plan for Yve S. should be termination of parental rights (\u201cTPR\u201d) and adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">On 20 March 2000, the court convened a permanency planning review that would spread over more than a year. By the time of a hearing on 20 October 2000, the Department advocated changing the permanency plan goal from TPR/adoption to reunification with the mother; however, the court declined to change the goal of the plan. The court held additional review hearings on 13 and 20 December 2000, 15 and 16 February 2001, and 28 March 2001. On 28 March 2001, at the conclusion of the last day of the hearing process that had begun the previous March, the court changed the permanency plan from TPR/adoption to long-term foster care. Yvonne S. noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">On 8 November 2001, while Yvonne S.\u2019s first appeal was pending in the Court of Special Appeals, the juvenile court convened another review hearing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The juvenile court concluded that hearing on 20 December 2001, at which time it issued an order reaffirming the content of its 28 March 2001 order. Yvonne S. noted a second appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">On 23 January 2002, the Court of Special Appeals filed an unreported opinion in the first appeal affirming the juvenile court\u2019s 28 March 2001 order, which had changed Yve S.\u2019s permanency plan to long-term foster care. Yvonne S. filed a petition for writ of certiorari asking this Court to review that decision. Thereafter, Yvonne S. petitioned this Court to issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>a writ of certiorari to the Court of Special Appeals before it could decide her second appeal regarding the 20 December 2001 order of the juvenile court. On 8 May 2002, this Court granted both petitions and consolidated the cases. <em>In Re: Yve. S., </em>369 Md. 178, 798 A.2d 551 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Subsequently, on 20 April 2002 and 16 July 2002, the juvenile court \u2014 now the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (see n. 1 supra), but with the same judge sitting by special designation during calendar 2002 \u2014 held another review hearing in Yve S.\u2019s case and entered a new order establishing permanent foster care as the goal of the permanency plan. Yvonne S. noted a third appeal to the Court of Special Appeals and shortly thereafter filed with regard to that appeal a petition for writ of certiorari with this Court. On 22 August 2002, we granted that petition, <em>In re Yve S., </em>370 Md. 268, 805 A.2d 265 (2002), and transferred the appeal to our regular docket. Because the third appeal raised issues concerning the jurisdiction of the juvenile court to act while an appeal of its earlier order on the same subject matter was pending, it was not consolidated with the earlier cases, but was briefed separately. All of the cases, however, were argued on the same day. We shall decide all issues raised with this single opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">Petitioner, Yvonne S., presents the following questions for our consideration, which we rephrase as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-9\">1. Does the fact that a parent has a mental illness that is being successfully managed nevertheless provide a \u201ccompelling reason\u201d to deny reunification and instead adopt a permanency plan of long-term foster care?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-10\">2. Is it proper to allow a social worker to give her opinion as to the demeanor of the parent when the parent testified, and to give her opinion of the substance of the parent\u2019s testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>3. Did the trial court err in refusing to recuse itself from further participation in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-5\">4. Whether the trial court erred in changing the permanency plan from long-term foster care to permanent foster care during the pendency of the appeal on the former determination?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Yve S. entered into the .Montgomery County foster care system in February of 1997, at the age of six, after the Department received reports that she was not being fed adequately and that she and her mother, Yvonne S., were homeless. Prior to this, Yvonne S. and Yve S. led a nomadic lifestyle. In 1990, they lived in Key West, Florida, where Yve S. was born. In 1991, they lived in Maryland; in 1992, they lived in Martinsburg, West Virginia. In 1993, they lived in Millville, West Virginia, where Yve S. was first taken into foster care. In 1994, they moved to Gaithersburg, Maryland, and then to Westminister, Maryland, in 1995. In 1996, they moved to North Carolina. Finally, in 1997, they returned to Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">Soon after Yve S. was placed in foster care in Montgomery County, the Department learned that Yvonne S. had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and schizo-affective disorder, dating back to her teens. A psychiatric evaluation of Yve S. resulted in a diagnosis of \u201cacute stress reaction,\u201d chronic post-traumatic stress disorder, and dissociative disorder. Yve S. also displayed symptoms of possible physical and sexual abuse and, in July of 1997, alleged that she had been molested by a boyfriend of Yvonne S.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">Yvonne S. complied with the Department\u2019s recommendations for mental health treatment and parenting classes. As a result, she and Yve S. were reunited in June of 1998. In July 1998, the juvenile court approved Yvonne S.\u2019s request to move to the Outer Banks of North Carolina, where she had leased a mobile home. Montgomery County, however, never initiated a home study nor completed a proper interstate compact for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Dare County, North Carolina, family welfare authorities to implement. After only a few days in North Carolina, the Dare County Department of Social Services found it necessary to remove Yve S. from Yvonne S.\u2019s care. Yvonne S. had been evicted from the trailer, and allegedly had left Yve S. in the care of a \u201cknown sex offender,\u201d though there is no record that this person\u2019s status as such was known to Yvonne S. The Dare County Department placed Yve S. in emergency shelter care and then returned her to Montgomery County, where she was placed with a foster care family.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">Yvonne S. remained in North Carolina for a time following Yve S.\u2019s return to foster care in Maryland. During that time, in August 1998, she entered into a service agreement with the Montgomery County Department in which she agreed to obtain treatment for her mental illness and maintain stable housing and employment. Yvonne S.\u2019s tenure in North Carolina concluded with a psychiatric hospitalization, after she stopped taking her medications. When she was discharged in late February 1999, she was given a two-week supply of her medications and a one-way bus ticket to Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">In March, 1999, Yvonne S. began receiving mental health treatment at St. Luke\u2019s Hospital in Montgomery County, under the care of Dr. James Harold, a psychiatrist, and also began having visitation with Yve S. on a regular basis With further assistance from the therapists and social workers at St. Luke\u2019s, as well as guidance and support from her church community, Yvonne S. stabilized, became employed, and established a home. In June 1999, she obtained a job at a local nursing home as a housekeeper. By the end of August 1999, Yvonne S. had advanced to the position of activities coordinator and had obtained her own apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">By the summer of 2000, Yvonne S. had maintained the same job and apartment for more than a year. She consistently attended her treatment at St. Luke\u2019s. By the end of that summer, Yvonne S. was having weekend-long visits with Yve S., and, in light of Yvonne S.\u2019s apparent stability, the Department advocated that the permanency plan for Yve S., which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>previously had been \u201cTPR/adoption,\u201d be changed to \u201creunification\u201d with her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">In a letter to the juvenile court, dated 26 September 2000, the foster parents made a plea for the court to reject the Department\u2019s recommendation for reunification, arguing that Yvonne S., with her mental illness, could not raise a child with Yve S.\u2019s needs. At a review hearing held on 20 October 2000, the court distributed copies of this letter to the parties, and shortly thereafter, the Department changed its position from reunifying Yve S. with her mother to one of placing Yve S. in long term foster care with the foster parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">On 20 December 2000, 15 and 16 February 2001, and 28 March 2001, the juvenile court conducted the permanency planning hearing required by statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Only a few days before her testimony in this important hearing, Yvonne S. lost her job at the nursing home. Despite the fact that she also was working part-time as a pet sitter, doing housecleaning for hire, and volunteering at a woman\u2019s homeless shelter at the time of the hearing, she was understandably nervous during her testimony. On the Sunday prior to the 28 March 2001 hearing, Yvonne S. and Yve S. drove from Yvonne S.\u2019s home in Gaithersburg to Bethesda to tour the grounds of the Bethesda Naval Hospital, so that Yve S. could see a particular statue deemed pertinent to her heritage. They then traveled to Rockville for a 10:00 a.m. church service, which they attended with a woman whom Yvonne S. had met while working at the homeless shelter during the preceding week. This level of activity was viewed as extraordinary by the Department\u2019s assigned social worker, Ms. Carolyn Rose. Ms. Rose testified, over objection, to that effect, and that, in her view, that level of activity, combined with Yvonne S.\u2019s nervousness on the witness stand, indicated to her the imminent onset of a manic episode on the part of Yvonne S. Despite testimony by the treating psychiatrist, Dr. Harold, that a manic episode was not imminent, Ms. Rose, immediately following the 16 February <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>2001 hearing, reduced the visitation from weekend-long visits to one hour of supervised visitation, later increased to a few hours once a week.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">On 28 March 2001, the juvenile judge ordered that the permanency plan pursue long term foster care as its goal. The hearing judge affirmed her permanency plan determination at the conclusion of another review hearing on 20 December 2001, despite testimony that Ms. Rose\u2019s forecast of a manic episode had failed to materialize, Yvonne S. was employed making a higher income than before, and all visitation had gone well. Similarly, the Department, through Ms. Rose, continued to refuse to return visitation to its prior frequency and duration. The plan goal became permanent foster care by virtue of the court\u2019s 16 July 2002 order. Additional facts will be supplied as appropriate to our discussion of each issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">From time to time we confront cases which present issues which merit even more extensive discussion of the legal principles involved than flows from our normal close attention of each case. Sometimes this is because of the highly technical or complex nature of the case. Other times it is because of the fundamental nature of the rights and responsibilities of the parties involved. The present case is situated on the frontier of what State action may be permissible in the face of fundamental rights possessed by its citizens,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and involves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>standards which, while their names suggest intuitive definitions and means of application, are in fact highly technical and complex in nature, and contain well established elements which are not as self-evident in application as their titles suggest.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The fundamental doctrinal problem presented by this case is the proper definition and application of the \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d standard. The problem arises in large part because the name of the standard itself invites an \u201cintuitive\u201d understanding which, upon examination, bears little resemblance to how the standard has been defined by our cases. The standard does not require simply that a determination be made that one environment or set of circumstances is superior to another. If that were the case, child custody matters would involve relatively simple choices. Although much of what we include in this opinion is derivative, there is value in massing it in this appropriate case.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF A PARENT</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">The proper starting point for legal analysis when the State involves itself in family relations is the fundamental constitutional rights of a parent. Certain fundamental rights are protected under the U.S. Constitution, and among those rights are a parent\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> liberty interest in raising his or her children as he or she sees fit, without undue interference by the State. The rights and protections afforded a parent, as recognized by the United States Supreme Court, were gathered recently in the well researched <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>opinion of <em>Wolinski v. Browneller, </em>115 Md.App. 285, 693 A.2d 30 (1997), from which we shall quote at length.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-5\">Beginning with <em>Meyer v. Nebraska, </em>262 U.S. 390, 43 S.Ct. 625, 67 L.Ed. 1042 (1923) and <em>Pierce v. Society of Sisters, </em>268 U.S. 510, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925), the Supreme Court, in a variety of contexts, has recognized that freedom of personal choice in matters of marriage, family life, and the upbringing of children is a liberty interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See M.L.B v. S.L.J., </em>U.S. LEXIS, [519 U.S. 102] 117 S.Ct. 555, 136 L.Ed.2d 473 (Dec. 16, 1996) (termination of parental rights); <em>Santosky v.

Oklahoma, </em>316 U.S. 535, 541, 62 S.Ct. 1110, 86 L.Ed. 1655 (1942). Maryland has consistently echoed the Supreme Court, declaring a parent\u2019s liberty interest in raising a child a fundamental one that cannot be taken away unless clearly justified. <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 10941, </em>335 Md. 99,112, 642 A.2d 201 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>(1994); <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship Nos.

The United States Supreme Court has long avowed the basic civil right encompassed by child rearing and family life. <em>See Troxel v. Granville, </em>530 U.S. 57. 66. 120 S.Ct. 2054. 2060. 147 L.Ed.2d 49. 57 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>(2000)(stating that \u2018the Fourteenth Amendment protects the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children\u2019); <em>See also Santosky v.

Maryland, too, has declared a parent\u2019s interest in raising a child to be so fundamental that it \u2018cannot be taken away unless clearly justified.\u2019 <em>Boswell v. Boswell, </em>352 Md. 204, 218, 721 A.2d 662, 669 (1998) (citing <em>In re Adoption//Guardianship] No. 10941, </em>335 Md. 99, 112, 642 A.2d 201 (1994)).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">368 Md. at 671, 796 A.2d at 780-81; <em>see also Shurupoff v.

One need not wander far into the thickets of family law before running into 'situations and circumstances where application of an absolute right of the parent would fail to produce a just result. Divorce is perhaps the most obvious situation. Where two parents have equal constitutional rights as parents, and both are exercising those rights to opposing ends, what is to become of the child or children involved? What are the child\u2019s rights in such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>situation, and by what standard is a court to avail itself in order both to uphold the rights of the parents while reaching an outcome society finds acceptable for the blameless offspring? Further, in a variety of situations, such as the one <em>sub judice, </em>a court must ask to what extent the State has an interest in the child as <em>parens patriae </em>\u2014 a corollary of the State\u2019s interest in protecting the health, safety, and welfare of its citizenry. Again, quoting extensively from <em>Wolinski:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-5\">The Supreme Court has emphasized, however, that \u201crights of parenthood are [not] beyond limitation,\u201d and that the \u201cstate has a wide range of power for limiting parental freedom and authority in things affecting a child\u2019s welfare ....\u201d. Thus, a parent\u2019s right to direct his or her child\u2019s upbringing is not absolute. Rather, Due Process analysis requires the delicate balancing of all of the competing interests involved in the litigation. In the context of most family law disputes over children, the State\u2019s interest is to protect the child\u2019s best interests as <em>parens patriae </em>\u2014 &amp; derivation of the State\u2019s interest in protecting the health, safety, and welfare of its citizenry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-6\">The importance of those State interests that successfully override parental autonomy in raising children is determined by the nature of the individual liberty interests upon which the State laws or regulations impinge. A regulation or law significantly curtailing a fundamental right must undergo strict scrutiny \u2014 it must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling public interest. Restrictions upon rights not deemed fundamental need only be rationally related to some purpose within the competency of the State.

The Court of Appeals has often reaffirmed that this interest takes precedence over the fundamental right of a parent to raise his or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>her child. The courts have said time and again that the best interest standard is dispositive in custody awards. In the context of adoption cases, the Court of Appeals has labeled \u201ccompelling\u201d the State\u2019s interest in securing permanent homes for children placed into its custody because of an inability or unwillingness of their parents to care for them properly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">115 Md.App. at 300-02, 693 A.2d at 37-38 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">In the case of <em>In re Mark M., </em>365 Md. 687, 782 A.2d 332 (2001), this Court recently reiterated these considerations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmG\">That fundamental interest [in rasing a child], however, is not absolute and does not exclude other important considerations. Pursuant to the doctrine of <em>parens patriae, </em>the State of Maryland has an interest in caring for those, such as minors, who cannot care for themselves. We have held that \u201cthe best interests of the child may take precedence over the parent\u2019s liberty interest in the course of a custody, visitation, or adoption dispute.\u201d That which will best promote the child\u2019s welfare becomes particularly consequential where the interests of a child are in jeopardy, as is often the case in situations involving sexual, physical, or emotional abuse by a parent. As we stated in <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. A91-71A </em>334 Md. 538, 640 A.2d 1085 (1994), the child\u2019s welfare is \u201ca consideration that is of \u2018transcendent importance\u2019 \u201d when the child might otherwise be in jeopardy. <em>Id. </em>at 561, 640 A.2d at 1096 (citation omitted). Therefore, visitation may be restricted or even denied when the child\u2019s health or welfare is threatened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-9\">We have recognized that in cases where abuse or neglect is evidenced, particularly in a CINA case, the court\u2019s role is necessarily more pro-active. In fact, whereas the standard for denying parental visitation is generally quite strict \u2014 i.e. \u201cit would only be in an exceptional case and under extraordinary circumstances that the right of visitation will be denied\u201d <em>(see Boswell v.

Due to the prominent role of these statutes in the case <em>sub judice, </em>we shall include at length here the seminal dissertation on them found in <em>In re: Adoption/Guardianship No. 10941, </em>335 Md. 99, 642 A.2d 201(1994), in which Judge Karwacki, writing for the Court, comprehensively addressed the state and federal statutory schemes. Judge Karwacki stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-9\">The Maryland General Assembly has enacted a comprehensive statutory scheme to address those situations where a child is at risk because of his or her parents\u2019 inability or unwillingness to care for him or her. Title 5 of the Family Law Article of the Maryland Code (1984, 1991 Repl.Vol.) (hereinafter \u201cF.L.\u201d) governs the custody, guardianship, adoption and general protection of children who because of abuse or neglect come within the purview of the Department of Human Resources. This case involves the interplay between the child welfare statutes, F.L. \u00a7 5-501 <em>et seq., </em>under juvenile jurisdiction, and the adoption statutes, F.L. \u00a7 5-301 <em>et seq., </em>under equity jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-10\">Subtitle 7 of Title 5 of the Family Law Article concerns the protection of children who have been abused or neglected by their biological parents. Pursuant to this subtitle, certain authority figures, such as health practitioners, police officers, educators and human service workers, are required to report cases of suspected abuse or neglect. F.L. \u00a7 5-704. The local department of social services is then required to investigate such reports. F.L. \u00a7 5-706. Thereafter, in accordance with its findings and treatment plan, the local department is required to render appropriate services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>in the best interests of the child,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> including, when indicated, petitioning the juvenile court to commit the child to its care and custody. F.L. \u00a7 5-710(a). If the juvenile court determines that the child is a child in need of assistance (CINA),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it has discretion to order that the child be committed to the local department \u201con terms that the court considers appropriate ... including designation of the type of facility where the child is to be accommodated, until custody ... is terminated with approval of the court\u201d or the child turns 21 years old. Md.Code (1974, 1989 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 \u00a7 3-820(c)(1)(ii) and 3-825 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article. Such out-of-home placement can include placement in a licensed foster home, F.L. \u00a7 5-525, or placement with relatives.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-10\">During the 1970\u2019s, nationwide concern grew regarding the large number of children who remained out of the homes of their biological parents throughout their childhood, frequently moved from one foster care situation to another, thereby reaching majority without belonging to a permanent family. This phenomenon became known as \u201cfoster care drift\u201d and resulted in the enactment by Congress of Public Law 96-272, the \u201cAdoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980,\u201d codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 670-679 (1988). One of the important purposes of this law was to eliminate foster care drift by requiring states to adopt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>statutes to facilitate permanent placement for children as a condition to receiving federal funding for their foster care and adoption assistance programs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-5\">Under the federal act, a state is required, among other things, to provide a written case plan for each child for whom the state claims federal foster care maintenance payments. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 671(a)(16). The case plan must include a description of the home or institution into which the child is placed, a discussion of the appropriateness of the placement, and a description of the services provided to the parents, child and foster parents to facilitate return of the child to his or her own home or to establish another permanent placement for the child. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 675(1). The state must also implement a case review system that provides for administrative review of the case plan at least every six months and judicial review no later than eighteen months after placement and periodically thereafter. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 675(5)(B) and (C). The purpose of the judicial review is to \u201cdetermine the future status of the child\u201d including whether the child should be returned to its biological parents, continued in foster care for a specified period, placed for adoption, or because of the child\u2019s special needs or circumstances, continued in foster care on a long term basis. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 675(5)(C).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-6\">Maryland receives considerable federal funds pursuant to this Act. Accordingly, the Maryland General Assembly has enacted legislation to comply with the federal requirements. Under Maryland\u2019s statutory scheme, for those children committed to a local department of social services the department is required to develop and implement a permanency plan that is in the best interests of the child. F.L. \u00a7 5-525.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-7\">In developing the permanency plan, the department is required to consider a statutory hierarchy of placement options in descending order of priority. F.L. \u00a7 5-525(c). First and foremost, the department must consider returning the child to the child\u2019s natural parents or guardians. F.L. \u00a7 5 \u2014 525(c)(1). If reunification with the biological parents is not possible, the department must consider placing the child with relatives to whom adoption, guardianship, or care and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>custody, in descending order of priority, are planned to be granted. F.L. \u00a7 5 \u2014 525(c)(2). If placement with relatives is not possible, then the department must consider adoption by a current foster parent or other approved adoptive family. F.L. \u00a7 5-525(c)(3). Only in exceptional situations as defined by rule or regulation is a child to be placed in long term foster care. F.L. \u00a7 5 \u2014 525(c)(5).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-5\">If it is determined that reunification is not possible and that adoption is in the child\u2019s best interests, the juvenile court lacks jurisdiction to finalize this plan. <em>In re Darius A., </em>47 Md.App. 232, 235, 422 A.2d 71, 72 (1980); <em>see also </em>F.L. \u00a7 1-201. Instead, unless the parents consent to the adoption of their child, the department is required to petition the circuit court for guardianship pursuant to F.L. \u00a7 5-313. If the circuit court finds by clear and convincing evidence, after considering the statutorily enumerated factors, that it is in the best interest of a child previously adjudicated a CINA for parental rights to be terminated, the circuit court has authority to grant the department\u2019s petition for guardianship. Such award carries with it the right- for the department to consent to the adoption of the child. F.L. \u00a7 \u00a7 5-311 and 5-317(f).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-6\">The overriding theme of both the federal and state legislation is that a child should have permanency in his or her life. The valid premise is that it is in a child\u2019s best interest to be placed in a permanent home and to spend as little time as possible in foster care. Thus, Title 5 of the Family Law Article seeks to prevent the need for removal of a child from its home, to return a child to its home when possible, and where returning home is not possible, to place the child in another permanent placement that has legal status.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">335 Md. at 103-06, 642 A.2d at 203-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">THE ROLE OF AND REQUIREMENTS ON THE TRIAL COURT</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-10\">We explained the role of and requirements on trial courts in applying Subtitle 8 of Maryland\u2019s Family Law Article in our opinion in <em>In re: Damon M., </em>pointing out that: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>Prior to 1998, the responsibility lor developing a permanency plan for a child in foster care was entrusted to the local department of social services. Md.Code (1984, 1991 Repl. Vol., 1995 Cum.Supp.) \u00a7 5-525(c) of the Family Law Article. Before 1996, a plan developed by the local department was reviewed by the court, together with the report and recommendation of the Foster Care Review Board, as a part of the disposition review hearing the court was required to conduct. Md.Code (1984, 1991 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 5-544(3) of the Family Law Article. As a result of the amendment of the Juvenile Causes Act in 1996, see Ch. 595, Laws of 1996, the juvenile court was mandated to \u201chold a hearing to review the implementation of a permanency plan\u201d for each child in foster care within 10 months of the disposition hearing in which the CINA finding was made. Md.Code (1996, 1997 Cum.Supp.) \u00a7 3-826.1 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. It is of interest to note that the statute provided that if the child was to be \u201ccontinued in placement for a specified period,\u201d then the court would have to determine \u201cthe extent of compliance with the permanency plan.\u201d \u00a7 3-826.1(d). The subsequent amendment to \u00a7 3-826.1, see ch. 539, Laws of 1998, to make it conform with the Federal Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 effected a significant change. Now, the court has the responsibility for determining the permanency plan, \u00a7 3-826.1(a)(1) and justifying the placement of children in out of home placements for a specified period or on a long-term or permanent basis, \u00a7 3-826.1(d), in addition to conducting periodic, six month review\u2019s. \u00a7 3-826.1(f).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-5\"><em>In re: Damon M., </em>362 Md. at 430-3.1 n. 1, 765 A.2d 624 n. 1.

At that hearing, for each child in placement and in determining the plan, the court is required to make certain decisions and findings, \u00a7 3-826.1(c), [now \u00a7 3-823(e) ] specifically, whether the child should be: returned to the parent or guardian, \u00a7 3-826.1(c)(1)(i) [now \u00a7 3 \u2014 823(e)(1)(i) ]; placed with relatives to whom adoption or guardianship is granted, \u00a7 3-826.1(c)(1)(ii) [now \u00a7 3 \u2014 823(e)(1)(ii) ]; placed for adoption, \u00a7 3 \u2014 826.1(c)(1)(iii) [now \u00a7 2 \u2014 823(e)(1)(iii) ]; emancipated, \u00a7 3-826.1(c)(1)(iv) [now deleted]; or because of the child\u2019s special needs or circumstances, continued in placement on a permanent or long-term basis or for a specified period.\u201d \u00a7 3-826.1(c)(1)(v) and (vi) [now \u00a7 3-823(e)(1)(v) and (vi) ].

Subsection (f)(1)(ii) [now \u00a7 3-823(h)(1)(h), now revised to require review hearings every 12 months.]. As is true of the initial permanency planning hearing, the court must make some determinations at the hearing to review the permanency plan. \u00a7 3-826.1(0(2) [now \u00a7 3-823(h)(2) ]. Among other things, in addition to determining whether the commitment remains necessary and appropriate, subsection (f)(2)(i) [now \u00a7 3-823(h)(2)(i) ], and evaluating the progress made toward alleviating or mitigating the causes of the commitment, subsection (0(2)(iii) [now \u00a7 3 \u2014 823(h)(2)(iii) ], the court is required to \u201cdetermine the extent of compliance with the permanency plan,\u201d subsection (0(2)(ii) [now \u00a7 3-823(h)(2)(ii) ], and to change it \u201cif a change in the permanency plan would be in the child\u2019s best interest.\u201d Subsection (i)(2)(v) [now \u00a7 3-823(h)(2)(vi) ].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-5\">The permanency plan is an integral part of the statutory scheme designed to expedite the movement of Maryland\u2019s children from foster care to a permanent living, and hopefully, family arrangement. It provides the goal toward which the parties and the court are committed to work. It sets the tone for the parties and the court and, indeed, may be outcome determinative. Services to be provided by the local social service department and commitments that must be made by the parents and children are determined by the permanency plan. And, because it may not be changed without the court first determining that it is in the child\u2019s best interest to do so, the permanency plan must be in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>child\u2019s best interest. These are the reasons, no doubt, that the court is charged with determining the plan and with periodically reviewing it, evaluating all the while the extent to which it is being complied with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-5\">It is true, of course, that a parent will have lost custody before a permanency plan will have been developed. Nevertheless, once determined, because the permanency plan sets out the anticipated permanent placement, to the achievement of which the \u201creasonable efforts,\u201d required by \u00a7 3 \u2014 826.1(f)(3) [now \u00a7 3 \u2014 823(h)(3) ], must and will be directed, it can not be totally divorced from the issue and, in point of fact and in a real sense, actually is a part of it. Moreover and in fact, when the plan is reunification, there necessarily is, on the part of the court and, certainly, the parent, an expectation \u2014 more than a hope \u2014 that the parent will regain custody. That is, after all, the point of the plan and the reasonable efforts, including the provision of services to the family, so necessary to achieving compliance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-6\"><em>Id., </em>362 Md. at 435-37, 765 A.2d at 627-28. As <em>In re: Damon M. </em>observes, the purpose of a permanency plan is to set the direction in which the parent, agencies, and the court will work in terms of reaching a satisfactory conclusion to the situation. Once set initially, the goal of the permanency plan is re-visited periodically at hearings to determine progress and whether, due to historical and contemporary circumstances, that goal should be changed. It is not the purpose of the initial permanency plan hearing, however, to resolve all issues involved in that final resolution. If that were the case, there would be no need for review of how, on a regular basis, the plan is progressing or not. Also as <em>In re: Damon M. </em>indicates, the initial permanency plan hearing is to be held and conducted expeditiously. Protracted proceedings in establishing the initial plan defeat the purpose of the statute. The statute presumes that, unless there are compelling circumstances to the contrary, the plan should be to work toward reunification, as it is presumed that it is in the best interest of a child to be returned to his or her natural parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>D.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">THE STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">In <em>In re: Damon M. </em>we held that, despite their interlocutory nature, orders of court regarding permanency plans are immediately appealable. <em>Id. </em>362 Md. at 438, 765 A.2d at 628-29. The appellate standard of review as to the overall determination of the hearing court is one of \u201cabuse of discretion.\u201d Because children and fundamental rights are at stake, and the fact that speed and stability are desirable where permanency plans are concerned, it is useful to discuss at some length what precisely \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d means in the context of review of a permanency plan order. In <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 3598, </em>347 Md. 295, 701 A.2d 110 (1997), we described \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-6\">Judicial discretion was defined in <em>Saltzgaver v. Saltzgaver, </em>182 Md. 624, 635, 35 A.2d 810, 815 (1944) (quoting Bowers\u2019 Judicial Discretion of Trial Courts at P 10) as \u201cthat power of decision exercised to the necessary end of awarding justice and based upon reason and law, but for which decision there is no special governing statute or rule.\u201d It has also been defined as a \u201creasoned decision based on the weighing of various alternatives.\u201d There is an abuse of discretion \u201cwhere no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the [trial] court,\u201d or when the court acts \u201cwithout reference to any guiding rules or principles.\u201d An abuse of discretion may also be found where the ruling under consideration is \u201cclearly against the logic and effect of facts and inferences before the court,\u201d or when the ruling is \u201cvolatile of fact and logic.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-7\">Questions within the discretion of the trial court are \u201cmuch better decided by the trial judges than by appellate courts, and the decisions of such judges should only be disturbed where it is apparent that some serious error or abuse of discretion or autocratic action has occurred.\u201d In sum, to be reversed \u201cthe decision under consideration has to be well removed from any center mark imagined by the reviewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>court and beyond the fringe of what that court deems minimally acceptable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">347 Md. at 312-13, 701 A.2d at 118-19 (some internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">For cases involving the custody of children generally, our precedents establish a three part review of the decisions of the lower courts, addressing the findings of fact, conclusions at law, and the determination of the court as a whole. We set forth the rule for review of custody cases in <em>Davis v. Davis, </em>280 Md. 119, 372 A.2d 231 (1977), where we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">Maryland Rule 886 (applicable to this Court) and, in identical language, Rule 1086 (applicable to the Court of Special Appeals) provide the standard of review of actions tried without a jury.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In such actions, the appellate courts of this State \u201creview the case upon both the law and the evidence, but the judgment of the lower court will not be set aside on the evidence unless clearly erroneous and due regard will be given to the opportunity of the lower court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d Rule 886 <em>&amp; </em>1086. The \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d concept is no newcomer to Maryland procedure: The predecessor of Rule 886 (adopted effective January 1, 1957 as Rule 886 a), General Rules of Practice and Procedure, Part Three, III, Rule 9 c (effective September 1, 1944), contained the same scope of review embodied in the present rule; moreover, prior to the standard\u2019s codification as a rule, it was the time-honored practice on appeals to this Court in equity actions to give great weight to the chancellor\u2019s findings of fact. And we have heretofore noted that these rules in essence merely conformed the scope of review in nonjury actions at law to the scope of review we had always applied in equity appeals. Nothing in Rule 886 indicates that it does not apply to all cases tried without a jury, and we have explicitly held that the rule applies when we review nonjury criminal causes (under Rule 772), nonjury defective delinquency cases, child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>support awards, and child custody cases. <em>Hild v. Hild, </em>221 Md. 349, 359, 157 A.2d 442, 448 (1960). Since <em>Hild </em>we have consistently applied the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d portion of Rule 886 (or that standard without citation to the rule) in our review of child custody awards. Moreover, even prior to our explicit recognition in <em>Hild </em>of the applicability of Rule 886, our predecessors in essence utilized the clearly erroneous standard when reviewing factual determinations on appeals of child custody actions. Since Rules 886 and 1086 are identical, what we say with respect to one is equally applicable to the other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-5\">Having determined that Rule 886 is controlling in child custody cases, we now consider the extent to which the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d portion of it applies in such appeals. The words of the rule itself make plain that an appellate court cannot set aside factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous, and this is so even when the chancellor has not seen or heard the witnesses. On the other hand, it is equally obvious that the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d portion of Rule 886 does not apply to a trial court\u2019s determinations of legal questions or conclusions of law based upon findings of fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-6\">Although these two propositions are clear, there is some confusion in our cases with respect to the standard of review applicable to the chancellor\u2019s ultimate conclusion as to which party should be awarded custody. Notwithstanding some language in our opinions that this conclusion cannot be set aside unless clearly erroneous, we believe that, because such a conclusion technically is not a matter of fact, the clearly erroneous standard has no applicability. However, we also repudiate the suggestion contained in some of our predecessors\u2019 opinions, and relied upon by the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Sullivan v. Auslaender, </em>12 Md.App. 1, 3-5, 276 A.2d 698, 700-01 (1971), and its progeny, that appellate courts must exercise their \u201cown sound judgment\u201d in determining whether the conclusion of the chancellor was the best one. Quite to the contrary, it is within the sound discretion of the chancellor to award custody according to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>the exigencies of each case, and as our decisions indicate, a reviewing court may interfere with such a determination only on a clear showing of abuse of that discretion. Such broad discretion is vested in the chancellor because only he sees the witnesses and the parties, hears the testimony, and has the opportunity to speak with the child; he is in a far better position than is an appellate court, which has only a cold record before it, to weigh the evidence and determine what disposition will best promote the welfare of the minor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-5\">In sum, we point out three distinct aspects of review in child custody disputes. When the appellate court scrutinizes factual findings, the clearly erroneous standard of Rules 886 and 1086 applies. [Secondly,] [i]f it appears that the chancellor erred as to matters of law, further proceedings in the trial court will ordinarily be required unless the error is determined to be harmless. Finally, when the appellate court views the ultimate conclusion of the chancellor founded upon sound legal principles and based upon factual findings that are not clearly erroneous, the chancellor\u2019s decision should be disturbed only if there has been a clear abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">280 Md. at 122-26, 372 A.2d at 232-34 (some internal citations omitted; emphasis added).

As we have pointed out, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 3-823(f) sets forth a statutory hierarchy of placement options in descending order of priority.

And it\u2019s not an easy thing to do. It hasn\u2019t been easy. This case has not been easy from the very beginning, because of the parties involved in it. And I don\u2019t mean the attorneys and the foster parents and the social workers. I don\u2019t mean that at all. I mean, because of Yve and her mom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-6\">I think that I remarked the last time, and I will reiterate again that I think that I\u2019ve had this case almost 100 percent of the time the hearings have come in. I believe that I even had the emergency, I had the adjudication, I had the disposition, uh \u2014 I\u2019m the judge who returned Yve to her mom, uh \u2014 and obviously hindsight\u2019s 20/20, but that was a major disaster.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-7\">I\u2019ve been the judge that\u2019s seen Yve and watched her progress since she came back from North Carolina. I\u2019ve seen Yve on many occasions. She\u2019s come in to see me. We usually don\u2019t have her sitting here. Sometimes we do, for the court hearings, if they weren\u2019t too controversial, we had her here. She\u2019s drawn me many pictures. She\u2019s written me many letters. We\u2019ve had many conversations at foster care picnics. She\u2019s one of the first children that always comes up to me and says hi, Judge [ ], how are you, and tells me what\u2019s going on with her, and introduces me to all her friends. She\u2019s a lovely, delightful little girl.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-8\">But, during all the years that I\u2019ve known Yve, I know that she\u2019s not what she appears on the surface. She also has many, many problems. Her mom is a wonderful person, and for the most times that she\u2019s been in the courtroom, she\u2019s been very, very appropriate, very polite, respectful, uh, trying to answer questions that were given to her, trying to give information and has never, ever shown anything but complete love and concern for Yve.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-9\">And I think that [Counsel for Yve S.] is right, that Yve has always wanted to be with her mom. There\u2019s no ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>tion about it, and her mom has always wanted Yve with her. The problem has been that for a good portion of this case, Mom\u2019s not been capable of taking care of Yv\u00e9. And for also a good portion of the case, even if Mom were capable, at certain times, Yve\u2019s had some real severe problems. I remember when she first went to live with [Yve S.\u2019s first foster family]. She had some real acting-out problems. As a matter of fact, before she even came into care, the school were so concerned, her problems were such, she was acting out in school. They were very, very concerned about her, with what was going on, which is, I think what eventually brought the Department into the case, was. the school\u2019s concern, because they saw her on an everyday basis, and her inability to conform her behavior, uh \u2014 brought her to the attention of, uh, the authorities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">There\u2019s no doubt in my mind that Ms. S. absolutely adores Yve, and there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that Yve adores her mom. But, I cannot at this time return Yve to her mom. Although she\u2019s doing much better than at any time that I\u2019ve ever seen her, just a few things stand out that are indicative of decisions that she made that put Yve at risk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">One of the reasons that she lost her job, and who knows what the real reason is, but we\u2019ve had a lot of people testify about it. Ms. S. testified about it, Ms. Rose [the social services case worker] testified about it, the minister testified about it, uh \u2014 is that week she chose to go to Suburban Hospital rather, with a friend that was having a problem, rather than go to work. Now, I certainly admire her for doing that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">She is a good friend and wants to help the person, but that was one of the straws that broke the camel\u2019s back, about why she lost her job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-8\">On Sunday, I think that it\u2019s wonderful that she works with women at the homeless center, because she herself was there for a while. She understands how important that it is to be involved there. But, she doesn\u2019t need to bring that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>woman around Yve. Yve\u2019s a child who needs constant care, attention, structure, as well as love.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-4\">Uh \u2014 I\u2019m very aware of Yve\u2019s condition when she came back from North Carolina and all of the things that happened to her in North Carolina. Uh \u2014 that situation was very detrimental to her. She ended up being placed, by her mom, left in the care of some people who were pretty bad people. Hopefully nothing happened to her. We don\u2019t know for sure whether it did or it didn\u2019t, but she ended up having to go into foster care there, and then coming back here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">As recently within the last two weeks, she says she wanted to kill herself. That\u2019s definitely a child with special needs. Most ten-year-olds do not go around saying they want to kill themselves. She says that she wants to be with her mom, because her mom needs her. She wants to make her mom happy. That\u2019s a very big burden for a ten-year-old girl. It\u2019s really hard for her to take care of herself, much less feel the responsibility of having to take care of her mom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">I don\u2019t know, there\u2019s no way to ever know whether Ms. S. will be able to take care of Yve. I hope so, but it is certainly not now. And Yve asked me to make a decision, and I\u2019m not going to have that decision be that we\u2019ll work towards getting her home with her mom, because I don\u2019t see the realistic expectation of that. I honestly don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">Taking care of her on weekends, and I\u2019m so glad that the visits have been successful, is one thing, but trying to manage a child like Yve, with all of the, the special attention that she needs, and all the coordination that is involved with</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-8\">getting her to the therapist that she needs, working with the school system. Mom\u2019s tried, she really has tried, and I give her all kinds of credit for that. I think that she\u2019s done a wonderful job with that. But no one today says that she\u2019s able to do it, and I don\u2019t know when she\u2019ll ever be able to do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>The job situation is certainly part of it, but that\u2019s not the whole thing. It\u2019s a judgment consideration. I understand what Ms. Rose talked about her concern about the escalation in behavior, and I also understand that Dr. Harold [Yvonne S\u2019s psychiatrist] sees that not as a problem. He talked about the lack of communication. I was struck not by the same things that Ms. Rose was struck by, with Ms. S.\u2019s testimony, but her \u2014 inability sometimes to listen to what the question is, and answer it. She often answers questions that are asked. And Dr. Harold alluded that with \u2014 Ms. Rose testified that she tried to say to Ms. S., I can\u2019t read his writing, I don\u2019t understand what he means, you\u2019ve got to tell me what the explanation was, and it became a big problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\">Somehow or another, that lack of communication, and I don\u2019t really know why, but it happens a lot. And today, when Ms. S. was testifying, she often answered questions that were not the questions that were asked. . The information was certainly beneficial and appropriate, but it was not the question that was asked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">My point in bringing that up is that Yve is a child who requires constant, vigilant attention, and she needs clear guidelines, structure. She needs to know, she has to act within something that she can anticipate. And the progress that she\u2019s made in the [current foster parent\u2019s] home, from the testimony has been, because of the structure that they\u2019ve been able to provide for her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\">I have extreme concerns about the mom ever being able to provide the structure that Yve needs. So, I know that it\u2019s taken me a long time to get here, but it\u2019s taken us a long time, and we\u2019ve heard a lot of evidence. And, I don\u2019t think that any of it wasn\u2019t beneficial. I was very interested to hear from, us \u2014 Ms. S.\u2019s minister, and I\u2019m so happy for her that she has him in her life, and that she has the extended church. I think that information was very, very beneficial, and I\u2019m glad for her that she has that. And it\u2019s a real network that can help her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>I think that it\u2019s wonderful that she has Dr. Harold. Clearly, they have an excellent relationship, and she\u2019s made so much progress from where she\u2019s ever since the 50 \u2014 how many months, four, six, since we\u2019ve been involved in this case, uh, she\u2019s made wonderful progress, and she\u2019s doing really, really well. But I just cannot make the decision that she\u2019s going to be able to take care of Yve.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-4\">So, I am going to adopt the permanency plan of long-term foster care. I feel that it\u2019s appropriate that she remain, where she has been, for over thirty-some months, where she has done very well. She\u2019s blossomed there. On the other hand, I think that it\u2019s very appropriate that she continue to have visitation with her mom, and as frequent\u2014 certainly a minimum of once a week, and as long as both of them are able to maintain safety.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-6\">Again, my priority is Yve. She is number one. It\u2019s my understanding from listening to Ms. Rose testify that she\u2019s hoping to get back to weekend visits, very, very soon, and I would certainly hope that\u2019s what happens. But, I am going to put the visitation minimum of once a week, under the direction of the Department, because clearly, in this case, things change. Things change with Yve, and things change with her mom.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">(emphases added). It is apparent to us from these \u201cfindings\u201d that the best interest of the child standard was misapplied in this case. As detailed <em>supra, </em>the proper issue before the hearing judge was whether there was sufficient evidence that further abuse or neglect was unlikely.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Except to the extent that the parent\u2019s ability, or lack thereof, to deal with the needs of a child rise to the level of neglect, findings that the child has \u201csome real severe problems\u201d or \u201chas special needs\u201d or \u201crequires constant, vigilant attention,\u201d or has mentioned sui<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>tide,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> are not relevant to this determination. Similarly, as we have pointed out repeatedly, the fact that the child may be \u201cdoing very well,\u201d or may have made progress in the environment of foster care,' or even \u201cblossomed there,\u201d or may feel that she needs to take on the burden of caring for the parent, are also largely not telling on the main issue. \u201cThe fact that [a parent] has a mental or emotional problem and is less than a perfect parent or that the children may be happier with their foster parents is not a legitimate reason to remove them from a-natural parent competent to care for them in favor of a stranger.\u201d <em>In re: Barry E., </em>107 Md.App. at 220, 667 A.2d at 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Reading the remaining \u201cfindings\u201d in a light most charitable to the hearing judge, we note that she seemed to be concerned about the mother\u2019s ability to exercise sound judgment, doubt about which the trial judge felt somehow placed Yve S. at risk. The hearing judge neither states how these concerns rose to the level of, or somehow indicate a future likelihood of, abuse or neglect, nor is it particularly clear how any of the judge\u2019s concerns, individually or collectively, actually put Yve S. at any perceivable risk.. More to the point, however, the \u201cfindings\u201d themselves are not supported by the relevant record evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The first of these findings is the assumption by the trial judge that one of the reasons Yvonne S. lost her job was because she chose to visit a sick friend in the hospital instead of going to work on time. Yvonne S did testify that she went to the hospital one day as the result of a friend passing away, and that as a result she was slightly over two hours late for work that day. The undisputed testimony, however, was that she nonetheless worked over eight hours that day. There is no testimony in the record by anyone that her being late for work that day was the reason for the loss of the particular job. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>To the contrary, the uncontraverted testimony from Yvonne S. and from her psychiatrist, Dr. Harold, was that the reason she lost her job was because of the scheduling demands made upon Ms. S. by the case worker, Ms. Rose, and by the numerous court hearings in this case. Regarding Ms. S.\u2019s employment discharge, Ms. Rose testified on cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-5\">Petitioner\u2019s Counsel: How many phone contacts did she have with the employer prior to his informing her that she was going to be fired?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-6\">Respondent\u2019s Counsel: And I would object as to relevancy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak5\">COURT: I\u2019ll allow it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-7\">A: Since Ms. S. first began working there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-8\">Q: Yes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-9\">A: This will just be off the top of my head, because I\u2014 would have to go back through my notes. I would say probably about six.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-10\">Q: And, uh, most of those occurred prior to her being fired, didn\u2019t they?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-11\">A: All but one occurred prior to her being fired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-12\">Q: But within the month prior to her being fired?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-13\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-14\">Q: Was there one prior to the one where he told you she was fired?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-15\">A: One\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-16\">Q: Tell\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-17\">A: All of them but one were prior to the \u2014 her being fired. Which one are you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-18\">Q: Okay. In the month before she was fired, how many times did you talk to her employer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-19\">A: Uh \u2014 I don\u2019t recall talking to him at all that previous month.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-20\">Q: Do you remember talking to Ms. S about having a visit with Yve that would go over into a Monday?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-21\">A: Yes, thank you for refreshing my memory. There was one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Q: And what did you say to the employer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-5\">A: I, uh \u2014 we were trying to offer Ms. S. extended visits. She had mentioned at her school meeting that she didn\u2019t have as much information as the rest of us, \u2018cause she felt that she didn\u2019t have that much time with her daughter.\u2019 And I was trying to come up with some plan where we could extend that. So I offered her a visit beginning from Friday evening until she could keep her through Monday morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3a\">Q: And she told you that she couldn\u2019t do that, because she had to be at work early on Monday morning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">A: She had to be at work at nine o\u2019clock Monday morning, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-7\">Q: And in order to do that, she would have to drive Yve to Silver Spring in the morning, and they would have to get up too early in the morning. It wouldn\u2019t be good for Yve.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQd\">A: That was her statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-8\">Q: And she also told you that this was jeopardizing her job, if she continued to make requests of her employer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AoY\">A: I don\u2019t remember her saying that it was jeopardizing her job. My memory is that she said that her employer did not want her to do this, because she might come in late.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Arz\">Q: Was it after that, that you talked to the employer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-9\">A: Yes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-10\">Q: And what did you say to him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-11\">A: I asked him if this was a concern that he had?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"At5\">Q: And that was before the conversation that you had with him, where he told you that she was fired?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-13\">A: Yes</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-14\">There is nothing in Ms. Rose\u2019s testimony that supports the \u201cfinding\u201d of the trial judge that poor judgment was the reason for Yvonne S.\u2019s discharge, and certainly nothing connecting the discharge to a visit to a friend in the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-15\">Similarly, there is no such connection in any of the testimony by others who addressed the issue of Yvonne S.\u2019s employment. Yvonne S. testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-16\">Q: Did Christopher Trump (Phonetic)\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>A: Uh\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-5\">Q: Tell you that you were discharged?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-6\">A: Uh \u2014 well, I had, after that, I had a meeting with two staff people. One was human resources, two were human resources, one was Chris Trump, and he said to me, you\u2019ve been canceled, which I don\u2019t really know what canceled means. And then I spoke to the director, who \u2014 I mean, he\u2019s the director of the activities department, who I\u2019ve had excellent performance with, who had written several letters of recommendation and excellent job performance, which is under, the Court does have. The situation is this. Your Honor, uh, he is, unfortunately, the Department of Health and Human Services has placed a lot of uh \u2014 pressure on my schedule, uh, and he has been so accommodating with my scheduling and you know, court dates, letters that he\u2019s written in my, on behalf of my support, which I appreciate immensely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-7\">And, uh \u2014 because of that, he\u2019s very, very concerned that uh, because of that, I\u2019m not going to be there for the residents ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-8\">Q: Did Chris Trump tell you yesterday, that you were being discharged from the job because you were being tardy so often and absent so often?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-9\">A: What he said was, I said that I was rarely ever late, that I would come in early much of the time to compensate for any of the work that I missed, up \u2014 uh, for, for court hearings or what have you. And that is absolutely true. Rarely have I ever been late. I would, I would go early, and not get paid for it, and that comment was made by the Human Resources, well, you\u2019re not allowed to do that. And I said, well I, I just, you know, wanted to compensate for the time, you know, that I have missed concerning court orders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-10\">Chris Trump and I discussed at length about uh, the Department and \u2014 making demands on my time, and he accommodated one hundred percent, and he just, I made a comment about the possible appeal, if I didn\u2019t get this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>situation with Yve back. And said, oh no, you mean \u2014 I said it might not be now, or three months from now. He said, oh no, you mean I\u2019m going to have to look forward to going through this again with you through the court system and with the Department of Health and Human Services? And then right after that, the word canceling you came out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Dr. Harold, Yvonne S.\u2019s psychiatrist, also testified as to how the demands made by the Department were creating stress regarding Yvonne S.\u2019s employment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-6\">Q: And have you noted that she\u2019s under some stress no, or not under stress now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">A: Uh, the current stress is around, you know, this court hearing, regarding custody. And so uh \u2014 that obviously has been of some stress to her. Uh, there has been some stress recently around just the requirements that she\u2019s had to keep, uh, regarding caring for her daughter, and uh, complying with the County and Court stipulations for uh \u2014 you know, regarding custody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-8\">Q: Could you explain to [the Judge] in a little detail what some of the stresses are you are dealing with, that she\u2019s had to face, and what \u2014 what she\u2019s expressed to you, and how you\u2019ve helped her deal with that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-9\">A: A lot of it has been around, around scheduling, uh, as has been brought out. Uh, there has been some impact on her job, because of, uh, scheduled activities regarding, uh\u2014 school, or meeting with Ms. Rose, or uh \u2014 uh, scheduled things with her daughter and her therapist, and, her daughter\u2019s doctor. Schedules, in terms of family visits uh, with the Scheibels, and that weekend exchange. So, the impact on her work schedule, and that, that has been stressful. (E-265-66)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">The only other individual who testified on this score was Yvonne S.\u2019s pastor, Reverend Robinson. He testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-11\">Q: Reverend, do you have any connection with this administrator at her prior employment? Is she involved in your church, or were you just working with her, for\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>A: She\u2019s a parishioner of our church.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-5\">Q: She\u2019s a parishioner? And what is her name?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">A: Leah Bowden.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-7\">Q: How do you spell that last name?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-8\">A: B-o-w-d-e-n.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-9\">Q: And is it your understanding that Ms. S. has lost her job at the Potomac Nursing Home and is looking for a new job?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-10\">A: I don\u2019t know if I have the liberty to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-11\">Petitioner\u2019s Counsel: Objection, Your Honor, I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-12\">A: really answer that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-13\">COURT: Well, I\u2019ll allow him, her to inquire on the basis of his conversation with this lady, because he testified to that, as to being sure that she would be able to get her a job. So, I\u2019ll allow him to answer that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-14\">A: Okay, uh, to my understanding that she lost the job, definitely from that department that she was in. That the administrator has indicated uh, there may be a possibility in another department. I know that she\u2019s also their link to several other homes in the area, with uh, some kind of working agreement, partnership, I don\u2019t know exactly, but uh\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-16\">Q: And is it your understanding that she lost the job because she was unreliable and undependable\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-17\">Petitioner\u2019s Counsel: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-18\">Q: in coming to work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-19\">Petitioner\u2019s Counsel: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-20\">COURT: Overruled</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-21\">A: Uh \u2014 no, I was not told that. I\u2019m not fully acquainted with exact \u2014 all the reasons why she lost the job.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-22\">Based upon this record, the pertinent finding of the trial judge is clearly erroneous. There is simply no competent evidence in the record to support the \u201cfinding\u201d that choosing to visit a friend in the hospital was given meaningful weight in the prior employer\u2019s decision to let go Yvonne S. As such, it cannot support a \u201cfinding\u201d as an example of poor decision-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>making \u201cthat put Yve at risk.\u201d On the contrary, the record indicates, if anything, that the loss of her former position was a consequence of dealing with the hearing court\u2019s and the Department\u2019s requirements and proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">Similarly, we are at a loss to understand how Yvonne S.\u2019s religious conviction and her volunteering to work at a homeless shelter were transformed into a detriment to Ms. S.\u2019s ability to give appropriate attention to her child (at the time of the 28 March 2001 hearing an eleven year old girl) or how it placed her child at risk. Giving a homeless woman a ride to church is not evidence of a deficiency in judgment, and certainly is not evidence of potential future abuse or neglect on the part of the mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The third \u201cfinding\u201d of the hearing judge explicated how she viewed, in essence, Ms. S.\u2019s testimonial demeanor. Apparently the trial court shared the view reflected in the testimony of the social worker, Ms. Rose, that because Ms. S. gave more information than was requested in response to questions posed to her when testifying indicated that Ms. S. potentially was relapsing into a manic phase of her mental illness. We shall address Ms. Rose\u2019s testimony <em>infra. </em>The only other testimony as to Ms. S.\u2019s testimonial demeanor came from the only participant qualified and in a position to draw a medical conclusion from such observation, Ms. S.\u2019s treating psychiatrist, Dr. Harold. At the 28 March 2001 hearing, Dr. Harold testified as follows regarding Ms. S.\u2019s earlier testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">Q: And, uh, were you able to observe her testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-8\">Q: And, uh, what did you observe about her demeanor and her, uh, uh \u2014 her language, during that testimony, specifically?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-9\">A: Really nothing out of the ordinary, from what I observed with her, having met with her over our time of, uh\u2014 my treating her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-10\">Q: And that would be over two years?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-5\">Q: And, uh \u2014 the social worker expressed concern, specifically about her jumping from subject to subject. What did you observe about that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-6\">A: I haven\u2019t seen that in my meetings with her, nor during that hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-7\">Q: What did you observe about her, uh \u2014 her answers to questions during that hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-8\">A: They were directed. I guess the problem came when Ms. S. made her statements involving religion and her views of how that would figure into the court outcome.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAq\">Q: What was your take on that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-9\">A: Uh \u2014 it wasn\u2019t anything, I think excessive, in terms of, uh \u2014 concern about hyperreligiosity, as related to say, a manic episode. I didn\u2019t see that evident there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-10\">Q: What, what\u2019s your, uh, thought on the fact that she raised, uh, religion at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-11\">A: It, it \u2014 you know, once again, it really wasn\u2019t excessive to the degree that it would, you know, warrant concern about this being indicative of a manic episode. And actually, in fact, uh, having taught Sunday school myself for about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>six years, uh, \u2014 I\u2019ve seen very similar kind of statements, uh \u2014 or not so much statements, but level of expression of faith. It wasn\u2019t anything unusual, I thought.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-5\">Also, in terms of working with people who have bipolar illness, who do become excessive with their religious thoughts and statements, it wasn\u2019t anything near that, that degree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-6\">Q: What are the \u2014 what kinds of behaviors would give you concern?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-7\">A: If the majority of her statements, say during the entire hearing and also during meetings with myself, uh \u2014 if those were present, that to me would indicate some excessive religious thoughts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-8\">Q: And, uh \u2014 what about her demeanor during the hearing? Did you have any concern about that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-9\">A: Uh \u2014 you know, it, this has been a long hearing. I mean, we have been at this since December, looking for a decision. And you know, to me, it seems like everybody\u2019s kind of dealing with the stress of when a decision would be made. And, you know, at the time, that was looking to be, the time something would be decided, you know, was like, this is her, her last ditch effort in a sense. This is her putting in her plea, her emotions, her, you know, her view of how she would like this to come out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-10\">Q: Was there anything at all during that testimony that raised any concern on you part?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-11\">A: No</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-12\">Q: What about expressing sadness and crying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-13\">A: Uh \u2014 in light of what\u2019s just at stake here, it seemed appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-14\">Q: What would you see in someone that was going into a manic episode that would be different from that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-15\">A: It\u2019s much more, much more excessive. It\u2019s much more frequent, uh, it\u2019s much more elevated, in terms of the degree of the expression, and it\u2019s also, you know, coupled with other behaviors indicative of a manic-type episode.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>We agree with Petitioner that she is not a professional witness and, as such, fairly can be expected not to give precise, clipped answers to questions, especially given the stakes involved. We also agree with Petitioner that \u201cequating her demeanor on the witness stand to a lack of structure indicative of an inability to attend to a child who \u2018needs vigilant attention\u2019 is a strained inferential leap at best ...,\u201d in light of the testimony of the psychiatrist, and particularly where the hearing judge herself quixotically states in her findings that the additional information supplied by Yvonne S. was both \u201cbeneficial and appropriate.\u201d This is hardly compelling evidence of a likelihood of future abuse or neglect. The hearing judge\u2019s finding is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Finally, the trial court found that Ms. S. was unable to care for a child with the needs of Yve S. because \u201cno one today says that she\u2019s able to do it.... \u201d That finding also it is unsupported on this record. Dr. Harold testified on direct examination as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-6\">Q: Do you, based on your work with Ms. S. for the last two years, is it your professional opinion that she can provide a stable, consistent and supportive family environment for Yve?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-7\">A: I would say that her case record or track record with us, and if she continued to do this well, she\u2019s able to do that. Q: Is there any contraindication to having custody of your children where you have bipolar illness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-8\">A: It depends on one\u2019s stability. Certainly, if someone is actively uh, in a manic episode, or depressed episode, uh, and if that, depending on the severity of that, that certainly can affect one\u2019s ability to rear children. With Ms. S., uh, and honestly, we have tried to be as objective about this as we can, we being myself, [and my psychiatric practice colleagues] Dr. Sommers and Ms. Kazinski, in looking at her uh, treatments, her uh, wellness and her ability to do this. And we all conclude that uh, with her compliance, uh \u2014 and her lack of symptoms at this point, she\u2019s able to do that. And, we certainly would not recommend otherwise, if we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>thought so. And we\u2019ve \u2014 done that with others in the past who we thought couldn\u2019t, you know, met obligations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">More germane, however, was Dr. Harold\u2019s testimony on the level of stress full custody would have on Yvonne S., and the likelihood of relapse as a result of that stress:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-6\">Q: What about the effect of working with the social worker in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-7\">A: That\u2019s been stressful, because there\u2019s been a lot of demands placed on Ms. S., in regards to, uh, what she has to provide for the social worker, in terms of documentation, uh, visits, uh \u2014 -just compliance with what\u2019s ordered by the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-8\">Q: What kind of demands have been made that you think are somewhat stress-producing for her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-9\">A: Uh, Ms. S., has talked about problems with her visits, particularly weekend visits, that were unannounced and unexpected, uh \u2014 that\u2019s been stressful. She\u2019s talked about just having to basically prove herself, how she\u2019s gotten some feedback from the social worker about uh, uh \u2014 uh, what uh, she considers uh, I guess her duty, or her objective, uh, in working with Ms. S\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-10\">Q: Whose duty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-11\">A: Ms. S. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-12\">Q: The social worker, or Ms. S.?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-13\">A: Uh, Ms. \u2014 the social worker\u2019s</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-14\">Q: What uh \u2014 what about the reporting requirements? What does the social worker ask Ms. S. to do that is somewhat stressful? Was there something specifically that she\u2019s asked her to do after every visit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-15\">A: She\u2019s talked about how she has to write a report,chronicling what happens with each visit, what took place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Am0\">Q: What about meetings with therapists and other people? Are there report requirements for that as well?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-16\">A: Uh \u2014 I believe so. I\u2019m not totally sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-17\">Respondent\u2019s Counsel: I would object, Your Honor, as to relevancy. This witness is testifying about what may be uh, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>appropriate for a child welfare agency to do. I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s relevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-5\">Petitioner\u2019s Counsel: Well, I\u2019m asking him about stressors on Ms. S., and whether it\u2019s really worthwhile for this to continue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-6\">COURT: Well. I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s what this case is about, stressors on Ms. S.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Why don\u2019t we go onto another question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-7\">Petitioner\u2019s Counsel: Well, I think that it is. I think that the Department is saying that she\u2019s going to be more stressed if she gets the child in her custody, and I\u2019m saying that she will be less stressed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-8\">COURT: Well, I don\u2019t think that you\u2019ve said that. Why don\u2019t you ask that question then.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-9\">Q: Would she be more stressed or less stressed, if she\u2019s placed, uh, if the child is placed in her custody? Would that be more stressful or less stressful for Ms. S.?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-10\">A: At this point, I would have to say uh, less stressful, and like I said before, I think that the best way to uh, to uh, determine that would be to increase the visitation time and see how well she handles that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-11\">Q: Why would it be less stressful?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-12\">A: Uh, this is what she wants. It\u2019s what she feels able to do, uh \u2014 she would have proven she\u2019s a capable parent. Uh, the situation of custody and her uh, parenting competency will have been resolved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-13\">Q: When you say that she wouldn\u2019t have to report to anyone, you\u2019re talking about the written reports that she has to write at the end of every visit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-14\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-15\">Q: Have you met with the social worker and talked to her about the stresses, the requirements that she makes of Mrs. S.?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>A: I\u2019ve met with the social worker once. The subject of these things came up, although I did not talk with her directly about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-5\">Q: Did you have an opportunity to observe her demeanor, and uh \u2014 and manner with Ms. S.?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-6\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-7\">Q: And what conclusions did you come to, if any, about how she treats her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-8\">A: Uh\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-9\">Respondent\u2019s Counsel: Again, Your Honor, I would object. I mean, he\u2019s indicated that he\u2019s had one meeting with the social worker. I just don\u2019t think that this witness is, is an expert, I mean, in that, I man\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-10\">COURT: I\u2019ll let him testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-11\">Respondent\u2019s Counsel: He was called as an expert, as a psychiatrist for the, for the mother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-12\">COURT: I don\u2019t consider this to be an expert opinion. I\u2019ll allow him to answer it, if he has an opinion. He might not have one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-13\">A: Uh \u2014 I think that Ms. Rose uh, is certainly acting as an advocate for Yve. I think where we, uh, disagreed was what Ms. S. had to do in order to prove her competency, in being Yve\u2019s full-time parent. I think that Ms. Rose is concerned about Ms. S., uh, having some relapses as far as her illness goes, and how that would affect Yve. And uh, my response to her was that certainly I can\u2019t give you a guarantee.

In <em>Stickell v. City of Baltimore, 252 </em>Md. 464, 471, 250 A.2d 541 (1969), we observed: \u201cIt is well established that a person must demonstrate a minimal amount of competence or \u2018expertise\u2019 on the subject on which he is allegedly an expert in order to be qualified to testify as an expert witness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">279 Md. at 338-39, 368 A.2d at 1015 (some internal citations omitted). As this language suggests, the mere fact that a witness has been accepted to testify as an expert in a given field is not a license to testify at will. Such a witness only will be allowed to testify as an expert in areas where he or she has been qualified and accepted. Where a witness who is qualified as an expert in one area strays beyond the bounds of those qualifications into areas reserved for other types of expertise, issues may arise as to the proper admissibility of that testimony. As the Court of Special Appeals noted in <em>Globe Security Systems Co. v. Sterling, </em>79 Md.App. 303, 556 A.2d 731 (1989):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUC\">The Court ruled [in <em>Simmons v.

No court or expert is in possession of a magical crystal ball capable of answering with certainty this question, as the psychiatrist, Dr. Harold, pointed out, <em>supra. </em>The standard, rather, is whether it is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>likely that neglect will be repeated, which in this case ultimately becomes a question of whether the mother was stable and seemed likely to remain so.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Prior to 1978, only a licensed psychiatrist was permitted to make a diagnosis as to whether an individual was suffering from, or suffering a relapse of, a mental illness because the making of such a diagnosis constituted the practice of medicine. <em>State v.

Subsequently, in <em>In Re: Adoption/Guardianship No. CCJ14746, </em>360 Md. 634, 759 A.2d 755 (2000), we held that the Legislature, in Md.Code (1974) Health Occupations Art., \u00a7 19-101(m)(4)(ii) specifically allowed licensed clinical social workers to make a mental diagnosis, and therefore, they could testify to the same. 360 Md. at 641-47, 759 A.2d at 759-62. There have been no additional changes, and the rule remains the same at present. A witness may not testify to the effect of making a diagnosis concerning mental illness unless he or she is a physician qualified to make such a diagnosis or prognosis, or unless they are otherwise authorized by statute to make such diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">The Department\u2019s apparent theory in the case <em>sub judice </em>was that Ms. S., a woman diagnosed with a bi-polar disorder, was not a fit parent because, during a critical court appearance, where the future of her family was at stake, she evidenced nervousness and agitation, which, according to the social worker, Ms. Rose, was indicative of a relapse into another manic episode, notwithstanding the testimony of Yvonne S.\u2019s treating psychiatrist to the contrary. Ms. Rose, however, went one step too far, a step well beyond the scope of her expertise. Apparently trying to have it both ways, she stated: \u201cI am not in a position to diagnose whether she was in a manic phase or not, but that was the way that she appeared to me.\u201d Ms. Rose also testified that \u201c[UJnfortunately, Ms. S.\u2019s history is such that it\u2019s very questionable as to whether or not she\u2019s going to be able to maintain her stability\u201d and also that \u201cMs. S. has done an amazing job in the last two years of being able to stabilize herself. But, it, it\u2019s such that I, it appears to me that it takes a lot of her energy to keep herself stable. To add to the pressure of caring for a very special needs child such as Yve, the placement\u2019s [with the mother] not going to last.\u201d These statements are not only speculative, but amount to a lay diagnosis or prognosis regarding a complex medical issue. Ms. Rose is not qualified to do that, as she was not qualified as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or licensed clinical social worker. The testimony was improper and should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>been stricken. The trial judge erred in overruling Petitioner\u2019s objections to this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Nevertheless, this does not constitute a <em>per se </em>ground for reversal. The burden is upon Petitioner to show that the erroneously admitted testimony was material and prejudicial. In <em>Beahm, </em>we pointed out that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-6\">In the interest of the orderly administration of justice, and to avoid useless expense to the state and to litigants in its courts, it has long been settled policy of this court not to reverse for harmless error.\u201d This policy was iterated in <em>Balto. Transit Co. v. Castranda, </em>194 Md. 421, 439, 71 A.2d 442 (1950) and reiterated in <em>Adams v. Benson, </em>208 Md. 261, 269, 117 A.2d 881 (1955). As a corollary of that policy, it is firmly established that the complaining party has the burden of showing prejudice as well as error. If prejudice is shown, this Court will reverse. We summed up the policy with respect to the erroneous admission of hearsay evidence in <em>Kapiloff v. Locke, </em>276 Md. 466, 472, 348 A.2d 697 (1975):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AB2\">\u201cIt is, of course, true that the erroneous admission of evidence will not justify reversal unless the complaining party can show that the admission was prejudicial to him.... However, it is also clear that this Court will not hesitate to reverse where hearsay evidence is erroneously admitted and prejudice is shown.... The burden of proving prejudice in a <em>civil </em>case is on the complaining party .... \u201d (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9F\">Precise standards for the degree of prejudice required for reversal, have not been, and perhaps cannot be, established. In <em>Rippon v. Mercantile-Safe Dep.[ &amp; Trust Co. of Baltimore], </em>supra, 213 Md. at [215] 222,131 A.2d 695 [(1957)], we noted that the complaining, party made no effort to show \u201cunfairness or harm.\u201d In <em>Hance v. State Roads Comm., </em>221 Md. 164, 176, 156 A.2d 644 (1959) we observed: \u201cCourts are reluctant to set aside verdicts for errors in the admission or exclusion of evidence unless they cause substantial injustice,\u201d so \u201csubstantial prejudice\u201d must be shown. In <em>Rotwein v.

In <em>State Roads Comm. v. Kuenne, </em>supra, 240 Md. at 235 [213 A.2d 567], we spoke in terms of the error having \u201ca prejudicial effect on the outcome of the case.\u201d In <em>I.W. Berman Prop. v. Porter Bros., </em>276 Md. 1, 11-12, 344 A.2d 65 (1975), we repeated the \u201cboth manifestly wrong and substantially injurious\u201d language of <em>Rotwein v.

We concluded:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-5\">\u201cIn modern times, appellate review in all jurisdictions is subject to tenets that a judgment may be affirmed, under certain circumstances, despite errors committed in the conduct of the trial.

These rubrics, of constitutional, statutory or judicial origin, employ a variety of standards for determining whether a particular error is \u2018harmless,\u2019 but all require \u2018the resolution of whether the error significantly affected the interests of the complaining party\u2019.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 647 [368 A.2d 1005] citing C.

In <em>Maryland Deposit Insurance Fund Corp. v.

The only competent medical testimony properly admitted into the record regarding Ms. S.\u2019s present mental state and future prognosis was that of Dr. Harold, her treating psychiatrist. The juvenile judge apparently discounted his testimony and appeared to draw conclusions identical to those improperly admitted as a part of Ms. Rose\u2019s testimony. Reversal would be warranted on this ground alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">As we stated, <em>supra, </em>we conclude that the hearing court misapplied the best interest of the child standard in this case. As we pointed out, the standard does not mean that the child should be placed in the best possible environment. The statutory mandate requires that reunification of the child with the parent be the goal of the permanency plan if there is competent and credible evidence that future abuse or neglect is not likely. \u201cThe fear of harm to the child or to society must be a real one predicated upon hard evidence; it may not be simply a gut reaction or even a decision to err-if-at-all on the side of caution.\u201d <em>In re Jertrude O., </em>56 Md.App. at 100, 466 A.2d at 894. A fair reading of the findings and ruling of the hearing court indicate that the focus of the court was on what would be the best .environment for Yve S., not whether future neglect or abuse was not likely if returned to her mother\u2019s custody. The trial judge commented on the allegedly superior stability and structure of the foster home, and whether Yvonne S. would be able to provide the level of structure the court felt Yve S. needed. Reinforcing this notion, the court ruled that Yve S. should remain in long-term foster care, stating \u201cI feel that it\u2019s appropriate that she remain, where she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>has been, for over thirty-some months, where she has done very well. She\u2019s blossomed there.\u201d Because the hearing judge focused on where Yve S. would be better off, as opposed to the competent evidence of future abuse or neglect, insufficient consideration was given to whether the goal of the permanency plan should be reunification rather than long-term or permanent foster care.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Regarding the juvenile judge\u2019s ultimate conclusion, we particularly find telling the statement by the trial judge that \u201cI\u2019m the judge who returned Yve to her mom [in 1998], uh \u2014 and obviously hindsight\u2019s 20/20, but that was a major disaster.\u201d A natural reluctance to risk the possibility of a repeat \u201cdisaster\u201d is a pervasive theme throughout the record of this case, reflecting a philosophy \u201cto err-if-at-all on the side of caution\u201d on the part of the Department, as represented by Ms. Rose, and the juvenile judge. The overriding theme was \u201cWhat if Ms. S. suffers a relapse of her illness?\u201d The legitimate question, however, should have been: What is the likelihood of a relapse by Yvonne S. sufficiently severe that Yve S. likely would suffer abuse or neglect? The only properly admissible testimony on this issue came from the treating psychiatrist, who stated that as Ms. S. had been stable for over two years and her prognosis was good.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">The future is never certain for every child and for every family in these cases. The presence of a mental illness is not in and of itself a compelling reason for not pursuing reunification of a family unit, any more than would be the discovery that a parent had a terminal illness or was on the brink of financial ruin. An illustration of this concept, presented by Petitioner\u2019s counsel at oral argument, observed that the State would not be allowed to take a child away from a diabetic, who has managed successfully his or her ailment through self-administered insulin, on the mere fear that he or she might stop taking the insulin and fall into a diabetic coma at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>The evidence before the hearing judge regarding a reunification goal for the permanency plan was substantial. Ms. S. had remained stable and on her medications for over the last two years prior to the court\u2019s 28 March 2001 hearing and order. Her treating psychiatrist testified that her prognosis was good, and that she was capable of taking care of \u201cany child.\u201d She had secured housing and the financial means to support herself and Yve S. She completed successfully all of the requirements demanded by the Department. The juvenile judge noted that all of the allowed visitations had gone well, and that Ms. S. was \u201ca wonderful person, and for the most times that she\u2019s been in the courtroom, she\u2019s been very, very appropriate, very polite, respectful, uh, trying to answer questions that were given to her, trying to give information and has never, ever shown anything but complete love and concern for Yve.\u201d While Yvonne S. bore the burden of demonstrating no likelihood of future abuse or neglect, there is nothing in the record to suggest a likelihood of future abuse or neglect, nor is there any such finding by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">As was noted <em>supra, </em>on 20 December 2001, the hearing judge affirmed her permanency plan order at the conclusion of what appears to be a review hearing. The hearing judge did so despite testimony that the manic episode forecast eight months earlier by Ms. Rose had failed to materialize, that Yvonne S. was gainfully employed and making a higher income than she had been in February 2001, and that all of the allowed visitation between Yvonne S. and Yve S. had gone well.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Thus, in addition to reversing the 28 March 2001 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>order, we shall reverse similarly the 20 December 2001 order as an abuse of discretion on the part of the hearing judge, for the same reasons explained <em>supra </em>for reversing the 28 March 2001 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Petitioner raises the issue of whether the hearing judge\u2019s impartiality reasonably might be in question, given the record of the case. Petitioner cites as her primary evidence a statement made by the hearing judge to Yve S. during a recorded interview with the child in chambers. The statement of the hearing judge occurred during her 29 April 2002 interview with Yve S. as a part of the review of the permanency plan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-7\">THE COURT:.... But one thing I think you need to understand is that when we had that long hearing that stretched out for a long time, that is called a permanency planning hearing\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-8\">Yve S.: Uh-huh</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-9\">THE COURT: \u2014 we took a lot of evidence and we heard a lot of things and I took a lot of things under consideration and I decided after all of that, and also the whole history\u2014 Yve S.: Yeah</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-10\">THE COURT: \u2014 that it was better for you to stay with [the foster parents].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-11\">Yve S.: I know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-12\">THE COURT: And so it\u2019s not something I am going to change my mind about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-13\">Yve S.: I know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>THE COURT: You know? So I want you to understand that, I don\u2019t want you to think every time we have a review and every time we come to court that there is a possibility that you are going to live with your mom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-5\">Yve S.: I know that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-6\">THE COURT: You know that? Good. Because I don\u2019t want you to get upset and think things are going to happen real fast or anything like that because see, I got to think about you long term, because you are how old now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-7\">Yve S.: Now, I am 11 turning 12 in September.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-8\">THE COURT: I can\u2019t believe that. So I have a long time until you turn 18 and there are a lot of things that can happen between now and then. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Afr\">Petitioner argues that this exchange indicates that the hearing judge already had decided the outcome of the review hearing before receiving Petitioner\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">We shall not decide directly this issue. Because we reverse the juvenile court\u2019s orders for the reasons explained in this opinion, the only remaining relief Yvonne S. seeks is prospective recusal of the hearing judge for any proceedings held on remand. Because, as we discovered in the course of our deliberations, the hearing judge has retired and is not eligible to sit in the Circuit Court after 31 December 2002, she may not sit in any hearings held in Yve S.\u2019s case on remand. Accordingly, we need not consider the merits of Petitioner\u2019s recusal argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">The parties are in some disagreement as to the meaning and impact of the trial court\u2019s ruling and order at the conclusion of the 16 July 2002 review hearing. Respondent apparently is of the opinion that the order was merely a reaffirmation of the 28 March 2001 order, also reaffirmed by the court\u2019s order of 20 December 2001. Petitioner argues that there was a substantial change worked in the permanency plan by the 16 July 2002 order, namely, a change from \u201clong-term\u201d foster care to \u201cpermanent\u201d foster care.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>We understand why the parties disagree. It is not clear to us whether the juvenile judge intended by her 16 July 2002 order a substantive change in the goal of the permanency plan. In her oral ruling rendered at the conclusion of the 16 July 2002 hearing, the judge, in pertinent part, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-4\">If I determine she cannot safely go home, then I must determine from a list of plans in ranking which one is appropriate for her. I made that decision about a year [and] half ago when I had the original permanency planning hearing, and certainly nothing has changed to indicate that I would make any other decision than what I made then as far as what the appropriate place for her is because she cannot safely go home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-5\"><em>So I will reaffirm the plan of permanent foster </em>care.... (Emphasis added)<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">After explaining her reasoning, the judge summarized her ruling by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-7\">So basically, for all those reasons I am going to <em>reaffirm the permanency plan of long-term foster care </em>in a specific\u2014 with a specific caregiver. The law requires that I set another review in a year, which I will do, a review of permanency plan. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">Apparently, later on 16 July 2002, the judge signed a written \u201cOrder For Commitment of Juvenile\u201d intended to memorialize her oral ruling.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In that short document was included the following operative paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-9\">ORDERED, This 16th of [July] 2002, by the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Maryland, Sitting as a Juvenile Court, that the Respondent Child, Yve S. is committed to the Montgomery County Department of Health <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>and Human Services for <em>continued permanent foster care placement </em>.... (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">It is not entirely clear whether the statutory framework relevant to this case makes a clear distinction of substance between permanent versus long-term foster care. Section 3-823(e)(1) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-6\"><em>Determinations to be made at hearing. </em>\u2014 At a permanency planning hearing, the court shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-7\">(1) Determine the child\u2019s permanency plan, which may be:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-8\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-9\">(v) Continuation in a specified placement on a permanent basis because of the child\u2019s special needs or circumstances;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-10\">(vi) Continuation in placement for a specified period because of the child\u2019s special needs or circumstances;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-11\">Whether \u201clong-term\u201d is synonymous with \u201ca specified period\u201d as described in (vi) makes (or breaks) the question of whether it is different in substance from \u201cpermanent\u201d foster care within the meaning of sub-section (v). No help is to be found on this point in the general definitional section of the CINA statute (\u00a7 3-801).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-12\">Further muddying the water regarding this question is the fact that the judge, in her 16 July 2002 order, established for the first time a 12 month cycle of permanency plan reviews. Previous hearings had been held at roughly 6 month intervals. The significance, if any, of this distinction to this issue depends on Md.Code (1974, 2002 Repl.Vol.) Cts. <em>&amp; </em>Jud. Proc. Art., \u00a7 3 \u2014 823(h)(1), which reads, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-13\">(i) Except as provided in subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) of this paragraph, the court shall conduct a hearing to review the permanency plan at least every 6 months until commitment is rescinded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-14\">(ii) The court shall conduct a review hearing every 12 months after the court determines that the child shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>continued in out-of-home placement with a specific caregiver who agrees to care for the child on a permanent basis</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">There is nothing we could find, nor was anything relevant brought to our attention by the parties, that better illuminates the proposition that permanent foster care differs substantively from long-term foster care.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Because we are reversing the court\u2019s prior orders, upon which the 16 July 2002 order appears at least somewhat dependent, the juvenile court\u2019s possibly intended distinction between \u201cpermanent\u201d and \u201clong term,\u201d if one exists, may be explained and clarified by it in its next review proceeding, if that point retains any relevance. Accordingly, the 16 July 2002 order is reversed as well. The court may give a fresh consideration to the entire situation, including Yvonne S.\u2019s current mental health as it bears on a proper plan for Yve S.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">ORDERS IN #24 AND #50 REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY, SITTING AS THE JUVENILE COURT, FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; MONTGOMERY COUNTY TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b594-10\">.

For example, on one hand the Court's due process analysis, under <em>Mathews v.

This Court is unable to find any mention in the record of Yve S. discussing suicide prior to the hearing judge\u2019s 28 March 2001 ruling.

We are puzzled, therefore, as to how such a finding could be made when it was.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b637-12\">. In her 15 February 2001 testimony, which apparently everyone involved assumed would be Ms. S.'s last opportunity to address the court, she stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-13\">I want Yve back, Judge [ ], and she wants to be with me. I love my daughter, and I really, really believe that I can provide a loving, nurturing, safe home. And yes, I have used poor judgement in the past, and I did disappoint you, in North Carolina, but I do have better support systems now. I just wish I could restore your faith in me. I'm trying so hard, Judge [ ], and I'm honestly going to say this, that I believe, and I\u2019ve told the attorney this over and over again, that you\u2019ve been appointed by God to make the right decision, and the word says that I need to pray for you, and I always do, and Yve has complete faith in you, and so do I. And it\u2019s not our will be done, but God and the Lord's and the Judge. And that's the way that it is, because I can\u2019t see into her future, as the author and finisher of her faith of her life. And he\u2019s deemed you to make the right decision, and I believe in you. I\u2019m just asking for you to believe in me, and give me a chance to be her mother again.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-14\">These statements, under the circumstances, were neither excessive nor inappropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b641-16\">. In fact, stressors on Ms. S. are relevant to the stability of her illness and the likelihood of a relapse, which in turn is directly related to the issue of the likelihood of future neglect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b642-14\">. We have some concern, from this record, whether the Department's requirements of Petitioner were part of the problem, rather than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>solution. Because we are not finding [acts, it is not necessary to detail every instance where evidence of this conduct is brought to light, but the following excerpt from Dr. Harold\u2019s testimony, at a hearing subsequent to a reduction in visitation ordered by Ms. Rose, is revealing.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1Q\">Q: Have you talked to Ms. Rose about her concerns about Ms. S.?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHp\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-5\">Q: What have you told her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-6\">A: That I hear her, in terms of her being concerned about Ms. S.\u2019s, uh \u2014 lack of cooperation with her, her irritable mood around her. I said I haven\u2019t seen it with my meeting with her. From my interpretation of what\u2019s going on, it\u2019s their relationship that has been a problem. From my talk with Ms. S., with Ms. Rose, and looking at just the conditions around this whole hearing, this whole situation, Ms. S. as been aware for several months the County\u2019s opinion that she should not have full custody of her daughter. That, on top of successive, uh \u2014 cut backs on visitation, problems that she\u2019s had with trying to meet some of the demands that the County\u2019s put on Ms. S., what I'm seeing, that has been Ms. S\u2019s sources of antagonism.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-7\">She has to work with somebody on a weekly basis who really doesn\u2019t feel that she can do that job. And Ms. Rose has not hidden that fact from me, that that\u2019s how the County sees it, that she\u2019s not able to become a full-time mom. And they\u2019ve acknowledged that, that\u2019s their opinion. Uh, and I\u2019ve tried to report that to Ms. S., that this is what you\u2019re dealing with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-8\">In spite of that, you\u2019ve still got to work with the lady. You still have to work with the County. You still have to prove that you can do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-9\">I\u2019ve tried to express to Ms. Rose, Ms. S.\u2019s side of the argument in terms of, her I\u2019m asked to do all the things in terms of compliance, get a job, find housing, be responsible, make my visits, etcetera, etcetera, and in spite of each of those conditions being met, I still get penalized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">We also are mindful of the imbalance of resources sometimes inherent in such cases. As the Court of Special Appeals pointed out in <em>In re Jertrude O.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-11\">The State\u2019s ability to assemble its case almost inevitably dwarfs the parent's ability to mount a defense. No predetermined limits restrict the sums an agency may spend in prosecuting a given ... proceeding. The State\u2019s attorney usually will be expert on the issues contested and the procedures employed at the fact iinding hearing, and enjoys full access to all public records concerning the family. The State may call on experts in family relations, psychology, and medicine to bolster its case. Furthermore, the primary witnesses at the hearing will be the agency\u2019s own professional caseworkers whom the State has empowered both to investigate the family situation and to testify against the parents. Indeed, because the child is already in agency custody, the State even has the power to shape the historical events that form the basis for termination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-12\">56 Md.App. at 95, 466 A.2d at 891-92, quoting <em>Santosky v. Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 762-63, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 1399, 71 L.Ed.2d 599 (1982). Perhaps examples of how historical events can be shaped by social services exist in the case <em>sub judice </em>involving the circumstances surrounding Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>S.\u2019s employment and visitation conflicts. Another might be the following exchange between Petitioner\u2019s counsel and the social worker, Ms. Rose, which occurred at the 29 April 2002 hearing reviewing the permanency plan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-10\">Q: And for the last year, [Ms. S.] has completely complied with your service agreement with her, hasn\u2019t she?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-11\">A: No, because she disagrees with the plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-12\">Q: Other than disagreeing with the plan, she is completely cooperative in doing what she needs to do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-13\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b648-14\">. Ms. S. testified that they visited the hospital because her father had studied there as a medic and she wanted Yve S. to see something relevant to her heritage.. Why this visit seemed relevant to the social worker, or indicative of anything of concern to her, is a bit of a mystery to us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b650-6\">. Md.Code (1974,. 2002 Repl.Vol.), Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Art., \u00a7 9-120 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-7\">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a psychologist licensed under the \u201cMaryland Psychologists Act\u201d and qualified as an expert witness may testily on ultimate issues, including insanity, competency to stand trial, and matters within the scope of that psychologist\u2019s special knowledge, in any case in any court or in any administrative hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">As to the Maryland Psychologist\u2019s Act, see Md.Code (1974, 2000 Repl.

The Department, in the person of Ms. Rose, continued to refuse to return visitation to its prior frequency and duration. The Department's perspective regarding visitation is reflected in the following colloquy between Ms. Rose and Petitioner\u2019s Counsel, which occurred during the 20 December 2001 review hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-7\">Q: And is there a possibility that the Department might consider going back to the full weekend visits that the mother was having with Yve last year?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-8\">A: With the plan being, the permanent plan being long-term foster care, the Department would probably not recommend every' weekend. Yve needs to understand that the Court's decision was for her to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>raised by the [foster family]. At this point it appears that it might be too confusing for her if she\u2019s spending every weekend with her mother. It's something that has to be assessed as we go along.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUY\">Q: But aside from giving Yve the wrong impression, the Department wouldn\u2019t have any concerns about Yve\u2019s safety with her mother at this point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-16\">A: At this point, I don\u2019t have any concerns about her safety.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b659-10\">.
