Kessler, Assistant Bar Counsel, filed a petition<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for disciplinary action against Richard Seiden, respondent, for multiple violations of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct (MRPC). The petition alleged that respondent, based upon his representation of Penelope L. Mentlik, had violated MRPC 1.1,1.15(b) and 8.4(a) and (d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">On April 17, 2002, pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-709 <em>et seq., </em>this Court transmitted the matter to Judge Thomas J. Bolling<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>er, Sr. of the Circuit Court of Baltimore County to conduct a hearing and to make findings of fact and conclusions of law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">On June 13, 2002, an evidentiary hearing was held before the hearing judge. On November 14, 2002, Judge Bollinger issued his Memorandum Opinion and found by clear and convincing evidence that respondent violated MRPC 1.1, 1.15(b) and 8.4. The record was transferred from the hearing judge to our Court for oral argument. Pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-711(b)(2),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> respondent filed with this Court exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Respondent was admitted to the Bar of Maryland on November 16, 1978 and maintains his practice of law in his office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>located in Baltimore County. The Petition for Disciplinary Action in this case was based upon the complaint of Penelope L. Mentlik, BC Docket No. 2001-234-3-9. Her complaint was initially made by a letter dated December 27, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">Judge Bollinger\u2019s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law are, in part, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">\n<em>\u201cFINDINGS OF FACT</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-6\">\u201cThe Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that.... The complainant, Penelope L. Mentlik, was [the] Personal Representative of the Dorothy P. Dunkel estate. In August of 1998, Ms. Mentlik retained the services of the Respondent to represent the estate. During this representation the Respondent attended the settlement of real estate property which was part of the estate of Dorothy P. Dunkel. At the settlement, a check was tendered and made payable to \u2018Penelope L. Mentlik, Personal Representative of the Estate of Dorothy P. Dunkel.\u2019 The check was in the amount of $32,422.58. The Respondent deposited this check into his escrow account and signed Ms. Mentlik\u2019s name. <em>This Court can not find by clear and convincing evidence </em>that the Respondent signed Ms. Mentlik\u2019s name, endorsing the check, without her authority. I also find that the Respondent wrote a check from his own escrow account in the amount of $28,022.58 payable to \u2018Penelope L. Mentlik, Personal Representative of the Estate of Dorothy Dunkel.\u2019 He deducted a legal fee of $4400 from the estate funds without submitting a Fee Petition to the Orphans Court and <em>without </em>the Complainant\u2019s written consent to the fee. At the hearing on this matter the Respondent had not maintained the $4400 in his escrow account and still had not submitted a Fee Petition to the Orphans Court for approval to take that fee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">\u201cThe Court finds, in mitigation, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Respondent had a difficult client in the person of Ms. Mentlik and there was a dispute between them regarding almost every aspect of the legal representation. The Court further finds that the Respondent suffered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>ill health during the representation; however, the Court does not find these mitigating factors to excuse the taking of a fee without approval of the Orphans Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">\n<em>CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-5\">\u201cThe Court, upon review of the various exhibits, deposition testimony and testimony at the hearing, finds by clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent has indeed violated Rule 1.1 Competence; Rule 1.15(b) Safekeeping Property and Rule 8.4 Misconduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\">\u201cMr. Seiden had no lawful claim to the funds he took from Ms. Dunkel\u2019s estate and his taking of those funds for his personal use was theft and a criminal act reflecting adversely on his honesty, trustworthiness and fitness as an attorney. His taking of those funds was dishonest.\u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"AzIB\">A.

We recently reiterated the definition of clear and convincing evidence in <em>Harris, </em>366 Md. at 389, 784 A.2d at 523 (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Mooney, </em>359 Md. 56, 79, 753 A.2d 17, 29 (2000)), when we said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-5\">\u2018 \u201cThe requirement of \u2018clear and convincing\u2019 or \u2018satisfactory\u2019 evidence does not call for \u2018unanswerable\u2019 or \u2018conclusive\u2019 evidence. The quality of proof, to be clear and convincing, has also been said to be somewhere between the rule in ordinary civil cases and the requirement of criminal procedure \u2014 that is, it <em>must be more than a mere preponderance but not beyond a reasonable doubt. </em>It has also been said that the term \u2018clear and convincing\u2019 evidence means that the witnesses to a fact must be found to be credible, and that the facts to which they have testified are distinctly remembered and the details hereof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>narrated exactly and in due order, so as to enable the trier of the facts to come to a clear conviction, without hesitancy, of the truth of the precise facts in issue. Whether evidence is clear and convincing requires weighing, comparing, testing, and judging its worth when considered in connection with all the facts and circumstances in evidence.\u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-4\">359 Md. at 79, 753 A.2d at 29 (quoting <em>Berkey v.

After a review of the record, we affirm the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact and hold that they are not clearly erroneous and are based on clear and convincing evidence. <em>See Garfield, </em>369 Md. at 97, 797 A.2d at 763-64; <em>Dunietz, </em>368 Md. at 427-28, 795 A.2d at 711; <em>Monfried, </em>368 Md. at 388, 794 A.2d at 100. We adopt, however, only those portions of the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law that find the respondent in violation of MRPC 1.1, 1.15(b), 8.4(a) and 8.4(d). We shall sustain respondent\u2019s exception as to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that respondent\u2019s actions constituted theft and a criminal act. Petitioner filed no exceptions in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">B. Respondent\u2019s Exceptions</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Respondent makes two specific exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law. Respondent\u2019s exceptions, however, for all intents and purposes, can be merged into a single general exception to the last paragraph of the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law, discussed <em>infra. </em>Respondent\u2019s exceptions encompass the fact that the hearing judge found a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>general violation of the entire MRPC 8.4 when respondent was only charged with violations of MRPC 8.4(a) and (d). These exceptions, however, do not encompass an exception to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions that respondent violated MRPC 1.1, 1.15(b), 8.4(a) and 8.4(d). In fact, respondent, in his Exceptions and Response to Recommendation for Sanctions, specifically admits his violations of these rules when he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AB7V\">\u201cThe Petition [for Disciplinary Action] charged Respondent with violations of the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct: Rule 1.1 Competence, Rule 1.15(b) Safekeeping Property, and 8.4(a) and (d), misconduct. Respondent does not take exception to the conclusion of law that he violated these <em>charged </em>provisions because his admitted conduct would suffice to find violations of these provisions, notwithstanding Ms. Mentlik\u2019s permission. However, insofar as Judge Bollinger\u2019s Conclusion of Law encompassed all of Rule 8.4, including (b) and (c), provisions with which he was never charged, the Respondent takes exception. In addition to Petitioner\u2019s failure to charge these offenses, the same absence of a factual finding of intent, articulated fully above, would preclude Judge Bollinger\u2019s conclusion of law that Petitioner violated 8.4(b) and (c).\u201d [Alteration added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">Specifically, respondent excepts to the following language of the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law, especially the emphasized portion therein, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-5\">\u201cMr. Seiden had no lawful claim to the funds he took from Ms. Dunkel\u2019s estate and his taking of those funds for his personal use <em>was theft and a criminal act reflecting adversely on his honesty, trustworthiness and fitness as an attorney. His taking of those funds was dishonest.\u201d </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Respondent\u2019s exception has merit in that the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions, if the alleged violations had been charged, would mirror the exact language, as illustrated by the emphasis, of MRPC 8.4(b) and (c), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-7\">\u201cRule 8.4. Misconduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-4\">(b) commit a <em>criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\">(c) engage in conduct involving <em>dishonesty, </em>fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; ...\u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Acn\">However, respondent was not charged with such violations. Under <em>In re Ruffalo, </em>390 U.S. 544, 88 S.Ct. 1222, 20 L.Ed.2d 117 (1968), the United States Supreme Court held that an attorney was denied due process when the disciplinary charges against him were amended on the basis of his own testimony in his disciplinary proceeding. This Court has cited <em>Ruffalo </em>for the proposition that \u201cdue process considerations dictate that attorneys are entitled to notice of the charges against them when disciplinary proceedings begin.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Goldsborough, </em>330 Md. 342, 352, 624 A.2d 503, 508 (1993); <em>see also </em>Maryland Rule 16-709. In this State, this notice requirement is met by the filing of a Petition for Disciplinary Action in this Court. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Parsons, </em>310 Md. 132, 140, 527 A.2d 325, 329 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Monfried, </em>368 Md. 373, 378-79 n. 7, 794 A.2d 92, 95 n. 7 (2002), this Court recognized the appropriateness of a hearing judge\u2019s actions in limiting her Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law to the charges filed by Bar Counsel although she did \u201c \u2018not necessarily agree that the Commission ha[d] charged all of the Rules of Professional Conduct violated by the\u2019 \u201d lawyer in that case, (alteration added). Similarly in <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Wright, </em>306 Md. 93, 106, 507 A.2d 618, 624 (1986), this Court dismissed a petition against an attorney where the facts indicated a violation of prior Disciplinary Rule (DR) 9-102(B)(4), but where the lawyer was only charged with a violation of DR 2-106(A). We dismissed the petition, citing <em>Ruffalo, </em>because the petition did not charge the attorney for the violation that attorney\u2019s conduct actually violated, <em>i.e., </em>it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>merely alleged a violation of DR 2-106(A), charging an excessive fee, and not for a violation of DR 9 \u2014 102(B)(4). Regardless of whether respondent\u2019s conduct constituted theft or dishonesty, the Petition for Disciplinary Action in this case does not allege violations of MRPC 8.4(b) and (c). It does not charge respondent with theft or dishonesty. It instead charges violations of MRPC 1.1 Competence, 1.15(b) Safekeeping Property and 8.4(a) and (d) Misconduct. For the hearing judge to conclude that respondent\u2019s conduct constituted theft and dishonesty, using the exact language of two rules he was not charged with violating, was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">Respondent\u2019s exception, however, is additionally supported by the facts, which indicate that respondent\u2019s conduct did not reach the level of dishonesty included in the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law. The hearing judge specifically did <em>not </em>find that respondent \u201csigned Ms. Mentlik\u2019s name, endorsing the check, without her authority.\u201d Stated in the alternative, in the hearing judge\u2019s opinion the evidence equally supports the finding that respondent deposited the check into his escrow account at his client\u2019s direction. Thus, what could be established was that respondent took his fee, which Ms. Mentlik did not even contest as unreasonable, from an escrow account without following the correct procedures mandated in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">This Court, in <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Stancil, </em>296 Md. 325, 333, 463 A.2d 789, 792 (1983), relied on the fact that the attorney misconduct in that case had \u201cresulted from a difficult relationship with a single client that appear[ed] to be an isolated episode not likely to recur.\u201d (alterations added). The same could be said in the instant case. The hearing judge specifically found that Ms. Mentlik was a difficult client. Respondent points out several inconsistencies in Ms. Mentlik\u2019s testimony. These inconsistencies include: 1) Ms. Mentlik\u2019s changing explanation of whether she authorized respondent to attend the settlement and to sign for her; 2) Fountainhead Title\u2019s Vice-President Scheeler\u2019s testimony contradicting Ms. Mentlik\u2019s testimony that respondent was to send the check directly to Ms. Mentlik; 3) Ms. Mentlik\u2019s omission of her claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>that respondent did not have verbal authority to sign the check for her until her fifth correspondence with Bar Counsel; and, <em>inter alia, </em>4) Ms. Mentlik did not dispute the amount of the fee. Additionally, respondent had represented Ms. Mentlik for over two years dealing with two separate estates, one of which was time-consuming, and he testified that Ms. Mentlik had given him verbal permission to cash the check. Ms. Mentlik even sent respondent a facsimile acknowledging the amount of his fee, the same fee to which she later takes issue. Respondent was not even aware of a problem with Ms. Mentlik until he received notice of her grievance from the Attorney Grievance Commission in February 2002. This, in turn, caused confusion as to whether Ms.' Mentlik had terminated respondent. Respondent then hired outside counsel to assist him in attempting to complete the Fee Petition in Orphan\u2019s Court in an effort to complete the estate in line with Ms. Mentlik\u2019s wishes. According to respondent, \u201cMs. Mentlik thwarted all attempts by Respondent to file a fee petition.\u201d Additionally, respondent did not hide his actions from Ms. Mentlik, as evidenced by his sending her the settlement proceeds (minus his fee) along with a photocopy of the settlement check.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">In essence, respondent was presented with an extremely difficult situation, in which he likely knew that it would be nearly impossible to procure his fee. Instead of commencing the proper procedures, respondent took the \u201ceasy\u201d shortcut to obtaining his fee. This conduct, while violating the charged provisions of the MRPC, does not constitute a theft or the type of dishonest conduct for which we consistently issue severe sanctions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>We thus sustain respondent\u2019s exceptions to the extent that the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law were that respondent violated MRPC 8.4(b) and (c) and that respondent was dishonest by committing theft. These charges were not included within the Petition. Moreover, the uncharged alleged violations were not sufficiently supported by the findings of the hearing judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">III. Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">We now consider the appropriate sanction for respondent\u2019s misconduct. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the Attorney Grievance Commission, through Bar Counsel, argues that respondent be indefinitely suspended from the practice of law with the right to apply for reinstatement no sooner than three years. Respondent advocates that he should receive a public reprimand. In <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Gallagher, </em>we set out the purposes of the sanctioning process when we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-6\">\u201c \u2018This Court is mindful that the purpose of the sanctions is to protect the public, to deter other lawyers from engaging in violations of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, and to maintain the integrity of the legal profession. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Hess, </em>352 Md. 438, 453, 722 A.2d 905, 913 (1999) <em>(quoting Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Webster, </em>348 Md. 662, 678, 705 A.2d 1135, 1143 (1998)). We have stated that \u201c|t]he public is protected when sanctions are imposed that are commensurate with the nature and gravity of the violations and the intent with which they were committed.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number><em>Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Awuah, </em>346 Md. 420, 435, 697 A.2d 446, 454 (1997). Therefore, the appropriate sanction depends upon the facts and circumstances of each particular case, including consideration of any mitigating factors. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Atkinson, </em>357 Md. 646, 656, 745 A.2d 1086, 1092 (2000); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v.

Awuah, </em>346 Md. 420, 435, 697 A.2d 446, 454 (1997). <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Pennington, </em>355 Md. 61, 78, 733 A.2d 1029, 1037-38 (1999); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

The attorney\u2019s prior grievance history, <em>i.e., </em>whether there have been prior disciplinary proceedings, the nature of the misconduct involved in those proceedings and the nature of any sanctions imposed, as well as any facts in mitigation are similarly relevant, <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Franz, </em>355 Md. 752, 762-63, 736 A.2d 339, 343-44 (1999); <em>Maryland State Bar Association v. Phoebus, </em>276 Md. 353, 362, 347 A.2d 556, 561 (1975), as are the attorney\u2019s remorse for the misconduct, <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Wyatt, </em>323 Md. 36, 38, 591 A.2d 467, 468 (1991), and the likelihood of such conduct being repeated. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Freedman, </em>285 Md. 298, 300, 402 A.2d 75, 76 (1979). As to the repetition of violative conduct, we have held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>that an attorney\u2019s voluntary termination of the charged misconduct, when accompanied by an appreciation of the serious impropriety of that past conduct and remorse for it, may be evidence that the attorney will no longer engage in such misconduct. <em>Id., </em>at 300, 402 A.2d at 76. <em>See Franz, </em>355 Md. at 762-63, 736 A.2d at 344. <em>See also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Harris-Smith, </em>356 Md. 72, 90-91, 737 A.2d 567, 577 (1999)(acknowledging that the deterrence of other non-admitted attorneys from undertaking a federal practice from an office in Maryland was achieved when the firm dissolved after bar counsel\u2019s investigation commenced).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">In this case, we have upheld the hearing court\u2019s findings of fact, by clear and convincing evidence, and that judge\u2019s conclusions of law relating to respondent\u2019s violations of MRPC 1.1, 1.15(a), 8.4(a) and 8.4(d). In sustaining respondent\u2019s exception to the final portion of the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law, we hold that the evidence before the hearing judge does not support a finding that respondent had the requisite intent to constitute intentional misappropriation or theft, nor a finding that respondent was dishonest or deceitful. The facts indicate that respondent may have failed to follow proper procedures, but his conduct did not rise to that of an intentional misuse of his client\u2019s funds. The Review Board did not sanction charging respondent with violations of MRPC 8.4(b) or (c), which specifically forbid conduct involving criminal acts adversely reflecting on a lawyer\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness, as well as forbidding dishonest, fraudulent or deceitful conduct or misrepresentations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> And, under the principles stated in <em>Ruffalo </em>and <em>Parsons, </em>the facts in this case illustrate that the hearing judge did not have clear and convincing evidence that respondent was dishonest or that his conduct \u201cwas theft and a criminal act reflecting adversely on his honesty, trustworthiness and fitness as an attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">This Court has issued sanctions ranging from a public reprimand to a 90-day suspension where, as in this case, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>lawyer\u2019s violative conduct did not amount to an intentional misappropriation or dishonesty. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. McClain, </em>373 Md. 196, 212, 817 A.2d 218, 228 (2003)(imposing an indefinite suspension with the right to reapply in 30 days for violations of MRPC 1.15(a) and \u00a7 16-606 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article of the Maryland Code where the attorney corrected his violation, subsequently took a course in escrow account management and had no previous disciplinary proceedings); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Culver, </em>371 Md. 265, 283-84, 808 A.2d 1251, 1261-62 (2002)(issuing an indefinite suspension with the right to reapply in 30 days for violations of 1.5(c) and Maryland Rule 16-607(b)(2) where the facts indicated that the lawyer did not return monies, the contingency fee was not put into writing and the lawyer had previously been reprimanded); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. DiCicco, </em>369 Md. 662, 688, 802 A.2d 1014, 1028 (2002)(imposing an indefinite suspension with the right to reapply in 90 days for violations of MRPC 1.15(a), 1.15(c) and 8.4(a) where, despite of the attorney\u2019s negligent and sloppy administration of trust accounts, there was an absence of fraudulent intent, the attorney had no previous disciplinary problems in 38 years of practice and the attorney\u2019s clients did not suffer a financial loss); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Adams, </em>349 Md. 86, 98-99, 706 A.2d 1080, 1086 (1998)(imposing an indefinite suspension with the right to reapply in 30 days for violations of MRPC 1.15 and Maryland Rule 16-604 where the lawyer\u2019s conduct was a negligent, unintentional, misappropriation, and where the violation was the attorney\u2019s first, the client was a friend of the attorney, the attorney had good intentions and the monies were paid to the Comptroller); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Mclntire, </em>286 Md. 87, 96, 405 A.2d 273, 278 (1979)(issuing a public reprimand for violations stemming from a fee dispute between the lawyer and his client where there was not intentional wrongdoing, deceit or dishonesty).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Regardless of the fact that respondent has yet to file a Fee P\u00e9tition and has not kept the disputed fee in an escrow account, the record in the case <em>sub judice </em>is replete with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>mitigating evidence that provides for a lesser sanction than the three-year suspension sought by Bar Counsel. This is respondent\u2019s first disciplinary proceeding in over 24 years of practicing law. Respondent, as previously noted, was not charged with violations of MRPC 8.4(b) and (c), thus he did not intentionally misappropriate the monies of the complainant. He is remorseful for his conduct and has been cooperative throughout these proceedings. Respondent was also extremely ill from December of 2000 through mid-April of 2001, which, according to respondent, prevented him from filing a Fee Petition during that time. Respondent\u2019s conduct directly resulted from his representations of a particularly difficult client and will unlikely be repeated, as evidenced by his many years of practice without being charged in a disciplinary proceeding. Our weighing of the violations and the mitigating circumstances in the case <em>mb judice </em>results in the conclusion that respondent\u2019s conduct falls within the range of sanctions levied in the cases cited above.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">In light of these findings, we hold that an indefinite suspension from the practice of law with the right to reapply within 30 days will suffice as an appropriate sanction for respondent\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THIS COURT, INCLUDING THE COST OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION OF MARYLAND AGAINST RICHARD SEIDEN.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b447-10\">.
