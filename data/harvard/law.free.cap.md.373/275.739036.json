On March 21, 2002, the Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland (hereinafter \u201cBar Counsel\u201d), acting pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-709(a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a petition for disciplinary action against Blum charging him with violating the following Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct (hereinafter \u201cMRPC\u201d): MRPC 1.15(a)(Safekeeping property),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> MRPC 1.16(d)(Declining or Terminating Representation),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> MRPC 3.3(a)(1) and (4)(Can-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>dor Toward the Tribunal),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> MRPC 3.4(a) and (b)(Fairness to Opposing Party and Counsel),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> MRPC 8.1(a) and (b)(Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> MRPC 8.4(c) and (d)(Misconduct).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The petition also charged Blum with violating Maryland Rules 16-606 (Name and Designation of Account),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>16-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>607 (Commingling of Funds),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 16-609(Prohibited Transactions),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and Maryland Code, Sections 10-304 (Deposit of Trust Money)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and 10-306 (Misuse of Trust Money)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>Business Occupations and Professions Article (1989, 2000 Repl.Vol.). The charges involved Blum\u2019s representation of Zahra Dianat, Latania Hubbard, Chris Kourkoulakos, John Watson, Paul Leopold, Christine Bernstein, Corlis Lesley Sellers, Sharon Clinton, Cathy Walter, Jacqueline Boucher, Steven Bullock, Deborah Sidall, Lindsey Asay, Vasilios Pap-pas, and Charnese Fletcher-Grimes.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">On March 27, 2002, pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-709(b), we referred the petition to Judge Joseph A. Dugan, Jr., of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County to conduct an evidentiary hearing and make findings of fact and conclusions of law. We also ordered that the evidentiary hearing was to commence \u201cnot later than thirty (30) days from the filing of the response and that no extension shall be granted except by Order of this Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">On April 24, 2002, Blum filed his response, and on May 6, 2002, he filed a counterclaim in which he alleged malicious use of process and/or abuse of process. Bar Counsel responded by filing a motion to strike Blum\u2019s counterclaim, which was in fact, later granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">While conducting discovery, it became apparent that discovery problems were going to derail the hearing that was supposed to occur within the thirty day limit set in our March 27, 2002 Order. On May 9, 2002, as a result, Bar Counsel filed a motion for extension of time in which it was represented that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Blum, Bar Counsel, and the lower court had agreed that July 8, 2002 was an appropriate date to commence the proceedings because it would enable the parties to complete discovery. On May 15, 2002, we granted that motion. On May 24, 2002, however, Blum sought an additional extension in his motion to \u201ccontinue disciplinary hearing for appropriate time to obtain counsel and adequately prepare.\u201d This Court granted Blum\u2019s motion and set the hearing dates for September 4 and 5, 2002. In August of 2002, Blum sought, yet again, an extension of the hearing date in his supplemental motion to continue disciplinary proceeding. We denied that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">Also, as aforementioned, the discovery process was replete with problems. On June 6, 2002, Bar Counsel filed a motion for sanctions alleging Blum failed to respond to interrogatories and requests for documents and a motion for protective order claiming that Blum\u2019s notice of intention to take deposition and request for production of documents were oppressive, overly broad, and not calculated to lead to discoverable facts. On June 18, 2002, Judge Dugan conducted a hearing on these discovery motions, as well as on Bar Counsel\u2019s motion to strike Blum\u2019s counterclaim. During that hearing, the judge granted Bar Counsel\u2019s motion to strike Blum\u2019s counterclaim; Bar Counsel withdrew his motion for sanctions, and his motion for protective order was denied. On July 16, 2002, Bar Counsel filed his second motion for sanctions against Blum, again alleging that Blum had failed to respond to interrogatories. On August 16, 2002, less than three weeks before his disciplinary hearing, Blum filed a motion for sanctions claiming that the disciplinary action should be dismissed because Bar Counsel had willfully violated the rules of discovery. On that same day, Blum also filed a motion to recuse Judge Dugan, alleging that the judge\u2019s handling of the disciplinary matter had \u201cbeen with such ineptitude as to prevent him from fairly presiding over a Disciplinary Hearing.\u201d Both of Blum\u2019s motions were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Judge Dugan conducted evidentiary hearings on September 4 and 5, 2002. At the beginning of the September 4 hearing, Blum, during his opening argument, asserted that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>willing to admit to most of the allegations against him. Thus, Blum, pursuant to his suggestion and the agreement of Bar Counsel, took the stand and, in response to questions from Bar Counsel, admitted many of the allegations contained in the petition for disciplinary action not disposed of as mentioned in n. 13, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">After Blum\u2019s testimony, Bar Counsel presented testimony from six additional witnesses and introduced over forty evidentiary exhibits. Blum presented no documentary evidence and no testimony, other than his own, which was related to his assertion that he had not deposited any unearned fees into his personal or operating accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">On September 5, 2002, the judge continued the proceedings to Friday, September 6, 2002. Blum protested this extension and declared that he would not appear because he had a brief due in the Court of Special Appeals on that day and because his family celebrated Rosh Hashanah early, although that holiday did not begin until sundown on the 6th. When the Court of Special Appeals was contacted by the hearing judge to determine if an extension could be granted for the filing of Blum\u2019s brief, Judge Dugan learned that on August 28, 2002, Blum\u2019s case had been dismissed by the court for failure to file a brief upon an earlier deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">After Judge Dugan ordered the September 6, 2002 hearing to proceed, Blum did, in fact, fail to appear. At the conclusion of the proceeding, Judge Dugan, based on Blum\u2019s admissions and upon testimonial and. documentary evidence admitted during the evidentiary hearings, made oral findings of fact and conclusions of law, which were transcribed later for the record. We have summarized and reorganized those findings and conclusions below in order to better suit the needs of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">1. Zahra Dianat\u2019s Complaint and the Investigation Thereof</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">With respect to the complaint of Zahra Dianat, Judge Dugan found that on December 9, 1997, Ms. Dianat hired Blum to represent her in a December 10, 1997 protective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>order hearing. Blum charged her $500 for that representation, which she paid for by credit card. Because Blum did not have a credit card machine, he used a colleague\u2019s, Jeffrey T. Sheehan\u2019s. Blum charged to Ms. Dianat\u2019s credit card $1500: a $500 fee for the protective order hearing, and a $1000 retainer fee to represent her in a divorce. Blum did not provide Ms. Dianat with a receipt for the charge. Mr. Sheehan provided Blum -with a check for the amount that was charged on Ms. Dianat\u2019s credit card, minus a transaction fee, and Blum deposited that check into his personal checking account. Thereafter, Ms. Dianat contested the amount of the charge that was placed on her credit card, but the hearing judge did not find that she did not authorize the $1000 retainer charge for the divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">By letter dated January 9, 1998, which was mailed and faxed to Blum, Ms. Dianat terminated his representation and requested a refund of unused retainer funds. Blum did not respond to Ms. Dianat\u2019s letter. By letter dated April 6,1998, Blum acknowledged receipt of a complaint that Ms. Dianat filed with Bar Counsel and admitted that he owed her $720. He also represented that he was prepared to refund her that amount. Despite the representation, Blum did not return the money to Ms. Dianat. By letter dated November 25, 1998, Blum advised Ms. Dianat\u2019s new attorney, Floyd Willis, III, Esquire, that he had refunded the money to Ms. Diana, and attached a copy of check number 317 drawn on Blum\u2019s operating account at NationsBank. Blum altered the front of that check to appear as though it was made payable to Ms. Dianat when, in fact, it was made payable to a company named CMI for Blum\u2019s rent. Blum also included a copy of what he claimed was the back of Check 317 in order to show that the check had been negotiated. What he really included, however, was the copy of the back of a different negotiated check.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">In a July 1,1999 letter to Bar Counsel, Blum stated that the operating account upon which check 317 was written did not provide original negotiated checks. In addition, in a September 2, 1999 interview with Bar Counsel investigator John W. Rebum, Blum stated that he moved the unearned portion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Ms. Dianat\u2019s retainer fee from his escrow account to his operating account. Blum also told Mr. Rebum that he returned the money owed to Ms. Dianat by check number 317. All of these statements, the hearing judge found, were false. In addition, Blum consistently failed to provide information about check number 317 to Bar Counsel, despite repeated requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">On November 18, 1999, Bar Counsel served Blum with a subpoena requiring him to produce the check register for operating account No. 003-3389-6922 for the period of December 1, 1997 through December 30, 1999, as well as the original Check 317. On or about November 19, 1999, Blum filed a motion to quash the subpoena in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. In that motion, Blum falsely stated that he did not receive negotiated checks from the account upon which Check 317 was drawn when Check 317 was negotiated, but that because of Bar Counsel\u2019s request, he had specifically ordered Check 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">On January 24, 2000, in a hearing on Blum\u2019s motion to quash Bar Counsel\u2019s subpoena before the Honorable Martha G. Kavanaugh of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Blum falsely testified that when Check 317 was negotiated, he did not receive the original check, and that he did not begin receiving negotiated checks on his operating account until the end of 1998 or the beginning of 1999. Blum also falsely testified that the Bank told him it could not find the original Check 317, that Mr. Willis had requested the check, and that pursuant to that request, it had given the original to Mr. Willis. Thus the Bank, Blum prevaricated, was only able to provide him with a photocopy of Check 317, the photocopy that, in reality, he himself had manufactured and sent to Mr. Willis. In addition, Blum was found by the Circuit Court to have falsely testified during the January 24, 2000 hearing that by the time he deposited the check representing the charge to Ms. Dianat\u2019s credit card into his operating account, he had earned all of the funds.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In addition, Blum was found to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>falsely testified that the $720 owed Ms. Dianat was not an unearned fee. A further misrepresentation made during the January 24, 2000 hearing by Blum was that he did not know into which account he had deposited the check representing the charge placed on Ms. Dianat\u2019s credit card. Finally, at the end of the January 24, 2000 hearing, Judge Kavanaugh denied Blum\u2019s motion to quash and ordered that he produce the check register for Account No. 0039-3389-6922, titled \u201cLaw Offices, Bruce David Blum,\u201d his operating account for the period of December 1, 1997, through September 30, 1999, and the original cancelled check 317. Blum failed to produce those documents because, the hearing judge found, he had disposed of them \u201cat some point in time ... in the hopes that it would prevent [the] Court [and] the Attorney Grievance Com-mi[ssion]\u201d from obtaining them.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">Blum repeated these misrepresentations with respect to check 317 during an inquiry panel hearing. He also presented false evidence to the inquiry panel by producing notes from his client file concerning Ms. Dianat that he had altered.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Additionally, in a letter to Bar Counsel dated February 3, 2000, Blum would not advise into which account he had deposited the check representing the charge made on Ms. Dianat\u2019s credit card.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Finally, in a letter to Blum dated June 20, 2000, Bar Counsel requested retainer agreements, billing statements, and billable hour worksheets for approximately 30 clients. Rather than providing those documents, Blum stated in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>letter to Bar Counsel that he wanted an explanation for why they wanted the items. That letter, the hearing judge found, did not constitute a response to Bar Counsel\u2019s request and exemplified the \u201ctypical, evasive, and obstructive response that Mr. Blum continued to persevere in with Bar Counsel right up until the time and throughout the course of these proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Based upon these findings of fact with respect to Ms. Dianat, the hearing judge concluded that Blum violated MRPC 1.15(a)(Safekeeping Property), MRPC 3.3(a)(1) and (a) (4)(Candor Toward the Tribunal), MRPC 3.4(a) and (b) (Fairness to Opposing Party and Counsel), MRPC 8.1(a) and (b)(Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters), MRPC 8.4(c) and (d)(Misconduct), Maryland Rule 16-609(Prohibited Transactions), and Maryland Code, Section 10-306 (Misuse of Trust Money) of the Business Occupations and Professions Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">2. Latania Hubbard:<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">With respect to Ms. Hubbard, the hearing judge found that Blum deposited checks from her totaling $5000 into his personal and operating bank accounts, not into an attorney trust account, and that Blum had not earned those funds. Blum\u2019s testimony that he had performed between $11,000 and $12,000 worth of work for Ms. Hubbard at the time he received the funds, was found \u201cnot ... to be credible, along with most of what Mr. Blum testifies to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">In addition, the hearing judge found that the documentary evidence did not support Blum\u2019s claim. A January 12, 1998 letter of engagement between Ms. Hubbard and Blum indicated that an \u201cadvance fee\u201d of $5000 was due, that $4000 of that had been received, and that the remaining $1000 was due no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>later than January 31, 1998. The checks from Ms. Hubbard to Blum were dated January 18, 1998 and February 8, 1998, and a deposit slip indicated Blum deposited the former check into his operating account several days after receiving it. A statement of account,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> however, predated the letter of engagement. It purported to cover the period from \u201cJanuary 1, 1998 through April 20, 1999.\u201d Nevertheless, itemizations listed in that statement, according to the hearing judge, did not support Blum\u2019s testimony regarding the amount of work he had done for Ms. Hubbard prior to the January 12 letter of engagement. Thus, according to the hearing judge, the $5000 represented, as was characterized in the letter of engagement, an \u201cadvance fee.\u201d Blum had not yet earned all of the money when he deposited it into his operating and personal accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">Based on these findings of fact, the hearing judge concluded that Blum violated MRPC 1.15(a)(Safekeeping Property), Maryland Rule 16-609(Prohibited Transactions), and Maryland Code, Sections 10-304 (Deposit of Trust Money) and 10-306 (Misuse of Trust Money) of the Business Occupations and Professions Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">3. Corlus Leslie Sellers</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The hearing judge found that Blum was retained by Ms. Sellers on June 24, 1998, by virtue of a letter of engagement and a $2500 check representing the retainer fee called for in the letter, both dated June 24, 1998. On June 27, 1998, Blum deposited the $2500 check into his personal account at First National Bank of Maryland, but at that time, the hearing judge found, Blum had not earned all of the money although Blum had produced a statement of account running from June 21, 1998 to September 20, 1998, \u201cto show that ... the work had started prior to the letter of engagement.\u201d The statement of account, however, had \u201cno specific dates or times in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>terms of hours\u201d and did not support Blum\u2019s testimony regarding work he had done for Ms. Sellers prior to his depositing the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Based on these findings of fact, the hearing judge concluded that Blum violated MRPC 1.15(a)(Safekeeping Property), Maryland Rule 16-609(Prohibited Transactions), and Maryland Code, Sections 10-304 (Deposit of Trust Money) and 10-306 (Misuse of Trust Money) of the Business Occupations and Professions Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">4. Lindsey B. Asay</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">According to Judge Dugan\u2019s findings of fact, Blum accepted a check for $1500 on April 17, 1998 from Lindsey B Asay, and on April 22, 1998, he deposited that check into his personal checking account at First National Bank of Maryland. That check, as found by the hearing judge, had not yet been completely earned by Blum when he made the deposit into his personal account. A statement of account indicated a beginning date of March 21, 1998 and stated in part, \u201cReview domestic violence pleadings for initial client appointment 4/17,\u201d the same date that Blum received Mr. Asay\u2019s check. There was nothing in the statement of account or other documentary evidence, according to the hearing judge, to support Blum\u2019s testimony with respect to work he had done prior to depositing Mr. Asay\u2019s check. The funds represented by that check, therefore, were unearned when deposited into Blum\u2019s personal account on April 22, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Based on these findings of fact, the hearing judge concluded that Blum violated MRPC 1.15(a) (Safekeeping Property), Maryland Rule 16-609 (Prohibited Transactions), and Maryland Code, Sections 10-304 (Deposit of Trust Money) and 10-306 (Misuse of Trust Money) of the Business Occupations and Professions Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">5. Vasilious Pappas</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">The hearing judge found that on June 22, 1999, Blum deposited a $5000 check dated June 21, 1999 from Vasilious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Pappas into his personal account, but that Blum had not earned that check in full by the time he deposited it. Blum produced a statement of account with a beginning date of June 21, 1999, indicating that he had appeared at a protective order hearing, prepared a complaint for limited divorce, and attended a conference regarding strategy for custody and divorce. Blum testified, however, that he had done additional work constituting $5000 worth of services. The hearing judge found that Blum\u2019s testimony lacked credence and was not supported by the statement of account, with the result that Blum had not fully earned the $5000 check when he deposited it into his personal checking account.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">Based on these findings of fact, the hearing judge concluded that Blum violated MRPC 1.15(a)(Safekeeping Property), Maryland Rule 16-609(Prohibited Transactions), and Maryland Code, Sections 10-304 (Deposit of Trust Money) and 10-306 (Misuse of Trust Money) of the Business Occupations and Professions Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">6. Christine Bernstein</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">According to Judge Dugan\u2019s findings of fact, a February 24, 1998 letter of engagement executed by Ms. Bernstein and Blum indicated that Ms. Bernstein was advancing a fee of $1000 to Blum. Blum\u2019s statement of account running from February 21, 1998 through May 20, 1999, according to the hearing judge, did not indicate how much work was done prior to the February 24, 1998 letter of engagement and did not support Blum\u2019s testimony regarding the amount of the work which he purportedly had completed prior to receiving Ms. Bernstein\u2019s payment. The hearing judge found that Blum did not deposit the $1000 into his escrow account and that the funds were not earned when Blum received them.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Based on these findings of fact, the hearing judge concluded that Blum violated MRPC 1.15(a)(Safekeeping Property), Maryland Rule 16-609(Prohibited Transactions), and Maryland Code, Sections 10-304 (Deposit of Trust Money) and 10-306 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>(Misuse of Trust Money) of the Business Occupations and Professions Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">7. Cathy Walter</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Judge Dugan found that on or about July 9, 1998, Blum entered into a letter of engagement with Ms. Walter, and that on or about that same date, Blum accepted a $5000 payment from Ms. Walter that, as indicated in the letter of engagement, was a retainer fee. Those funds were not deposited into an escrow account, although it was unclear exactly where Ms. Walter\u2019s funds went. Blum did not earn, however, the $5000 before receiving it, according to the hearing judge. The hearing judge found Blum\u2019s testimony to the contrary to be incredible.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Based on these findings of fact, the hearing judge concluded that Blum violated MRPC 1.15(a) (Safekeeping Property), Maryland Rule 16-609 (Prohibited Transactions), and Maryland Code, Sections 10-304 (Deposit of Trust Money) and 10-306 (Misuse of Trust Money) of the Business Occupations and Professions Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">8. Attorney Trust Account</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">The hearing judge found that Blum \u201cwrote checks made payable to cash on his attorney trust account at Provident Bank,\u201d and that he had named his attorney trust account \u201cBruce David Blum Law Firm TOLTA.\u2019 \u201d Based on those findings, the hearing judge concluded that Blum violated Maryland Rules 16-606 (Name and Designation of Account) and 16-609 .(Prohibited Transactions).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">Bar Counsel presents no exceptions to Judge Dugan\u2019s findings and conclusions and, as a sanction for Blum\u2019s conduct, recommends disbarment. Blum argued before this Court that his admissions at the evidentiary hearing, which formed much of the bases for Judge Dugan\u2019s findings of fact, should be stricken because he was without counsel. Blum also excepts to the manner in which the disciplinary hearings were scheduled and to the hearing judge\u2019s denial of his motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>sanctions and motion for recusal. Based upon those exceptions, Blum urges us to remand the case for <em>de novo </em>proceedings. Because Blum\u2019s exceptions are without merit, and because his conduct clearly demonstrates that he is unfit to practice law in this State, we shall disbar him.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">This Court exercises \u201coriginal and complete jurisdiction for attorney disciplinary proceedings in Maryland,\u201d and conducts \u201can independent review of the record.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. McLaughlin, </em>372 Md. 467, 492, 813 A.2d 1145, 1160 (2002)(citing <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Garfield, </em>369 Md. 85, 97, 797 A.2d 757, 763 (2002) (citing <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Garland, </em>345 Md. 383, 392, 692 A.2d 465, 469 (1997))). In conducting that review, we accept the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact as <em>prima facie </em>correct unless shown to be \u201cclearly erroneous,\u201d and we give due regard to the hearing judge\u2019s opportunity to assess the credibility of witnesses. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">A. Blum\u2019s Exceptions</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">Blum claims that because the evidentiary hearings were \u201cunfair[ly] scheduled]\u201d in the Circuit Court, he was prevented from \u201cfully presenting his case\u201d and from retaining counsel. Consequently, he claims that his admissions should be stricken and that he is entitled to an entirely new hearing. In support of that claim, Blum presents no arguments other than those contained in his Supplemental Motion to Continue Disciplinary Hearing, which was previously filed in and denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>by this Court. Blum also claims that he did not receive a full and fair trial because the Circuit Court, after realizing that the proceedings would take longer than expected, continued them through September 6, 2002, despite Blum\u2019s claim that he could not appear on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">We have considered previously the arguments contained in Blum\u2019s Supplemental Motion to Continue Disciplinary Hearing and found them to be without merit. The disciplinary hearings in this case, pursuant to our March 27, 2002 Order remanding the matter to the hearing judge for findings of fact and conclusions of law, was to occur \u201cnot later than thirty (30) days from the filing of the response.\u201d Nonetheless, we already had continued the hearing twice before Blum\u2019s third motion for a continuance. In the first motion, which was filed by Bar Counsel, Blum agreed with Bar Counsel that, because of discovery difficulties, the hearing should occur on July 8, 2002. We granted that motion on May 22, 2002. Two days later, however, despite agreeing to the date of July 8, 2002, Blum filed a motion seeking to continue the proceedings further in order \u201cto obtain counsel and to adequately prepare.\u201d In a July 8, 2002 Order, we granted Blum\u2019s motion, setting the hearing date for September 4 and 5, 2002. Thus, we afforded Blum almost two more months to retain counsel and prepare for the hearings, even after he had already agreed that July 8, 2002 was an appropriate date. Moreover, Blum concedes that by July 8, 2002, he was aware of our Order. Thus, despite any prior communications he claims that he had with the Circuit Court or Judge Dugan\u2019s chambers with respect to the hearing dates, he knew, as of July 8, 2002, when the hearings were to occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Blum\u2019s claim with respect to the continuance of the hearing on September 6, 2002, is also wholly meritless. Blum represented to the hearing judge that he was unavailable on September 6, 2002 for two reasons: first, because his family celebrates Rosh Hashanah early, and second, because he had a brief due in the Court of Special Appeals on September 6, 2002. With respect to the brief, the Court of Special Appeals was contacted to determine if the due date could be extended, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>and Judge Dugan discovered that Blum\u2019s case in fact had been dismissed by the Court of Special Appeals in an August 28, 2002 order because a brief due on August 14, 2002 had not been timely filed. When confronted with this, Blum\u2019s response was that the Court of Special Appeals had miscalculated the due date and that he had not received notice of the dismissal. Judge Dugan, however, found that Blum was being \u201cless than candid with the Court.\u201d We have no difficulty in accepting Judge Dugan\u2019s finding, especially in light of Blum\u2019s continued lack of candor, which occurred when he appeared before this Court. In oral argument, Blum was asked whether he had told Judge Dugan that he could not appear on September 6 because he had a brief due in the Court of Special Appeals. Blum claimed that he had not said that, but had stated that he \u201cwould be filing a brief.\u201d Before Judge Dugan on September 5, 2002, however, Blum asserted on at least two separate occasions, \u201cI have a brief due by tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">Nor was he unavailable for the September 6, 2000 hearing because of Rosh Hashanah, for, as Judge Dugan pointed out, that holy day did not begin until sundown on September 6, 2002. Thus, Blum was not prevented from attending the September 6, 2002 hearing. On the contrary, he chose not to attend.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Blum\u2019s final two exceptions are based on Judge Dugan\u2019s denial of his motion for sanctions and his motion for recusal. They carry no more weight than the exceptions already discussed. On May 23, 2002, Blum served petitioner with a notice to take the deposition of Petitioner. In response, Bar Counsel filed a motion for protective order alleging that Blum\u2019s notice was oppressive, overly broad, and inappropriate because it would not lead to discoverable facts. During a hearing on Bar Counsel\u2019s motion, after negotiating other issues, Bar Counsel offered to make available for the deposition Mr. Rebum, the primary investigator in the matter, or Mr. Hirshman, Bar Counsel. Blum would not identify whom he would prefer for the deposition, and the Circuit Court advised petitioner that it need only produce Mr. Reburn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>When Bar Counsel produced Mr. Reburn'for the deposition, Blum inquired as to whether Mr. Reburn was produced pursuant to the notice of deposition and was there to testify on behalf of petitioner. Blum also claimed that Bar Counsel\u2019s response was that \u201cMr. Reburn, who was the investigator, was present to testify.\u201d Dissatisfied with Bar Counsel\u2019s answer, Blum filed a motion for sanctions, alleging that the disciplinary action against him should be dismissed for willful discovery violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">The Circuit Court denied Blum\u2019s motion, and was correct in doing so. We have said in the context of interpreting the discovery rules<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\">[t]he dismissal of a. claim ... is among the gravest of sanctions, and as such, is warranted only in cases of egregious misconduct such as \u2018willful or contemptuous\u2019 behavior, \u2018a deliberate attempt to hinder or prevent effective presentation of defenses or counterclaims,\u2019 or \u2018stalling in revealing one\u2019s own weak claim or defense.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-6\"><em>Manzano v. Southern Maryland Hosp., </em>347 Md. 17, 29, 698 A.2d 531, 537 (1997)(quoting <em>Rubin v. Gray, </em>35 Md.App. 399, 400-01, 370 A.2d 600, 601 (1977)) (citations omitted). There is absolutely no indication that Bar Counsel committed any discovery violations, willful or otherwise. Indeed, the Circuit Court found during the June 18, 2002 hearing \u201cthat Ms. Kessler [Assistant Bar Counsel who prosecuted this case] is not acting in bad faith [but] is doing everything she can to provide you with what you want.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Blum\u2019s final exception is based on his motion to recuse Judge Dugan. In that motion, Blum asserted that Judge Dugan, by his ruling on the discovery issue, \u201cshowed a predisposition and bias in favor of petitioner.\u201d Blum\u2019s argument has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>no merit. In ruling on the motion for recusal, Judge Dugan declared that he had \u201cno reason or basis\u201d to recuse himself. Contrary to what Blum asserts, the record in this case reflects behavior of the Circuit Court Judge that was both patient and fair. Respondent bears the \u201cheavy burden to overcome the presumption of impartiality and must prove that the judge has a personal bias and prejudice against him or her or has personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Shaw, </em>363 Md. 1, 11, 766 A.2d 1028, 1033 (2001). Blum has not demonstrated that Judge Dugan was biased or prejudiced against him, only that Judge Dugan did not rule in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">None of Blum\u2019s exceptions have merit and all, therefore, are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">B. Blum\u2019s Mishandling of Client Funds and Pattern of Deceit</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">1. MRPC 1.15 and 1.16, Maryland Rules 16-606 and 16-609, and Maryland Code, Sections 10-304 and 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">The hearing judge concluded that Blum\u2019s mishandling of funds with respect to Ms. Dianat, Ms. Hubbard, Ms. Bernstein, Ms. Sellers, Ms. Walter, Mr. Asay, and Mr. Pappas violated MRPC 1.15(a), Maryland Rule 16-609, and Maryland Code, Sections 10-304 and 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">With respect to Ms. Dianat, Ms. Hubbard, Ms. Bernstein, Ms. Sellers, Ms. Walter, Mr. Asay, and Mr. Pappas, Blum deposited funds from them into his personal or operating accounts, rather than into an attorney trust account. The hearing judge found that Blum had not yet earned these funds at the time he deposited them into his personal and operating accounts and that Blum did not use the funds for their intended and authorized purposes. Indeed, judging from the quantity of violations, it appears as though it was Blum\u2019s practice to take a client\u2019s money entrusted to him for future services and to then use that money as if it were his own, prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>to earning it. It also appeared to be his practice to maintain ambiguous and disorganized financial records. Blum\u2019s statements of accounts relating to the clients at issue, for instance, contained itemizations of activities, but consistently failed to provide dates or times spent on the itemizations, thus, perhaps not entirely without purpose, often rendering the time, nature and extent of his services unclear. The lack of clear documentation in this case adds further discredit to Blum\u2019s already incredible assertions that he would perform substantial amounts of services for clients without charging them, and then later bill those clients for less than what he purportedly was owed.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">A hearing judge\u2019s factual findings are <em>prima facie </em>correct unless shown to be clearly erroneous. <em>McLaughlin, </em>372 Md. at 493, 813 A.2d at 1160. Judge Dugan\u2019s findings, that the funds at issue were not earned when Blum deposited them into his personal and operating accounts, were not clearly erroneous. The funds were given to Blum in anticipation of future services, and as such, \u201cqualified as \u2018trust money* under Section 10-301 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 504, 813 A.2d at 1167. Section 10-301(d) defines \u201ctrust money\u201d as \u201ca deposit, payment or other money that a person entrusts to a lawyer to hold for the benefit of a client or a beneficial owner.\u201d According to Section 10-304 of the Business Professions and Occupations Article, an attorney, except in certain circumstances not relevant here, \u201cexpeditiously shall deposit trust money into an attorney trust account.\u201d Along the' same lines, Section 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article provides that \u201c[a] lawyer may not use trust money for any purpose other than the purpose for which the trust money is entrusted to the lawyer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Provisions of the MRPC and the Maryland Rules mirror these concepts. MRPC 1.15(a) provides in part that when a client entrusts a lawyer with the client\u2019s funds, the \u201c[f]unds shall be kept in a separate account maintained pursuant to Title 16, Chapter 600 of the Maryland Rules\u201d and that the lawyer must keep \u201ccomplete records of such account funds.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Maryland Rule 16-609 provides, in part, that an attorney may not use any funds \u201crequired by these Rules to be deposited in an attorney trust account ... for any unauthorized purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">Ms. Dianat, Ms. Hubbard, Ms. Bernstein, Ms. Sellers, Ms. Walter, Mr. Asay, and Mr. Pappas gave the funds at issue to Blum for the purpose of retaining his future services, not to pay for services that already had been rendered. Blum, however, deposited the funds into his personal and operating accounts as if he had already earned them. Consequently, he used those funds for a \u201cpurpose other than the purpose for which\u201d they were entrusted to him. Thus, we agree with the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions that with respect to the above listed clients, Blum violated MRPC 1.15(a), Maryland Rule 16-609, and Maryland Code, Sections 10-304 and 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">We also agree with the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that with respect to Ms. Dianat, Blum violated MRPC 1.16(d). The hearing judge found that Ms. Dianat mailed and faxed a letter to Blum in which she terminated his representation and requested a refund of unused retainer funds. Blum did not respond to Ms. Dianat\u2019s request for a refund, which prompted her to file a complaint with Bar Counsel. Upon receiving notice of that complaint, Blum acknowledged that he owed Ms. Dianat $720 and that he would pay her those funds. Blum, however, did not refund the money, and then misrepresented to Ms. Dianat\u2019s counsel, Bar Counsel, and the Court, that he had. Thus, upon Ms. Dianat\u2019s termination of Blum\u2019s representation, Blum did not \u201ctake steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client\u2019s interests, such as ... refunding any advance payment of fee that has not been earned.\u201d MRPC 1.16(d); <em>see also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n. v. Milliken, </em>348 Md. 486, 517, 704 A.2d 1225, 1240 (1998) (stating that under Md. Rule 1.16(d), an attorney is \u201cobligated to return any unearned portion\u201d of an \u201cadvance fee payment\u201d) On the contrary, the only person\u2019s interests Blum was concerned with protecting were his own, and in doing so, he was willing to lie and deceive time and again.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>Finally, the hearing judge was correct when he concluded that Blum violated Maryland Rules 16-606 and 16-609 when he named his attorney trust account \u201cBruce David Blum Law Firm TOLTA.\u2019 \u201d, and wrote checks made payable to cash on his attorney trust account. Maryland Rule 16-606 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-4\">An attorney or law firm shall maintain each attorney trust account with a title that includes the name of the attorney or law firm and that clearly designates the account as \u2018Attorney Trust Account\u2019, \u2018Attorney Escrow Account\u2019, or \u2018Clients\u2019 Funds Account\u2019 on all checks and deposit slips. The title shall distinguish the account from any other fiduciary account that the attorney or law firm may maintain and from any personal or business account of the attorney or law firm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Blum failed to title his attorney trust account in compliance with this rule. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Bernstein, </em>368 Md. 208, 221-22, 768 A.2d 607, 614 (2001)(concluding that an attorney trust account entitled \u201cMaryland Legal Services, Jack A. Bernstein, Esquire, IOLTA\u201d violated \u201cthe Maryland Rules regarding Attorney Trust Accounts\u201d). In addition, Blum wrote checks to cash from his attorney trust account in violation of Maryland Rule 16-609, which provides in part that \u201c[a]n instrument drawn on an attorney trust account may not be drawn payable to cash or to bearer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">2. MRPC 3.3,3.4, 8.1 and 8.4</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">The hearing judge concluded that Blum\u2019s myriad misrepresentations to Ms. Dianat\u2019s counsel, Bar Counsel, the inquiry panel, and the court, regarding Blum\u2019s admitted forgery of Check 317, violated MRPC 3.3(a)(1) and (a)(4), 3.4(a) and (b), 8.1(a) and (b) and 8.4(c) and (d). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">Blum misrepresented to Ms. Dianat\u2019s new attorney that he had refunded Ms. Dianat\u2019s money to her. He then altered Check 317 and manufactured a photocopy purporting to be the back of that check in order to create the illusion that he had paid Ms. Dianat with a check that had been negotiated. By this conduct, the hearing judge found that Blum violated MRPC 3.4(a) and (b) and MRPC 8.4(c) and (d). We agree. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>Blum had received Ms. Dianat\u2019s complaint to Bar Counsel and knew that her attorney was attempting to collect her money when he altered the check and concocted the deceptive photocopy. Consequently, Blum \u201cunlawfully obstruct[ed] another party\u2019s access to evidence, ... unlawfully alter[ed] ... a document ... having potential evidentiary value, [and] falsified] evidence.\u201d MRPC 3.4(a) and (b). His alteration of the check and his misrepresentations to Ms. Dianat\u2019s attorney were also fraught with \u201cdishonesty, fraud, [and] deceit,\u201d MRPC 8.4(c), and were \u201cprejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d MRPC 8.4(d). <em>See also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Koven, </em>361 Md. 337, 342-343, 761 A.2d 881, 883-884 (2000) (concluding that an attorney \u201cviolated Rule 8.4(c) and (d)\u201d when he \u201cintentionally altered Department of Labor letters and alien certification receipts, [] created letters and faxes to mislead [a company] and its employees, and [] submitted a false billing statement\u201d); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. White, </em>354 Md. 346, 350-54, 731 A.2d 447, 450-52 (1999)(concluding that destroying evidence and giving false testimony in federal district court violate MRPC 3.4(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">Blum\u2019s disingenuous and obstructive conduct continued as Bar Counsel attempted to investigate Ms. Dianat\u2019s complaint. In response to Bar Counsel\u2019s inquiry, Blum falsely claimed that the bank account upon which Check 317 was drawn did not provide negotiated checks when Check 317 was negotiated and that he would contact the bank for the check. In addition, Blum lied to Bar Counsel investigator John Re-burn about the movement of Ms. Dianat\u2019s money between his accounts and failed to respond to repeated requests for financial records related to Ms. Dianat\u2019s complaint. This conduct, the hearing judge correctly determined, violated MRPC 8.1(a)(\u201c[A] lawyer in connection with ... a disciplinary matter, shall not ... knowingly make a false statement of material fact.\u201d) and MRPC 8.4(c) (\u201cIt is professional misconduct for a lawyer to ... engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.\u201d); <em>see also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Angst, </em>369 Md. 404, 410, 800 A.2d 747, 751 (2002)(concluding that misrepresentations to Bar Counsel and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>Bar Counsel investigator constituted violations of MRPC 8.1(a) and 8.4(c))</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Blum\u2019s motion to quash a Bar Counsel subpoena and his conduct at the hearing on that motion also violated several Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct. Judge Dugan concluded, and we agree, that during the hearing before the Honorable Martha G. Kavanaugh of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Blum violated MRPC 3.3(a)(1) and (a)(4), and MRPC 8.4(c) and (d), when he knowingly made repeated and blatant \u201cfalse statements of material fact\u201d to Judge Kavanaugh and offered evidence he knew to be false. Blum repeated, this time under oath, his previous lies with respect Check 317 and the account upon which it was drawn. In addition, he falsely claimed, among other things, that the bank told him it could not find the original Check 317, that Mr. Willis (Ms. Dianat\u2019s counsel), had requested that check, and that according to its records, it provided the check to Mr. Willis. <em>See White, </em>354 Md. at 363-64, 731 A.2d at 457 (1999)(concluding that attorney\u2019s false testimony under oath during a deposition violated MRPC 3.3(a)(1) and (a)(4) and 8.4(c) and (d)). When Blum made similar misrepresentations to the inquiry panel, the hearing judge correctly concluded that the same rules were violated, in addition to MRPC 8.1(a)(\u201c[A] lawyer in connection with ... a disciplinary matter, shall not ... knowingly make a false statement of material fact.\u201d) and MRPC 3.4(a) and (b) (prohibiting a lawyer from \u201cunlawfully obstructing] another party\u2019s access to evidence^] ... unlawfully altering] ... a document ... having potential evidentiary value[,] [and] falsifying evidence\u201d). Finally, the hearing judge correctly concluded that as Bar Counsel continued to request information from Blum, and as he continued to fail to provide that information, he violated MRPC 8.1(b)(\u201c[A] lawyer in connection with ... a disciplinary matter, shall not ... knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for information from [a] ... disciplinary authority....\u201d) <em>See also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Bar Council recommends that the appropriate sanction in this case is disbarment. We agree. Recently, in <em>McLaughlin, </em>we recognized that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQp\">the purpose of the sanctions is to protect the public, to deter other lawyers from engaging in violations of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, and to maintain the integrity of the legal profession. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v.

We have stated that \u201c[t]he public is protected when sanctions are imposed that are commensurate with the nature and gravity of the violations and the intent with which they were committed.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Awuah, </em>346 Md. 420, 435, 697 A.2d 446, 454 (1997). Therefore, the appropriate sanction depends upon the facts and circumstances of each particular case, including consideration of any mitigating factors. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Atkinson, </em>357 Md. 646, 656, 745 A.2d 1086, 1092 (2000); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v.

Blum also took funds that clients had given to him in anticipation of future services and deposited such funds into his personal and operating accounts for his own benefit, before he had earned those funds. Behavior such as this, in and of itself, \u201cin the absence of mitigating circumstances, ordinarily warrants disbarment.\u201d <em>Milliken, </em>348 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>at 520, 704 A.2d at 1241-42 (concluding that \u201cnumerous trust account violations\u201d and \u201cconversion of client monies in failing to return unearned fees,\u201d among other things, mandated disbarment); <em>Powell, </em>369 Md. at 475, 800 A.2d at 789-90 (recognizing that \u201c[i]t has long been the position of this Court that disbarment is the appropriate sanction for intentional dishonest conduct\u201d and stating that in cases involving \u201cintentional dishonesty, fraud, misappropriation and the like, we will not accept as compelling extenuating circumstances \u2018anything less than the most serious and utterly debilitating mental or physical health conditions ...\u2019\u201d) (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

In fact, rather than any mitigating factors, the egregiousness of Blum\u2019s conduct was compounded and aggravated by his persistent lies, deceit, and obstructionist behavior during the course of the disciplinary process. Judge Dugan found that \u201cMr. Blum, in the course of these proceedings, would say anything or do anything to try and prevent Bar Counsel from investigating and finding out the violation[s] he [has committed] and the fraud that he has perpetrated upon the Court and his client.\u201d Indeed, Blum was willing to make multiple, blatant misrepresentations to Ms. Dianat\u2019s counsel, Bar Counsel, and the inquiry panel in an attempt to obfuscate the truth and save his own skin. In addition, he ignored several, legitimate requests by Bar Counsel for financial documents pertinent to the disciplinary hearing, he altered and destroyed evidence, and on numerous occasions, he lied under oath to Judge Kavanagh. Such conduct is intolerable.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Honesty is of paramount importance in the practice of law.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>Unlike matters relating to competency, diligence, and the like, intentional dishonest conduct is closely entwined with the most important matters of basic character to such a degree as to make intentional dishonest conduct by a lawyer almost beyond excuse.
