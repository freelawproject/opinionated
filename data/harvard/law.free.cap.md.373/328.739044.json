Procedural history</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Based on the stipulations and agreed exhibits, the undersigned finds the following facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-6\">1. Roberson was admitted to practice law in Maryland by the Court of Appeals on December 30, 1976. He was appointed as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Georgia on January 3, 1978 and was admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>to the State Bar of Georgia on November 7, 1979.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Roberson subsequently entered private practice in Georgia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-4\">2. Prior to the present proceedings, Roberson never has been subject to any disciplinary proceedings in either Maryland or Georgia. He was decertified on April 13, 1999, by Maryland, however, for nonpayment of his annual Clients\u2019 Security Trust Fund assessment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">3. The State Bar of Georgia initiated an investigation of Roberson on February 21, 1997, and filed its Formal Complaint (\u201cthe complaint\u201d) against Roberson on December 31, 1997, alleging nine (9) serious violations of the standards set by Georgia\u2019s Bar Rules, seeking appropriate discipline and reimbursement of fees. Joint Exhibit B, pp. 6 through 33. All alleged violations related directly or indirectly to representation of the late Julia Mae Shiggs<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and her husband, initially in a medical malpractice claim between April 1995 and October 1996.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">4. The Supreme Court of Georgia (\u201cthe Court\u201d), in the interim between the investigation\u2019s initiation and the complaint\u2019s filing, by administrative Order of June 13, 1997 and effective July 1, 1997, changed the standard of proof for attorneys\u2019 disciplinary cases from \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d to \u201cclear and convincing evidence.\u201d Amended Georgia Bar Rule 4-221(e)(2); joint exhibit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\">5. On June 13, 1997, the Court also amended the Georgia Bar Rules, establishing the system of special master\u2019s trials, followed by a Review Panel; then, \u201c[ajlleged errors in the trial may be reviewed by the [Georgia] Supreme Court when the findings and recommendation of the Review Panel are filed with the Court.\u201d Amended Georgia Bar Rule 4-213(a); joint exhibit 5. The latter amendment, removing the right to a jury trial, also superseded state legislation which had provided jury trials for disbarment actions. [Official Code of Georgia Annotated], sec. 15-19-32; see joint exhibits 4 and 4A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>6. The Supreme Court of Georgia, as provided by these amended rules, appointed a Special Master to take testimony as to this matter on November 24, 1998. The Special Master held a hearing in the matter between April 19 and 22, 1999. Joint exhibits 6A through 6D.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-8\">7. The Special Master filed his 54-page report of facts and recommendations for discipline on March 27, 2000. This included the determination that the newly-adopted standard of proof as to \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d should be applied, rather than the earlier standard of \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Joint exhibit B, pp. 484-587. The Special Master found that Roberson committed all nine (9) alleged ethical violations, recommending disbarment, a public reprimand and restitution of attorney\u2019s fees received.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-9\">8. The Report of the Review Panel, relying on the Special Master\u2019s Report, was filed July 17, 2000. Joint exhibit B, pp. 726-729. With one exception,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Review Panel approved all findings and recommendations of the Special Master.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-10\">9. The Supreme Court of Georgia, in its April 5, 2001, per curiam opinion, also approved the findings that Roberson had committed all nine (9) alleged violations by \u201cclear and convincing evidence,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> ruling that disbarment was the appropriate sanction and requiring \u201cfull restitution\u201d before any petition for reinstatement. Joint exhibit C.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-11\">10. The specific facts of the representation, as found by the Special Master and approved by the Georgia Supreme Court, are not disputed by</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>Roberson in these Maryland disciplinary proceedings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">B. <em>Facts of representation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">In August 1994, Julia Mae Shiggs (\u201cShiggs\u201d), a 34 year old woman, was admitted to Savannah\u2019s Memorial Medical Center (\u201cthe hospital\u201d) to give birth to her fourth child. Ms. Shiggs experienced complications during a Caesarian section and slipped into a coma from which she never awoke.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> SMR2 [Special Master\u2019s Report].</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Shortly thereafter, Michael Mydell (\u201cMydell\u201d), Ms. Shiggs\u2019 common-law husband, contacted Roberson to file a medical malpractice suit on behalf of Ms. Shiggs and a loss of consortium claim for himself. Special Master Report (\u201cSMR\u201d) 2-3.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> An Authority to Represent agreement (the \u201cfee agreement\u201d) was executed on September 28, 1994, in which Mydell retained the services of Roberson for a 40% contingent fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">Roberson, in November 1995, with the permission of Mydell, hired John Thomas Woodall (\u201cWoodall\u201d), another experienced trial attorney to assist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>with the litigation. However, Roberson and Woodall did not execute a written agreement as to attorney\u2019s fees. Instead, they had a \u201cgentleman\u2019s agreement\u201d according to Roberson and shook hands. SMR 5. Woodall, it was understood, would have no personal contact with Roberson\u2019s clients and would receive instructions only from Roberson.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">Roberson and Woodall filed suit on April 14, 1995 and alleged counts for medical malpractice and loss of consortium. SMR 5. However, in September 1995, Roberson informed Mydell that the case expenses were escalating and he needed to contribute $10,000 to the costs of prosecuting the claims. SMR 6. Mydell and Roberson then agreed to amend their Fee Agreement when Mydell could not pay the $10,000. SMR 6. The new contract between Mydell and Roberson on September 1, 1995, required that Roberson receive 50% of the proceeds of any recovery in the case. SMR 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">On the eve of trial after learning that Mydell had impregnated another women while his wife was still in a coma, Roberson decided that the loss of consortium claim could adversely impact Ms. Shiggs\u2019 medical malpractice claim. Mydell subsequently agreed to dismiss his loss of consortium claim after discussing this matter with Roberson. SMR 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The trial began on January 16, 1996, and ended after six (6) days with a settlement agreement on January 22, 1996. The settlement agreement consisted of a collective cash payment of $3, 325,000 to be paid by defendants within 72 hours to Roberson for Ms. Shiggs\u2019 benefit. Importantly, the settlement agreement involved the participation of trial judge Gregory Fowler: Roberson agreed that \u201ccourt approval of any valuation [of services provided in addition to the monetary payments] would be necessary.\u201d SMR10 <em>&amp; </em>12; emphasis in original.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Also, as part of the settlement agreement, the defendants insisted that Mydell\u2019s and all Ms. Shiggs\u2019 four children\u2019s inchoate wrongful death claims be released. SMR 14. Despite Mydell\u2019s stated misgivings and refusal to participate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Roberson agreed and arranged the releases of the children\u2019s claims, obtaining the local Probate Court\u2019s approval for this in July 1996. SMR 14-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Further supplementing the monetary aspects of the settlement agreement, the hospital agreed to provide certain future medical services to Ms. Shiggs. SMR 12. This would include all aspects of Ms. Shiggs\u2019 care, including certain daily respiratory therapy <em>&amp; </em>treatment. A value of these future services was required, in part, for the purpose of determining attorneys\u2019 fees. SMR 12. The value of future services \u2014 of respiratory treatment only \u2014 had been calculated for trial by Dr. Bart to be $1,091,909, based on the present value of seven year\u2019s worth of respiratory expenses. SMR 13.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This information was provided on January 23,1996, by Woodall<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to Roberson.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Roberson, nevertheless, valued the future medical services in his submission to the trial court at $1,425,000, using this figure in the Settlement Statement which he presented to Mydell and filed with the Court. SMR 13-14.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Later in August 1996, when Roberson was asked for his documentation of the $1,425,000 figure, Roberson: a) told Woodall that he (Roberson) \u201chad lost the papers\u201d with the $1,425,000 figure; b) contended that $1,425,000, not $1,091,909, was the figure that Woodall supplied and c) suggested to the trial judge that the pages may have been switched without his consent.. SMR 13, 30 and 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">To the contrary, Woodall testified, as to the August conversation with Roberson,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-7\">This is the first time in my life I had heard of $1,425,000. I knew that I had only faxed him on January whatever it was in 1996,1 had only faxed him a figure for respiratory therapy that was $1,091,000, and I did not know what the difference was either.\u201d SMR 30.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">Woodall got the impression from talking with Roberson that Roberson received the increased figure directly from Dr. Bart; however, when Woodall</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>asked her, Dr. Bart informed Woodall that she had no other calculations and had done none for Roberson directly. SMR 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Knowing that the larger figure was necessary to justify the amount of attorney\u2019s fees already distributed from the settlement proceeds, Woodall<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> on behalf of himself and Roberson asked Dr. Bart to sign an affidavit which made up the approximately $300,000 difference between the future medical care figures by assuming the need for additional hospital stays, if she was \u201ccomfortable\u201d with this. SMR 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">The Special Master also considered testimony as to the source of the $1,425,000 calculation from Karen Alston, a paralegal formally employed by Roberson. However, he rejected Ms. Alston\u2019s testimony as inconsistent and containing too many \u201cmemory gaps.\u201d For example, Alston testified both 1) that Roberson was her source of the $1,425,000 figure, which he wrote for her on a scrap of paper and 2) that Woodall was her source of the figure, which he \u201chad to tell her how to write.\u201d SMR 13-14, note 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">Roberson complains that the Special Master found it \u201cmore likely\u201d that the increase between the $1,091,909 future medical bill and the $1,425,000 was added on by Roberson, arguing that this phrase indicates the Master applied a mere \u201cpreponderance\u201d standard of proof rather than the more stringent and legally required \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard. SMR 13. However, the undersigned finds that the \u201cmore likely\u201d reference has been taken out of context and misconstrued. In context, the undersigned finds that Special Master infelicitously used this phrase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>simply to indicate that he gave no credibility to Roberson\u2019s alternate explanations of how the $300,000 discrepancy arose. Upon summarizing the entirety of the evidence on this point, it is plain that the Special Master found clear and convincing evidence that Roberson had violated professional standards by \u201cmaintaining dishonest, fraudulent, and deceitful records of the settlement ... which contained willful misrepresentations.\u201d SMR 38-42. Notably, the Georgia Review Panel approved the Special Master\u2019s report, excepting and disagreeing that the evidence on this point was simply \u201cmore likely\u201d; instead, the Review Panel found \u201cthe evidence is clear and convincing that Respondent Roberson increased the amount of future medical services from $1,091,000 to $1,425,000 in order to enlarge the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees claimed.... \u201d Joint Exhibit B, p. 727. The Georgia Supreme Court in its per curiam opinion, affirmed the Review Board\u2019s \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence finding and made no reference to the Special Master\u2019s \u201cmore likely\u201d language. Joint Exhibit C.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">C. <em>Disbursements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">During the settlement discussions, Roberson decided to establish a \u201cspecial needs trust\u201d where a portion of the settlement funds could be set aside free of Medicare or Medicaid liens. As a result, Roberson returned a $600,000 check received from the defendant doctor to his attorney, Greg Hodges, and had it replaced with two checks: (1) a $400,000 check for the special needs trust; and (2) a $200,000 check for the trust belonging to Ms. Shiggs\u2019 children.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">Roberson had Hodges retain the checks until the trusts were set up and could be funded, but Roberson never had the trusts funded and they remained in Hodges\u2019 drawer until a new guardian was appointed. SMR 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">After the settlement was completed, Roberson paid Woodall $1,100,000 on January 26, 1996, which was paid from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>settlement funds held in trust prior to court approval of the settlement. SMR 18-19. This payment was made, despite Roberson\u2019s prior oral agreement with Woodall on a \u201cflat fee\u201d of $1,000,000 for Woodall\u2019s services, irrespective of the amount recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">On February 26, 1996, Roberson issued a check from his trust account to Mydell in the amount of $151,359.33. Tr. 135-37.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Roberson also did not seek court approval prior to making this disbursement to Mydell. SMR 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Further, Roberson made a payment from his trust account on February 16, 1996, in the amount of $30,000 to Mydefl\u2019s sister Ms. Loretta Barnes (\u201cBarnes\u201d) for the estimated value of her care of Ms. Shiggs\u2019 four children. This payment also was made before the probate court approved the disbursement. SMR 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">In addition, Roberson wrote four checks to himself from his trust account totaling $600,000 between January 31,1996 and February 18, 1996. SMR 21.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Roberson also wrote four additional checks totaling $633,112 as payment for the purchase of a church.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Again, all these checks written by Roberson to himself were made without court approval. SMR 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">Based [on] his aforementioned increase in the figure for future medical fees, Roberson increased the amount of contingent attorney\u2019s fee claimed from one-half of the cash settlement of $3,325,000 \u2014 i.e., $1,662,500 \u2014 to one-half the larger settlement $4,750,000 \u2014 i.e., over $2,000,000 total.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">Eventually, Roberson and Woodall were sued by the administrator of Ms. Shiggs\u2019 estate for legal malpractice and other claims related to the settlement agreement. Woodall settled the claim against him obtaining a full release for payment of $350,000. Roberson, after the disbarment order of the Georgia Supreme Court, settled the estate\u2019s claim against him with payment of $449,385.26. Stipulated Facts and Exhibits, esp. exhibit 19 dismissal, dated April 19, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>II. <em>Conclusions of Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">The undersigned finds that the Georgia- disciplinary proceedings have satisfied the requirements of Maryland Rule ' 16 773, which provides that \u201ca final adjudication in a disciplinary ... proceeding by another court ... that an attorney has been guilty of professional misconduct ... is conclusive evidence of that misconduct in any [Maryland] proceeding ... [unless the other court\u2019s adjudication] was so lacking in notice or the opportunity to be heard as to constitute a deprivation of due process ... [or] there was such an infirmity of proof establishing the misconduct as to give rise to a clear conviction that the Court ... cannot accept as final the determination of misconduct. Maryland Rule 16-773(e)(l), (e)(2), and (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">A. <em>Due Process issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">Roberson\u2019s two complaints as to his due process rights relate to the denial of: 1) his motion for application of the superseded, stricter standard of proof; and 2) his belated<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> demand for a jury trial, also superseded by the amended Georgia Bar Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">Initially, the undersigned notes that Maryland Rule 16-773 does <em>not </em>reference the full gamut of due process issues, but rather limits challenges of out-of-state proceedings to \u201cnotice\u201d and \u201copportunity to be heard.\u201d There has been no contention that Roberson lacked notice. And, the undersigned finds that he clearly had the opportunity to be heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>at three court levels: the Special Master\u2019s hearing, the Review Board proceeding and the appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">In effect, Roberson asserts that a \u201cdue process\u201d opportunity to be heard requires a jury trial for attorney disciplinary proceedings. To the contrary, Maryland\u2019s Court of Appeals has agreed with the Georgia Supreme Court decision herein that, while attorney disciplinary matters require basic due process protections, such rights are not coextensive with the rights of criminal defendants: neither findings \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d nor jury trial are required See, as to jury trials, <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Kerpelman, </em>288 Md. 341, 420 A.2d 940 (1980), cert. den. 450 U.S. 970,101 S.Ct. 1492, 67 L.Ed.2d 621 (1981); see, as to comparison with criminal proceedings, <em>Maryland State Bar Association v. Sugar-man, </em>273 Md. 306, at 315, 329 A.2d 1(1974), cert. den. 420 U.S. 974, 95 S.Ct. 1397, 43 L.Ed.2d 654 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">Roberson also suggests that the Georgia Supreme Court erred by changing the procedural rights to which he was entitled by legislation and prior rule after the alleged misconduct but before the filing of court action against him. The inherent authority of Georgia\u2019s Supreme Court to regulate the practice of law and the disciplinary proceedings as to lawyers has been found properly to supersede the efforts of the state legislature in this area. As with other constitutional challenges to the courts\u2019 authority to regulate attorneys, the U.S. Supreme Court has declined to intervene in such matters. <em>Wallace v. Wallace, 225 </em>Ga. 102, 166 S.E.2d 718, cert. den. 396 U.S. 939, 90 S.Ct. 369, 24 L.Ed.2d 240 (1969). This construction of the courts\u2019 disciplinary authority is identical to the Maryland Court of Appeal\u2019s interpretation of its own authority.

Phrased in the positive, the Special Master found clear and convincing evidence on various points as to unprofessional conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or wilful misrepresentation as to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-16\">a) representing to client Mydell that the [actual] value of future medical services for Ms. Shiggs was $1,425,000 [despite absence of any documentation or specific evidence of this];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-17\">b) representing to the Chatham County Probate and State courts that the value of future medical services was $1,425,000 [despite absence of any documentation or specific evidence of this];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>c) providing false and misleading assumptions to [economist] Dr. Bart [for use in an affidavit as to estimated future medical expenses]; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-4\">d) paying [Mydell and his sister] money belonging to Ms. Shiggs [while not properly disclosing the basis for such payments for the courts\u2019 approval]. SMR 20-21, 38-42.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Count II-conflict of Interest \u2014 (Georgia Bar Standard 30)</p>\n<p id=\"AGCH\">Related to the inflation of future medical bills, the Special Master found that Roberson failed to disclose a conflict of interest when he did not tell his client that this valuation question might result in an increase of counsel fees in Roberson\u2019s interest and to the detriment of the client. SMR 43^4.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Count III-clearly excessive fee \u2014 (Georgia Bar Standard 31.a.)</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">The initial contingent fee was increased from 40% to 50% of all amounts recovered. With the inclusion of future medical services\u2019 valuation, which were not yet provided, the attorneys\u2019 fee share of actual cash again was boosted to 72%. SMR 44-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">The Georgia Supreme Court found that this percent was excessive and Maryland similarly has held this level of contingency fee generally is excessive. The Court of Appeals has stated that \u201cit is generally a violation of the rule for the attorney\u2019s stake in the result to exceed the client\u2019s stake.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Korotki, </em>318 Md. 646, 649, 569 A.2d 1224, 1226 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">Count IV-contingent fee shared improperly with another lawyer-(Georgia Bar Standard 31.d.)</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">The Georgia standard, like the Maryland rule, as to disclosure of contingent fee arrangements with other counsel, required a written statement to be provided to the client of all details. This was not done. SMR 45-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">Count V-multiple employment impairing professional judgment-(Georgia Bar Standard 36)</p>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">Roberson provided multiple representation in this case by concurrent representation of: Ms. Shiggs, her common law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>husband Mydell-both individually and as Ms. Shiggs\u2019 guardian, as well as Ms. Shiggs\u2019 children, although there was no written agreement as to representation or attorney\u2019s fees as to the children. SMR 46-49; Stipulation, pp. 529-531.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">It is clear that Roberson\u2019s professional judgment was impaired in this multiple representation context in that: 1) he paid Mydell and his sister a portion of these settlement funds without prior court authorization, and 2) he failed to complete arrangements agreed upon to deposit a portion of settlement funds into trust for benefit of the children. <em>Id. </em>The lack of court authorization of payments to Mydell and his sister is significant in that there was no showing required that the amounts of these-payments were proportional to any actual services rendered, rather than being an arbitrary amount which would serve to dissuade these witnesses from raising questions about any other settlement issue. SMR 41, 49 and 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Count VI-wilfully disregarding a legal matter entrusted by client \u2014 (Georgia Bar Standard 44)</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">During settlement discussions with defendants\u2019 counsel, Roberson decided to ask that a \u201cspecial needs\u201d trust be established for benefit of Ms. Shiggs\u2019 children to avoid Medicare or Medicaid liens. For this reason, Roberson returned a $600,000 settlement check received from the defendant doctor to his attorney, Greg Hodges, and had it replaced with two checks: 1) a $400,000 check for the special needs trust; and 2) a $200,000 check for the trust belonging to Ms. Shiggs\u2019 children.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Roberson had Hodges retain the checks until the trusts were set up and could be funded (Tr. 424-25), but Roberson never had the trusts funded and they remained in Hodges\u2019 drawer until a new guardian was appointed. SMR 16. This clearly constituted abandonment of a matter for which Roberson has assumed responsibility. SMR 48-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>Count VII-failure to promptly notify and deliver to the client funds received for her \u2014 (Georgia Bar Standard 61)</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Roberson clearly violated this standard by: 1) failure to deposit the $600,000 funds left in the hands of the defendant doctor\u2019s attorney, 2) improper payment of the client\u2019s settlement funds to Mydell and his sister, and 3) the excessive counsel fees taken by Roberson himself and his co-counsel Woodall. SMR 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Count VIII-failure to maintain complete record of client\u2019s funds \u2014 (Georgia Bar Standard 63)</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Roberson, beyond the original Settlement Statement, kept no records of funds\u2019 receipt and disbursement other than bank statements and cancelled checks. As found by the Special Master, \u201cit is impossible to tell [from these bank records] how much money Roberson received on [the client\u2019s] behalf and where it all went.\u201d SMR 51. The settlement statement falsely reflected that Roberson received the $600,000 on behalf of the children, as he actually returned these funds, and that Roberson paid an attorney $15,000 to set up the children\u2019s trust, as he never actually made this payment. SMR 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Count IX-not accounting for all trust funds \u2014 (Georgia Bar Standard 65.a.)</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">Roberson provided no accounting to Ms. Shiggs or her guardian for the settlement funds which he, as her attorney, held in trust. \u2022 SMR 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">III. <em>Mitigation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">Initially, the undersigned notes that little attention was paid to mitigation in the Georgia proceedings herein. Both the Special Master and the Georgia Supreme Court refer to \u201cnon mitigating factors\u201d based upon \u201cthe facts found.\u201d The \u201cfacts found\u201d all relate to the specifics as to the occurrence of the disciplinary infractions. SMR 53; Joint Exhibit C, p. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">Maryland has a somewhat broader view of mitigation, which may include an attorney\u2019s lack of prior record and his community involvement. E.g., <em>Attorney Grievance Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number><em>mission v. Bereano, </em>357 Md. 321, 744 A.2d 35 (2000). Maryland Rule 16-757(b) permits an attorney in a disciplinary proceeding to provide proof of mitigating facts by a preponderance of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Here, the undersigned finds the following mitigating evidence: Roberson is an attorney who practiced for nearly 25 years without a prior report of professional misconduct. This career has included public service as a federal prosecutor, as a volunteer attorney in Georgia\u2019s Pro Bono Project, and as a Continuing Legal Education faculty member. He has received honors and recognition from the NAACP, Savannah State College (now Savannah State University), the Savannah Legal Secretaries\u2019 Association, and other organizations. He has donated little league football uniforms and offered $35,000 initial funding for a scholarship endowment. Joint Exhibit A.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Of particular significance to this case, Roberson now has completed a settlement as to restitution claims of his late client\u2019s estate with a payment of $449, 385.26 and the estate has released its claims against him. <em>Id., </em>exhibits 17-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Kimberly Copeland, Esq., appeared at the Maryland hearing, testifying that she is a member of the Georgia bar and is president-elect of the Georgia Alliance of African American Attorneys. In addition to praising Roberson for his good character and his reputation as \u201can outstanding attorney,\u201d Ms. Copeland reported statistics as to a disparity of Georgia attorney disciplinary proceedings against African-American attorneys. She related that, of approximately 28,000 attorneys admitted to practice in the state, only about 1,500 or 5% are African-Americans. Despite this, she reported that 30% of those disbarred are African-Americans \u2014 that is, six times the rate for other attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">Finally, the undersigned notes that Respondent offered scant indication of remorse at the Maryland hearing and that there is no evidence of this in the Georgia record.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">Having reviewed this evidence, the undersigned shares questions about the disproportionate disciplinary statistics of our sister state. Yet, Roberson\u2019s high level of profession<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>al success suggests that he has no need of affirmative action; the substantial quality of the evidence supporting the disciplinary action, only peremptorily disputed, makes racial discrimination unlikely. Despite the extensive mitigation, the undersigned concludes that the broad array of professional misconduct in this serious matter calls for substantial disciplinary action such as disbarment or suspension and recommends this.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Judge Caroom, then, determined that the Respondent violated MPPC 8.4(a) and (c) (Misconduct), MRPC 1.7(a),(b) and (c) (Conflict of Interest), MRPC 1.5(a) (Clearly Excessive Fees), MRPC 1.5(i) (Contingent Fee), and MRPC 1.15 (Safekeeping Property) based upon his finding that the Georgia disciplinary proceeding and the adjudication of guilt of misconduct satisfied the requirements of Maryland Rule 16-773 and were \u201cconclusive evidence\u201d of the misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Bar Counsel took no exceptions to Judge Caroom\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. On December 26, 2002, Respondent filed belated exceptions in this Court, iterating complaints which he had previously registered with the hearing court and, additionally, professing his remorse. Those earlier complaints involved the standard of proof applied in the Georgia proceeding, Roberson\u2019s rejected demand for a jury trial in the Georgia proceeding, and the procedural rules that were adopted by the Georgia Supreme Court after the misconduct occurred but before the action was filed. Maryland Rule 16-773(g), by its terms, limits challenges to the original adjudication in reciprocal discipline cases to \u201cnotice and opportunity to be heard\u201d or \u201cinfirmity of proof.\u201d This Court, even prior to the adoption of this Rule, has recognized that Respondent is not allowed to collaterally attack either the findings of fact or the judgment rendered by the original jurisdiction. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Sabghir, </em>350 Md. 67, 81, 710 A.2d 926, 932-33 (1998). Further, Respondent\u2019s remorse, although a factor that may be considered in fashioning a sanction, <em>see Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Dunietz, </em>368 Md. 419, 430, 795 A.2d 706, 712 (2002), also does not come <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>within an exception to the mandate of reciprocal discipline when properly proven. Respondent\u2019s exceptions are, therefore, overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">Turning to the appropriate sanction, Bar Counsel has recommended that Respondent be disbarred from the practice of law as he was in the State of Georgia. Respondent has requested that we consider a twelve-month suspension, with reinstatement conditioned upon one or all of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">A. Successfully completing a course in Legal Ethics [Course to be approved by the Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland or this Court];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">B. If the Respondent re-enters the practice of law, appoint a monitor of all trust account activity for the period of one (1) year from the date the Respondent re-enters the practice of law [The monitor to be appointed by this Court or the Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland]; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-7\">C. If the Respondent re-enters the practice of law, require him to perform a set number of hours annually for two (2) years in <em>pro bono </em>representation; such <em>pro bono </em>clients to be assigned by Maryland Legal Aid or other entity engaged in indigent representation in the State of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">This Court very recently reinforced its attitude toward imposition of sanction in a reciprocal discipline case in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Ruffin, </em>369 Md. 238, 253-254, 798 A.2d 1139,1148 (2002):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-9\">We are prone, <em>see Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Sabghir, </em>350 Md. 67, 83, 710 A.2d 926, 934 (1998); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Richardson, </em>350 Md. 354, 365-66, 712 A.2d 525, 530-31 (1998), but not required, <em>see Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Gittens, </em>346 Md. 316, 324, 697 A.2d 83, 87 (1997), to impose the same sanction as that imposed by the state in which the misconduct occurred. Indeed, the Court is duty-bound to assess for itself the propriety of the sanction imposed by the other jurisdiction and that recommended by the Commission, <em>Gittens, </em>346 Md. at 326, 697 A.2d at 88, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>look not only to the sanction imposed by the other jurisdiction, but to the particular facts and circumstances of each case, the outcome being dependent upon the latter, but with a view toward consistent dispositions for similar misconduct. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Willcher, </em>340 Md. 217, 222, 665 A.2d 1059, 1061 (1995) (quoting <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Parsons, </em>310 Md. 132, 142, 527 A.2d 325, 330 (1987)); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Saul, </em>337 Md. 258, 267-68, 653 A.2d 430, 434-35 (1995). We ordinarily will defer to the sanctioning State when the two States\u2019 purpose in disciplining counsel is the same. <em>Id. </em>at 327, 697 A.2d at 88 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">The State of Georgia, similar to Maryland, views the protection of the public as one of the purposes of attorney discipline. This view is evident in <em>In re Calhoun, </em>268 Ga. 675, 677, 492 S.E.2d 514, 515 (1997), where the Supreme Court of Georgia disbarred an attorney \u201cin order to protect the public from improprieties that injure the public\u2019s trust in the attorney-client relationship.\u201d <em>See also In re Allison, </em>267 Ga. 638, 642, 481 S.E.2d 211, 215 (1997) (recognizing that \u201cthe primary purpose of disciplinary proceedings ... is to protect the public from attorneys who are not qualified to practice law due to incompetence or unprofessional conduct\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">As a result, deferral to the discipline imposed in Georgia is appropriate. As we have noted, Respondent has not demonstrated by \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d that his defenses are within the exceptional circumstances of Rule 16-773(e), nor do the mitigating circumstances found by the hearing judge provide sufficient bases for a lesser sanction than was entered in Georgia. In <em>Sabghir, </em>we stated: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>350 Md. at 83-84, 710 A.2d at 934 (quoting <em>Willcher, </em>340 Md. at 222, 665 A.2d at 1061 (quoting <em>Parsons, </em>310 Md. at 142, 527 A.2d at 330)). Respondent, although without disciplinary blemish in Georgia or Maryland prior to these proceedings, was found guilty of some of the most egregious misconduct, involving dishonesty, impairment of professional judgment, charging a clearly excessive fee, wilful disregard of a legal matter, and theft of client funds, among others. In similar situations, we have disbarred other attorneys who have committed such misconduct. <em>See, e.g., Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. McLaughlin, </em>372 Md. 467, 509-10, 813 A.2d 1145, 1170-71 (2002) (disbarring an attorney for professional misconduct, including theft of client funds, charging clearly excessive fees, and self-dealing); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Spery, </em>371 Md. 560, 568-72, 810 A.2d 487, 491-94 (2002) (disbarring attorney for theft from his real estate partners despite the attorney\u2019s previously unblemished twenty-eight year practice); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.
