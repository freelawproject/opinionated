In the course of the organizing campaign, appellants engaged in picketing and related collective action as instructed by the union in an effort to get Omni House to recognize the union as their collective bargaining representative. In response to the picketing, Omni House suspended and then terminated the employment of appellants because they had not given Omni House ten-days notice of their intentions to picket. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(g), appears to require a ten-day notice prior to picketing of a health care institution by a union.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On July 25, 2001, appellants filed suit against the union in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City for negligent misrepresentation under State law because the union had assured appellants that their activities were lawful and not subject to adverse action by their employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">On August 21, 2001, the union filed a \u201cnotice of removal\u201d of the case to the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. On December 18, 2001, the union then filed a Motion to Dismiss the federal case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, claiming that the issue presented was preempted by federal law mandating that cases such as the case <em>sub judice </em>initially be presented to the National Labor Relations Board (hereafter \u201cNLRB\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">On January 3, 2002, the federal district court neither granted nor denied the union\u2019s Motion to Dismiss and remanded the case to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City for it to decide whether the National Labor Relations Act (hereafter \u201cNLRA\u201d) preempts appellants\u2019 claims and places exclusive subject matter jurisdiction for their claims with the NLRB.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">On May 29, 2002, Judge Kaye A. Allison of the Circuit Court issued an Order granting the union\u2019s Motion to Dismiss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>and stated that the court must defer to the NLRB because it has jurisdiction over the matter. On June 5, 2002, appellants filed a Notice of Appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. On November 8, 2002, we, on our own initiative, granted a writ of certiorari to undertake review of this issue before the intermediate appellate court acted. <em>Law, et. at. v. Operating Engineers Local No. 37, </em>371 Md. 613, 810 A.2d 961 (2002). Appellants presented one question for review in their brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-4\">\u201cWas the Circuit Court in error for dismissing the Appellants\u2019 Case ruling that a State tort fell under the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board and was thus preempted?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">We answer no to appellants\u2019 question and affirm the decision of the Circuit Court. We hold that appellants\u2019 claims are preempted by the NLRA because any State court decision to adjudicate the tort suit for negligent misrepresentation would, under the circumstances in the case at bar, result in adjudication of underlying labor issues relating to unfair labor practices falling within the NLRB\u2019s primary jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Appellants sued the union after being terminated by their employer, Omni House. In the spring of 2001, the union solicited appellants to unionize by explaining the benefits of unionization and collective bargaining. In late May of 2001, the union\u2019s representatives met with appellants to discuss the possibility of having the union act as their collective bargaining representative. At least seven of the eight appellants signed union cards, as well as two other employees who are not parties to this suit, authorizing the union to act as their exclusive bargaining representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">On June 12, 2001, at a meeting between appellants and the union, the union explained to appellants that they should not be concerned about being fired for their union membership as they were \u201cwithin their legal rights.\u201d Then, upon the advice of the union representatives, appellants notified the CEO of Omni House that they had organized and were members of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>union and requested that Omni House recognize the union as their bargaining agent. The union alleges that, at this time, appellants had not yet become members of the union, even though they might have thought the opposite when appellants told Omni House they had joined a union.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">On June 14, 2001, the union notified Omni House that appellants were assisting in its organizing efforts. This letter advised Omni House that appellants, the bargaining unit, were covered by section 7 of the NLRA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On June 15, 2001, the union advised Omni House that a majority of the employees in the bargaining unit had designated the union as their exclusive bargaining representative. The letter also requested recognition by Omni House of the union as the exclusive bargaining representative of the employees at the Third Avenue Omni House location in Anne Arundel County.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">On June 19, 2001, appellants engaged in a recognitional strike and picketed Omni House in an attempt to have it recognize the union as appellants\u2019 exclusive bargaining representative and because the CEO of Omni House refused to speak with and/or meet with the union organizers.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Subsequent to the picketing, the union advised appellants that the CEO had refused to accept the union\u2019s letter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>representation and that appellants should return to work the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">When appellants returned to work the next day, June 20th, they were, individually, called into the executive office of Omni House and advised that they were suspended because of their strike activities. Appellants, on June 21, 2001, again went out on the street and began picketing. Representatives of the union were present and approved the resumption of the picketing.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">At approximately noon on June 21st, appellants were notified by the union\u2019s attorney that the picketing and striking activities were improper because, under the law, they were required to have given ten-days notice prior to picketing because of Omni House\u2019s status as a health care institution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As a result, the union advised appellants to write a letter informing the CEO that all of appellants were going to return to work the next day, Friday, June 22, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">On June 22, 2001, the union advised appellants that the decision to strike was an error on their part and apologized for their suspension. Also on this day, the CEO of Omni House issued a letter to appellants notifying each of them that their employment at Omni House was being terminated for failure to give the required ten-days notice of picketing activity as required by the NLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">Appellants then filed a tort suit for negligent misrepresentation against the union in the Circuit Court. The union sought removal of the case to the federal district court and later filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>a Motion to Dismiss the case in the federal court. On January 3, 2002, the District Court Judge Andre M. Davis, <em>sua sponte, </em>neither granted nor denied the union\u2019s Motion to Dismiss and instead remanded the case back to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County for lack of federal court jurisdiction, holding that it was for that State court to decide whether the NLRA preempts appellants\u2019 claim and places subject matter jurisdiction over the claim with the NLRB.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">On remand to the Circuit Court, the Circuit Court Judge granted the union\u2019s Motion to Dismiss, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">\u201cThis case comes before this court on a Motion to Dismiss, filed by the [union]. The [union] argues that this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because resolution of [appellants\u2019] negligent misrepresentation claim involves issues that implicate \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 8 of the [NLRA], codified at 29 USC \u00a7\u00a7 157, 158. \u2018When an activity is arguably subject to \u00a7\u00a7 7 and \u00a7\u00a7 8 of- the [NLRA], the States as well as the federal courts must defer to the exclusive competence of the [NLRB].\u2019 <em>San Diego Bldg. Trades Council v. Garmon, </em>359 U.S. 236, 245 [79 S.Ct. 773, 3 L.Ed.2d 775] (1959). This court agrees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-8\">\u201cThis court finds that an adjudication of [appellants\u2019] claims would require this court to interpret and apply the notice requirement, as set forth in \u00a7 8(g) of the [NLRA], as well as other portions of the [NLRA], as raised by the [union]. As this case involves activities which are subject to \u00a7\u00a7 7 or \u00a7\u00a7 8 of the [NLRA], this court must defer to the [NLRB]. <em>Garmon, </em>359 U.S. at 245[, 79 S.Ct. 773]. Therefore, it is this 29th day of May, 2002, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City <em>ORDERED, </em>that the [union\u2019s] Motion to Dismiss is hereby <em>GRANTED.\u201d </em>[Alterations added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Avd\">A. THE SUPREMACY CLAUSE</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">The Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, art. VI, cl. 2,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> requires that when compliance with both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>federal and state law is a physical impossibility, the \u201cstate law is Void to the extent it conflicts with a federal statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sanders v. State, 57 </em>Md.App. 156, 167, 469 A.2d 476, 482, <em>cert, denied, </em>299 Md. 656, 474 A.2d 1345 (1984) (quoting <em>Maryland v. Louisiana, </em>451 U.S. 725, 747, 101 S.Ct. 2114, 2129, 68 L.Ed.2d 576, 596 (1981)). <em>See also Hillsborough County, Florida v. Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc., </em>471 U.S. 707, 713, 105 S.Ct. 2371, 2375, 85 L.Ed.2d 714, 721 (1985); <em>Harrison v. Schwartz, </em>319 Md. 360, 364, 572 A.2d 528, 530, <em>cert, denied, </em>498 U.S. 851, 111 S.Ct. 143, 112 L.Ed.2d 110 (1990); <em>Hecht Co. v. C &amp; P Telephone Co., </em>310 Md. 148, 152, 528 A.2d 474, 475-76 (1987). If Congress has expressly stated preemptive intent or evidenced an intent to occupy a field, federal law shall govern. <em>Harrison, </em>319 Md. at 364, 572 A.2d at 530. When, however, Congress does not expressly state its intent, there is a presumption against preemption. <em>Abbot by Abbot v. American Cyanamid Co., </em>844 F.2d 1108, 1112 (4th Cir.1988) (citing <em>Maryland v. Louisiana, </em>451 U.S. at 726, 101 S.Ct. at 2118, 68 L.Ed.2d at 576). The presumption is even stronger against preemption of state remedies, like tort remedies, when no federal remedy exists. <em>Abbot, </em>844 F.2d at 1112 (citing <em>Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., </em>464 U.S. 238, 251, 104 S.Ct. 615, 622-23, 78 L.Ed.2d 443, 454 (1984)); <em>see also Taylor v. General Motors Corp., </em>875 F.2d 816 (11th Cir.1989), <em>cert, denied, </em>494 U.S. 1065, 110 S.Ct. 1781, 108 L.Ed.2d 783 (1990) (strong presumption against preemption when subject matter is tort remedy).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>as we discuss more fully <em>infra, </em>a federal remedy does exist for appellants \u2014 a claim in respect to Omni House might possibly be brought before the NLRB for adjudication. More important, it appears that in order to fully adjudicate claims against the union it will be necessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>determine whether the reaction of Omni House to the strike and picketing, <em>i.e., </em>the termination of appellants, was an unfair labor practice under section 8 of the NLRA. Additionally, as we later indicate, an alleged inadequacy of an NLRB remedy, as compared to the remedies potentially available for a negligent misrepresentation claim in a state court suit, does not under the circumstances here present, overcome the applicability of what is known as the <em>Garmon</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>preemption that prevails, generally, in certain labor disputes. Federal preemption principles at this stage of the proceedings, deprive the Maryland courts of jurisdiction over the instant matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">B. NLRA AND PREEMPTION</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The NLRA established the NLRB to adjudicate labor disputes between and among employees, unions and employers.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Since the 1950s, the Supreme Court has stressed the primary role to be played by the NLRB in labor dispute resolution. In <em>Garner v. Teamsters, Local Union No. 776, </em>346 U.S. 485, 490, 74 S.Ct. 161, 165-66, 98 L.Ed. 228, 239 (1953), the Supreme Court noted that the NLRB had been vested with its powers because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">' \u201cCongress did not merely lay down a substantive rule of law to be enforced by any tribunal competent to apply law generally to the parties. It went on to confide primary interpretation and application of its rules to a specific and specially constituted tribunal and prescribed a particular - procedure for investigation, complaint and notice, and hearing and decisions, including judicial relief pending a final administrative order. Congress evidently considered that centralized administration of specially designed procedures was necessary to obtain uniform application of its substantive rules and to avoid those diversities and conflicts likely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>to result from a variety of local procedures and attitudes toward labor controversies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">In <em>San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, </em>359 U.S. 236, 246, 79 S.Ct. 773, 780, 3 L.Ed.2d 775, 784 (1959), the case correctly relied upon by the Circuit Court Judge in the case <em>subjudice, </em>the Supreme Court further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-5\">\u201cThe governing consideration is that to allow the States to control activities that are potentially subject to federal regulation involves too great a danger of conflict with national labor policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The Supreme Court then enunciated the general rule (the <em>Garmon </em>preemption) that state regulation is preempted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-7\">\u201cWhen it is clear or may fairly be assumed that the activities which a State purports to regulate are protected by \u00a7 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, or constitute an unfair labor practice under \u00a7 8, due regard for the federal enactment requires that state jurisdiction must yield.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 244, 79 S.Ct. at 779, 3 L.Ed.2d at 782. Even when it is not clear that the activity is protected or prohibited, as is reflected by the factual disputes in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the determination of the status of the activity is to be made by the NLRB, the agency declared by Congress to have special competence over such issues.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Supreme Court opined: \u201c[w]hen an activity is <em>arguably </em>subject to \u00a7 7 or \u00a7 8 of the Act, the States as well as the federal courts must defer to the exclusive competence of the National Labor Relations Board if the danger of state interference with national policy is to be adverted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 245, 79 S.Ct. at 780, 3 L.Ed.2d at 783 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>The <em>Garmon </em>rule, at its most basic level, provides that state and federal courts must yield exclusive jurisdiction to the NLRB whenever the conduct sought to be rectified by actions in state courts is in an area subject to NLRB jurisdiction and is either protected or \u201carguably\u201d protected by section 7 of the NLRA, or is prohibited or \u201carguably\u201d prohibited by section 8 of the NLRA, <em>i. e., </em>labor disputes involving activities protected and prohibited by the NLRA. This rule preempts state jurisdiction when the activity is actually or arguably \u201cwithin the compass of \u00a7 7 or \u00a7 8 of the [NLRA].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 246, 79 S.Ct. at 780, 3 L.Ed.2d at 784 (alteration added).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">In <em>Garmon, </em>however, the Supreme Court created two exceptions to the preemption doctrine for certain classes of eases and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-6\">\u201cwhere the activity regulated was a merely peripheral concern of the Labor Management Relations Act ... [o]r where the regulated conduct touched interests so deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility that, in the absence of compelling congressional direction, we could not infer that Congress had deprived the States of the power to act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 243-44, 79 S.Ct. at 779, 3 L.Ed.2d at 782.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> These exceptions provide a sense of the scope of the preemption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>doctrine explained in <em>Garmon. </em>In <em>Belknap, Inc. v. Hale, </em>463 U.S. 491, 498-99, 103 S.Ct. 3172, 3177, 77 L.Ed.2d 798, 807 (1983), when discussing the <em>Garmon </em>preemption doctrine and its exceptions, the Supreme Court stated that \u201cthe State\u2019s interest in controlling or remedying the effects of the conduct is balanced against both the interference \"with the [NLRB\u2019s] ability to adjudicate controversies committed to it by the [NLRA], and the risk that the State will sanction conduct that the [NLRA] protects.\u201d (citations omitted) (alterations added).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">The facts of the case <em>sub judice </em>reflect that the <em>Garmon </em>exceptions are inapplicable in this case. There are core issues that must be decided by the NLRB. It is clear that the interpretation of facts material to the labor issues here present is within that tribunal\u2019s initial jurisdiction under sections 7 and 8 of the NLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">G. SECTIONS 7 AND 8 OF THE NLRA</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The NLRB has primary jurisdiction to deal with labor disputes involving activities protected and prohibited by sections 7 and 8 of the NLRA. These particular sections of the NLRA broadly \u201cgovern both protected \u2018concerted activities\u2019 and [prohibited] unfair labor practices. They regulate the vital, economic instruments of the strike and the picket line, and impinge on the clash of the still unsettled claims between employers and labor unions.\u201d <em>Garmon, </em>359 U.S. at 241, 79 S.Ct. at 777, 3 L.Ed.2d at 780 (alteration added).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Section 7 of the NLRA guarantees employees certain rights and states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-8\">\u201cEmployees shall have the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection, and shall also have the right to refrain from any or all of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>activities except to the extent that such right may be affected by an agreement requiring membership in a labor organization as a condition of employment as authorized in section 8(a)(3).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">NLRA, \u00a7 7 (codified at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Section 8 of the NLRA enumerates several unfair labor practices that can be committed by an employer, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">\u201c(a) Unfair labor practices by employer. It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">(1) to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 7....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-8\">(3) by discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">NLRA, \u00a7 8 (codified at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1) and (3)).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">It is clear that if Omni House improperly terminated appellants in order to interfere with their attempts to organize or if the termination, in a discriminatory fashion, was intended to discourage the attempts of the union to organize, Omni House might have committed unfair labor practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-11\">Furthermore, section 8(b)(1)(A) provides that it is an unfair labor practice for a labor organization \u201cto restrain or coerce (A) employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 7\u201d NLRA, \u00a7 8 (codified at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b)(1)). In some situations, misrepresentations by a union during an organizing campaign might constitute an unfair labor practice under section 8(b).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-12\">Finally, section 8(g) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>\u201cA labor organization before engaging in any strike, picketing, or other concerted refusal to work at any health care institution shall, not less than ten days prior to such action, notify the institution in writing and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service of that intention, except that in the case of bargaining for an initial agreement following certification or recognition the notice required by this subsection shall not be given until the expiration of the period specified in clause (B) of the last sentence of section 8(d) of this Act.\u201d [Emphasis added.] 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">This appeal stems from appellant\u2019s initial complaint filed in the Circuit Court. We hold that the negligent misrepresentation tort claim, necessarily, pursuant to the facts of the case <em>sub judice </em>as plead in the complaint, would require judicial review of issues relating to actions that are clearly or, at least \u201carguably,\u201d protected and/or prohibited by sections 7 and 8 of the NLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">The union correctly asserts that appellant\u2019s negligent misrepresentation claim is \u201cpreempted because the conduct relied on to prove a crucial element of that claim is actually or arguably covered by the NLR[A].\u201d In Maryland, the elements that constitute the tort of negligent misrepresentation are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-8\">\u201c(1) The defendant, owing a duty of care to the plaintiff, negligently asserts a false statement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-9\">\u201c(2) The defendant intends that his statement will be acted upon by the plaintiff;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-10\">\u201c(3) The defendant has knowledge that the plaintiff will probably rely on the statement, which, if erroneous, will cause loss or injury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>\u201c(4) The plaintiff, justifiably, takes action in reliance on the statement; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">\u201c(5) The plaintiff suffers damages proximately caused by the defendant\u2019s negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-7\"><em>Martens Chevrolet, Inc. v. Seney, </em>292 Md. 328, 337, 439 A.2d 534, 539 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">Appellants contend that the facts are simple and that this is simply a tort case based upon the tortious conduct on the part of the union. Therefore, they assert, the State has jurisdiction over the dispute because the State has jurisdiction over this recognized state cause of action and a union is amenable to suit in the State court. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">To prevail appellants would have to prove that, pursuant to element one, <em>supra, </em>the union\u2019s advice that appellants had a lawful right to picket under section 7 of the NLRA was false because prior to striking they were required to give notice to Omni House pursuant to the language of section 8(g) and that the union did not advise appellants of this requirement. In this sense, it could be argued that the union was negligent in misrepresenting that appellants were \u201cwithin their legal rights\u201d regarding their union-related activities. Appellants have contended, and the record appears to reflect, that as a result of this advice, Omni House terminated their employment or, in the alternative, that their termination was a direct and proximate result of having picketed without having given the section 8(g) notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">Thus, a crucial element of the State tort claim relies on conduct that is clearly or arguably protected or prohibited by the NLRA, because, as we see it, what appellants are essentially claiming is that the union caused them to commit a NLRA violation. The conduct which appellants are challenging, <em>i.e., </em>the union\u2019s alleged misrepresentation, might .fall within the ambit of section 8(b) or (c) of the NLRA, because the union arguably violated these particular subsections of the NLRA. Potentially, the union, committed a prohibited unfair labor practice under section 8(b) or (c), by making such a misrepresentation during the organizing campaign.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>The union, in its brief and at oral argument, has proffered that it would argue preemption in defense to appellants\u2019 State tort suit. The union explained to the Court that it would argue that appellants did have the right to picket and strike under section 7 and that the appellants did not violate section 8(g) because they did not have to give the ten day notice. As previously indicated, <em>supra, </em>it is disputed whether the employees, themselves, had to give the ten-day notice. The union argues that the plain language of the statute does not even require such a determination because it specifically states that only \u201clabor organizations\u201d shall give ten-days notice and, as such, Omni House could allege an 8(g) violation claim only against the union, not appellants. The union refers to the case of <em>NLRB v. Local Union No. 388, </em>548 F.2d 704, 706-07, 710 (7th Cir.1977), and NLRB administrative decisions<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> holding that under section 8(g) a union that represents health care workers as their collective bargaining representative must give the ten-day notice, but that individual employees or groups of unorganized employees do not. Because, according to the union, appellants had not yet become official members of the union, it argues that they did not have to give notice. As a result, the union argues that Omni House violated the NLRA by terminating appellants in contravention of the NLRA and, thus, itself committed an unfair labor practice actionable only before the NLRB. The union further contends that, in reality, the actionable violation that occurred was of section 8(a)(1) and (3), an unfair labor practice on the part of Omni House when it fired the eight appellants. The union argues that proving element one of the negligent misrepresentation claim also requires determinations on the potential section 8 violations, on the part of both the union and/or Omni House. Those determinations fall within the primary jurisdiction of the NLRB.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>The determination of whether appellants were wrongfully discharged because they had the right to strike (an unfair labor practice pursuant to sections 8(a)(1) and/or (3) on the part of Omni House) or whether their discharge was proper because their strike and picketing'was improper, is a matter for determination, as to which position is correct, by the NLRB, because it involves a determination as to whether the termination constituted an unfair labor practice. If the actions of Omni House were proper, then the misrepresentations of the union which resulted in the strike and picketing would have to be examined to determine if they constituted unfair labor practices. In either event, the making of such determinations is, in the first instance, a primary function of the NLRB, not the courts. To decide this tort claim would require the courts to adjudicate the merits of the underlying labor controversy which are issues that can, and should have been, presented to the NLRB for adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">The union noted in its brief that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-5\">\u201cWhat is significant is that the Omni House Workers had the opportunity to bring charges against Local 37 and/or Omni House at any time after they were terminated, subject only to the limitations period prescribed by \u00a7 10 of the NLRA.... The Omni House Workers decided against bringing charges, opting instead to pursue litigation in state court. Preemption centers on claims that <em>could have been brought </em>before the NLRB even if they were not so brought.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Appellants, therefore, brought a claim against the union in state court, when they should have first brought their claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>before the NLRB against either or both Omni House and the union for unfair labor practice violations of the NLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">A. <em>GARMON </em>EXCEPTIONS DO NOT APPLY</p>\n<p id=\"A7G\">Appellants\u2019 argument, as it is detailed in their brief to the Court, is unclear in its interpretation of <em>Garmon </em>and how it supports their position that its exceptions are applicable in the case at bar. Nevertheless, we address the two <em>Garmon </em>exceptions to emphasize that the Circuit Court judge was not in error in relying on <em>Garmon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">In their brief, appellants note that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-6\">\u201cThe argument made at the motions hearing before the Circuit Court Judge below was that because the Appellants have sued the Union they are therefore restricted to bringing their complaint before the National Labor Relations Board which was the basis of the Motion Judge granting of the Appellees\u2019 Motion to Dismiss on May 29, 2002. The error of the Circuit Court judge in dismissing the case is best answered by the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Vaca v. Sipes, </em>386 U.S. 171, 87 S.Ct. 903 [17 L.Ed.2d 842] (1967).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Appellants then discussed briefly the facts of the <em>Vaca </em>case, which involved a union member who brought suit in a state court alleging that he had been discharged in violation of a collective bargaining agreement and charged his union with breach of contract and duty of fair representation for failure to take his claim to arbitration. In <em>Vaca, </em>decided subsequent to <em>Garmon, </em>the Supreme Court held that mere union involvement in a dispute does not preclude state action and that the state courts have jurisdiction in that type of case involving a breach of contract claim between a union member and his union arising from a collective bargaining agreement. Due to the nature and type of case involved, the Supreme Court stated that <em>\u201cGarmon </em>and like cases have no application to \u00a7 301 suits.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Vaca, </em>386 U.S. 171, 184, 87 S.Ct. 903, 913, 17 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>L.Ed.2d 842, 854 (1967). Appellants then cite the portion of the <em>Vaca </em>case where the Supreme Court stated that it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArT\">\u201chas refused to hold state remedies pre-empted \u2018where the activity regulated was a merely peripheral concern of Labor Management Relations Act. * * * [or] touched interests so deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility that in the absence of compelling congressional direction, we could not infer that Congress has deprived the States of the power to ' act.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-4\"><em>Vaca, </em>386 U.S. at 180, 87 S.Ct. at 911, 17 L.Ed.2d at 852. The portion of <em>Vaca </em>cited by appellants notes the <em>Garmon </em>rule and its exceptions but it does not support appellant\u2019s claim in this case. Further, appellants proffered no accompanying argument as to why <em>Vaca </em>supports the proposition that their claim is one outside of NLRB jurisdiction and within either of the <em>Garmon </em>exceptions. Appellants\u2019 reliance on <em>Vaca </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Appellants also rely upon <em>Batson v. Shiflett, </em>86 Md.App. 340, 586 A.2d 792 (1991), <em>Batson v. Shiflett, </em>325 Md. 684, 602 A.2d 1191 (1992), which involved a suit brought in the circuit court by a union member against the local president for, among other things, defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress. There, the union defended, as here, on the basis that the NLRA preempted the union member from proceeding with the case in state court. Ultimately, we upheld the state tort actions against the union and, by reason of the type and character of the suit brought, held that the case did not fall within the exclusive control the NLRB. There, the <em>Garmon </em>preemption was not applicable. In <em>Batson, </em>the Court followed the approach used by the Supreme Court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number><em>Garmon </em>and its progeny<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> by undertaking an analysis of the conduct at issue and whether the conduct for the tort claims fell under the purview of the NLRA. In <em>Batson, </em>even though the NLRB had decided an unfair labor claim arising from the underlying disputed collective bargaining agreement, the tort suits in the State court were not preempted by the NLRA because the resolution of the tort suits did not implicate and/or require adjudication of any remaining issues that should have first been presented to the NLRB.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\"><em>Batson </em>is also distinguishable because it involved the torts of defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress, torts not involved in the case <em>sub </em>judice.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Judge Karwacki <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>explained in detail for this Court the extent of federal labor preemption and how, pursuant to the facts of that case and the nature and type of the suit involved, the NLRA did not preempt the particular State tort claims there involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Contrary to appellants\u2019 assertions, <em>Batson </em>and the federal law relevant to this issue requires our holding in this case. Because it is necessary to determine whether unfair labor practices have occurred, the negligent misrepresentation claim is initially preempted by the NLRA and thus the subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate that issue rests with the NLRB. The <em>Garmon </em>preemption rule is applicable in this case. The exceptions carved out by the Supreme Court to this rule are not. The issues that would be necessary to address in this case involve core rights afforded and activities prohibited by sections 7 and 8 of the NLRA. As a result, we must defer to the NLRB for adjudication of appellant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The negligent misrepresentation claim cannot be tried to conclusion unless it is determined that appellee\u2019s advice was false and that before striking, appellants individually were required to give ten days notice to Omni House pursuant to section 8(g) and that this wrong advice directly led to then-termination. Such a determination, however, by our courts, would implicate a decision, as we indicated <em>supra, </em>on whether the employees had a right to strike under section 7 without giving notice because, as the union disputes, that statutory requirement pertains only to \u201clabor organizations,\u201d not individuals, <em>i.e., </em>the appellants in this case, and that pursuant to the facts of this case Omni House arguably committed an unfair labor practice by terminating the employees. Here, a necessary element of the tort action against the union requires a determination of whether Omni House either had or did not have the right to fire appellants. This is an NLRB matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">We conclude that it is necessary, in order to adjudicate the state tort claim, to determine whether unfair labor practices have occurred in this case and, if so, who committed the violations. Such determinations, under the circumstances here present involve the unfair labor practices jurisdiction of the NLRB. Consequently, we hold that the trial court did not err in ruling, based upon <em>Garmon </em>and its progeny, that the NLRA preempts appellant\u2019s state cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED. APPELLANTS TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b498-7\">. Unless otherwise noted, all statutory references hereafter are to the <em>National Labor Relations Act of 1935, </em>codified in Title 29 of the United States Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b500-7\">. We note this difference in the parties\u2019 recitation of the facts because whether the employee appellants had yet become members of a union would be a decision for the NLRB to determine, if it were adjudicating the underlying unfair labor practice claims this case ultimately rests upon. The record reflects, generally, that appellants were not yet members of the union. In interrogatory answers while the case was before the federal court, appellants affirmed that they had not joined the union and Judge Davis for the federal district court stated in his remand opinion that \"none of the plaintiffs ever became a member of the union.\u201d This and other factual disputes support our holding that the relationship between the three actors of this case (the employer, the employee and the union) is not clear and that each parties\u2019 protected rights and prohibited activities under the NLRA are in dispute. Such determinations, generally, come under the exclusive primary jurisdiction of the NLRB.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b500-8\">. Section 7 of the NLRA detailed <em>infra, </em>generally guarantees the rights of employees to self organize, form, join or assist a labor organization with the goal of collective bargaining.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b501-9\">. At this time, the record reflects that the union's attorney did, in fact, tell appellants they themselves had to have given ten-days notice prior to picketing and by appellants not having done so the picketing was unlawful. The union\u2019s attorney also stated that it was the union\u2019s mistake for not having informed appellants of this requirement. However, the union now proffers that appellants had not become union members and that section 8(g), upon which Omni House relies, is only applicable to \"labor organizations\u201d by the very language of the statute; therefore, appellants did not have to adhere to the ten-day notice provision and did not commit unlawful activity. Therefore, what really occurred was, according to the union's present position, an unfair labor practice pursuant to section 8 of the NLRA on the part of Omni House.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b502-11\">.
