Judge John H. McDowell of the Washington County Circuit Court held a suppression hearing on August 24, 2000.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Judge McDowell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>denied the motion to suppress on all grounds on September 15, 2000, and, in reference to the issue in this case, he found that petitioner had no expectation of privacy in the seized clothing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">On November 27-30, 2000, petitioner was tried and convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court for Washington County on charges of first and second degree murder, first degree assault and the unlawful taking of a motor vehicle. On March 8, 2001,'Judge McDowell sentenced petitioner to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole on the first degree murder conviction<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and to a concurrent five-year term of imprisonment for the unlawful taking of a motor vehicle conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Petitioner filed a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. On May 9, 2002, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s rulings and issued an unpublished opinion. In that opinion, the intermediate appellate court upheld the trial court\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s motion to suppress holding that petitioner had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the property stored in the police property Room, relying on the reasoning in <em>Holland v. State, </em>122 Md.App. 532, 713 A.2d 364, <em>cert, denied, </em>351 Md. 662, 719 A.2d 1262 (1998), and, in the alternative, that the property would have inevitably been discovered pursuant to a facially valid warrant. That court also ruled in favor of the State on other issues not before this Court when it affirmed the trial court in its denial of petitioner\u2019s motion to suppress petitioner\u2019s statements, his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>motion to suppress photographic array identifications, his contention that DNA evidence should not be admitted, his motion to dismiss for speedy trial violations and his claim that the evidence was insufficient to support the convictions. Petitioner then filed a timely Petition for Writ of Certiorari to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">On August 22, 2002, this Court granted petitioner\u2019s Petition for Writ of Certiorari involving the sole issue of petitioner\u2019s motion to suppress evidence stemming from an alleged illegal seizure of his clothing which was stored in a police property room pursuant to petitioner\u2019s arrest on an unrelated drug charge. <em>Wallace v. State, </em>370 Md. 268, 805 A.2d 265 (2002). Petitioner presents one question for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-6\">\u201cWhether the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Holland v. State, </em>[122 Md.App. 532, 713 A.2d 364,] permitting warrantless searches and seizures incident to arrest to occur later upon arrival at the jail, applies to a seizure of clothing from the jail pursuant to an unrelated investigation ten days after an arrest on an unrelated charge.\u201d [Alteration added.] [Footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">The essence of petitioner\u2019s question is not limited to the applicability of <em>Holland v. State; </em>petitioner is essentially asking this Court to determine if the trial judge\u2019s denial, and the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 subsequent affirmation of that denial, of petitioner\u2019s motion to suppress evidence stemming from the alleged improper seizure of his clothing were correct. We hold that this evidence was admissible and thus affirm the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 holding that petitioner had no reasonable expectation of privacy in clothing legally obtained by law enforcement officials, stored in the jail\u2019s property room, moved to another area in the facility by an officer for safekeeping and later returned to the booking area of the jail facility and searched. The stains on clothing were analyzed after the execution of a valid search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">Petitioner\u2019s charges stem from the homicide of Darrius Fetterhoff, who was found alive, floating in Conococheague <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>Creek on August 25, 1997, after being missing since August 20, 1997. On August 28, 1997, three days after being found, Mr. Fetterhoff died.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">On August 20, 1997, the same day Mr. Fetterhoff disappeared and several days prior to the discovery of Mr. Fetter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>hoff floating in the creek, petitioner was arrested for an unrelated drug offense and was held at the Washington County Detention Center (WCDC). After petitioner was incarcerated on this charge, his personal belongings, including his clothing, were taken from him, inventoried and then stored in the WCDC property room. At the hearing on petitioner\u2019s motion to suppress the use, at trial, of this clothing and any evidence derived from it, Corporal Douglass Moore, the supervisor of intake and release of detainees at WCDC, testified regarding the taking and storing of detainees\u2019 personal property at WCDC. While not specifically recalling petitioner\u2019s intake on August 20, 1997, Corporal Moore described the \u201cfairly standardized procedure\u201d of seizing detainees\u2019 property during the intake process at WCDC. The relevant portions of the jail\u2019s policy manual were also admitted into evidence. He stated that, according to WCDC\u2019s policy manual, \u201cAll property is handled by all officers the same way.\u201d Detainees\u2019 small personal belongings are taken immediately, inventoried, sealed in a bag and placed in the property room. Before the prisoners are moved into the general population, their clothes are removed, placed by the prisoner into a labeled bag and stored in the property room by the detention center\u2019s staff. Each prisoner is issued a jump suit. Only uniformed personnel have access to the stored property; inmates do not have access to their belongings, including their clothing, once the inmates are moved into the general population. Corporal Moore also testified that there was no evidence that petitioner\u2019s intake was any different than that of the standard intake he described.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">Inmates, however, may release their property to another individual, <em>e.g., </em>a family member, etc., by filling out a \u201crequest slip\u201d and having the property officer make arrangements for a clothing exchange. Most exchanges of clothing between inmates and visitors occur on weekends, but, generally, only when a request is properly submitted. Petitioner did not fill out a request to exchange clothing from August 30, 1997 to September 2, 1997, the time period in which the alleged Fourth Amendment violation took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>Corporal Roy Harsh, the investigating officer in the Fetterhoff murder, received the accounts of the witnesses who had seen Mr. Fetterhoffs vehicle. Those witnesses gave a description of the victim and two others, a woman and a man associated with that vehicle.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The man\u2019s appearance was similar to that of petitioner. During a conversation with a sergeant in the drug task force that arrested petitioner on August 20,1997, Corporal Harsh recited the description of the suspect male in the homicide to the sergeant. After hearing the suspect\u2019s description, the sergeant gave petitioner\u2019s name to Corporal Harsh.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Corporal Harsh then assembled a photo array including petitioner\u2019s picture and at least two witnesses identified petitioner as the suspect who had been seen in connection with the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">After petitioner potentially was linked to the crime by the witnesses, Corporal Harsh went to WCDC in order \u201cto verify what clothing items [petitioner] was wearing when he had been arrested on the 20th.\u201d Corporal Harsh first reviewed the inventory sheet record of petitioner\u2019s items in the property room and found descriptions of items similar to those furnished by the witnesses, including a pair of dark blue shorts. Realizing the evidentiary potential of petitioner\u2019s clothing, Corporal Harsh received permission from a jail side deputy, Deputy Russell, to move the clothing to the patrol side property room. Corporal Harsh stated that he moved the property \u201cto the patrol side for safekeeping, due to the fact that it was a weekend and that the inmates generally receive visitors on the weekend and that they are allowed to release their personal items during visitation.\u201d Corporal Harsh removed a black tee shirt, dark blue shorts and a plastic bag with personal items because of their possible evidentiary value. Once on the patrol side, he separated the clothing from the plastic bag and, while folding the clothing, noticed stains on petitioner\u2019s shorts. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>No analysis was done on the stains at that time; the items were placed in bags, recorded on the patrol side property record and placed in the secure property room of the patrol area. Other than putting the items in separate bags, petitioner\u2019s belongings remained in the same condition as they were before their transfer to the patrol side property room.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Corporal Harsh spoke to an attorney at the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office on the following Tuesday morning, September 2, 1997, the day after the Labor Day holiday, in order to inform that office of the events regarding the investigation of petitioner\u2019s clothing and to receive advice on future actions. Corporal Harsh testified that he \u201cwas advised to take the items back over to the booking area and to obtain a search warrant to obtain those items.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Later that day, Corporal Harsh returned the items to the booking area of the jail, applied for a search warrant, in which he included his August 30th observations upon moving the clothing to the patrol side property room, and presented the application to Judge R. Noel Spence, who issued the warrant. Corporal Harsh executed the warrant that evening and the items were released from the booking area for analysis the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"Al\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">This Court has recently summarized the standard of review of motions to suppress in the case of <em>State v. Collins, </em>367 Md. 700, 706-07, 790 A.2d 660, 663-64 (2002), when we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Au6\">\u201cOur review of a Circuit Court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress evidence under the Fourth Amendment is limited, ordinarily, to information contained in the record of the suppression hearing and not the record of the trial. <em>See Ferris v. State, </em>355 Md. 356, 368, 735 A.2d 491, 497 (1999); <em>In re Tariq A-R-Y, </em>347 Md. 484, 488, 701 A.2d 691, 693 (1997); <em>Simpler v. State, </em>318 Md. 311, 312, 568 A.2d 22, 22 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>(1990); <em>Trusty v. State, </em>308 Md. 658, 670, 521 A.2d 749, 755 (1987). When there is a denial of a motion to suppress, we are further limited to considering facts in the light most favorable to the State as the prevailing party on the motion. <em>Riddick v. State, </em>319 Md. 180, 183, 571 A.2d 1239, 1240 (1990); <em>Simpler, </em>318 Md. at 312, 568 A.2d at 22. In considering the evidence presented at the suppression hearing, we extend great deference to the fact-finding of the suppression hearing judge with respect to the weighing and determining first-level facts. <em>Lancaster v. State, </em>86 Md. App. 74, 95, 585 A.2d 274, 284 (1991); <em>Perkins v. State, </em>83 Md.App. 341, 346, 574 A.2d 356, 358 (1990). When conflicting evidence is presented, we accept the facts as found by the hearing judge unless it is shown that his findings are clearly erroneous. <em>McMillian v. State, </em>325 Md. 272, 281-82, 600 A.2d 430, 435 (1992); <em>Riddick, </em>319 Md. at 183, 571 A.2d at 1240. Even so, as to the ultimate conclusion of whether an action taken was proper, we must make our own independent constitutional appraisal by reviewing the law and applying it to the facts of the case. <em>Riddick v. State, </em>319 Md. at 183, 571 A.2d at 1240; <em>Munafo v. State, </em>105 Md.App. 662, 669, 660 A.2d 1068, 1071 (1995).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>petitioner does not present a question concerning whether the factual findings of the hearing judge were clearly erroneous. Accordingly, we need only address the purely legal issue of whether an officer\u2019s moving of an inmate\u2019s clothing, previously inventoried at the jail and legally held by the government, is in violation of petitioner\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. We hold that such a seizure (or continuous seizure), under the facts of this case, does not violate the Fourth Amendment rights of petitioner as petitioner did not have any reasonable expectation of privacy in the clothing that was legally in police custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">B. Legitimate Expectation of Privacy</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees protection for individuals\u2019 rights to be free <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>from unreasonable government searches and seizures. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-5\">\u201cThe right of people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">These Fourth Amendment protections are applicable to the State of Maryland through the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. <em>See Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 655, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 1691, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081, 1090 (1961); <em>Owens v. State, </em>322 Md. 616, 622, 589 A.2d 59, 61, <em>cert, denied, </em>502 U.S. 973, 112 S.Ct. 452, 116 L.Ed.2d 470 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">While the Fourth Amendment has many facets and intricacies, the case <em>sub judice </em>involves a rather narrow issue. The essential question is whether the Fourth Amendment prohibits an officer from moving an inmate\u2019s clothing, which was previously inventoried at the jail and legally held by the government, from the property room of the jail to another property room of the patrol division in the same facility, and inspect it without a warrant. As such, we primarily focus our background discussion of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence on legitimate expectations of privacy and inventory searches, the law essential to our decision in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">The Fourth Amendment\u2019s protections extend only to those items and places in which the individual claiming the protection has a legitimate expectation of privacy.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Smith v. Maryland, </em>442 U.S. 735, 740, 99 S.Ct. 2577, 2580, 61 L.Ed.2d 220, 226-27 (1979); <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 351, 88 S.Ct. 507, 511, 19 L.Ed.2d 576, 582 (1967); <em>Owens, </em>322 Md. at 625-26, 589 A.2d at 63. The United States Supreme Court has revisited its interpretation of an individual\u2019s \u201clegitimate expectation of privacy\u201d on several occasions. In <em>Rakas v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number><em>Illinois, </em>439 U.S. 128, 99 S.Ct. 421, 58 L.Ed.2d 387 (1978), the Supreme Court further developed this analysis by minimizing the distinction between substantive Fourth Amendment analysis and Fourth Amendment standing. The Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-5\">\u201c[T]his Court\u2019s long history of insistence that Fourth Amendment rights are personal in nature has already answered many of [the] traditional standing inquiries, and we think that definition of those rights is more properly placed within the purview of substantive Fourth Amendment law than within that of standing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-6\">\u201cAnalyzed in these terms, the question is whether the challenged search or seizure violated the Fourth Amendment rights of a criminal defendant who seeks to exclude the evidence obtained during it. That inquiry in turn requires a determinationof whether the disputed search and seizure has infringed an interest of the defendant which the Fourth Amendment was designed to protect. We are under no illusion that by dispensing with the rubric of standing ... we have rendered any simpler the determination of whether the proponent of a motion to suppress is entitled to contest the legality of a search and seizure. But by frankly recognizing that this aspect of the analysis belongs more properly under the heading of substantive Fourth Amendment doctrine than under the heading of standing, we think the decision of this issue will rest on sounder logical footing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 140, 99 S.Ct. at 428-29, 58 L.Ed.2d at 399 (citations omitted) (alterations added) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">In discussing a test for determinating the scope of a legitimate expectation of privacy, the Supreme Court went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AI_\">\u201c[A] \u2018legitimate\u2019 expectation of privacy by definition means more than a subjective expectation of not being discovered ____Legitimation of expectations of privacy by law must have a source outside of the Fourth Amendment, either by reference to concepts of real or personal property law or to understandings that are recognized and permitted by society.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 143-44 n. 12, 99 S.Ct. at 430-31 n. 12, 58 L.Ed.2d at 401-02 n. 12 (alterations added).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The Supreme Court has subsequently articulated the <em>Rakas </em>two-step analysis as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-6\">\u201c[I]n order to claim the protection of the Fourth Amendment, a defendant must demonstrate that he personally has an expectation of privacy in the place searched, and that his expectation is reasonable; <em>i.e., </em>one that has \u2018a source outside of the Fourth Amendment, either by reference to concepts of real or personal property law or to understandings that are recognized and permitted by society.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-7\"><em>Minnesota v. Carter, </em>525 U.S. 83, 88, 119 S.Ct. 469, 472, 142 L.Ed.2d 373, 379 (1998) (quoting <em>Rakas, </em>439 U.S. at 143-44 n. 12, 99 S.Ct. at 430-31 n. 12, 58 L.Ed.2d at 401-02 n. 12). <em>See also California v. Greenwood, </em>486 U.S. 35, 39-40, 108 S.Ct. 1625, 1628, 100 L.Ed.2d 30, 36 (1988) (stating that \u201cAn expectation of privacy does not give rise to Fourth Amendment protection, however, unless society is prepared to accept that expectation as objectively reasonable\u201d). In other words, if petitioner does not have a legitimate expectation of privacy in his clothing in police custody, then he has no Fourth Amendment protections as to those items.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">In his arguments to this Court, petitioner focuses not on whether he had a legitimate or reasonable expectation of privacy in his clothing stored in WCDC\u2019s property room, but on whether \u201cthe seizure was conducted incident to the relevant lawful arrest or conducted pursuant to any relevant legitimate inventory.\u201d In the situation here present, however, an inventory search, or search incident to arrest,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> is only relevant to whether the police were legally in possession of petitioner\u2019s clothing in the first instance. In this petition the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>issue of the taking of possession of the items in the first instance is not presented. What is presented is the appropriateness of it being inspected ten days later. Here the action being challenged is not the original seizure or the original search, but merely a continual seizure of the clothing when it was moved by the State from the jail side property room, placed in the patrol side property room, inspected, and then returned to the jail side property room. In the present case the State merely moved the property legally in its possession from one place to another place in the same facility also under the control of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Once the inventory search of an individual is completed and his clothing and other items are seized as a part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>legitimate practices of the intake facility, that individual\u2019s clothing and other possessions so seized from him are in the legal possession of the police and any evidence discovered during such a search is, generally, admissible at trial. <em>Lafayette, </em>462 U.S. 640, 103 S.Ct. 2605, 77 L.Ed.2d 65. In this case, petitioner does not challenge the legality of the August 20th inventory search conducted pursuant to his arrest on the unrelated drug charge. Therefore, there is no doubt that his possessions, including the clothing in question here, as far as this case is concerned, were in the legal possession of the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">An important Supreme Court decision in respect to the situation in this case is <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>415 U.S. 800, 94 S.Ct. 1234, 39 L.Ed.2d 771 (1974). In <em>Edwards, </em>Edwards was lawfully arrested and placed in a jail cell. The police investigation of the crime scene revealed the possibility that forensic evidence was on Edwards\u2019 clothing. Therefore, the next day, without a warrant, the police took Edwards\u2019 clothing and held it as evidence. An examination of the clothing revealed paint chips which linked Edwards to the crime. This evidence was received at trial over Edwards\u2019 objection. The Supreme Court held that the evidence was admissible. In comparing the delayed search with the initial one, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-6\">\u201cWith or without probable cause, the authorities were entitled at that point not only to search Edwards\u2019 clothing but also to take it from him and keep it in official custody.... The police were also entitled to take from Edwards any evidence of the crime in his immediate possession, including his clothing.... [T]he clothing he had been wearing at the time of arrest was taken from him and subjected to laboratory analysis. This was no more than taking from respondent the effects in his immediate possession that constituted evidence of crime. This was and is a normal incident of a custodial arrest, and reasonable delay in effectuating it does not change the fact that Edwards was no more imposed upon than he could have been at the time and place of the arrest or immediately upon arrival at the place of detention. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>The police did no more on June 1 than they were entitled to do incident to the usual custodial arrest and incarceration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANT\"><em>Id. </em>at 804-05, 94 S.Ct. at 1237-38, 39 L.Ed.2d at 776-77 (alteration added) (footnote omitted). In discussing the reasonableness of the search, the Court went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-5\">\u201c[T]he police had lawful custody of Edwards and necessarily of the clothing he wore. When it became apparent that the articles of clothing were evidence of the crime for which Edwards was being held, the police were entitled to take, examine, and preserve them for use as evidence, just as they are normally permitted to seize evidence of crime when it is lawfully encountered.... Indeed, it is difficult to perceive what is unreasonable about the police\u2019s examining and holding as evidence those personal effects of the accused that they already have in their lawful custody as a result of a lawful arrest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 806, 94 S.Ct. at 1238, 39 L.Ed.2d at 777 (alteration added).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">This Court, while not interpreting <em>Edwards </em>in this particular context, has spoken to a similar and instructive issue in our decision of <em>Gee v. State, </em>291 Md. 663, 435 A.2d 1387 (1981). In <em>Gee, </em>a police officer in the District of Columbia arrested Gee for robbery and, pursuant to a search incident to that arrest, legally took possession of a wallet containing a police badge, which the victims of the robbery said that Gee had flashed during the robbery. The wallet was placed in the possession of the property custodian of the Metropolitan Police Department. Two days later, a Prince George\u2019s County police officer, acting on a report of a similar robbery that occurred months prior,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> went to the property custodian of the Metropolitan Police Department and examined Gee\u2019s wallet. He discovered evidence inside it, including the badge, which was introduced as evidence in Gee\u2019s Maryland trial. Gee filed a motion to suppress the evidence from this search, arguing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>no warrant was issued and there was no specific exception to the warrant requirement to justify the warrantless search by the Prince George\u2019s County police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">This Court held that the Prince George\u2019s County officer\u2019s inspection of Gee\u2019s wallet was valid as he did no more than what the District of Columbia officer had already done in the first search, which was to effectuate a valid search incident to arrest. <em>Id. </em>at 669-72, 435 A.2d at 1390-91. In <em>Gee, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8_\">\u201cThe clear majority of United States Courts of Appeal have held there to be no constitutional violation under circumstances similar to those presented in the instant matter. Where New Jersey authorities had arrested the defendant for carrying a concealed weapon, the subsequent inspection by a federal agent of money taken from the defendant and held for safekeeping was determined not to require a warrant in <em>United States v. Jenkins, </em>496 F.2d 57 (2d Cir.1974), <em>cert, denied, </em>420 U.S. 925, 95 S.Ct. 1119, 43 L.Ed.2d 394 (1975). This was so even though the subsequent inspection, which focused on the serial numbers of bills, revealed that it was \u2018bait money\u2019 taken in a bank robbery. The court said that \u2018[n]o reasonable expectations of privacy were invaded and no search occurred when the police officers in this case simply looked again at what they had already \u2014 lawfully\u2014seen.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 74. Where the entry by fire marshals onto premises which were the subject of a suspected arson was justified by exigent circumstances, the subsequent removal of physical evidence of arson by Delaware State Police, acting without a warrant, was valid since no greater invasion of privacy resulted. <em>Steigler v. Anderson, </em>496 F.2d 793 (3d Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>419 U.S. 1002, 95 S.Ct. 320, 42 L.Ed.2d 277 (1974). In <em>United States v.

In sustaining the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>search, the court said that the underpinning of the cases which find no constitutional violation is that \u2018the items in question have been exposed to police view under unobjectionable circumstances, so that no reasonable expectation of privacy is breached by an officer\u2019s taking a second look at matter with respect to which expectation of privacy already has been at least partially dissipated.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 991. <em>Accord, United States v.

For example, in <em>State v. Gonzales, </em>111 Ariz. 38, 523 P.2d 66 (1974), Glendale, Arizona police had arrested the defendant for public drunkenness. When he was booked at the jail, his clothing was taken from him. Several hours later the Glendale police were advised by the Sheriffs office of Maricopa County, Arizona, that the defendant was a suspect in a murder case in Phoenix. The clothing was impounded, subsequently taken by Maricopa authorities without a warrant and introduced by the state at the murder trial---- It was held there was no merit to the defendant\u2019s contention that the clothing had been illegally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>seized when it was made available by the law enforcement officers of one subdivision to those of another. <em>See also State v. Williams, </em>227 So.2d 331 (Fla.App.1969); <em>Capps v. State, </em>505 S.W.2d 727 (Tenn.1974).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 670-72, 435 A.2d at 1390-91 (some citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">In <em>Holland, supra, </em>the Court of Special Appeals interpreted the language in <em>Edwards </em>in a similar context as that of the case <em>sub judice. </em>As previously articulated, <em>Edwards </em>reasoned: \u201cit is difficult to perceive what is unreasonable about the police\u2019s examining and holding as evidence those personal effects of the accused that they already have in their lawful custody as a result of a lawful arrest.\u201d <em>Edwards, </em>415 U.S. at 806, 94 S.Ct. at 1238, 39 L.Ed.2d at 777. The Court of Special Appeals referenced this language and reasoning to directly support its conclusion as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-6\">\u201cWhen the property is taken from the arrestee, the Fourth Amendment intrusion is a <em>fait accompli. </em>When, hours later, a crime lab technician picks up a gun from a storage locker to check it out ballistically, that is not a fresh Fourth Amendment intrusion requiring either a fresh exigency or a warrant for its justification. The danger of destruction is at an end once an arrestee\u2019s property has been seized. That is the seizure, and the only seizure, that has Fourth Amendment significance. The property may then be dusted for fingerprints, examined for bloodstains or DNA, checked for serial numbers, or otherwise processed on a more leisurely basis as an investigation unfolds. Every time that an item, already in police hands, is physically picked up and examined or reexamined, that is not a fresh Fourth Amendment intrusion requiring a fresh justification. \u201c... Just because the property seized, particularly in an institutional custodial setting such as in this case, is presumptively innocuous does not immunize it from subsequent examination and processing. <em>An arrestee has no reasonable expectation that the police will not scrutinize closely those items that are in their legitimate custody, discovering evidence, perhaps, even where none was initially suspect</em>ed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number><em>Holland, </em>122 Md.App. at 539-40, 713 A.2d at 367-68 (emphasis added). In <em>Holland, </em>after Holland was arrested and incarcerated, the police took his property and stored it in a locker for safekeeping. After several hours, a co-conspirator informed the police that Holland was in possession of the hotel room key to a room that was the headquarters of a drug operation. The police then obtained the key from Holland\u2019s property stored in the jail pursuant to the inventory search. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the denial of Holland\u2019s motion to suppress. While not specifically articulating its reasoning in terms of the Supreme Court\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy test, what the <em>Holland </em>court did, and what we hold today, simply restates this sentiment in the framework of the expectation of privacy test.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Cases from other jurisdictions with analogous facts to the case at bar have similarly used the reasonable expectation of privacy analysis in upholding a denial of a defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. In <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>259 Va. 377, 527 S.E.2d 131 (2000), the defendant was arrested and processed for an unrelated charge and his possessions, including his clothing, were inventoried and stored in police custody. An officer received information that the defendant\u2019s boot matched that of a boot impression found at a murder scene. The detective working the murder case obtained the boot from the property room without a warrant. The boot, and evidence stemming from it, were used at trial to link the defendant to the murder. Relying on <em>Edwards, </em>the Virginia Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-6\"><em>\"We </em>conclude that the defendant, Williams, had no expectation of privacy in his boots that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable. The boots were in the custody of the Richmond City Sheriff pursuant to administrative booking policies and procedures. We hold that when a person, such as the defendant, has been lawfully arrested and his property has been lawfully seized by law enforcement personnel pursuant to that arrest, the arrestee has no reasonable expectation of privacy in that property, and later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>examination of the property by another law enforcement official does not violate the Fourth Amendment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 386, 527 S.E.2d at 136. That Court also found no merit to the defendant\u2019s argument that <em>Edwards </em>was distinguishable because the clothing was being held for a charge other than the murder charge for which it was searched again. It said: \u201cThis distinction is legally insignificant because the dispositive inquiry remains whether the defendant, Williams, had an expectation of privacy in the seized items.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 386 n. 2, 527 S.E.2d at 136 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">In <em>Oles v. State, </em>993 S.W.2d 103 (Tex.Crim.App.1999), eight days after the defendant had been arrested on a motion to revoke probation, an investigator seeking evidence relating to another offense removed the defendant\u2019s clothing that had been inventoried and stored in police custody. Although no forensic evidence was apparent to the naked eye, the investigator brought the clothing to the medical examiner\u2019s office to have it checked for traces of blood. The victim\u2019s blood was discovered on the defendant\u2019s shoes, the evidence was admitted at trial and the defendant was ultimately convicted of murder. The court found, similar to the court in <em>Williams, </em>that the fact that the defendant was arrested and in detention for an offense other than the one for which the investigator was seeking evidence was of no consequence. In addition, that court discussed factors that are commonly applicable to whether an expectation of privacy is legitimate after it stated that several of those factors were inapplicable to this situation in that case, \u201clargely because a jail cell and a storage facility operated by law enforcement are simply not places commonly associated with notions of privacy,\u201d because \u201cthe place \u2018invaded\u2019 is a storage area operated by the officers investigating the accused \u2014 who himself has no ability to enter the area even if he so wanted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 109. In discussing the relevant factors, that court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-7\">\u201cSome of the factors are applicable to this situation, however, such as whether the accused had complete dominion or control and the right to exclude others from his belongings, whether he took normal precautions customarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>taken by those seeking privacy, or whether his claim of privacy is consistent with historical notions of privacy. These factors all weigh against a finding of an expectation of privacy in the present case, but none as strikingly as the one involving historical notions of privacy. <em>No situation imaginable is as alien to the notion of privacy than an arrestee sitting in a jail cell, completely separated from his effects that are lawfully controlled and inventoried by the very police that are investigating him.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">\u201cIt is doubtful in these situations that any appellant would harbor a subjective belief that inventoried items are still private to him. Notwithstanding that improbability, based on the application of the factors described above, it is nearly certain that society would not recognize this belief as objectively reasonable in these situations. This inevitably leads to the conclusion that it is proper for police to examine and test clothing validly within their control and custody, regardless of the existence of probable cause or exigent circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-6\"><em>Id. </em>(citation omitted) (emphasis added) (footnote omitted). The court noted that the defendant could have shown a subjective expectation of privacy by asking a third person to pick up the items for him, but that it was not clear that this would be objectively reasonable. While the petitioner in the case <em>sub judice </em>may have had the opportunity of attempting to have his clothing picked up by a family member, he had not taken advantage of that opportunity at the time of Corporal Harsh\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Several other cases, with slightly different factual situations from the case at bar, similarly hold that a detainee has no reasonable or legitimate expectation of privacy in effects being lawfully held by the police.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See United States v.

Not only was petitioner on notice of a possible police investigation of his clothing and effects, as they were previously inspected on August 20, 1997, pursuant to a legal inventory search, he was well aware that the police had dominion over the clothing and could exclude him from possessing it. So long as it was in police custody, he could not access the property himself and could not exclude others from the property. Petitioner could have requested the release and exchange of his clothing to a third person, but did not. He simply had no control over who viewed his lawfully stored property. Taking all of these facts into account, it strains the imagination to see how a reasonable person would think that an individual would have a privacy interest in visibly stained clothing being held by the police in a jail when the individual had no control over it or who viewed it. As stated by one of our sister courts, \u201c[n]o situation imaginable is as alien to the notion of privacy than an arrestee sitting in a jail cell, completely separated from his effects that are lawfully controlled and inventoried by the very police that are investigating him.\u201d <em>Oles, </em>993 S.W.2d at 109.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>Petitioner, however, argues that the reasoning in <em>Edwards </em>and <em>Holland </em>is distinguishable due to the fact that the items in those cases were collected as evidence for the crimes in which those defendants were being held. This contention has no merit. An officer\u2019s investigatory motive is not an element of the Supreme Court\u2019s test to determine whether an individual has a legitimate expectation of privacy. It is, therefore, in this context, irrelevant. The test deals only with the <em>individual\u2019s, </em>not the police officer\u2019s, subjective expectation of privacy and whether that expectation is a reasonable one. Creating such an artificial distinction turning on whether the evidence was seized or searched for in respect to the incarcerating crime or in respect to a different crime could lead to arbitrary and absurd results.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Again, the essential determination is the reasonableness of the expectation of privacy of the suspect. Other jurisdictions have similarly resolved this issue and refused to accept such a distinction.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Petitioner also argues that the length of time, ten days, between petitioner\u2019s incarceration and Corporal Harsh\u2019s actions are enough to distinguish <em>Edwards </em>and <em>Holland. </em>Generally, the length of time, without more, is of no relevance. Once the expectation of privacy is lawfully lost, it does not exist, unless such an expectation arises again by some subsequent action. It would logically appear that the longer the police had dominion and control over the property, thus excluding a prisoner from that same property, the less reasonable the prisoner\u2019s expectation of privacy in that property would be. Regardless, as we have discussed, the passage of time does not increase one\u2019s expectation of privacy in property held by the police.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This proposition is supported in <em>Ed</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number><em>wards, </em>where the Supreme Court discussed a lower court holding with approval when it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-5\">\u201c[C]ases in the courts of appeals ... have long since concluded that once the accused is lawfully arrested and is in custody, the effects in his possession at the place of detention that were subject to search at the time and place of his arrest may lawfully be searched and seized without a warrant even though a substantial period of time has elapsed between the arrest and subsequent administrative processing, on the one hand, and the taking of the property for use as evidence, on the other. This is true where the clothing or effects are immediately seized upon arrival at the jail, held under the defendant\u2019s name in the \u2018property room\u2019 of the jail, and at a later time searched and taken for use at the subsequent criminal trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-6\"><em>Edwards, </em>415 U.S. at 807, 94 S.Ct. at 1239, 39 L.Ed.2d at 778.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Petitioner, at oral argument, proffered that detainees are not divested of all of their privacy rights because <em>Edwards </em>limited its holding based upon the reasonableness of what occurs. A similar proposition was argued by the defendant in <em>Oles </em>when he argued that the language in <em>Edwards </em>directly following the above quoted language limits its application. <em>Oles, </em>993 S.W.2d at 107 n. 5. The subsequent language referred to in <em>Oles </em>states: \u201cIn upholding this search and seizure, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>we do not conclude that the Warrant Clause of the Fourth Amendment is never applicable to postarrest seizures of the effects of an arrestee.\u201d <em>Edwards, </em>415 U.S. at 808, 94 S.Ct. at 1239, 39 L.Ed.2d at 778. The Supreme Court, however, cited to certain cases when it expressed such concerns \u201cwhich might Violate the dictates of reason either because of their number or their manner of perpetration.\u2019 <em>Charles v. United States, </em>278 F.2d 386, 389(C.A.9), <em>cert denied, </em>364 U.S. 831, 81 S.Ct. 46, 5 L.Ed.2d 59 (1960). <em>Cf. Schmerber v. California, </em>384 U.S. 757, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966); <em>Rochin v. California, </em>342 U.S. 165, 72 S.Ct. 205, 96 L.Ed. 183 (1952).\u201d <em>Edwards, </em>415 U.S. at 808 n. 9, 94 S.Ct. at 1239 n. 9, 39 L.Ed.2d at 778 n. 9. <em>Schmerber </em>and <em>Rochin </em>involve warrantless searches which severely intruded on the physical autonomy of an individual. <em>Schmerber, </em>while permitting the officer\u2019s actions on exigency grounds, was a case in which officers forcibly took a blood sample from an individual, while <em>Rochin </em>was a case where the Supreme Court found a violation of a defendant\u2019s due process rights as the officers\u2019 actions \u201cshocked the conscience\u201d when officers broke into an individual\u2019s home, tackled him and forcibly pumped his stomach. The graphic and abusive intrusions by the officers in those cases highlight the true concerns of the Supreme Court in its qualifying language mentioned above.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Corporal Harsh\u2019s actions in the present case, in no way, reflect the type of actions that \u201cshock the conscience\u201d or which would \u201cviolate the dictates of reason.\u201d In fact, an objective view of Corporal Harsh\u2019s actions illustrate their reasonableness. Once Corporal Harsh realized the possible evidentiary value of the property, he acted to preserve it. He did no more than the officer who viewed the clothing when it was first taken. After comparing witness accounts with the property record, Corporal Harsh was aware that the clothing in the property room was similar to the clothing the suspect in the homicide was alleged to be wearing on the day of the crime he was investigating. As the property was in police possession at the time and the defendant thus had no reasonable expectation of privacy in it, Corporal Harsh had ample <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>cause to immediately search the property for potential evidence. However, Corporal Harsh instead secured the property so that he could obtain the advice of the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office. He actually took the cautious route by not immediately searching the clothing. In essence, his actions were akin to leaving the clothing in the jail side property room and issuing a hold on any possible release. In either case, petitioner\u2019s clothing would have remained in a police custody in one of the property rooms. In addition, only after obtaining a search warrant did the police submit the clothing for testing. The Fourth Amendment\u2019s exclusionary rule\u2019s purpose in deterring police and government misconduct<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> is not violated by an officer who chooses to secure potential evidence already being legally held by the authorities (which he has an immediate right to search), seeks advice from counsel and then further searches the evidence pursuant to a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">In conclusion, we hold that an incarcerated individual, generally, does not have a reasonable or legitimate expectation of privacy in property legally seized and lawfully stored in police custody by law enforcement officials. Subsequent searches or seizures of that property by law enforcement officials normally do not violate that individual\u2019s Fourth Amendment protections.

Mr. Fetterhoff\u2019s wife, Lois Fetterhoff, testified that the car found by police, near the area where Mr. Fetterhoff was found floating, was her husband's car. She testified that the car had no prior blood stains in it and that her husband had his glasses and watch with him at the time he became missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Keisha Russ, a friend of petitioner, testified that petitioner and Clara Miller were attempting to obtain crack cocaine on August 20, 1997. Ms. Miller was driving a gold car with a Pennsylvania license plate, petitioner was in the passenger seat and Mr. Fetterhoff, who Ms. Russ also knew, was in the backseat. Ms. Russ later saw a shirtless petitioner and Ms. Miller at an apartment and petitioner had a bloody rag wrapped around his hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">Sergeant Tom Newton of the Washington County Patrol Division testified that he found an abandoned vehicle, a light gray Ford Tempo, on August 21,1997. He had seen the same car on the morning of August 20, 1997, and observed a white male in his forties or fifties enter and exit the car. The driver of the car was a black male and the passenger was a female.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">Kim Stottlemeyer testified that, while driving, she was stopped by a black male who asked if he could syphon some gasoline. She described the man as wearing a white tee shirt with red stains and that his car was white and contained a female passenger. She later identified petitioner as this man. Robert Kursey testified that, while driving on the same road as Ms. Stottlemeyer, he saw a car in the middle of the road with a black male talking to its driver. The man then approached Mr. Kursey\u2019s tow truck and asked for a ride. Mr. Kursey stated that the man had a bloody white tee shirt wrapped around his hand. Mr. Kursey gave the man and a female a ride into town. He later identified the man as petitioner. Corporal Roy Harsh interviewed Ms. Stottlemeyer and Mr. Kursey in connection with this incident and both witnesses identified the petitioner from a photo array.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">Ultimately, DNA analysis of the blood stains on defendant\u2019s clothing established that the blood belonged to the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">As petitioner is only asking us to address the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress, we consider only those relevant facts brought out during the August 24, 2000 suppression hearing and view them in the light most favorable to the State. <em>See State v.

Searches incident to arrest were discussed by the United States Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>414 U.S. 218, 94 S.Ct. 467, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973). The <em>Robinson </em>Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-10\">\"The authority to search the person incident to a lawful custodial arrest, while <em>based upon the need to disarm and to discover evidence, </em>does not depend on what a court may later decide was the probability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>in a particular arrest situation that weapons or evidence would in fact be found upon the person of the suspect. A custodial arrest of a suspect based on probable cause is a reasonable intrusion under the Fourth Amendment; that intrusion being lawful, a search incident to the arrest requires no additional justification. It is the fact of the lawful arrest which establishes the authority to search, and we hold that in the case of a lawful custodial arrest a full search of the person is not only an exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment, but is also a \u2018reasonable\u2019 search under that Amendment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 235, 94 S.Ct. at 477, 38 L.Ed.2d at 440-41 (emphasis added). <em>See also Chimel v. California, </em>395 U.S. 752, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969); <em>Abel v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 217, 80 S.Ct. 683, 4 L.Ed.2d 668 (1960)(allowing a search of a suitcase that could have been made at the scene of the lawful administrative arrest to be made at a later time in the detention center).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">In <em>Illinois v. Lafayette, </em>462 U.S. 640, 646-47, 103 S.Ct. 2605, 2609-10, 77 L.Ed.2d 65, 71 (1983), the Supreme Court set out the justifications for the \"well-defined\u201d inventory search exception to the Fourth Amendment at station houses as being \"entirely proper for police to remove and list or inventory property found on the person or in the possession of an arrested person who is to be jailed. A range of governmental interests supports an inventory process.\u201d That Court went on to discuss justifications such as securing the prisoner\u2019s property, preventing prison employees from stealing property, silencing arrestee\u2019s false claims of theft, inhibiting the careless handling of property, protecting against the import of weapons into the facility and assisting in the ascertaining of the prisoner\u2019s identity. <em>Id. See also South Dakota </em>v. <em>Opperman, </em>428 U.S. 364, 96 S.Ct. 3092, 49 L.Ed.2d 1000 (1976)(hold-ing that an inventory search of a vehicle lawfully impounded by the police as valid and did not violate the Fourth Amendment).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b120-8\">. The previous robbery victims gave a description of the robbers and the license plate number of the car used in the robbery, which led to Gee as a suspect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b126-8\">. These cases, while having a range of factual scenarios, generally involve \"second look\u201d cases where a law enforcement official effectuates a second look or search of a detainee\u2019s belongings that had been properly inventoried pursuant to a legal search and seizure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b129-5\">. This Court's body of case law regarding legitimate expectations of privacy in the Fourth Amendment context other than in inventory searches supports this position. While none of our cases presented this Court with similar facts as those in the case at bar, they are illustrative that where detainees have severely limited, or no, control over their property, like petitioner in this case, any possible subjective expectation of privacy they have in that property may be clearly outside the boundaries of our notion of what constitutes a reasonable expectation of privacy. <em>See State v.

State, </em>317 Md. 441, 564 A.2d 785 (1989)(holding that the defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in a second work locker at a private business where management could conduct general searches of lockers when they had a reasonable basis to believe that drugs were being used on a certain shift, there were known procedures for such searches, management cut off locks on lockers that periodically needed to be cleaned, the defendant denied use of the second locker as it was company policy to have only one locker).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b130-6\">.
