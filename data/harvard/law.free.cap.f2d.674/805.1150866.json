Marshall, </em>650 F.2d 1055, 1056 (9th Cir. 1981). However, not every employee suffering loss is entitled to benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-24\">One prerequisite is that his employer must have been affected by the expansion. The Act specifies three types of qualifying employers: affected woods employers, affected mill employers, and affected contract employers. \u00a7 201(6). If Wayne Bare Trucking Company qualifies, it is as an \u201caffected- contract employer.\u201d Section 201(9) defines this term to mean:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-25\">an affected employer providing services pursuant to contract with an affected woods employer, if at least 15 per centum of said employer\u2019s employee-hours <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>worked during calendar year 1977 were within or directly related to the expansion area pursuant to such contract or contracts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">The disputed issue is whether the Company satisfied the 15-percent requirement. Appellants contend that the term \u201cdirectly related\u201d means close geographic proximity, though they do not say how close is close enough. They reason that because the Company\u2019s employees worked more than 15 percent of their hours near (but not within) the expansion area, Wayne Bare Trucking Company is an affected contract employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">We reject this interpretation as unreasonable. <em>See Lanning v. Marshall, </em>650 F.2d at 1057-58 n.4; <em>Noble v. Marshall, </em>650 F.2d 1058, 1061 n.8 (9th Cir. 1981). Congress intended to assist those <em>directly </em>affected by the expansion. <em>See </em>H.Rep.No. 581, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 18, <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 463, 464. Indemnification based on the fact that employees worked <em>near </em>the expansion area would not further this purpose. More importantly, giving the statutory language its ordinary meaning, we cannot read the words \u201cdirectly related\u201d to refer to geographic proximity. The direct relationship that seems to be contemplated is between the work itself and the expansion area, <em>regardless of where the work was performed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">The Secretary of Labor has also rejected this type of geographic interpretation. The alternative proffered by the Secretary is that work performed outside the expansion area was \u201cdirectly related\u201d only if it served workers within the area. <em>See, e.g., In re Bailey, </em>No. SF-REPP-2071 (Dep\u2019t of Labor Nov. 10, 1980) (unpublished decision of the Assistant Secretary). We need not pass upon the Secretary\u2019s interpretation in upholding his determination that the employees here do not qualify for the benefits they seek.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b825-26\"> Portions of the Act are codified at 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 79b-79p.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
