It is vague, they claim, because its language is confusing and fails to apprise them and others of what conduct is proscribed by the statute. It is overbroad, they claim, because it proscribes conduct which is protected expression under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>We are presented in these appeals with no other issues, although others were raised in direct appeals to Ohio\u2019s appellate courts, and in the petitions filed in the district courts pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Although each appeal reaches us in a somewhat different posture, each has certain aspects in common with the others. All petitioners were found guilty of a violation of Ohio\u2019s pandering statute, Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2907.32, following jury trials in the Cleveland Municipal Court. Those trials took place before the Supreme Court of Ohio determined that the Ohio statute was neither overbroad nor vague when read in <em>pari materia </em>with the requirements of <em>Miller v. California, </em>413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973). <em>See State v. Ronald Burgun, et al., </em>56 Ohio St.2d 354, 384 N.E.2d 255 (1978).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nonetheless, the trial judge in each trial instructed the jury by reciting the provision of Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7 2907.01(F),. defining \u201cobscene\u201d material or performance, and also by reciting the three basic guidelines in obscenity cases as set forth in <em>Miller.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">All petitioners requested habeas relief following various appeals in the state court system. Habeas relief was granted in four cases and was denied in two cases. Of the four judges of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio considering the issue, two judges (District Judges John M. Manos and Ann Aldrich) concluded that the statute was both over-broad and vague, and two judges (Chief Judge Frank Battisti and Senior District Judge William K. Thomas) concluded that the statute was constitutionally valid. The contrary views are set forth in two opinions written by Judge Manos,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> holding the statute invalid, and in opinion by Senior Judge Thomas, upholding the statute. <em>Turoso v. Cleveland Municipal Court, </em>531 F.Supp. 829 (N.D.Ohio 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">In <em>Ward v. Illinois, </em>431 U.S. 767, 97 S.Ct. 2085, 52 L.Ed.2d 738 (1976), the Supreme Court found that state courts may \u201cauthoritatively construe\u201d an otherwise defective statute to conform to the <em>Miller </em>requirements. Following the guidance of <em>Ward, </em>another panel of this court, of which the writer of this opinion was also a member, has thus specifically upheld the statute in response to claims of facial invalidity due to overbreadth and vagueness. <em>Sovereign News Co. v. </em>Falke, - F.2d - (6th Cir. 1981). The panel found that any infirmities which may exist in the statutory language have been cured by the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s incorporation of the <em>Miller </em>guidelines and examples in <em>Burgun, supra. </em>This holding would appear to lay to rest the issues framed in these appeals as well, since they are similarly limited to questions of constitutional infirmity of the statute as a whole. However, the decision in <em>Sovereign </em>addresses itself only to declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against anticipated but largely unrealized injury. Because these appeals arise in the setting of habeas corpus relief sought after actual conviction for violation of the statute, we discuss the subject more specifically here to highlight problems peculiar to actual prosecutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-12\">Section 2907 of the Ohio Revised Code deals with three categories of sex-related crimes: sexual assaults and displays (Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7\u00a7 2907.02-2907.09); prostitution offenses (Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7\u00a7 2907.21-2907.27); and offenses related to the dissemination of obscenity and matter harmful to juveniles (Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7\u00a7 2907.31-2907.37).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-13\">The four habeas petitioners here were each charged with violation of Ohio Rev. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Code \u00a7 2907.32(A).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Petitioners Lee and Spiker were charged with violation of section 2907.32(A)(4), while petitioners Burgun and Turoso were charged with violating Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7 2907.32(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">The actual instructions given by the state trial judge in each of the underlying state prosecutions leave much to be desired by way of clarity, but it is fair to observe that in each case the jury was instructed as to the basic elements of the crime under which the particular petitioner was charged under Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7 2907.32. The jury was further read the specific definitions of \u201cobscene material or performance,\u201d as contained in Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7 2907.01(F). The jury was also instructed that to convict the particular defendant it must find that the particular material or performance meets the three guidelines of <em>Miller:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-5\">(a) whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">(b) whether the work depicts in a patently offensive way, <em>sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-17\">(e) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-18\"><em>Miller v. California, supra, </em>413 U.S. at 24, 93 S.Ct. at 2614 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-19\">The so-called <em>\u201cMiller </em>examples\u201d were not included by any of the trial court judges in their instructions as illustrations of specific sexual conduct.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7 2907.01 specifically defines \u201csexual conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-20\">As used in section 2907.01 to 2907.37 of the Revised Code:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-21\">(A) \u201cSexual conduct\u201d means vaginal intercourse between a male and a female, and anal intercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete vaginal or anal intercourse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-22\">However, the respective juries received instructions including this definition in only two appeals, Appeal No. 80-3817 (Dalene Burgun) and Appeal No. 81-3127 (William Lee). Thus, although the juries were told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>that they were to find \u201csexual conduct specifically defined by state law,\u201d they were given no such specific definitions in four of six cases. Appeal No. 80-3743 (Turoso I); Appeal No. 80-3742 (Turoso II); Appeal No. 80-3796 (Turoso III); Appeal No. 80-3728 (Laura Spiker).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">A certain amount of obfuscation, in our opinion unnecessary, has arisen, but this is due neither to the statute itself nor to the language of <em>Burgun </em>as contained in its syllabus. Rather, confusion arises from the body of the opinion in <em>Burgun </em>and from the jury instructions, which were impliedly approved by the affirmances of the appeals involved in Burgun.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There appears to have been a tendency in the jury instructions, both in the underlying state criminal trials here and in <em>Burgun, </em>to focus on the definition of \u201cobscene\u201d in subsection (F), without mention of the definition of \u201csexual conduct\u201d in subsection (A). Indeed, the instructions to the jury in appeal No. 80-3742 (Turoso II) expressly refer to the \u201csexual conduct\u201d requirement of the <em>Miller </em>guidelines as being that which the trial judge had just read from subsection (F). This misplaced emphasis could engender confusion. Those federal district judges who granted habeas relief could well have considered those instructions as an indication that the Ohio statute remained vague and overbroad, despite the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s alleged attempt to \u201cauthoritatively construe\u201d it in a manner consistent with <em>Miller.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">Petitioners argue that the statute is vague and overbroad because of, rather than despite, the many specific definitions in the statute. The definition of \u201csexual conduct\u201d in section 2907.01(A), <em>see ante </em>at 489, is only the first of many definitions included in section 2907.01. The others are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-12\">(B) \u201cSexual contact\u201d means any touching of an erogenous zone of another, including without limitation the thigh, genitals, buttock, pubic region, or, if such person is a female, a breast, for the purpose of sexually arousing or gratifying either person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-13\">(C) \u201cSexual activity\u201d means sexual conduct or sexual contact, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-14\">(D) \u201cProstitute\u201d means a male or female who promiscuously engages in sexual activity for hire, regardless of whether the hire is paid to the prostitute or to another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-15\">(E) Any material or performance is \u201charmful to juveniles,\u201d if it is offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community with respect to what is suitable for juveniles, and if any of the following apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-16\">(1) It tends to appeal to the prurient interest of juveniles;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>(2) It contains a display, description, or representation of sexual activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, or nudity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-4\">(3) It contains a display, description, or representation of bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty, or brutality;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-5\">(4) It contains a display, description, or representation of human bodily functions of elimination;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\">(5) It makes repeated use of foul language;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-7\">(6) It contains a display, description, or representation in lurid detail of the violent physical torture, dismemberment, destruction, or death of a human being;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-8\">(7) It contains a display, description, or representation of criminal activity which tends to glorify or glamorize such activity, and which with respect to juveniles has a dominant tendency to corrupt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-9\">(F) When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary adults [sic]. Or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or performance is \u201cobscene\u201d if any of the following apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-10\">(1) Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-11\">(2) Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by display or depicting sexual activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, or nudity in a way which tends to represent human beings as mere objects of sexual appetite;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-12\">(3) Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty, or brutality;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-13\">(4) Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by displaying or depicting human bodily functions of elimination in a way which inspires disgust or revulsion in persons with ordinary sensibilities, without serving any genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral, or artistic purpose;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-16\">(5) It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty, or brutality, or human bodily functions of elimination, the cumulative effect of which is a dominant tendency to appeal to prurient or scatological interest, when the appeal to such interest is primarily for its own sake or for commercial exploitation, rather than primarily for a genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral, or artistic purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-17\">(G) \u201cSexual excitement\u201d means the condition of human male or female genitals when in a state of sexual stimulation or arousal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-18\">(H) \u201cNudity\u201d means the showing, representation, or depiction of human male or female genitals, pubic area, or buttocks with less than a full, opaque covering, or of a female breast with less than a full, opaque covering of any portion thereof below the top of the nipple, or of covered male genitals in a discernibly turgid state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-19\">(I) \u201cJuvenile\u201d means an unmarried person under the age of eighteen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-20\">(J) \u201cMaterial\u201d means any book, magazine, newspaper, pamphlet, poster, print, picture, figure, image, description, motion picture film, phonographic record or tape, or other tangible thing capable of arousing interest through sight, sound, or touch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-21\">(K) \u201cPerformance\u201d means any motion picture, preview, trailer, play, show, skit, dance, or other exhibition performed before an audience.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-22\">The heart of petitioners\u2019 argument is that, when obscenity is defined only with reference to subsection (F), the statute is capable of an unconstitutional application. For example, they claim the statute, as \u201cauthoritatively construed\u201d would permit prosecutions for simple nudity,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as coming within the definition of obscene matter un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>der subsection (F)(2), or it would permit prosecution for depicting \u201cextreme or bizarre violence\u201d under subsection (F)(5), neither of which alone complies with the restrictions in <em>Miller. </em>Petitioners assert that, because the five subsections of subsection (F) are written in the disjunctive, there is no tie-in with the other subsections. Thus, a jury instructed in the way condoned in <em>Burgun </em>could find that the defendants were guilty as charged, even though it might not have believed that the material or performance involved met the tests of <em>Miller.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">These claims have superficial appeal. However, it is unreasonable to consider only discrete sections of the statute in order to determine its validity. The statute must be read in its entirety and, as the Ohio Supreme Court so obviously intended, in <em>pari materia </em>with Miller.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Such a reading discloses that subsection (F) is but one of several requirements necessary to sustain a conviction. In addition to meeting one or more of the five requirements of section 2907.01(F), material must also depict or describe sexual conduct, contact, or activity within the meaning of section 2907.01(A)-(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">Alternatively, the material at issue must both satisfy one or more of the definitions of section (F) and comport with one of the <em>Miller </em>examples in order to satisfy <em>Miller. </em>Although no jury in the underlying state criminal proceedings here was advised that specific sexual conduct included the <em>Miller </em>examples, the Supreme Court of Ohio appears to have construed the former and nearly identical obscenity statute to encompass the <em>Miller </em>examples. <em>See State ex rel. Keating v. Vixen, </em>35 Ohio St.2d 215, 301 N.E.2d 880 (1973)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, the publish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>ed order of affirmance by our court in <em>Sovereign News, supra, </em>recognizes that those examples were adopted by reference in <em>Burgun, </em>a conclusion reached as well by Judge Thomas in his opinion in appeal No. 80-3696 (Turoso III).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">As a result, a potential defendant has definite standards by which he can evaluate any material at issue. For example, one who finds himself charged with pandering obscenity by selling obscene material will first read section 2907.32(A)(2) for the essential elements of the offense. He can then refer to section 2907.01 for a definition of \u201cobscene,\u201d or of any other term with a specific meaning under the statute. Knowing also that the Ohio Supreme Court has construed the statute as incorporating the guidelines of <em>Miller v. California, </em>he will know its three requirements must be proved <em>in addition </em>to the elements of obscenity listed in section 2907.01(F). Therefore, under the statute \u201cas written and authoritatively construed,\u201d it is incumbent upon the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-6\">(a) The material depicts conduct which is sexual; that is, it depicts vaginal intercourse or any of the other explicit examples expressly set forth in the definition of sexual conduct in section 2907.01(A), or one of the two examples of such conduct as described in <em>Miller;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-7\">(b) the sexual conduct depicted is obscene, as that term is expressly defined in section 2907.01(F)(l)-(5); <em>and</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-8\">(c) the material meets the three guidelines of <em>Miller, </em>in that (1) when taken as a whole and applying contemporary community standards, it appeals to the prurient interests of the average person; (2) it depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, the sexual conduct specifically defined in section 2907.01(A) or in the examples of <em>Miller; </em>and (3) taken as a whole, it lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">The foregoing seems to us the most logical, natural and also literal construction of the Ohio statute, construed <em>in pari materia </em>with <em>Miller. </em>It is true that, taken alone, certain of the disjunctive definitions of \u201cobscene\u201d in section 2907.01(F) may appear to apply only to protected activity, such as simple nudity and violence. Similarly, it is possible that a reading of both <em>Miller </em>and the statute creates redundancies and sur-plusage. This result can be avoided in each particular case with careful jury instructions. More important, it is not for our court to determine that a better statute could be devised. Rather, it is our function to follow the Supreme Court\u2019s finding that state statutes dealing with obscenity can be upheld where their authoritative judicial construction has made them conform to <em>Miller. Miller, supra, </em>413 U.S. at 24, n.8, 25, 93 S.Ct. at 2614, 2615; <em>Ward v. Illinois, </em>431 U.S. 767, 97 S.Ct. 2085, 52 L.Ed.2d 738 (1977). Defendants can determine that the material must depict explicit sexual conduct as defined in the statute, that the sexual conduct must also meet one or more of the definitions of \u201cobscene\u201d in the Ohio statute, and that all three of the <em>Miller </em>guidelines must be met in order to convict him. Thus, there can be no prosecution for simple nudity, nor for violence or bizarre conduct alone. As a result, there can be no claim of over-breadth on that account, nor is the statute vague as leaving uncertainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-11\">As we have mentioned earlier, the instructions given in the underlying criminal prosecutions in the Cleveland Municipal Court varied in their form from that outlined above. All included a reading of the entire definition of \u201cobscene\u201d contained in section 2907.01(F); however, only two included a reading of the definition of \u201csexual conduct\u201d contained in section 2907.01(A). None included the <em>Miller </em>examples.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-12\">In no case is it claimed that the particular material or performance did not, in fact, depict sexual conduct specifically included in the statutory definition. In fact, there is no claim that such an instruction (or indeed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>any other definition which the particular case might appear to make desirable) was requested and refused. It is obvious to us that if a jury is advised that material must depict sexual conduct \u201cspecifically defined by applicable state law,\u201d good sense suggests that the specific definition be given. It is also apparent that if confusion existed, it was wholly avoidable by a straightforward application of the statute and of <em>Miller. </em>If such confusion had been seen as prejudicial by the defendants in the criminal proceedings, it could easily have been corrected or could have been made the subject of appropriate objection on appeal within the state system. It seems equally clear to us, from the graphic descriptions of the material involved, that these cases concern what is commonly known as hard core pomographical material. It so obviously fits within the appropriate definitions of \u201cobscene materials\u201d that any further or more explicit definitions could only have reinforced the likelihood of conviction. It is thus difficult to believe that any failure to object or to raise such issues before us was an oversight. Obviously, the petitioners here have realized that their best, and probably only effective, defense lay in persuading the courts that the statute was altogether void. Anything short of that finding would at best lead to a grant of a conditional writ, retrial under even less favorable but completely lawful instructions, and, once more, convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">In his written opinion filed in the appeal of Frank Turoso, Appeal No. 80-3696 (Tu-roso III), United States District Judge William K. Thomas noted that the jury instruction involved therein included neither the <em>Miller </em>\u201cexamples\u201d nor the definition of \u201csexual conduct\u201d of section 2907.01(A). <em>Tu-roso, supra, </em>at 838. Judge Thomas\u2019 observations explain both the nature of the problems in these appeals and the reason why they do not reach constitutional proportions. He indicates further that omissions in the jury instructions do not require holding the entire statute unconstitutional, the sole legal ruling sought here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-5\">In his recommended report, the magistrate noted that the court (Judge Calan-dra) did not define sexual conduct in terms of the two examples in <em>Miller </em>[413 U.S.], at p.25 [93 S.Ct. at p.2615], nor did the court define sexual conduct as it appears in Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2907.01(A). The magistrate then concluded:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">Since the court instructions did not define the sexual conduct to be restricted with the requisite specificity, the instructions were unconstitutionally overbroad. <em>Sovereign News Co., supra, </em>at p. 400.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">Thereupon he recommended that the petition for a writ of habeas corpus be granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-9\">Immediately before Judge Calandra gave his general instructions to the jury, he informed defense counsel that he would \u201ccharge the jury on the <em>Miller </em>case and the <em>Smith </em>case and the <em>Burgen (sic) </em>case.\u201d As the quoted portions of Judge Calandra\u2019s instructions indicate, he gave the jury the <em>Miller </em>guidelines. Following the completion of the general instructions, there was a discussion at the bench about several matters. At that time, defense counsel did not ask the judge to add the <em>Miller </em>\u201cexamples\u201d to the court\u2019s instructions on the <em>Miller </em>guidelines. Thus defendant did not ask the court to give to the jury the <em>Miller </em>\u201cexamples.\u201d Moreover, defendant did not object to the giving of the <em>Miller </em>guidelines without the <em>Miller </em>\u201cexamples.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-10\">In <em>Henderson v. Kibbe, </em>431 U.S. 145, 154-55, 97 S.Ct. 1730, 1736-1737, 52 L.Ed.2d 203 (1977), the Court reversed a decision of the Second Circuit wherein a divided panel had granted a state prisoner\u2019s petition for habeas corpus on the ground that a New York state trial judge\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on the issue of causation was constitutional error. The Court observed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-11\">Orderly procedure requires that the respective adversaries\u2019 views as to how the jury should be instructed be presented to the trial judge in time to enable him to deliver an accurate charge and to minimize the risk of committing reversible error.

The question in such a collateral proceeding is \u201cwhether the ailing instruction by itself so infected the entire trial that the resulting conviction violates due process,\u201d <em>Cupp v. Naughten, </em>414 U.S. [144] at 147 [94 S.Ct. 396, at 400, 38 L.Ed.2d 368], not merely whether \u201cthe instruction is undesirable, erroneous, or even \u2018universally condemned\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-7\"><em>Id., </em>at 146 [94 S.Ct., at 400],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-8\">This controlling rule of federal habeas corpus law differs from the magistrate\u2019s recommended ruling, isolating, as he did, the judge\u2019s instructions from the rest of the trial and determining that the court\u2019s instructions were unconstitutionally incomplete. However, the question in this federal habeas corpus proceeding is not whether Judge Calandra\u2019s instruction to the jury, <em>sans </em>a definition of \u201csexual conduct\u201d in terms of the two examples in <em>Miller </em>[413 U.S.], at p.25 [93 S.Ct. at p.2615], nor \u201c. .. as it appears in O.R.C. 2907.01(A),\u201d rendered the \u201cinstructions ... unconstitutionally overbroad.\u201d The question rather is whether the instruction without such definition of sexual conduct \u201cso infected the entire trial that the resulting conviction violates due process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ArI\"><em>Id. </em>at 838-839.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">The foregoing comments apply with equal force to each of the appeals consolidated here, and no effort is made by the parties to assert any meaningful distinction between them individually. There is no evidence in petitioners\u2019 briefs or the records below that any trial was so tainted by a failure to instruct properly that due process was violated. Thus, habeas relief is unwarranted. <em>See Long v.

It has thus made clear its commitment to the protection of First Amendment expression. Petitioners assert that the court\u2019s \u201cauthoritative construction\u201d of the obscenity statute falls short of meeting the <em>Miller </em>standards, offering as evidence both the implicit approval of potentially defective jury instructions in <em>Burgun, supra, </em>and the alleged insensitivity to the <em>Miller </em>requirements in <em>State ex rel. Keating v.

In our view, Judge Merritt\u2019s dissent completely misses the point of the majority decision here, in <em>Sovereign News v. Falke, supra, </em>and in the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Burgun. </em>That is, of course, that the First Amendment continues to protect expression in Ohio unless it falls within the permissible limits of <em>Miller v. California. </em>Judge Merritt\u2019s unhappiness, therefore, is of necessity with <em>Miller. </em>It has to be manifestly clear that whatever \u201cconduct\u201d the Ohio statute proscribes must perforce come within <em>Miller </em>or it is protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">Judge Merritt\u2019s speculations concerning the fate of great works of art in Europe, under Ohio\u2019s statute are therefore without basis. Meanwhile, back in the Cleveland Municipal Court, the battle bears faint resemblance to that fought in the dissent. According to the evidence in <em>Turoso I, </em>for example, the following is part of an unchallenged description of an 8 mm. film which incurred the charges and brought about the conviction complained of in that appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-8\">[Participants are two males and two females. One of the females is committing fellatio on the two males at the same time. [The movie] then shows the two males jacking off and the female lying down in front of them licking her lips. After a time one of the males ejaculates into her mouth and on the chin. The other female then licks the chin and kisses the above mentioned female. She then commits fellatio on the male that hasn\u2019t ejaculated yet. While she is doing this the other males and female and [sic] playing with her vagina. The female then commits cunnilingus on her. Then the other male ejaculates into the mouth of the female. The two females then kiss and embrace again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-12\">Appeal No. 80-3743 (Turoso I), Joint Appendix at 22.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b512-13\">.

Our Court treats this as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>just another criminal statutory construction case and tries to perform radical surgery on the statute in order to save it and the state convictions based on it. But this is a statute outlawing speech and artistic expression; it requires a more sensitive reading of the First Amendment than our Court has given. Unlike the relatively healthy state statute saved in <em>Ward v. Illinois </em>by insertion of a <em>Miller </em>pacemaker, the heart of the Ohio statute in question here is malignant. A <em>Miller </em>pacemaker will not regulate it. If our Court\u2019s opinion stands as the law of obscenity, then all state obscenity statutes will be upheld as valid, no matter how broadly or specifically they censor protected speech, so long as the <em>Miller </em>standards are repeated to the jurors after they are instructed to apply the unconstitutional statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">The Illinois statute in <em>Ward </em>was a general, single-shot provision outlawing material when \u201cits predominant appeal is to prurient interest.\u201d The Ohio statute has more than thirty specific sections and subsections that cover the waterfront. The heart of the statute is section E with seven subsections and section F with five. Section E, relating to juvenile material, covers everything from \u201cbizarre violence,\u201d \u201cfoul language,\u201d \u201cphysical torture\u201d and \u201cdeath\u201d to \u201cnudity\u201d and \u201csexual excitement.\u201d Under Section F, and the jury instructions approved by our Court today, a defendant can be convicted of pandering adult obscenity and go to jail, for displaying or depicting \u201c[1] sexual excitement or [2] nudity in a way which tends to represent human beings as mere objects of sexual appetite ... [or 8] bestiality or [4] extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality ... or [5] depicting human bodily functions of elimination in a way which inspires disgust or revulsion in persons with ordinary sensibilities .... \u201d Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7 2907.01(F). \u201cBestiality\u201d and other similar ideas are not defined but obscene \u201cnudity\u201d consists of \u201cshowing ... [1] male or female genitals, [2] pubic area, or [3] buttocks with less than a full, opaque covering or, [4] of a female breast with less than a full opaque covering of any portion thereof below the top of the nipple . . .. \u201d Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7 2907.01(H). These provisions are the heart of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Under the statutory scheme and jury instructions approved by us today, Phidias and Praxiteles would be condemned not to a cup of hemlock, along with Socrates, but to languish in an Ohio jail along with the creators of most Greek statues of Aphrodite, Hermes, Apollo and the Satyrs. For these sculptors \u201cdisplayed\u201d genitals, buttocks and female breasts \u201cbelow the top of the nipple\u201d \u201cwith less than a full, opaque covering.\u201d The Parthenon frieze of Phidias has for over 2500 years withstood wind and storm and bombings and invasions by Persians, Spartans, Romans, Ottoman Turks and German artillery, but its marble nudity and magnificent depiction of \u201cbizarre violence\u201d could not withstand the onslaught of the righteous of Ohio. Michelangelo\u2019s ceiling twenty centuries later in the Sistine Chapel would now have to come down for the larger-than-life genitals and buttocks of Adam are clearly \u201cdisplayed\u201d as God reaches out his finger to instill life in the first man. The creation could not have taken place in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Moreover, since relieving oneself of body fluid is also \u201cobscene\u201d in Ohio, the creator of the famous sculpture of the little boy in Brussels, who performs for all to see function # 1 in a pond, would unfortunately have to go to jail, and the little boy of bronze, in order to escape the sledge- hammer of the godly, would have to place over his genital region not merely a fig leaf but nothing less than a \u201cfull opaque covering.\u201d The Pope would even have to remove from Ohio the Vatican Museum with its many fearsome statues, friezes and pictures showing \u201cbestial\u201d and \u201cbizarre\u201d battles of an extremely violent nature between animals and animal-like humans.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">If you believe that all this is a dissenter\u2019s exaggeration and that the authorities in Ohio would not really countenance under this statute the suppression of such works of art, I admonish you to read <em>State of Ohio ex rel. Keating v. \u201cVixen,\u201d </em>35 Ohio St.2d 215, 301 N.E.2d 880 (1973), the response of the Ohio Supreme Court to the action of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>United States Supreme Court, 413 U.S. 905, 93 S.Ct. 3033, 37 L.Ed.2d 1016 (1973), vacating the state court\u2019s earlier decision in 27 Ohio St.2d 278, 272 N.E.2d 137 (1971), in light of <em>Miller. </em>The state court, purporting to apply <em>post-Miller </em>standards, finds the film in question obscene under the statute after describing it as follows: \u25a0</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-6\">The principal character, Vixen, is a buxom young wife, whose \u2018square\u2019 husband is a combination pilot and fishing guide in the wilderness of British Columbia. His work keeps him away from their home for extended periods of time. Among the other characters are Vixen\u2019s motorcycle hood brother, a Canadian Mountie, with whom Vixen passes the first few minutes of the film, a vacationing couple who are guest-clients of the husband, a black American whom Vixen despises and who has fled the country to avoid the draft, and an Irish communist who attempts at gun-point to force Vixen\u2019s husband to fly him to Cuba. The first four are objects of Vixen\u2019s lechery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-7\">The movie is approximately 70 minutes long, out of which approximately one-half deals with incest, adultery, and lesbianism, which are graphically portrayed through facial and bodily expressions indicative of orgasmic reaction. The remaining one-half of the movie leads the viewer through such contemporary issues as racism, anti-militarism, communism and airplane hijacking. <em>It should be noted that, although the players are frequently shown nude and at full length, at no place are their genital parts exposed to the leering lens of the camera. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">272 N.E.2d at 139. Although this movie may not be a work of art, it is far from hard core pornography.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On the next page of the opinion, the Ohio Supreme Court explains that just one sex scene would make even \u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d obscene and subject to prior injunctive restraint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APh\">Assume, hypothetically that the main character in \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 performs during one scene, an act of sexual lewdness, could we permit that part of the film to go unregulated merely because the producer had an \u2018eye on the recent Supreme Court rulings?\u2019 The question supplies its own answer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-11\">In the end, however, the'situation is not touched with much humor. Books are being confiscated and people going to jail for speech under a statutory scheme that clearly and patently contravenes the First Amendment. As District Judges Manos and Aldrich state so cogently, all the Supreme Court of Ohio has done is simply add the <em>Miller </em>standards as a new, alternative method of sending people to prison while leaving in effect alongside it the old unconstitutional method outlawing graphic expression of \u201csexual excitement,\u201d \u201cnudity,\u201d \u201cbizarre violence\u201d and \u201chuman bodily functions.\u201d It is impossible to tell in these cases whether the jury convicted and the Ohio courts imprisoned the defendants because they violated the old unconstitutional statutory provisions or the new <em>Miller </em>standards. The juries in these cases were given all of the alternatives in the disjunctive and were not required to state which of the several standards they applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-12\">Our system of criminal justice cannot live with the underlying principle enunciated today in this case by our Court: a man\u2019s conviction for speech is valid under a patently unconstitutional law so long as the state could, theoretically, have repealed the old law and drafted another, more narrow, valid statute that .proscribes the same speech. Our system cannot live with this principle because it violates due process and creates the offense ex post facto. The opinion of the court also violates principles of federalism. We have the authority to review and declare invalid state laws which abridge the First Amendment, but we are not authorized to repeal their statutes and reenact them to suit ourselves. And even more to the point, if we are going to presume to enact new laws for the states rath<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>er than simply review judicially the ones they have, we should at least enact valid laws for them. The one we have pieced together here still outlaws nudity, bizarre violence, foul language, torture, death and the \u201cglorification\u201d of sex and many other materials protected by the First Amendment. It violates the basic principle laid down in <em>Cohen v. California, </em>403 U.S. 15,26, 91 S.Ct. 1780, 1788, 29 L.Ed.2d 284 (1971) that the First Amendment protects the \u201cemotive function\u201d as well as \u201ccognitive content\u201d and the principle that First Amendment protection of artistic materials is \u201cnot lessened by the fact that they are designed to entertain as well as inform.\u201d <em>Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, </em>343 U.S. 495, 72 S.Ct. 777, 96 L.Ed. 1098 (1952).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b517-9\">.
