The record lacks a transcript, and is highly bobtailed. Except that it appears that the purchases were made from government agents, nothing is shown with respect to the circumstances of the transactions, the nature of the inducement, or the defendants\u2019 willingness. It is conceded that for the purposes of the motions for acquittal we must take defendants\u2019 predisposition as established. FRAP 10(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Admitted predisposition means that the case \u201cdoes not qualify as one involving \u2018entrapment\u2019 at all.\u201d <em>Hampton v. United States, </em>1976, 425 U.S. 484, 489, 96 S.Ct. 1646, 1649, 48 L.Ed.2d 113 (Rehnquist, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and White, J.); <em>see id. </em>at 492 n.2, 96 S.Ct. at 1651 n.2 (Powell, J., joined by Blackmun, J., concurring in the judgment). The cases upon which defendants rely for a rule of entrapment per se when the government supplies the unlawfully possessed goods, <em>e.g., United States v. Bueno, </em>5 Cir., 1971, 447 F.2d 903, <em>cert. denied, </em>411 U.S. 949, 93 S.Ct. 1931, 36 L.Ed.2d 411; <em>United States v. West, </em>3 Cir., 1975, 511 F.2d 1083, were effectively overruled by <em>Hampton. See United States v. Hill, </em>5 Cir., 1980, 626 F.2d 1301, 1307. Nevertheless, according to a differently composed majority of the <em>Hampton </em>Court there remains the issue whether the government agents\u2019 participation in the offense was so \u201coutrageous,\u201d or \u201coffensive,\u201d as to require reversal under the due process clause, or by virtue of our supervisory powers. 425 U.S., ante, at 491-95, 96 S.Ct. at 1650-52 (Powell, J., joined by Blackmun, J.); <em>id. </em>at 495-500, 96 S.Ct. at 1652-55 (Brennan, J., joined by Stewart and Marshall, JJ.); <em>see United States v. Caron, </em>1 Cir., 1980, 615 F.2d 920, 921; <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>1 Cir., 1977, 565 F.2d 179, 181-82, <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1075, 98 S.Ct. 1264, 55 L.Ed.2d 780.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">This issue is presented neat \u2014 the officers participated to the extent of supplying the food stamps, cumulatively worth some $20,-000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We do not find this participation intolerable. In <em>Hampton </em>an undercover government agent supplied a predisposed defendant with heroin to sell to another undercover agent. Even the two justices, Justice Powell, joined by Justice Blackmun, who would not subscribe to the plurality opinion\u2019s assertion that, given predisposition, there never could be a violation of due process, declined to hold that merely supplying the drug was constitutionally offensive. At the same time, we note that Justice Powell felt, 425 U.S., ante, at 495 n.7, 96 S.Ct. at 1652 n.7, that possibly greater involvement was permissible in drug cases because of the seriousness of the traffic, and the difficulty of apprehending offenders. <em>See also United States v. Russell, </em>1973, 411 U.S. 423, 432, 93 S.Ct. 1637, 1643, 36 L.Ed.2d 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">Food stamps are not drugs. However, from the very fact that they are freely possessed and redeemed, and go through many hands, apprehension of parties whose possession or transfer is unlawful only for perhaps non-obvious reasons may be particularly difficult. Under these circumstances the most effective way to catch and deter retailers or others who would deal in bulk in stolen food stamps may be for the government itself to provide the stamps to the willing buyers. A defendant who is predisposed to purchase stamps wholesale is a much more serious criminal than are individual misusers. We see nothing outrageous in the government\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">Defendants\u2019 second objection is to the court\u2019s charge on entrapment. This accorded with our decision in <em>Kadis v. United States, </em>1 Cir., 1967, 373 F.2d 370, holding that predisposition and inducement were not to be bifurcated, but were to be considered together. The court said, <em>inter alia,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-12\">\u201cWhere a person would not have otherwise violated the law, but is induced or persuaded by law enforcement officers or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>their agents to commit a crime, he is a victim of entrapment, and the law as a matter of policy forbids his conviction in such a case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-4\">\u201cOn the other hand, where a person already has the readiness and willingness to break the law, the mere fact that government agents provide what appears to be a favorable opportunity is not entrapment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-5\">\u201cIf you should find beyond a reasonable doubt .. . that, <em>at the time of the commission of the alleged offenses .. . </em>the defendants ... were ready and willing to commit offenses such as are charged in the indictment, when the opportunity was afforded, and that government officers or their agents did no more than offer the opportunity, then you should find that the ... defendants were not victims of entrapment.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Defendants seize on the court\u2019s reference to the \u201ctime of the commission\u201d of the offenses, asserting that this could cause the jury to inquire into their mental states after, rather than before, the inducement. Standing alone, the point might be well taken. Obviously, an entrapped defendant will always be willing and ready to commit the offense after the inducement and immediately before the crime\u2019s commission. However, in several other places the court made clear the necessity for finding a predisposition to commit the crime apart from any governmental persuasion. We particularly like the court\u2019s distinguishing hesitation motivated by a consciousness of the upright from that due to the circumspection of a law violator. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"AqO\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b154-17\">. \u201cWhoever knowingly uses, transfers, acquires, alters, or possesses coupons ... in any manner not authorized by this chapter or the regulations issued pursuant to this chapter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>shall, if such coupons . .. are of the value of $100 or more, be guilty of a felony</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b155-14\">.
