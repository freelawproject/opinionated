This question has created much conflict among bankruptcy judges and district courts throughout the nation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The only other court of appeals that has considered the issue has answered it in the negative, <em>Cross Electric, Inc. v. United States, </em>664 F.2d 1218 (4 Cir. 1981). The issue is of importance to the successful reorganization of debtors, on the one hand, and to the interest of the United States in the quick collection of tax revenues, on the other. We find the issue more difficult than did the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and, conceding the question to be a close one, reach an opposite result.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-20\">Whiting Pools, Inc. (Whiting), the debtor, was in the business of selling, installing and servicing swimming pool equipment and supplies. On January 14, 1981, the IRS, acting pursuant to IRC \u00a7 6331, seized all of Whiting\u2019s tangible property, including equipment, vehicles, inventory, office equipment and supplies, at its place of business in the Western District of New York. The estimated worth of the seized property in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>the hands of Whiting as a going concern was $162,876. The lien of the IRS was for some $92,000, plus interest, in unpaid withholding and Federal Insurance Contributions Act taxes. Testimony taken before the bankruptcy judge indicated that sale of the property by the IRS would net a maximum of $80,000 to $35,000, with a more probable recovery in the neighborhood of $20,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">On the day following the IRS levy Whiting filed a petition under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and was continued as a debtor in possession, \u00a7 1101(1). A month later the United States initiated an adversary proceeding under \u00a7 362(d) of the Code in which it sought a determination that the automatic stay provisions of \u00a7 362 were inapplicable to it or, in the alternative, for relief from the stay to permit it to sell the property. It alleged that storing the property was costing $2,500 per month. Whiting\u2019s answer contained a counterclaim asking that the IRS be required to turn over the property pursuant to \u00a7 542 of the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Bankruptcy Judge Hayes, after holding hearings, delivered an opinion, 10 B.R. 755 (Bkrtcy.W.D.N.Y.1981), in which he concluded that the automatic stay provided in \u00a7 362 was applicable to the IRS \u2014 a conclusion which is not disputed here. Examining \u00a7 362(d), which directs the bankruptcy court to grant relief from such a stay under certain circumstances,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the judge found that such relief could not be granted under \u00a7 362(d)(2) since the debtor had an equity in the property and the property was \u201cabsolutely necessary to an effective reorganization of the debtor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 757. Turning back to \u00a7 362(d)(1), the judge concluded that while the best interests of the United States would be served by a reorganization, for which he thought there was a reasonable chance, and the Government could be adequately protected while the reorganization proceeding was pending, it made \u201clittle sense to continue the stay unless a turnover of property\u201d, <em>id., </em>could lawfully be directed. He thus reached what both parties concede to be the crucial issue, namely, whether it could be.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-17\">We set forth in the margin the sections of the Bankruptcy Code which must be construed in deciding that question.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although Whiting had sought a turnover under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>\u00a7 542, the bankruptcy judge was precluded from granting relief under that section by the decision of District Judge Elfvin in the Western District of New York in <em>In re Avery Health Center, Inc., </em>8 B.R. 1016 (D.C.W.D.N.Y.1981), with which he seemingly disagreed. Believing that the turnover powers formerly provided in proceedings under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act by the last sentence of \u00a7 257,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> see <em>Reconstruction Finance Corp. v. Kaplan, </em>185 F.2d 791, 795 (1 Cir. 1950), must have gone somewhere, he found them in \u00a7 543(b), reading the definition of \u201ccustodian\u201d in \u00a7 101(10), mor\u00e9 particularly the reference to an \u201cagent\u201d, as including the IRS, 10 B.R. at 759. After noting the anomaly that \u00a7 543 seems to permit a turnover without providing for the protection that would be required by reading \u00a7\u00a7 363(e) and 542 together&gt; he directed the turnover on the conditions set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ard\">The district court, 15 B.R. 270, reversed. It adhered to its previous decision in <em>In re </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number><em>Avery Health Center, Inc., supra, </em>concerning \u00a7 542, and rejected the bankruptcy judge\u2019s theory that the IRS was an \u201cagent\u201d under \u00a7 101(10)(C) and thus a \u201ccustodian\u201d under \u00a7 543. It considered that \u201cthe concept of agency entails a fiduciary relationship arising out of an express or implied contract between the principal and the agent,\u201d and that the IRS, when making a levy under IRC \u00a7 6331, did not fill such a role. The court remanded the case to the bankruptcy court to determine whether the stay of the IRS\u2019s proposed sale should be lifted. Whiting appealed to this court, and the bankruptcy court declined to take action upon the remand pending our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">I. <em>Section 543</em></p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The definition of \u201ccustodian\u201d in \u00a7 101(10) finds an antecedent in \u00a7 2(a)(21) of the former Bankruptcy Act, which required, under certain circumstances, delivery of property by \u201creceivers or trustees appointed in proceedings not under this Act, assignees for the benefit of creditors, and agents authorized to take possession of or to liquidate a person\u2019s property.\u201d The definition of custodian in \u00a7 101(10) appears in H.R. 8200, 95th Cong., 1st Sess., as reported by the House Committee on the Judiciary on September 8, 1977, H.R.Rep. No. 95-595, U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1978, p. 5787, with a comment which we reproduce in the margin.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The same definition and comment can be found in S. 2266, 95th Cong.2d Sess. and in S.Rep.No. 95-989, p. 23, U.S.Code Cong. <em>&amp; </em>Admin.News 1978, pp. 5787, 5809. These shed little light on the meaning of the phrase \u201cor agent under applicable law, or under a contract\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Since \u00a7 101(10)(A) and (B) include two of the categories described in \u00a7 2(a)(21) of the previous Act, \u00a7 101(10)(C) must have been intended to include and possibly broaden what had been covered by \u00a7 2(a)(21)\u2019s phrase, \u201cagents authorized to take possession of or to liquidate a person\u2019s property\u201d. Seemingly it embraces the case of an agent appointed or authorized by a debtor to take charge of property for the purpose of enforcing a lien of a particular creditor, but see, <em>contra, In re Lewis, </em>12 B.R. 106, 108-09 (Bkrtcy.M.D.Ga.1981), which may not have been true under \u00a7 2(a)(21) of the previous Act. <em>Compare </em>1 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 2.78, at 390.23 n.35 (14th ed.) <em>with In re Rosenberg, </em>128 F.2d 924 (7 Cir. 1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">Here there is no doubt that the IRS is \u201cauthorized to take charge of property of the debtor for the purpose of enforcing a lien against ... property\u201d of the debtor. However, the definition of \u201ccustodian\u201d does not include anyone who is so authorized but only a person who acts as a trustee, receiver, or agent. Admittedly the IRS is not a trustee or receiver. No one would characterize it as the taxpayer\u2019s agent as a matter of ordinary English speech. The Restatement of Agency 2d, \u00a7 1 (1958) defines agency as \u201cthe fiduciary relation which results from the manifestation of consent by one person to another that the other shall act on his behalf and subject to his control, and consent by the other so to act.\u201d See also Restatement of Agency 2d, \u00a7 1, Comment, at pp. 8-9 (1958). Seizure of property by the IRS under IRC \u00a7 6331 is not pursuant to a consensual relationship but is imposed by law irrespective of and generally contrary to the taxpayer\u2019s desires. It is true that a person may be an agent under \u00a7 101(10)(C) when the relationship is created by law rather than by contract, but it would be a strained reading to interpret this as including the IRS, the archetypical \u201cadverse claimant\u201d, see <em>Phelps v. United States, </em>421 U.S. 330, 334, 95 S.Ct. 1728, 1731, 44 L.Ed.2d 201 (1975).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>immaterial that the IRS has certain responsibilities, such as giving notice of seizure and sale and accounting for any surplus.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">Beyond this, in determining the meaning of \u201ccustodian\u201d as used in \u00a7 543, it is necessary to consider the other provisions of the Code. One of these is \u00a7 543(c), which requires the bankruptcy court to provide a custodian with \u201creasonable compensation for services rendered and costs and expenses incurred.\u201d We can think of no reason why Congress would have chosen to provide the IRS with reasonable compensation, as distinguished from reimbursement of expenses, see IRC \u00a7 6342(a)(1), for its efforts to dismember the debtor\u2019s estate in its own interest. Moreover, as Bankruptcy Judge Hayes noted below, 10 B.R. at 760, \u00a7 542\u2019s explicit reference to \u00a7 363, and thereby to the adequate protection requirements of \u00a7 361, suggests that \u00a7 542 is a \u201cmore appropriate section\u201d, 10 B.R. at 760, than \u00a7 543 for resolving turnover disputes involving secured creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">We therefore conclude that the district judge correctly decided that \u00a7 543 afforded no basis for a turnover order, and must consider whether he was also correct in his earlier ruling in <em>In re Avery Health Center, Inc., supra, </em>8 B.R. 1016, to which he adhered in this case, that no basis was furnished by \u00a7 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">II. <em>Section 542 </em>\u2014 Turnover <em>Generally</em></p>\n<p id=\"Azn\">Determination whether \u00a7 542 is here applicable requires consideration of several sections of the Code. Section 542 requires the turnover \u201cof property that the trustee may use, sell or lease under section 363. ... \u201d Section 363(c)(1) directs that in a Chapter 11 proceeding the trustee, without notice or a hearing, may use, sell or lease \u201cproperty of the estate\u201d in the ordinary course of business, but \u00a7 363(e) requires that \u201con request of an entity that has an interest in property used, sold, or leased, or proposed to be used, sold, or leased, by the trustee, the court shall prohibit or condition such use, sale, or lease as is necessary to provide adequate protection of such interest.\u201d Section 541(a)(1) provides that, with exceptions not here relevant, an estate is comprised of \u201call legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">The Government argues that the plain meaning of these sections mandates an answer in its favor. Relying on several decisions in the district and bankruptcy courts, see footnote 1, <em>supra, </em>the Government finds in \u00a7 541\u2019s definition of \u201cproperty of the estate\u201d a distinction between a debtor\u2019s <em>interests in property </em>and <em>property in which the debtor has an interest. </em>The Government, Brief at 17, then advances the following general interpretation of the Code\u2019s turnover provision: \u201cthe \u2018property of the estate\u2019 which must be delivered to the trustee ... by virtue of Section 542(a) consists only of any interests in property belonging to the debtor as of the time of its filing of a petition\u201d in bankruptcy. The Government concludes that, at the commencement of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>case, the debtor\u2019s only interests in the property seized by the IRS were those explicitly set forth in \u00a7 6331 <em>et seq. </em>of the IRC,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that therefore only these interests became part of the \u201cproperty of the estate\u201d, and that turnover of these interests would be inappropriate since the debtor cannot \u201cuse, sell, or lease\u201d them. Brief at 7, 18-19. All other interests in the seized property, in particular the right to possession, are argued to be held by the IRS. The Government draws on several general statements in the Code\u2019s legislative history to support its contention.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Although there is some force in the Government\u2019s construction of \u00a7\u00a7 542, 541 and 363, we ultimately must reject it. Justice Cardozo, interpreting one of the predecessors of the Code in <em>Duparquet Huot &amp; Moneuse Co. v. Evans, </em>297 U.S. 216, 218, 56 S.Ct. 412, 413, 80 L.Ed. 591 (1936), said, \u201cTo fix the meaning of these provisions there is need to keep in view the background of their history. There is need to keep in view also the structure of the statute, and the relation, physical and logical, between its several parts.\u201d The mechanical interpretation of \u00a7 541(a)(1) urged by the Government would require us to violate that admonition.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The Government\u2019s general interpretation of the interplay of \u00a7 542 and \u00a7 541(a)(l)\u2019s definition of \u201cproperty of the estate\u201d would have a far-reaching effect on reorganizations by denying to debtors or trustees in reorganization not only the power to obtain the turnover of property of the debtor levied upon by the IRS, but also that repossessed prior to bankruptcy by secured creditors or held by pledgees after a default. In all these instances the secured creditor would have rightful possession of the property. Typical statutes recognize the debtor as having only limited \u201crights\u201d in the property \u2014 notice of sale, redemption prior to sale, and receipt of surplus proceeds, see pp. 157-158 <em>infra </em>and note 8 <em>supra. </em>Thus, under the Government\u2019s reading of the statute, only these limited <em>interests in property </em>would constitute \u201cproperty of the estate\u201d. The trustee therefore could obtain turnover only of these interests, which he has without benefit of a turnover order, not the property itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-12\">The results dictated by the Government\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 542 would be a significant departure from the treatment of reorganization proceedings under the former Bankruptcy Act. In Chapter X reorganization cases under that Act a bankruptcy court had broad power to order secured creditors in possession following the debt- or\u2019s default to turn over their collateral. In the leading case of <em>Reconstruction Finance Corporation v. Kaplan, </em>185 F.2d 791 (1 Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>1950), a pledgee seized the debtor\u2019s plant, equipment and inventory following default on a loan, thereby precipitating the filing of a Chapter X reorganization petition later in the day. Following approval of the debtor\u2019s reorganization plan, the bankruptcy court ordered the pledgee to turn over the repossessed property to the debtor\u2019s trustee. The First Circuit, speaking through Chief Judge Magruder, upheld the order, on the ground that such authority was necessary if Chapter X reorganizations were to have a realistic possibility for success:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-4\">In contrast with the provisions of law relating to straight bankruptcy, Chapter X, like its earlier counterpart \u00a7 77B, ... contemplates the rehabilitation of financially ailing business corporations under plans of reorganization which may deal with claims of creditors, secured as well as unsecured, and embrace all of the debtor\u2019s property, however encumbered with outstanding security interests. In keeping with this objective, appropriate broad powers are conferred upon the reorganization court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">185 F.2d at 794.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The court also wrote that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-7\">The second sentence of \u00a7 257 may not specifically authorize a turnover order displacing the ordinary possessory lien of a pledgee of collateral or other personal property; but it seems in substance to cover the kind of security interest which RFC had in the inventory under its statutory factor\u2019s lien. In other words, RFC\u2019s lien on the inventory had the characteristic of a chattel mortgage, with possession, and the right to possession, remaining in the borrower until default. <em>But there is no need to rest on the second sentence of \u00a7 257, which is not the broad basic section conferring upon the court jurisdiction over all the debtor\u2019s property wherever located; </em>it appears rather to be a specific provision inserted out of abundance of caution to make clear the inapplicability under Chapter X of <em>Tuttle v. Harris, </em>1936, 297 U.S. 225, 56 S.Ct. 416, 80 L.Ed. 654, a case decided under \u00a7 77B. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 795.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">The First Circuit\u2019s conclusion in <em>RFC v. Kaplan, supra, </em>was also reached in a number of other cases, some preceding and others following it. See <em>Grand Boulevard Investment Co. v. Strauss, </em>78 F.2d 180 (8 Cir. 1935) (under \u00a7 77B); <em>In re Prudence-Bonds Corp., </em>77 F.2d 328 (2 Cir.) (under \u00a7 77B), <em>cert. denied, </em>296 U.S. 584, 56 S.Ct. 95, 80 L.Ed. 413 (1935); <em>John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Casey, </em>134 F.2d 162 (1 Cir.) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>319 U.S. 757, 63 S.Ct. 1176, 87 L.Ed. 1709 (1943); <em>In re Franklin Garden Apartments, Inc., </em>124 F.2d 451 (2 Cir. 1941); <em>In re Third Avenue Transit Co., </em>198 F.2d 703, 706 (2 Cir. 1952) (affirming bankruptcy court\u2019s authority to order turnover, but refusing to exercise discretion to do so). See also 6A Collier 114.03, at 741 (14th ed. 1977). The validity of Chief Judge Magruder\u2019s observation that this power of the bankruptcy court to order the turnover of property in the lawful possession of secured creditors did not depend solely on \u00a7 257 is demonstrated by the fact that two of these decisions were rendered under \u00a7 77B, the predecessor of Chapter X which included \u00a7 257. A principal basis of these decisions was that the reorganization statutes, \u00a7 77B(a), \u00a7 111 (Chapter X) and \u00a7 411 (Chapter XII), unlike the provisions applying in ordinary bankruptcy, but like \u00a7 77(a), see <em>Continental Illinois National Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Chicago, R. I. &amp; P. Ry. Co., </em>294 U.S. 648, 55 S.Ct. 595, 79 L.Ed. 1110 (1935), gave the bankruptcy court jurisdiction of all the property of the debtor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>whether or not it was in the debtor\u2019s possession.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">The Government\u2019s reading of \u00a7 541 would have the effect of reversing this settled law in reorganization proceedings under Chapter 11 of the Code. We see no evidence that any such drastic change was intended. As Justice Douglas put it, in interpreting the old Bankruptcy Act in <em>Emil v. Hanley, </em>318 U.S. 515, 521, 63 S.Ct. 687, 690, 87 L.Ed. 954 (1943), \u201cWe cannot help but think that if Congress had set out to make such a major change, some clear and unambiguous indication of that purpose would appear.\u201d We find no such indication in the new Code or its legislative history. And, like Justice Douglas, we do not believe that nearly fifty years of the law of reorganization under the Bankruptcy Act would have been changed without some clear statement to that effect. This is particularly true because the Government\u2019s reading of the Bankruptcy Code would seriously affect the chances of success in many reorganizations: \u201cIt is ... generally vital to the success of a reorganization that all the debtor\u2019s property be included, that the continuation of the debtor\u2019s business be not unduly hampered by dissipation of the property to particular creditors .. .. \u201d 6 Collier on Bankruptcy H 3.05, at 431 (14th ed. 1977). In light of legislative history indicating that reorganizations were to be encouraged under the new Code, we doubt that Congress intended such a result.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">Indeed an examination of the legislative history antedating 1977 compels a broad view of \u00a7 542\u2019s turnover power. Section 542 was a relatively late addition to the Code. It did not appear in the early drafts of the proposed legislation,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and was first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>included in H.R. 6, which was introduced on Jan. 4, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">H.R. 6 was the product of the House Judiciary Committee, which prepared the bill after the Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights had conducted extensive hearings on earlier drafts.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> H.R. 6 was prepared with the intent of resolving problems that had been identified during these hearings. 124 Cong.Rec. H 11690, 11701; Klee, <em>Legislative History of the New Bankruptcy Code, </em>54 Am.Bankr.L.J. 275, 280 (1980). Since \u00a7 542 first appeared in H.R. 6, it is important to consider what was said at those hearings regarding the turnover of collateral from secured creditors in possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The House and Senate subcommittee hearings contain a number of statements regarding the bankruptcy court\u2019s turnover power. The following pattern emerges from the testimony: Witnesses said it was clear that the bankruptcy courts were intended to have (and should have) the authority to order the turnover of collateral from secured creditors in possession. Concern was expressed, however, that the language of early drafts of the proposed legislation failed to set forth the basis for such a turnover power in sufficiently explicit detail; consequently, redrafting of the legislation on this point was urged. Witnesses also suggested that turnover be preceded by the provision of adequate protection for secured creditor\u2019s interests. We are not aware that any witness opposed a broad turnover power if this was accompanied by proper provisions for protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The following excerpts from the congressional hearings illustrate the above summary. One witness told the House subcommittee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-10\">I believe that it is almost beyond argument that in the new bankruptcy legislation collateral in the possession of secured creditors should be subject to the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court, except, perhaps, where the bankruptcy is directed toward liquidation and the property has already been taken into custody by another court of competent jurisdiction....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-11\">In rehabilitative proceedings it is proper for the court to be able to control under the injunctive power liquidation procedures by secured creditors in possession <em>and under adequate safeguards to compel the surrender of collateral for use in the rehabilitation process. While recognizing the wish of this Committee that witnesses not comment on the specific language of the proposed legislation at this time I note that the power of the court to compel the surrender of collateral has been left largely to inference in both of the Bills presently before Congress. Leaving this issue to case by case development is, in my opinion, undesirable in light of the present judicial uncertainty on the point and I believe that the legislation should expressly deal with the question of when and under what standards displacement of the secured creditor or its agent should be permitted.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights of the House Committee on the Judiciary, Bankruptcy Act Revision, 94th Cong., 1st Sess., Hearings on H.R. 31 and 32, Part I, at 439 (1976) [hereinafter House Hearings] (prepared statement of Patrick A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Murphy, Esq.) (emphasis added). See also <em>id. </em>at 489-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Another witness, testifying on behalf of the American Bankers Association, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq2\">A related change in both bills would extend the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court to secured creditors in possession of property of the bankrupt, which would, with appropriate safeguards, permit the Bankruptcy Court to force the secured creditor to surrender that property to the debtor or trustee even in a straight bankruptcy case. Assuming that adequate safeguards of the rights of secured creditors are contained in the legislation, we would support this change recognizing that it is a power that is present in reorganization cases under existing law [citing \u00a7\u00a7 256 and 257 of Ch. X and \u00a7\u00a7 506 and 507 of Ch. XII and <em>RFC v. Kaplan.]. </em>It should be made clear by statute, however, that the Bankruptcy Court would have no power to administer any secured creditor\u2019s collateral unless (1) there is an equity for the benefit of creditors or unless such administration is necessary to effect a rehabilitation under Chapter VI or VII of the Commission\u2019s Bill or Chapters VI, VII, or VIII of the Judge\u2019s Bill, and (2) it is clear that the value of the secured creditor\u2019s claim against the collateral will be preserved. \u2022</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 1023 (prepared statement of Walter W. Vaughn).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-13\">The National Bankruptcy Conference expressed the same view of the matter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALr\">However, the NBC [National Bankruptcy Conference] noted that there is no provision either in the reorganization chapter or elsewhere comparable to existing Section 257 of Chapter X. This section authorizes the Court to require a mortgagee or other secured creditor to turn over to a trustee property in his possession. In view of the expanded jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court under the proposed bills, it is also clear that this power should continue in the Court and the NBC concluded that it should be extended to liquidation cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-14\">The following principles are therefore recommended: (1) The right to gain possession from a secured creditor should exist in both liquidation and reorganization eases. (2) Some standard or guidelines, even if only of a general nature should be established as to the occasions when such rights should be exercised. (3) The standards or guidelines in liquidation cases should be those contained in Section 5-203 and in reorganization cases those in Section 7-203 [the forerunner of the current adequate protection section].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 1838-39.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See also <em>id. </em>at 1756-57 (prepared statement of Robert J.

One article, Murphy, <em>Use of Collateral in Business Rehabilitation: A Suggested Redrafting of Section 7-203 of the Bankruptcy Reform Act, </em>63 Calif.L.Rev. 1483 (1975), said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">Two questions are presented: (1) does the court have the power to stay the secured creditor from commencing or continuing a foreclosure action; and (2) does the court have the power to order a secured creditor in possession to surrender the property for use in the rehabilitative process? Section 7-203 of the Proposed Act contemplates the use of collateral but fails to deal with the initial question of obtaining the property from a secured creditor in possession. Section 2-201 of the Proposed Act is clearly intended to extend the jurisdiction of the court to property of the estate wherever located and, when read with section 4-501, would permit the court to <em>stay </em>a secured creditor in possession even in straight bankruptcy proceeding \u2014 clearly a change from existing law. However, neither the Proposed Act nor the Judge\u2019s Bill deals expressly with the <em>recovery </em>of property from secured creditors in possession.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1497 (footnotes omitted). The article continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-8\">Expanded jurisdiction under section 2-201, in combination with the broad definition of \u201cproperty of the estate\u201d under section 4-601, indicates that the Commission intended to give the court power to deal with collateral in the possession of secured creditors. This should be clarified, however, in the general part of the legislation, Chapter IV of the Proposed Act, rather than in Chapter VII, in order for the court to have comprehensive power in liquidation proceedings and in the rehabilitative chapters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 1497-98. See also Coogan, <em>Comments on Some Reorganization Provisions of the Pending Bankruptcy Bills, </em>30 Bus.Law. 1149, 1169-78 (1975); Murphy, <em>Restraint and Reimbursement: The Secured Creditor in Reorganization and Arrangement Proceedings, </em>30 Bus.Law 15 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">Shortly after the uncontradicted statements regarding the bankruptcy court\u2019s turnover power, cited above, were made to the House and Senate subcommittees, \u00a7 542, the Code\u2019s general turnover provision, was added to the proposed legislation. Following this addition, the provision was incorporated in all later drafts of the bill, and the turnover question, which had attracted substantial attention in the 1975 and 1976 hearings, was not mentioned in subsequent legislative history. This sequence of events compels the inference that \u00a7 542 was added to the Code to make clear \u2014 as a number of witnesses had explicitly urged \u2014 that the turnover power approved in <em>RFC v. Kaplan </em>was to be incorporated in the new statute. This inference becomes all the more compelling when one considers that if \u00a7 542 did not authorize compelling turnovers by secured creditors in possession, apparently its only use would be to authorize obtaining property from persons in wrongful possession following theft or conversion. Given the circumstances surrounding the inclusion of the section in the Code, the more natural reading of \u00a7 542 is that it was intended to codify <em>RFC v. Kaplan, </em>and possibly, although we need not decide the question, also extend the turnover power to straight bankruptcy cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-13\">For the foregoing reasons, we reject the Government\u2019s reading of \u00a7\u00a7 542, 541 and 363 in the present context of a Chapter 11 proceeding, and hold that in such a case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>the bankruptcy court generally has power under \u00a7 542 to order the turnover of property repossessed or executed upon by a secured creditor or held by a pledgee following the debtor\u2019s default and prior to his bankruptcy, if the property has not yet been sold. We thus pass on to the Government\u2019s further argument that, even if the bankruptcy court can compel a turnover by a repossessing or executing lender under \u00a7 542 in a Chapter 11 proceeding, this cannot be done in the case of property upon which the IRS has levied.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">III. <em>Federal Tax Levies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">On the basis of a mere reading of the IRC provisions, the argument is unpersuasive. Comparison of relevant statutes indicates that an IRS levy on tangible property pursuant to \u00a7 6331 <em>et seq. </em>is virtually indistinguishable from the ordinary repossession and foreclosure procedures followed by secured creditors, except for the fact that the IRS can make its own levy without need of the assistance of a sheriff, marshal or similar officer. Compare \u00a7 6331 <em>et seq. </em>of the IRC with \u00a7\u00a7 9-207, 9-501 to 507 of the UCC and with N.Y.Lien Law \u00a7\u00a7 200-05 (public sales), N.Y.Lien Law \u00a7\u00a7 206-210 (levy) and with \u00a7\u00a7 1301 <em>et seq. </em>of the New York Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law. In these instances as under IRC \u00a7 6331 <em>et seq., </em>the statutes give the debtor the right, and only the right, to notice, an opportunity for redemption, and surplus proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">The Government\u2019s argument for a sharp distinction between an IRS levy and a secured creditor\u2019s repossession is based primarily on <em>Phelps v. United States, </em>421 U.S. 330, 95 S.Ct. 1728, 44 L.Ed.2d 201 (1975). In <em>Phelps, </em>a taxpayer had transferred its assets to an assignee for the benefit of creditors, who had converted them into some $38,000 in cash. The Government filed a notice of tax lien in the amount of $140,831.59 and levied upon the $38,000 in the assignee\u2019s hands. An involuntary petition in bankruptcy was then filed against the taxpayer, and a receiver in bankruptcy petitioned the bankruptcy court to require the assignee to turn over the proceeds. The Seventh Circuit ruled against the receiver, 495 F.2d 1283 (1974), on the ground that the assignee was holding for the benefit of the United States as an adverse claimant, thereby implicating the rule that in ordinary bankruptcy such a holder is not subject to summary jurisdiction. It disagreed with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>In re General Wood Products Corp., </em>483 F.2d 975 (1973), that an assignee\u2019s disclaimer of interest brought similarly seized property within the summary jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court under language in <em>Tau-bel-Scott-Kitzmiller Co. v. Fox, </em>264 U.S. 426, 432-33, 44 S.Ct. 396, 398-99, 68 L.Ed. 670 (1924), and that the possession of the bankrupt necessary to support exercise of summary jurisdiction in ordinary bankruptcy existed \u201cwhere the property is held by some other person who makes no claim to it.\u201d The Supreme Court granted certiorari to resolve the conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">The Supreme Court agreed with the Seventh Circuit. It reasoned that, following the levy, the assignee held the $38,000 on behalf of the United States as an adverse claimant. The Court then applied the settled rule that \u201cwhere possession is assertedly held not for the bankrupt, but for others prior to bankruptcy . . . the holder is not subject to summary jurisdiction.\u201d Phelps, <em>supra, </em>421 U.S. at 335-36, 95 S.Ct. at 1731-32 (quoting 2 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 23.-06[3], at 506.2-506.3 (14th ed. 1975)). The receiver\u2019s case was not aided by \u00a7 2(a)(21) of the Bankruptcy Act which authorized bankruptcy courts to require turnovers by assignees for the benefit of creditors since, as a result of the levy, the assignee was holding not for creditors generally but as a custodian for the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">It is plain that the <em>holding </em>in <em>Phelps </em>does not assist the Government here. <em>Phelps </em>was one in the line of cases applying the distinction between summary and plenary jurisdiction that had evolved under the 1898 Act with respect to ordinary bankruptcy, see <em>Taubel-Scott-Kitzmiller Co. v. Fox, supra, </em>264 U.S. 426, 44 S.Ct. 396, 68 L.Ed. 670, where decision hinged on whether or not the trustee had actual or constructive pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>session of the debtor\u2019s property. Under the Code this distinction no longer exists, as the legislative history makes clear, see, e.g., Senate Report No. 95-989 (1978) at 153, <em>reprinted in, </em>[1978] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 5939; House Report No. 95-595 (1978) at 445, <em>reprinted in, </em>[1978] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 6400. Instead, Congress adopted a broad jurisdictional provision which states, in language modeled on \u00a7 111 of Chapter X of the former Act, \u201cThe bankruptcy court ... shall have exclusive jurisdiction of all of the property, wherever located, of the debtor, as of the commencement of [the] case.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1471(e). Hence it is far from clear that under the Code a bankruptcy court would not have <em>power </em>to order a turnover on the same facts as in <em>Phelps.</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Moreover <em>Phelps </em>did not decide that a bankruptcy court would not have had power in a Chapter X proceeding under the former Act to direct a turnover on facts such as there presented. As we have previously developed, the constraints against a bankruptcy court\u2019s exercising summary jurisdiction with respect to property of the bankrupt not in the debtor\u2019s actual or constructive possession had never applied under the reorganization provisions, \u00a7\u00a7 77 and 77B, and Chapters X and XII. Rather, \u201cthe reorganization court [could] bring its authority to bear upon creditors in situations not possible in ordinary bankruptcy.\u201d 6 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 3.03, at 412 (14th ed. 1977). In such cases</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aep\">when possession of the debtor\u2019s property is held by a creditor, such as a pledgee or mortgagee, whose claim is not in dispute and who does not dispute the debtor\u2019s title but claims the right to hold the property and use it as security, the courts have generally ruled that this possession is not sufficient to defeat the reorganization court\u2019s summary jurisdiction either to enjoin the use of the security as by sale or to retake possession thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">6 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 3.05, at 431 (14th ed. 1977). See <em>Reconstruction Finance Corporation v. Kaplan, supra, </em>and cases cited at pp. 151-152, <em>supra. </em>As shown above the framers of the Code intended to preserve this jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">The Government is thus forced to argue that after an IRS levy, as distinguished from levies by other secured creditors, a debtor loses not only possession but ownership. This position finds scant support in the language of IRC \u00a7 6331 <em>et seq. </em>Looking only at the statute, we would see no basis for doubt that at the commencement of the Chapter 11 proceeding Whiting had title to the goods the IRS had seized. Under the statute ownership is extinguished not by the levy and seizure but only by a subsequent sale. Thus, \u00a7 6335(a) requires that written notice of seizure be given \u201cto the owner of the property (or, in the case of personal property, the possessor thereof)\u201d or be left at his usual place of abode or business. Section 6335(b) requires that, as soon as practicable after the seizure, notice of sale be given to \u201cthe owner\u201d. Section 6336, relating to perishable goods, again requires notice to the \u201cowner of the property\u201d. The IRS\u2019s certificate of sale of personal property shall \u201ctransfer to the purchaser all right, title, and interest of the party delinquent in and to the property sold\u201d, \u00a7 6339(a)(2), and its deed of real property \u201cshall be considered and operate as a conveyance of the right, title and interest the party delinquent had in and to the real property thus sold at the time the lien of the United States attached thereto.\u201d \u00a7 6339(b)(2). By the very language of the statute, it is the delinquent party\u2019s interest, not an interest already acquired by the Government as a result of the levy, that is conveyed. Nothing in these sections prohibits the delinquent party, after the levy and pending the sale, from exercising the most fundamental right of ownership, namely, to transfer title, subject, of course, to the continuing right of the United States to proceed with the sale unless the property has been redeemed under \u00a7 6337(a). Such a transfer could well occur when the tax<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>payer\u2019s equity was substantial. It thus is not surprising that in <em>Bennett v. Hunter, </em>76 U.S. (9 Wall.) 326, 336-37, 19 L.Ed. 672 (1870), addressing itself to a statutory scheme essentially the same as IRC \u00a7 6331 <em>et seq., </em>the Court had said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-4\">What preceded the sale was merely preliminary, and, independently of the sale, worked no divestiture of title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The title was \u201cforfeited\u201d by the levy only in the sense that \u201cit became subject to be vested in the United States, and upon public sale, became actually vested in the United States or in any other purchaser, but not before such public sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">In the face of all this the Government relies on two statements in the <em>Phelps </em>opinion. One, 421 U.S. at 337, 95 S.Ct. at 1732, is that \u201cThe levy, therefore, gave the United States full legal right to the $38,000 levied upon as against the claim of the petitioner receiver\u201d. The statement that the United States had \u201cfull legal right\u201d to the $38,000 levied upon for a much larger tax liability is not equivalent to saying that where, as here, the debtor has an equity in the property, that also passes to the Government. Any such statement \u2014 and, we repeat, none was made \u2014 not only would have been unnecessary to the decision but would have run directly counter to <em>Bennett v. Hunter, supra, </em>which was not called to the Court\u2019s attention either in the briefs or in oral argument and was not cited by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">' The other statement in <em>Phelps </em>on which the Government relies is in footnote 8, 421 U.S. at 337, 95 S.Ct. at 1732. The footnote dealt with an argument by the receiver based on \u00a7 70(a)(8), which vested a trustee in bankruptcy \u201cwith the title of the bankrupt as of the date of the filing of the petition ... to ... property held by an assignee for the benefit of creditors.\u201d The Court\u2019s first answer was the receiver\u2019s admission that at the date of the filing of the petition, the bankrupt had no title to property it had previously conveyed to the as-signee. The footnote then added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-9\">In any event, the pre-bankruptcy levy displaced any title of Chicagoland [the taxpayer], and \u00a7 70(a)(8) is therefore inapplicable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">The footnote cited no authority for the proposition that the levy as distinguished from the sale \u201cdisplaced\u201d the title of Chica-goland, which the receiver had conceded to be nonexistent because of the prior conveyance to the assignee, and any such view, if applied generally, would run directly counter to <em>Bennett v. Hunter, supra. </em>The remark just quoted must be read as addressed to the particular circumstances of the <em>Phelps </em>case, where the tax claim vastly exceeded the amount of the levy and the seizure was of cash which did not need to be sold. See <em>United States v. Pittman, </em>449 F.2d 623, 627 (7 Cir. 1971).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>In deciding this case it is appropriate for us to look, as the Supreme Court would equally be obliged to look, not only to the two statements in <em>Phelps </em>but to the legislative history of the Bankruptcy Code. Both the House and the Senate Reports, H.R.Rep.No.95-595, 95th Cong. 1st Sess. at 367 (1977); S.Rep.No.95-989, 95th Cong.2d Sess. at 82 (1978), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1978, pp. 5787, 5868, 6323, said that \u00a7 541(a) included</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-5\">property recovered by the trustee under section 542 of proposed title 11, if the property received was merely out of the possession of the debtor, yet remained property of the debtor,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4m\">and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-6\">The debtor\u2019s interest in property also included \u201ctitle\u201d to property, which is an interest, just as are a possessory interest, or a leasehold interest, for example.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AtN\">Despite the Government\u2019s assertions to the contrary, our conclusion that an IRS levy on tangible property in which the debtor has an equity does not strip the debtor of all property interests and transfer full title to the Government is entirely consistent with the statements in the House and Senate Reports, H.R.Rep.No.95-595, <em>supra, </em>at 367-68; Sen.Rep.No.95-989, <em>supra, </em>at 82, U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News pp. 5787, 5868, 6323, see also 124 Cong.Rec. H 11096 (daily ed. Sept. 28, 1978), that the Code was \u201cnot intended to expand the debtor\u2019s rights against others more than they exist at the commencement of the case\u201d and that the trustee \u201ccould take no greater rights than the debtor himself had.\u201d Whiting has not asked us to invalidate the tax lien. It has asked only to have the use of the property, on which the IRS had levied but which it had not yet sold, in what Whiting believed and the bankruptcy judge found might be a successful rehabilitation, to the advantage of the Government as well as other interested parties. Here we must give some weight to the purpose of the Code, announced by Representative Edwards, a member of the Commission on the Bankruptcy Laws of the United States, who presented the bill to the House, 124 Cong.Rec. H 11089 (daily ed. Sept. 28, 1978):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-9\">The amendment also encourages business reorganizations by a streamlined new commercial reorganization chapter. . . . It will protect the investing public, protect jobs, and help save troubled businesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">There can be no doubt that allowing the government to strip a failing company of all its tangible property would impact seriously on this goal.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-11\">We recognize that, as said in <em>Bull </em>v. <em>United States, </em>295 U.S. 247, 259-60, 55 S.Ct. 695, 699, 79 L.Ed. 1421 (1935), \u201ctaxes are the life-blood of government, and their prompt and certain availability an imperious need. Time out of mind, therefore, the sovereign has resorted to more drastic means of collection. The assessment is given the force of a judgment, and if the amount assessed is not paid when due, administrative officials may seize the debtor\u2019s property to satisfy the debt.\u201d Such considerations are of peculiar force when, as here, a debtor has simply helped itself to amounts withheld from employees. The framers of the Code sought to reconcile the possibly conflicting goals of enhancing the prospects for rehabilitation and protecting the revenue by the provision in \u00a7 363(e) for adequate protection of the subject of a turnover order to which we have already referred, <em>supra, </em>note 3. The nature of what \u00a7 363(e) means by \u201cadequate protection\u201d is spelled out in \u00a7 361, quoted at note 3, <em>supra. </em>If a plan of reorganization is ultimately effectuated, the United States, as holder of a perfected lien, would be entitled to the protections afforded by \u00a7 1129(b)(2)(A); it could not be treated, over its objection, simply as an unsecured priority creditor. However, a successful reorganization is by no means assured; there have been all too many instances where creditors, even se<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>cured creditors, have seen their interests whittled away while the debtor and its counsel endlessly pursue some will of the wisp after all real hope has faded. A bankruptcy judge acting on a request like that made here should therefore give serious consideration to forms of protection other than that ultimately obtainable in a reorganization plan.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">Here the bankruptcy judge purported to do just that, see note 5, <em>supra, </em>and we would have little doubt that the conditions he developed would be sufficient except for one point not apparent on the face of his opinion. The opinion of the district court reveals that, in addition to the turnover order of April 28, 1981, here before us, the bankruptcy judge made an order on April 30, 1981, directing Bankers Trust Company to pay certain levied funds to the IRS and further directing that such funds <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> be considered as partial payment of the $20,000 which Whiting was required to pay the IRS under the order here under review. The district judge vacated the April 30 order and directed the bankruptcy court to reconsider it. We are not clear what the effect of this was. There is nothing to indicate whether Whiting had appealed from the April 30 order, and the direction that the Bankers Trust funds be considered as partial payment of the $20,000 on the turnover of the tangibles would fade away if the April 28 order were vacated as the district court directed. The April 30 order is not before us and perhaps may never be. We also have no idea what has been happening in the year since the levy and the filing of the Chapter 11 petition. Under the circumstances we think it best simply to reverse the order of the district court insofar as it held that the tangible assets were not subject to a turnover order, and remand to it with instructions to vacate its own order to that effect and remand to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. In such proceedings the bankruptcy court should consider whether a turnover order is appropriate under present circumstances and, if it decides in the affirmative, what protection should be afforded to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b173-13\">.

The bankruptcy judge and Whiting seek to draw support for the conclusion that the IRS is a \u201ccustodian\u201d under \u00a7 543 from cases arising under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act, most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>notably <em>RFC v. Kaplan, </em>185 F.2d 791 (1 Cir. 1950) (Magruder, C. J.), which held that a creditor who had taken possession of a debtor\u2019s goods after default could be required to turn over the goods to a trustee or a debtor in possession. Apart from the fact that the origin of the creditor\u2019s possession lay in a consensual transaction, these cases, as is developed below, went not on the ground that the creditor was acting as the debtor\u2019s agent but on the basis that \u00a7 111 of the Bankruptcy Act gave the reorganization court \u201cexclusive jurisdiction of the debtor and its property wherever located\u201d, differing in this respect from ordinary bankruptcy in which the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction only over property in the bankrupt\u2019s possession and the trustee was obliged to institute a plenary suit to recover other property. See <em>In re Prudence-Bonds Corp., </em>77 F.2d 328 (2 Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>296 U.S. 584, 56 S.Ct. 95, 80 L.Ed. 413 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-12\">Several bankruptcy courts have held that an ordinary secured creditor in possession is a \u201ccustodian\u201d under the Code, and therefore subject to \u00a7 543\u2019s turnover requirement, <em>Smitty\u2019s Inc. v. Southeast National Bank, </em>1 C.B.C.2d 366 (Bankr.Ct.M.D.Fla.1979) (writ of replevin); <em>In re Gunder, </em>8 B.R. 390, 394 (Bkrtcy.S.D.Ohio 1980) (repossession); <em>In re Brickel, </em>11 B.R. 353, 355 (Bkrtcy.D.Me.1981) (repossession); <em>In re Williams, </em>6 B.R. 789 (Bkrtcy.E.D.Mich.1980) (repossession). Apart from the fact that the ultimate source of the creditor\u2019s right in these decisions was a consensual transaction, we find little analysis which assists us. We express no view on their correctness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b178-6\">. According to the Government, these were: a right to notice of the seizure and the sale, \u00a7 6335(a) and (b); a right to redemption prior to the sale, \u00a7 6337(a), and, in the case of real property, for 120 days thereafter, \u00a7 6337(b); and a right to surplus proceeds,. \u00a7 6342(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b178-7\">.

Indeed, the immediate legislative history contains language inconsistent with the rigid reading of \u201cproperty of the estate\" urged by the Government. The House Report accompanying the Bankruptcy Code, after noting that the \u201cscope of [\u00a7 541(a)(1) ] is broad\u201d, states that property of the estate \u201cincludes all kinds of property, including tangible or intangible property, causes of action (see Bankruptcy Act section 70a(6) and all other forms of property currently specified in section 70a of the Bankruptcy Act \u00a7 70a, as well as property recovered by the trustee under section 542 of proposed title 11, if the property recovered was merely out of the possession of the debtor, yet remained \u2018property of the debtor\u2019 \u201d.

This discussion indicates that \u00a7 541(a)(1) was not intended to narrow the old Act\u2019s definition of \u201cproperty of the estate\u201d, as the Government\u2019s reading of the statute would require, but rather to preserve or enlarge it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b179-8\">. The fears of Congress with respect to <em>Tuttle v. Harris, </em>297 U.S. 225, 56 S.Ct. 416, 80 L.Ed. 654 (1936), may well have been exaggerated. The holding in that case simply echoed that in <em>Duparquet, supra, </em>297 U.S. 216, 56 S.Ct. 412, 80 L.Ed. 591, that appointment of a foreclosure receiver was not an event that would authorize the commencement of a 77B proceeding under \u00a7 77B(i). It did not deal with the power of the bankruptcy court to order a turnover by such a receiver when a 77B proceeding had been properly instituted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b180-5\">. There was some uncertainty as to the scope of the bankruptcy court\u2019s turnover power in Chapter XI proceedings under the former Act. According to one commentator:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-6\">Probably the single greatest area of uncertainty with respect to the exercise of Chapter XI jurisdiction concerns the secured creditor in possession of property of the debtor. It is at present unclear whether the court has the power to prevent a secured creditor in possession from enforcing its lien and whether the court has the power to force that creditor to surrender property to the debtor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Murphy, <em>Restraint and Reimbursement: The Secured Creditor in Reorganization and Arrangement Proceedings, </em>30 Bus.Law. 15, 39 (1974). A number of recent decisions affirmed a turnover power in Chapter XI cases similar to that under Chapters X and XII, e.g., <em>In re George W. Schultz, </em>50 Am.Bankr.L.J. 185 (Bankr.Ct.D.Okla.1975); <em>In re Roebling Steel &amp; Wire Corp., </em>1 B.C.D. 944 (Bankr.Ct.D.N.J. 1975); <em>In re American Kitchen Foods, Inc., </em>2 B.C.D. 715 (D.Me.1976). There was, however, authority for the proposition that, since arrangements of unsecured debts under Chapter XI, unlike proceedings under Chapters X and XII, see <em>In re Colonial Realty Investment Co., </em>516 F.2d 154 (1 Cir. 1975), were not intended to alter the rights of secured creditors, a narrower turnover power was appropriate in Chapter XI, 8 Collier on Bankruptcy 3.02, at 156-63 (14th ed. 1977). A version of this latter view was accepted in <em>In re Pittsburgh Penguins Partners, </em>598 F.2d 1299 (3 Cir. 1979), where the court held that in a Chapter XI proceeding the IRS could not be compelled to turn over property on which it had levied prior to the filing of a petition in bankruptcy. This decision is of little guidance in the present reorganization proceeding, both because the Third Circuit was of the view that the bankruptcy court\u2019s turnover power was extremely limited in Chapter XI cases, and because it thought that certain language in <em>United States v. Phelps, supra, </em>was dispositive of the case before it, a view we do not share, see pp. 156 157, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b180-13\">.

The Government relies also on cases in the courts of appeals to support its thesis that a levy under \u00a7 6331 <em>et seq. </em>strips the debtor of ownership despite the contrary implications of the statutory language and <em>Bennett v. Hunter, supra. </em>The general thrust of the decisions, as distinguished from some of the language, is to the contrary. <em>In re Brewster-Raymond Co., </em>344 F.2d 903 (6 Cir. 1965), held that a debt owing to the bankrupt on which the Government had levied prior to adjudication but the proceeds of which had not been turned over to it remained part of the bankrupt estate so as to trigger \u00a7 57(j) which prohibited the collection of tax penalties that had been included in the levy. <em>United States v. Sullivan, </em>333 F.2d 100 (3 Cir. 1964) (in banc), although paraphrasing, at p. 116, the language in <em>United States v. Eiland, </em>223 F.2d 118, 121 (4 Cir. 1955), a case cited in <em>Phelps, </em>421 U.S. at 336, 95 S.Ct. at 1732, that a levy \u201ceffects a seizure of the delinquent\u2019s property tantamount to a transferal of ownership\u201d, held that the levy did not allow the Government to recover from insurance policy loans and automatic premium loans made after service of the notice of the levy. <em>Eiland </em>itself held only that in an ordinary bankruptcy a referee could not compel a debtor of the bankrupt on whose debt the United States had levied for a much larger tax to pay the debt to the trustee rather than the United States; the court suggested that a different result might obtain if the case involved tangible property, 223 F.2d at 123. <em>United States v. Pittman, supra, </em>449 F.2d 623, while presenting textual arguments that, in its view although not in ours, would support a conclusion that the levy itself transferred title to the Government and citing <em>Eiland, supra, </em>ended up by saying, at p. 627:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-12\"><em>Eiland </em>involved the levy upon an intangible indebtedness rather than upon corporeal property as here and we would hesitate to extend its holding.
