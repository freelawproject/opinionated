(Aminoil) appeals from the district court\u2019s order dismissing its action against Gorsuch, Administrator of the Environmental Pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1229\">*1229</page-number>tection Agency (EPA or the Administrator), for lack of jurisdiction. The suit was originally filed in California state court for review of an order of the California State Water Resources Control Board (State Board). When Aminoil joined the Administrator as a real party in interest, the Administrator removed the case to the district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442(a)(1). Because we conclude that the state court, and therefore the district court on removal, lacked jurisdiction to join the Administrator as a party, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-6\">A. <em>The Statutory Framework.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1245-7\">In 1972 Congress enacted amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act which are now generally referred to as the Clean Water Act (Act). Pub.L. No. 92-500, 86 Stat. 816, codified at 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1251-1376. The purpose of these amendments is to eliminate pollutant discharges into the navigable waters of the United States by 1985. Act \u00a7 101(a)(1), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(1). Section 402 of the Act creates the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), which regulates the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters under the authority of the EPA. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342. It is unlawful for any person to discharge a pollutant without first obtaining a NPDES permit and complying with its terms. Act \u00a7 301(a), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1311(a). Navigable waters have been administratively defined to include \u201cwetlands\u201d pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Army Corps of Engineers, 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 323.2, and the EPA, 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-9\">The Act is a \u201ccomplicated and lengthy statute.\u201d <em>American Frozen Food Inst. v. Train, </em>539 F.2d 107, 113 (D.C.Cir.1976). Its allocation of concurrent enforcement authority to both state and federal agencies creates a \u201ccooperative federal-state scheme for the control of water pollution,\u201d <em>Shell,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1245-11\"><em>supra, </em>585 F.2d at 409, and a \u201cdelicate partnership\u201d between state and federal agencies. <em>Save The Bay, Inc. v. Administrator of the EPA, </em>556 F.2d 1282, 1284 (5th Cir. 1977). The Act empowers the Administrator to issue discharge permits regulating the nature and quantity of the various pollutants which may lawfully be discharged. Act \u00a7 402(a), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(a). Yet in order \u201cto recognize, preserve, and protect the primary responsibilities and rights of States to prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution,\u201d Act \u00a7 101(b), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(b), the Act provides that each state may establish and administer its own permit program covering pollutant discharges into navigable waters within its jurisdiction. Act \u00a7 402(b), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(b). The Administrator must approve a proposed state permit program unless he determines that the program does not provide \u201cadequate authority\u201d to enforce the Act. <em>Id. </em>Once a state program is approved, the Act requires that the EPA suspend its own issuance of permits. Act \u00a7 402(c)(1), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(c)(1). California has adopted a plan for the issuance of NPDES permits, see Cal. Water Code \u00a7 13370 <em>et seq., </em>which has been approved by the EPA. 39 Fed. Reg. 26,061 (1973). The State Board and its nine subsidiary regional boards, therefore, \u201chave primary responsibility for the enforcement of the [Act] and the effluent limitations established pursuant to it in California.\u201d <em>Shell, supra, </em>585 F.2d at 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-13\">The EPA, however, retains independent supervisory authority over approved state programs. It may withdraw its approval of a state program if it determines that the state program is not being administered in accordance with the requirements of the Act, \u00a7 402(e)(3), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(c)(3), and the Administrator may veto any state discharge permit which he deems to be \u201coutside the guidelines and requirements of [the Act].\u201d Act \u00a7 402(d)(2), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(d)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under sections 309(a)(1) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1230\">*1230</page-number>(a)(3) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1319(a)(1), (a)(3), the EPA is empowered to notify violators and states that if the state has not commenced appropriate enforcement action within 30 days, the EPA will issue a compliance order or bring a civil action to enforce compliance. Section 309(b), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1319(b), authorizes the Administrator to commence a civil enforcement action against individual violators and recalcitrant state agencies in federal district court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1246-4\">Despite this residual federal supervisory responsibility, the scheme of cooperative federalism established by the Act remains \u201ca system for the mandatory approval of a conforming State program and the consequent suspension of the federal program [which] creates a separate and independent State authority to administer the NPDES pollution controls....\u201d <em>Mianus River Preservation Comm. v. Administrator, EPA, </em>541 F.2d 899, 905 (2d Cir. 1976). The role envisioned for the states encompasses both the opportunity to assume primary responsibility for the implementation and enforcement of federal effluent discharge limitations, Act \u00a7 402(b), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(b), and the right to enact discharge limitations which are more stringent than the federal standards, Act \u00a7 510, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1370. Thus, although the Act gave the EPA the authority in the first instance to issue NPDES discharge permits, Act \u00a7 402(a)(1), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(a)(1), \u201cCongress clearly intended that the states would eventually assume the major role in the operation of the NPDES program.\u201d <em>Shell, supra, </em>585 F.2d at 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-5\">B. <em>The Factual Background.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1246-6\">Aminoil operates oil and gas wells at a site in Orange County, California, leased from appellant Signal Bolsa Corporation. These operations produce drilling wastes which are presently discharged into the surrounding environment. The proper characterization of these surrounding waters is the basis of the instant dispute. In July 1978, the Fish and Wildlife Service of the United States Department of the Interior requested that the Santa Ana Region of the State Board (Regional Board) adopt an order declaring Aminoil\u2019s disposal site a \u201cwetlands\u201d subject to the jurisdiction of the Act and its companion California statute, Cal. Water Code \u00a7 13370 <em>et seq. </em>Following a meeting at the site between Aminoil, the EPA and the Regional Board, and after a public hearing, the Regional Board concluded that the area \u201ccannot be defined as national wetlands. Therefore, an NPDES permit is not necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-9\">The Amigos de Bolsa Chica (Amigos), an interested environmental group, petitioned the State Board for review of the Regional Board\u2019s decision pursuant to Cal.Water Code \u00a7 13320. Aminoil intervened in this proceeding. On July 13, 1979, while the Amigos\u2019 petition was pending, the EPA sent Aminoil a \u201cfinding of violation\u201d pursuant to section 309(a)(1) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1319(a)(1), indicating that Aminoil\u2019s discharges into wetlands without a NPDES permit were in violation of section 301 of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1311(a). In accordance with section 309(a)(1), the EPA notified Aminoil and the State Board that it would take \u201cappropriate action\u201d if the State Board had not commenced enforcement action within 30 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-10\">Two months later, the State Board mailed to the EPA a copy of a proposed order reversing the decision of the Regional Board and finding the property to be a \u201cwetlands\u201d subject to the jurisdiction of the Act. This proposed order was based upon the same record that was before the Regional Board; no additional evidentiary hearing was conducted. In a letter dated September 17, 1979, the EPA urged the State Board to adopt the proposed order without substantive change. Three days later, the State Board adopted the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-11\">On October 24, 1979, Aminoil filed an action in California superior court seeking review of the State Board\u2019s finding on the wetlands issue pursuant to Cal.Water Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1231\">*1231</page-number>\u00a7 13330 and Cal.Civ.Proc. Code \u00a7 1094.5 (mandamus). It named as real parties in interest the Amigos and the Administrator. On November 20, 1979, the Administrator removed the action to the district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442(a)(1), which permits officers of United States agencies, when acting under color of such office, to remove civil actions commenced against them in state court to the federal district court. Subsequently, the Administrator filed a motion to dismiss, asserting that neither the state court, nor the district court upon removal, had jurisdiction to entertain the action against him, and that sovereign immunity barred the suit. The district court granted the motion. Relying on our decision in <em>Shell, </em>the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AA7\"><em>Shell </em>cannot logically be interpreted as giving a state court jurisdiction over a federal agency in a dispute over federal law when such jurisdiction is denied a federal court. The EPA must take [final] action before it can be sued pursuant to the Act, and when it is sued, it must be sued in federal court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"afu-dedup-0\">Because this ruling did not affect Amigos, Aminoil brought a motion pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 54(b). The district court granted the motion and entered final judgment as to the Administrator upon its express determination that \u201cthere [was] no just reason for delay in entering such judgment.\u201d It is from this judgment that the instant appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-6\"><em>Shell </em>holds that informal action<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> by the EPA, which influences a state agency\u2019s decision to reject NPDES permit applications under an EPA-approved state program, is not reviewable in federal court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We had previously decided that such informal EPA action is not directly reviewable in this court pursuant to section 509(b)(1)(F) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1369(b)(1)(F). <em>Shell, supra, </em>585 F.2d at 411. In <em>Shell </em>the court concluded that federal review should similarly be unavailable in the district court. First, the court reasoned that the State Board could not reasonably be considered the agent of the EPA, <em>id. </em>at 412, and that serious constitutional problems would be raised in reviewing the claim that a federal agency had \u201ccoerced\u201d a state agency. <em>Id. </em>at 413-14. Second, the court held that there was no basis for federal review under section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704, as that provision is limited to review of \u201cfinal agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 414. Thus, because the EPA had not yet taken final action, and because state court review of the permit decision was available and would have been adequate, federal review was foreclosed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aq_-dedup-0\">Federal courts are not the sole avenue of review of the states\u2019 administrative decisions. Jurisdiction to review the State Board\u2019s decision is specifically conferred on the states\u2019 courts of general jurisdiction. . . . The existence of a state judi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number>cial forum for the review of the regional board\u2019s action forecloses the availability of the federal forum under the terms of the Administrative Procedure Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1248-4\">Proper respect for both the integrity and independence of the state administrative mechanism, mandated by Congress in this context, required that Shell\u2019s complaint be dismissed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1248-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 414-15 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-6\">Perhaps more importantly, however, the <em>Shell </em>decision was premised on the scheme of cooperative federalism embodied in the Act. Permitting federal review of such \u201cinformal\u201d EPA action prior to any affirmative EPA action authorized by the Act would conflict with the allocation of enforcement authority and jurisdiction mandated by Congress.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1248-7\">[Hjolding that statutorily sanctioned advice by the EPA to a state agency constitutes final federal agency action reviewable in the federal courts would permit an applicant, dissatisfied with a decision of a state board, to circumvent the appellate process envisioned by the statute and bestow jurisdiction upon a federal court simply by alleging coercion or undue influence. The statute provides ample opportunity for the assertion of federal jurisdiction after the EPA has taken formal action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1248-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 414. As in <em>Shell, </em>permitting federal review in this case would allow an individual, dissatisfied with a decision of the State Board, to attempt to circumvent the appellate process envisioned by the statute and bestow jurisdiction upon a federal court by joining the Administrator as a party to its state court action, in hope that the Administrator, as here, would exercise his right to remove.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-9\">Our analysis, however, must be somewhat different from that utilized in <em>Shell. </em>It is settled that the removal jurisdiction of the district court is entirely derivative of that of the state court. <em>Minnesota v. United States, </em>305 U.S. 382, 389, 59 S.Ct. 292, 295, 83 L.Ed. 235 (1939). Where the state court lacks jurisdiction, the district court acquires none even if it would have had jurisdiction if the suit had originally been commenced before it. <em>Lambert Run Coal Co. v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co., </em>258 U.S. 377, 382, 42 S.Ct. 349, 351, 66 L.Ed. 671 (1922); <em>Jacobson v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, </em>566 F.2d 1353, 1362 (9th Cir. 1977), <em>aff\u2019d in relevant part sub nom., Lake Country Estates, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, </em>440 U.S. 391, 99 S.Ct. 1171, 59 L.Ed.2d 401 (1979). Unlike <em>Shell, </em>therefore, our focus in this case must be on the jurisdiction of the state court, rather than the federal district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-11\">The EPA insists, and the district court held, that <em>Shell </em>compels the conclusion that the state courts were without jurisdiction to permit joinder of the Administrator. It argues that since <em>Shell </em>establishes that judicial review of states\u2019 NPDES permit decisions is proper in state court, but not federal court, the correlative principle is equally true: the EPA is subject to the jurisdiction of the federal courts, but not the state courts, in the exercise of its supervisory authority under the Act. In light of <em>Shell, </em>Aminoil concedes that initial federal review of its dispute with the State Board and the EPA would not properly lie with the district court under the judicial review provisions of the Act or section 10 of the APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704. Nonetheless, it argues that state court review of the State Board\u2019s decision is consistent with <em>Shell </em>and that the California courts, as courts of general jurisdiction, have the power to join the Administrator as a \u201cnecessary\u201d or \u201cindispensable\u201d party. <em>See </em>Cal.Civ.Proc.Code \u00a7 389. During oral argument, counsel for Aminoil aptly stated the relief his client seeks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjK\">[Aminoil] seeks only a single proceeding in which it can be decided whether its property in Orange County is a \u201cwetlands\u201d subject to federal jurisdiction, and a determination that will be binding on all parties having an interest in it.. . . The EPA is trying to maximize its flexibility, in that it does not want to be sued in federal court, it does not want to be sued in state court. It wants to maintain its regulatory prerogatives at the expense of the states, its partners in this federal-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1233\">*1233</page-number>state scheme, and to the considerable detriment of private litigants like [Aminoil] who seek an economical resolution of the \u201cwetlands\u201d federal jurisdictional issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AcS8\">Thus, Aminoil fears that it may ultimately persuade the California courts to reverse the State Board\u2019s decision, but will then be forced to relitigate the wetlands issue in an independent enforcement action brought by the EPA in district court. While we are sympathetic with Aminoil\u2019s desire for a single, determinative proceeding, a desire which is certainly consistent with longstanding notions of judicial economy and the principle that needlessly duplicative litigation should be avoided, we do not believe the state courts are the proper forums for such a proceeding under either the Act or <em>Shell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1249-4\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-5\">The undisputed fact that the California courts are courts of general jurisdiction is not dispositive. Although these courts have jurisdiction over Aminoil\u2019s cause of action against the State Board, they may not necessarily have the power to join the Administrator as a party. It is settled that the United States, and its officers while acting in their official capacities, enjoy sovereign immunity. Thus, a state court may entertain an action against an officer of the federal government only if the United States has waived its immunity by consenting to suit or if the officer has exceeded his statutory or constitutional authority. <em>See, e.g., Dugan v. Rank, </em>372 U.S. 609, 620-22, 83 S.Ct. 999, 1006-07, 10 L.Ed.2d 15 (1963); <em>United States v. Sherwood, </em>312 U.S. 584, 586, 61 S.Ct. 767, 769, 85 L.Ed. 1058 (1941); <em>Martinez v. Marshall, </em>573 F.2d 555, 560 (9th Cir. 1977); <em>Smith v. Grimm, </em>534 F.2d 1346, 1351 n.6 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 980, 97 S.Ct. 493, 50 L.Ed.2d 589 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-6\">Aminoil argues that a 1976 amendment to the APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702, waives sovereign immunity in this case. That statute provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1249-9\">An action in a court of the United States seeking relief other than money damages and stating a claim that an agency or an officer or employee thereof acted or failed to act in an official capacity or under color of legal authority shall not be dismissed nor relief therein be denied on the ground that it is against the United States or that the United States is an indispensable party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1249-10\">This provision is clearly inapplicable. While we have held that section 702 waives the sovereign immunity of the United States for non-monetary claims against the government, <em>Hill </em>v. <em>United States, </em>571 F.2d 1098, 1102 (9th Cir. 1978), the waiver of sovereign immunity in section 702 is expressly limited to actions brought \u201cin a court of the United States . . . .\u201d The legislative history demonstrates that section 702 was not intended to effect a waiver of sovereign immunity for suits against the United States or its officers in state courts. \u201cThe consent to suit is also limited to claims in the courts of the United States; hence, the United States remains immune from suit in state courts.\u201d H.R.Rep.No.94-1656, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 11 (1976), <em>reprinted in </em>[1976] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 6121, 6131.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-11\">Aminoil also argues that sovereign immunity does not bar its suit because the Administrator acted beyond the scope of his statutory authority. It relies primarily <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> on <em>Larson v. Domestic &amp; Foreign Commerce Corp., </em>337 U.S. 682, 69 S.Ct. 1457, 93 L.Ed. 1628 (1949), where the Court wrote that \u201cwhere the officer\u2019s powers are limited by statute, his actions beyond those limitations are considered individual and not sovereign actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689, 69 S.Ct. at 1461. Aminoil maintains that if its Orange County property is not a \u201cwetlands\u201d properly subject to jurisdiction under the Act, the Ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>ministrator had no authority pursuant to the Act to issue his finding of violation or otherwise to influence the State Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-4\">We are not persuaded that <em>Larson </em>supports Aminoil\u2019s argument. There, the Court held that the key question in addressing the sovereign immunity of the United States is \u201cwhether the relief sought in a suit nominally addressed to the officer is relief against the sovereign.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687, 69 S.Ct. at 1460 (footnote omitted). The Court observed that where an officer of the United States acts in an unconstitutional manner or oversteps the limits of his statutorily delegated authority, his actions are not those of the sovereign and he may be held personally liable for monetary or equitable relief. <em>Id. </em>at 689-90, 69 S.Ct. at 1461. The relief Aminoil seeks, a determination that its Orange County property is not a wetlands subject to the Act and the NPDES system, is relief against the sovereign because it would preclude the Administrator in his official capacity from enforcing the Act. <em>Id. </em>at 688-89, 69 S.Ct. at 1461. <em>See Dugan v. Rank, supra, </em>372 U.S. at 620, 83 S.Ct. at 1006. Moreover, Aminoil clearly cannot maintain that the Administrator was not authorized by the Act to issue the \u201cfinding of violation.\u201d <em>See </em>Act \u00a7 309(a)(1), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1319(a)(1). <em>See also Malone v. Bowdoin, </em>369 U.S. 643, 648 n.9, 82 S.Ct. 980, 984 n.9, 8 L.Ed.2d 168 (1962). Its argument is that, since the Administrator incorrectly determined that the Orange County property is subject to federal jurisdiction, his actions were beyond the scope of his authority and are therefore not barred by sovereign immunity. <em>Larson, </em>however, clearly rejected this argument. A simple mistake of fact or law does not necessarily mean that an officer of the government has exceeded the scope of his authority. Official action is still action of the sovereign, even if it is wrong, if it \u201cdo[es] not conflict with the terms of [the officer\u2019s] valid statutory authority . . . . \u201d 337 U.S. at 695, 69 S.Ct. at 1464.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-7\">Aminoil argues, finally, that consent to suit should be implied from the dual enforcement scheme of the Act itself. It contends that having vested state tribunals with jurisdiction to decide matters in which the EPA has an interest, Congress implicitly bestowed jurisdiction on those courts over the EPA. Aminoil relies on <em>United States v. Hellard, </em>322 U.S. 363, 64 S.Ct. 985, 88 L.Ed. 1326 (1944), where the Court found implied consent to suit in state court from an act of Congress which subjected United States land (Indian property) to state law, and provided that (1) the United States would be bound by state court judgments, and (2) the United States must be given an opportunity to appear in state court actions. <em>Id. </em>at 364, 64 S.Ct. at 986. Neither of these provisions appears in the Act. If the latter did appear, Aminoil might justifiably claim that Congress had consented to joinder of the EPA in state court actions for review of NPDES permit decisions. Yet in the absence of statutory provisions similar to those involved in <em>Hellard, </em>and particularly in light of the delicate partnership between federal and state administrative agencies created by the Act, we are unwilling to infer that Congress has implicitly consented to state court actions against the EPA or the Administrator.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1250-8\">A congressional waiver is not to be lightly implied; absent an unequivocal expression of congressional consent to suit, sovereign immunity bars even a claim for non-monetary relief against the government. <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>445 U.S. 535, 538, 100 S.Ct. 1349, 1352, 63 L.Ed.2d 607 (1980); <em>United States v. Testan, </em>424 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1235\">*1235</page-number>U.S. 392, 399, 96 S.Ct. 948, 953, 47 L.Ed.2d 114 (1976); <em>Hill v. United States, supra. </em>There is no clear indication of intent to waive immunity in this ease. Indeed, the Act\u2019s structure strongly supports the opposite inference \u2014 a congressional intent to preclude the exercise of state court jurisdiction over the EPA or the Administrator. Far from an unequivocal expression of consent to joinder of the agency in state court, the Act\u2019s allocation of dual enforcement authority to state and federal agencies suggests a similar allocation of judicial authority, confining review of formal EPA action to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-5\">In addition to the question of sovereign immunity, our holding is also compelled by an analysis of the issue of jurisdiction. Although the Act is silent as to the scope of state court jurisdiction, the remedies provided in the Act for review of allegedly improper EPA action lie in the federal courts. For example, the agency\u2019s issuance or denial of a permit under section 402 and its action in making any determination as to a state permit program are directly re viewable in the United States courts of appeals. Act \u00a7 509(b)(1)(D), (F), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1369(b)(1)(D), (F). <em>Cf. Crown Simpson Pulp Co. v. Costle, </em>445 U.S. 193, 100 S.Ct. 1093, 63 L.Ed.2d 312 (1980) (per curiam) (EPA\u2019s formal objection to a state-issued permit, pursuant to section 402(d)(2), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(d)(2), is directly reviewable in the courts of appeals). The federal district courts have jurisdiction over civil enforcement actions brought by the Administrator. Act \u00a7 309(b), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1319(b). Further, section 505(a) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365(a), authorizes any citizen to bring a civil action in the district courts for enforcement of the Act against parties who discharge pollutants or against the Administrator for his failure to perform any non-discretionary act or duty under the Act. <em>See </em>Note 7, <em>supra. </em>Although the Act does not expressly provide that these remedies against the EPA and the Administrator are exclusive,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> when interpreting a statute as detailed as the Act, the remedies provided are presumed to be exclusive absent clear contrary evidence of legislative intent. <em>See National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. National Ass\u2019n of Railroad Passengers, </em>414 U.S. 453, 458, 94 S.Ct. 690, 693, 38 L.Ed.2d 646 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-8\">Nothing in the legislative history of the Act provides such a clear indication of contrary legislative intent. <em>See Middlesex County Sewerage Auth. v. National Sea Clammers Ass\u2019n, </em>453 U.S. 1, 14, 101 S.Ct. 2615, 2623, 69 L.Ed.2d 435 (1981). Indeed, we infer from the EPA\u2019s statutory right to intervene in a \u201ccitizen suit\u201d filed in district court, <em>see </em>Act \u00a7 505(c)(2), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365(c)(2), and from the lack of any correlative right to intervene in state court actions, a congressional intent to preclude state court jurisdiction over the agency or the Administrator. If, therefore, as Aminoil argues, it will remain subject to independent and potentially conflicting federal authority absent joinder of the EPA in its state court action, it is because \u201c[pjroper respect for both the integrity and independence of the state [judicial] mechanism, mandated by Congress in this context,\u201d requires that result. <em>See Shell, supra, </em>585 F.2d at 414-15. Holding otherwise would sharply conflict with the EPA\u2019s independent authority to supervise state permit programs under the Act. <em>See </em>Act \u00a7 402(i), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(i); S.Rep.No.95-370, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 73 (emphasizing importance of \u201cvigorous\u201d EPA oversight), <em>reprinted in </em>[1977] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4326, 4398. Section 402(i) expressly permits the EPA to take enforcement action in federal court notwithstanding the existence of a lawfully-issued state NPDES permit or the EPA\u2019s prior approval of such a permit. If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>EPA finds that any person is in violation of the Act, it must issue a finding of violation and institute a civil enforcement action in federal court if the state agency involved itself fails to commence \u201cappropriate enforcement action.\u201d Act \u00a7 309(a)(1), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1319(a)(1). Thus, allowing joinder of the EPA in a state court action could create substantial practical impediments to the EPA\u2019s exercise of its supervisory responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-4\">Therefore, this is not a case in which construing the Act to preclude state court review of federal agency action \u201ccreat[es] ... a seemingly irrational bifurcated system.\u201d <em>Crown Simpson Pulp Co. v. Costle, supra, </em>445 U.S. at 197, 100 S.Ct. at 1095 (footnote omitted). We hold, as did the district court, that judicial review of EPA action, whether under the Act or section 10 of the APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704, must await final EPA action and must be initiated in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-6\">This holding does not conflict with our previous decision in <em>United States v. ITT Rayonier, Inc., </em>627 F.2d 996 (9th Cir. 1980) <em>(Rayonier). </em>There, we held that the Act\u2019s allocation of concurrent enforcement authority does not prevent the EPA from being collaterally estopped based upon a state court action, to which it was not a party, for review of the terms of a state-issued NPDES permit. <em>Id. </em>at 1002, 1003-04. Aminoil argues that a very limited extension of <em>Rayonier </em>would allow the EPA or the Administrator to be joined as a party to a state court action. It contends that it is inconsistent to hold, as we did in <em>Rayonier, </em>that the EPA may be bound by a state court decision to which it was not a party, but that it may not be joined in a state court action, the disposition of which may bind it. According to Aminoil, therefore, the obvious corollary of <em>Rayonier </em>is that the EPA may be joined in a state court action for review of a NPDES permit decision by a state agency.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1252-9\"><em>Rayonier </em>involved the proper construction of a state-issued NPDES permit which provided that effluent limitations for certain pollutants would be modified to be consistent with any final guidelines promulgated by the EPA. When those guidelines were promulgated, the state agency issued an order which required the permit holder to comply with the federal guidelines. After the EPA issued a finding of violation to the permit holder and the state agency pursuant to section 309(a)(1) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1319(a)(1), a state court reversed the state agency, finding that the language of the permit excused compliance with the federal guidelines pending judicial approval of the final guidelines. The EPA then filed its own enforcement action in district court pursuant to section 309(b) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1319(b). <em>Rayonier, supra, </em>627 F.2d at 999. We reversed the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for the EPA. We reasoned that the Act was not such a countervailing statutory policy as to preclude application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel. <em>Id. </em>at 1000-02. We further reasoned that collateral estoppel was applicable because \u201c[i]n the context of [that] case,\u201d the EPA and the state agency were in privity. <em>Id. </em>at 1003. We clearly indicated, however, that the issues presented in <em>Rayonier </em>\u201cmay be <em>sui generis. \u201d Id. </em>at 1004.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-10\">We do not believe that <em>Rayonier </em>supports the position for which Aminoil argues. First, the case is distinguishable from the instant dispute. Although <em>Rayonier </em>places a limitation on the EPA\u2019s ability to bring an independent enforcement action, it is a spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1237\">*1237</page-number>cific, narrow limit. <em>Rayonier </em>involved construction of a state-issued NPDES permit. Here, in contrast, the substantive issue presented in Aminoil\u2019s complaint is whether its Orange County property is a \u201cwetlands\u201d within the meaning of certain lawfully-promulgated administrative regulations. In other words, the issue is whether federal jurisdiction over \u201cnavigable waters\u201d extends to Aminoil\u2019s property and therefore makes that property subject to the requirements of the Act. We recently concluded that a holding under state law is not dispos-itive of the question of navigability under federal law. <em>Puget Sound Power &amp; Light Co. v. Federal Energy Regulatory Comm\u2019n, </em>644 F.2d 785, 788 (9th Cir. 1981). <em>Puget Sound, </em>therefore, implies that there are situations in which the \u201cwetlands\u201d issue cannot be finally determined by a state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-5\">Alternatively, even if the EPA could be collaterally estopped in a subsequent enforcement action, it does not necessarily follow that state courts can exercise jurisdiction over the agency or its Administrator. The doctrine of sovereign immunity and the allocation of judicial authority implicit in the structure of the Act preclude the states from exercising jurisdiction over the EPA. This allocation of federal-state jurisdiction follows logically from the framework of cooperative federalism created by the Act. Thus, the preclusion of state court jurisdiction is a product of the congressional policy judgment underlying the Act itself. It is not for us to revise that congressional judgment merely because it may place private litigants in the unenviable and burdensome position of being required to litigate their liability under the Act in two separate judicial systems. <em>See Central Hudson Gas &amp; Elec. Corp. v. EPA, </em>587 F.2d 549, 559 (2d Cir. 1978). Therefore, if it is inconsistent with <em>Rayonier </em>to hold that the EPA may not be joined as a party to a state court action the disposition of which may ultimately bind it, it is the responsibility of Congress to correct any such inconsistency by amending the Act to allow the EPA to be joined in state court actions for review of state agency NPDES permit decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-8\">We recognize, on the other hand, that our holding does not comport well with traditional notions of judicial economy and the principle that needlessly duplicative litigation should be avoided. We emphasize, therefore, that we hold only that, in order to be consistent with <em>Shell, </em>nonfinal EPA action is not reviewable in the federal courts by means of joining the EPA as a party to a state court action seeking review of a state NPDES permit decision. Under both the Act and section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704, review of EPA action must await final agency action and must be initiated in federal court.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1253-9\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-10\">The district court\u2019s order dismissing the Administrator as a party, and its final judgment entered as to the Administrator, are affirmed. As the only basis for federal jurisdiction in this case was the Administrator\u2019s right to remove this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442(a)(1), the district court should remand the remainder of the action to the state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1245-10\">. The states are required to transmit a copy of any permit application to the Administrator. Act \u00a7 402(d)(1), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(d)(1). The Administrator may waive this notification requirement, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 402(e), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(e), and may also waive his authority to veto any particular state-issued permit. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 402(d)(3), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(d)(3). He has done neither in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1246-7\">. Section 402(i) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(i), provides that \u201cnothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of the Administrator to take action pursuant to section 309 of this Act.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1247-7\">. Actually, the district court stated that the EPA must take \u201cformal\u201d rather than \u201cfinal\u201d action before it may be sued pursuant to the Act. For accuracy, we made the change in the text. The EPA\u2019s issuance of a finding of violation, unlike the recommendation at issue in <em>Shell, </em>is undoubtedly formal action authorized by \u00a7 309(a)(1) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1319(a)(1). <em>See </em>Note 4, <em>infra. </em>Like the recommendation at issue in <em>Shell, </em>on the other hand, a finding of violation is not \u201cfinal agency action\u201d within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704. <em>See Shell Oil Co. v. Train, </em>585 F.2d 408, 414 (9th Cir. 1978). The difference between the two words is not material in light of the present procedural posture of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1247-8\">. The EPA informally recommended denial of Shell\u2019s application for a permit variance pursuant to a \u201cmemorandum of understanding\u201d between the State Board and the EPA\u2019s Region IX office in San Francisco. <em>Shell, supra, </em>585 F.2d at 411. Unlike the instant case, the EPA did not issue a formal \u201cfinding of violation\u201d under section 309(a)(1) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1319(a)(1), or take any other action pursuant to its statutory authority to supervise state NPDES permit programs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1247-11\">. The <em>Shell </em>decision has met with some criticism. <em>See </em>Note, <em>Jurisdiction to Review Informal EPA Influence Upon State Decisionmaking Under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act: Shell Oil Co. v. Train, </em>92 Harv.L.Rev. 1814 (1979), and <em>Shell, supra, </em>585 F.2d at 415-21 (Wallace, J., dissenting). However, <em>Shell </em>is binding precedent in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1249-7\">. Aminoil also cites <em>Philadelphia Co. v. Stimson, </em>223 U.S. 605, 32 S.Ct. 340, 56 L.Ed. 570 (1912). This case is easily distinguishable because there the plaintiff sought to impose personal liability on an officer of the United States for a wrongful taking of property. <em>Id. </em>at 619, 32 S.Ct. at 344. Here, in contrast, Aminoil did not join the Administrator in his individual capacity and is not seeking to impose personal liability on him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1250-5\">. Section 505(a) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365(a), authorizes any citizen to bring a civil action in district court against alleged violators of the Act or against the Administrator for his failure to perform any nondiscretionary act or duty under the Act. Some courts have held that this section effects a waiver of sovereign immunity. <em>See, e.g., South Carolina Wildlife Federation v. Alexander, </em>457 F.Supp. 118, 122 (D.S.C.1978); <em>Township of Long Beach v. City of New York, </em>445 F.Supp. 1203, 1210 (D.N.J.1978). We do not pass upon that question. But to the extent this section might be interpreted to indicate congressional intent to waive sovereign immunity, it militates against the implied consent argued for by Aminoil because the section is, by its own terms, limited to the federal district courts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1251-6\">. Some courts have suggested that the jurisdiction of the courts of appeals under section 509(b)(1), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1369(b)(1), is exclusive. <em>See Central Hudson Gas &amp; Elec. Corp. v. EPA, 587 </em>F.2d 549, 555 (2d Cir. 1978); <em>American Frozen Food Inst. </em>v. <em>Train, </em>539 F.2d 107, 124 (D.C.Cir.1976); <em>American Petroleum Inst. v. Train, </em>526 F.2d 1343, 1345-46 (10th Cir. 1975). In addition, it appears that the district courts\u2019 jurisdiction over civil enforcement actions initiated by the Administrator is \u201cexclusive of the courts of the States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1355.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1252-7\">. There appears to us to be an inconsistency between this argument and Aminoil\u2019s prior contention. On the one hand, Aminoil insisted earlier that it should be permitted to join the Administrator as a party to its state court action because otherwise, even if it is successful in that suit, it may be forced to relitigate the wetlands issue if the EPA decides to exercise its supervisory authority under the Act. On the other hand, Aminoil now argues that the Administrator should be joined as a party because otherwise <em>Rayonier </em>will preclude him from relitigating the issue in a subsequent civil enforcement action. In that situation, however, Aminoil\u2019s fear of being denied a single, determinative adjudication would be unfounded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1253-6\">. We do not decide that it is impossible for private litigants such as Aminoil to obtain a single, dispositive determination of the \u201cwetlands\u201d issue. For example, we do not consider the propriety of filing an action for a declaratory judgment in the federal district court and joining the EPA and the appropriate state agency as defendants. Nothing in our decision precludes the federal courts from exercising jurisdiction over an EPA-approved state agency. Absent problems of ripeness, it may be that there are no substantial barriers to application of the federal Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201. See <em>Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, </em>387 U.S. 136, 139-41, 153-54, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 1510 11, 1517-18, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967). See <em>also Califano v.
