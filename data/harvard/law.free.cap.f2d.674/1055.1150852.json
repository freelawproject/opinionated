We affirm the Commission\u2019s rule-making and vacation orders, but we find that review of the Commission\u2019s discriminatory-rate adjudication is now moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1057\">*1057</page-number>The underlying central issue concerns the substantive and procedural propriety of the Commission\u2019s actions in adopting a new standard or rule of a narrow nature. The narrow area of the rule focuses on the determination of whether a common carrier has under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10741(b) subjected a port to rates that are unreasonably discriminatory with regard to those to other ports, in instances where that carrier does not itself provide direct service but must do so by joint rates issued in conjunction with a connecting carrier. The new standard requires a finding that the originating carrier has <em>actually </em>contributed to or controlled the rate insofar as it is discriminatory. Under the prior or replaced standard, the originating and connecting carriers were conclusively presumed to have \u201ccommon control\u201d of the joint rates \u2014 that, acting in conjunction as a network, they directly and effectively controlled the rates between the preferred port and the prejudiced port. For reasons to be stated, we find the Commission\u2019s adoption of a new rule of decision to be non-arbitrary and within its administrative discretion and the statutory limits for that discretion set by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-5\">We should further note that the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, Pub.L.No.96-448, 94 Stat. 1895 (1980), was not signed by the President into law until October 14, 1980. Without intimating that our rationale would necessarily be affected otherwise, we note that the Act does not apply to our review of the present decisions of the Commission, which were docketed (and decided) prior to the effective date of the Act. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 706. <em>Introductory Summary</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1073-6\">In the attached appendix, we have set forth the full citation and nomenclature of the proceedings and parties to whom we will refer herein. As shown by these proceedings, the context in which the present issues arise is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-7\">In 1977, Frisco (a rail carrier) published reduced carload rates on wheat from origins in Oklahoma and Kansas to various Texas ports (Houston, Galveston, etc. \u2014 \u201cother Texas ports\u201d), but not to Corpus Christi. Prior to this publication, the rates had been equal to all Texas ports; the reduced rates for the other Texas ports were about 3V6 cents per hundred pounds less than those for Corpus Christi. Various Corpus Christi port and shipping interests protested, including Nueces County (a Texas port district), Producers (a regional grain marketing cooperative with a large-volume grain elevator at Corpus Christi), and Dreyfus (a large-scale shipper of grain that used the Producers elevator at Corpus Christi). The basis of their protest was that the rates were unduly preferential of the other Texas ports, and prejudicial to the Corpus Christi port, in violation of former Section 3(1) of the Interstate Commerce Act, now (in the 1978 recodification) 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10741(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-9\">Frisco had lowered the rates to the other Texas ports to meet rail and truck rate-competition. The reason it had not done so for Corpus Christi was that Frisco had no direct line into that port, and the other connecting rail carriers to that port (MoPac and Southern Pacific) had refused to concur in a lowered joint rate equivalent to that published for the other ports.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-10\">In its 1977 decision in <em>Wheat I </em>(see appendix for this and other citations herein) rejecting these protests, the Commission held that Frisco was not in control of and did not participate in the disparate rates for Corpus Christi, because Frisco had made a good faith offer of division of the joint rates (to divide the lower rates fairly between the connecting carriers and itself), but these carriers had rejected this offer. Due <em>inter alia </em>to the protestant\u2019s contention that Frisco\u2019s reduced rates to other Texas ports violated outstanding Commission orders in 1954 and 1961 decisions in <em>Corpus Christi I, </em>the Commission reopened <em>Wheat I. </em>In <em>Wheat II </em>(1979), it then reinstated its holding that the Frisco rates to Corpus Christi were not unreasonably discriminatory (for the same reason of Frisco\u2019s lack of control thereof), but it also ordered the <em>Corpus Christi I </em>cases to be reopened to determine whether those decisions were consistent with <em>Wheat II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1073-11\">In <em>Corpus Christi I </em>(1954 and 1961), the Commission had concluded that the joint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1058\">*1058</page-number>rates of various carriers transporting grain from the Midwest were unduly prejudicial to Corpus Christi and unduly preferential of the other ports. In so finding, the Commission relied upon a presumed network \u201ccommon control\u201d of joint rates, so that- \u2014 if the joint rate was discriminatory \u2014 each of the carriers joining in it was held to participate in the discriminatory rate. Accordingly, the Commission entered \u201calternative orders,\u201d which were still in effect at the time of <em>Wheat I </em>(1977) and <em>Wheat II </em>(1979). (By an alternative order issued to correct discriminatory rates, the offending carrier(s) are ordered to abate the discrimination by raising one rate, lowering the other, or altering both. <em>See, e.g., Texas &amp; Pacific Ry. Co. v. United States, </em>289 U.S. 627, 650, 53 S.Ct. 768, 776, 77 L.Ed. 1410 (1933).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-4\">Pursuant to <em>Wheat II, </em>after service, notice was published in the Federal Register reopening the <em>Corpus Christi I </em>cases (1954 and 1961). <em>Wheat II, </em>then before this court on petition for review, was on motion remanded to the Commission for its further consideration. In the resulting <em>Corpus Christi II, </em>decided in 1980, the Commission expressly abandoned its former presumed \u201ccommon control\u201d of joint rates and held that, in the determination of discriminatory rate issues under \u00a7 10741(b), it would in the future utilize an analysis of actual control by the originating carrier (applying the good faith order of divisions test enunciated in the <em>Wheat </em>cases).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It therefore vacated the decisions in <em>Corpus Christi I </em>and reaffirmed its holdings in <em>Wheat I </em>and <em>Wheat </em>II.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1074-10\">Wheat <em>Adjudications Moot</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1074-11\">Before discussing the viable issues under review, we note of our own motion that the <em>Wheat </em>adjudications (that Frisco\u2019s grain rates to Corpus Christi are not shown to be unreasonably discriminatory under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1059\">*1059</page-number>\u00a7 10741(b)) are moot. Following <em>Wheat I, </em>MoPac concurred in a reduced joint rate to Corpus Christi equivalent to the reduction published for the other Texas ports. As a result, it is not contested that Corpus Christi is no longer prejudiced by the Frisco rates initially complained of. Accordingly, the three petitions for review that raise issues directed solely to the invalidity of the <em>Wheat </em>determinations<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> are dismissed<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-5\">No suggestion of mootness is made with regard to the <em>Corpus Christi II </em>issues presented by the remaining petition for review. <em>See </em>note 3. That decision\u2019s vacation of the continuing rate-equalization orders in <em>Corpus Christi I </em>deprived Corpus Christi interests of a former remedy by which to attack rail rate disparities; and its adoption by way of rule-making of a new rule (actual control, rather than the formerly presumed common control of joint rates) has obvious continuing effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-6\">\n<em>The Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-7\">The remaining issues presented to us for review may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1075-12\">I. A substantive attack upon the Commission\u2019s replacement of the former presumed \u201ccommon control\u201d rule by the new \u201cactual control\u201d test as an unjustified abrogation by the Commission of its previously settled interpretation designed to advance the anti-discriminatory purposes of the Interstate Commerce Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1075-13\">II. A primarily procedural attack upon the Commission\u2019s vacation by <em>Corpus Christi II </em>in 1980 of its 1954 and 1961 <em>Corpus Christi I </em>decisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1075-14\">I. <em>The Commission\u2019s Replacement of the Presumed \u201cCommon Control\u201d Rule by an \u201cActual Control\u201d Test</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1075-15\">In the context of the scheme of the Interstate Commerce Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d), where carriers are permitted to establish rates for their services, the Act provides that no common carrier may \u201csubject a person, place, port, or type of traffic to <em>unreasonable discrimination.\u201d </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10741(b) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is to be noted that this provision includes within its scope only whether a given carrier provides discriminatory rates to a preferred and to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1060\">*1060</page-number>prejudiced point; it has no application where the rates of a given carrier to one point are disparate with those of another carrier to an equivalent point. <em>Texas &amp; Pacific Ry. Co. v. United States, </em>289 U.S. 627, 649-50, 53 S.Ct. 768, 776, 77 L.Ed. 1410 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-4\">With regard to joint rates to a point\u2014 those combined charges for the services of both the originating and the connecting carriers (with division thereof decided between the joining carriers) \u2014 the Supreme Court early stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1076-5\">participation in joint rates does not make connecting carriers partners. They can be held jointly and severally responsible for unjust discrimination only if each carrier has participated in some way in that which causes the unjust discrimination .... If this were not so, the legality or illegality of a carrier\u2019s practice would depend, not on its own act, but on the acts of connecting carriers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1076-6\"><em>Central Railroad Company of New Jersey </em>v. <em>United States, </em>257 U.S. 247, 259, 42 S.Ct. 80, 83, 66 L.Ed. 217 (1921). As the Court later stated, reiterating the point: \u201cA carrier or a group of carriers must be the common source of the discrimination \u2014 must <em>effectively </em>participate in both rates, if an order for correction of the disparity is to run against it or them.\u201d <em>Texas &amp; Pacific Ry. Co., supra, </em>289 U.S. at 650, 53 S.Ct. at 776. (Emphasis supplied.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1076-11\">By way of further background, a rate-discrimination case, \u00a7 10741(b), is established by showing (1) that there is a disparity in rates, (2) that the complaining party is competitively injured, actually or potentially, (3) that the carriers are the common source of both the allegedly prejudicial and preferential treatment, and (4) that the disparity in rates is not justified by transportation conditions. The complaining party has the burden of proving the presence of the first three factors, and the carriers have the burden of justifying the disparity, if possible, in connection with the fourth factor. <em>See, e.g., Chicago &amp; Eastern Illinois Railroad Company v. United States, </em>384 F.Supp. 298 (N.D.Ill.1974), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>421 U.S. 956, 95 S.Ct. 1943, 44 L.Ed.2d 445 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-12\">The issue before us involves solely the third element needed to establish a claim of discriminatory rate \u2014 that the carrier be the \u201ccommon source\u201d of both prejudicial and preferential rates. The order issued in <em>Cor</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1061\">*1061</page-number><em>pus Christi II </em>\u2014establishing an \u201cactual control\u201d test rather than a presumed \u201ccommon control\u201d of joint rates \u2014 resulted from notice served and published in the Federal Register to the effect that the Commission was \u201cconsidering moving from a conclusive presumption of common control to an analysis of actual control over the joint rates.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The decision of the Commission in <em>Corpus Christi II </em>limited its consideration to this criterion,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and its modification of its former test to determine whether a carrier is the \u201ccommon source\u201d of the discriminatory rates is the only substantive issued posed for us by this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-5\">\n<em>A. \u201cPresumed Common Control\u201d and \u201cActual Control\u201d Tests</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-6\">In <em>Texas &amp; Pacific Ry. Co., supra, </em>as previously noted, the Supreme Court had indicated that, for a carrier participating in allegedly discriminatory joint rates to meet the \u201ccommon source\u201d requirement (i.e., that the carrier be the source of both the prejudicial and the preferential rate), the carrier \u201cmust <em>effectively </em>participate in both rates.\u201d 289 U.S. at 650, 53 S.Ct. at 776 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-12\">At the times that the <em>Corpus Christi I </em>cases were decided in 1954 and 1961, the Commission used a \u201cnetwork common control\u201d theory to determine whether carriers effectively participated in a discriminatory joint rate. By this test, the Commission, in effect, conclusively presumed common control because the carriers involved acted as a network, so that each was responsible for the joint rate. In the 1954 <em>Corpus Christi </em>case, the carriers were found to have effec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1062\">*1062</page-number>tive common control of the rates simply by virtue of carrier participation in joint rates. <em>See </em>291 I.C.C. at 469-470. In the 1961 <em>Corpus Christi </em>case, the carriers attempted to argue that \u201cno one carrier effectively controls the rates to Corpus Christi and the other allegedly preferred ports.\u201d 315 I.C.C. at 162. Without any discussion of the matter, but citing <em>Texas &amp; Pacific Ry., supra, </em>the Commission asserted that the carriers \u201cacting in conjunction with the originating lines, directly and effectively control the rates.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1078-4\">During the 1970\u2019s the Commission began to modify its approach to this analysis of common control. For example, in <em>Soybeans, Midwest to Chicago and Gulf Ports, Export, </em>335 I.C.C. 883, 890 (1970), <em>vacated as moot, </em>416 U.S. 953, 94 S.Ct. 1964, 40 L.Ed.2d 303 (1974), the Commission refused to find common control by an origin carrier where connecting carriers refused to concur in rate changes, and where there was no showing of mutual and joint participation in the action alleged to be discriminatory. In <em>Corn and Soybeans Midwest to Gulf Ports, For Export, </em>349 I.C.C. 1, 4 (1974), the Commission held that where a carrier served one port directly and one by means of a joint service with a second railroad, section 10741(b) \u201cdoes not give this Commission the power to require equalized rates in the event that the second railroad refuses to participate in an equalized joint rates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AI0\">The Commission\u2019s movement away from applying a conclusive presumption of common control of joint rates culminated in <em>Wheat I </em>and, particularly, in <em>Wheat II. </em>In the latter decision, the Commission explicitly adopted an \u201cactual control\u201d test, see note 1, and explicitly rejected the common-control presumption:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-5\">To summarize, because of the need to assure rate flexibility, we have required proof that the railroads actually control the rates to the preferred and prejudiced ports. In this regard, we believe that the presumption of control extending from the existence of a network such as was found to exist in the Corpus Christi cases is insufficient to assure that actual control exists. While seeking proof of actual control, we have allowed the railroad to show that it does not have such control because it could not, after acting in good faith, arrive at divisions agreements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1078-10\"><em>Wheat II, </em>359 I.C.C. at 604. As a consequence, after service and publication of notice, reopening <em>Corpus Christi I </em>to consider a substitution of an actual control test for the former presumption of network control, see note 7, the Commission by way of a rule-making procedure adopted in <em>Corpus Christi II </em>the order presently under review: \u201cThe actual control standard shall be used to determine the common source of unreasonable discrimination under 49 U.S.C. 10741(b) in future challenges to carrier rate adjustments to the ports in these proceedings.\u201d 364 I.C.C. at 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-11\">\n<em>B. The Scope of Our Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-12\">The scope of our review of Interstate Commerce Commission action is reiterated in <em>Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad Company v. United States, </em>632 F.2d 392 (5th Cir. 1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 1017, 101 S.Ct. 3004, 69 L.Ed.2d 388 (1981), which involved, in part, the Commission\u2019s adoption of a different standard for determining whether a railway merger is \u201cconsistent with public interest.\u201d We stated: \u201cWe can ask only whether the Commission has observed the statutory limits that Congress has set for its discretion, whether its action was arbitrary or capricious, or whether its findings are supported by adequate analysis and substantial evidence in the record as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-13\">The \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard is narrow and permits a reviewing court merely to consider whether the agency decision \u201cwas based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 416, 91 S.Ct. 814, 823-24, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971). The \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard requires a determination that agency findings are supported by \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. N. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1063\">*1063</page-number><em>L. R. B., </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 217, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938). If the evidence of record is such that it supports inconsistent inferences and conclusions, the courts must defer to administrative choice. <em>Illinois Central Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Co., </em>385 U.S. 57, 69, 87 S.Ct. 255, 262, 17 L.Ed.2d 162 (1966). This same standard of review is used in our review of a Commission rate determination. <em>See Systems-Fuels, Inc. v. United States, </em>642 F.2d 112 (5th Cir. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-5\">The judicial deference that is accorded to a Commission action of the present nature is attributable to the fact that \u201cthe courts have always recognized that Congress intended to commit to the Commission the determination, by application of an informed judgment to existing facts, of the existence of forbidden preferences, advantages and discrimination.\u201d <em>United States v. Chicago Heights Trucking Co., </em>310 U.S. 344, 352-53, 60 S.Ct. 931, 936, 84 L.Ed. 1243 (1940). The broad discretion thus accorded to the I.C.C. in these cases has long been recognized as necessary to the types of value judgments therein involved:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-6\">Whether a preference or advantage or discrimination is undue or unreasonable or unjust is one of those questions of fact that have been confided by Congress to the judgment and discretion of the Commission ... and upon which its decisions, made the basis of administrative orders operating in future, are not to be disturbed by the courts except upon a showing that they are unsupported by evidence, were made without a hearing, exceed constitutional limits or for some other reason amount to an abuse of power.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6f\"><em>Manufacturers\u2019 Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>246 U.S. 457, 481, 38 S.Ct. 383, 389, 62 L.Ed. 831 (1918).</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-7\">The \u201cnarrow scope within which Congress has confined judicial participation\u201d in the Commission\u2019s rate determinations is attributable to the fact that \u201c[t]he process of rate making is essentially empiric . . . fluid and changing . .. [involving] factors that must be valued as well as weighed.\u201d Congress .has, therefore, given the Commission \u201cthe duty of being responsive to the dynamic character of transportation problems.\u201d <em>Board of Trade of Kansas City v. United States, </em>314 U.S. 534, 546, 62 S.Ct. 366, 372, 86 L.Ed. 432 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-9\">\n<em>C. The Actual Common Control Standard</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-10\">In adopting the actual common control standard, the Commission swept away a presumption of network common control that it used for many years to impose strict liability on carriers based on their participation in joint rates and the presence of interconnecting rail lines. We must now determine, within the narrow scope of review that we have, whether the Commission acted properly in abolishing this former presumption and in adopting, instead, a test that centers on factual issues that determine whether the carrier participated in the <em>actual </em>control of the disparate joint rate claimed to be discriminatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-11\">When we considered a Commission change in policy in the context of railroad mergers, we stated that \u201cit is established beyond argument that an agency may change its policies so long as it identifies and articulates its reasons for doing so.\u201d <em>Missouri-Kansas-Texas, supra, </em>632 F.2d at 403. Our opinion in <em>Missouri-Kansas-Texas </em>echoed that of the Supreme Court in <em>American Trucking Associations, Inc. v. Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway Company, </em>387 U.S. 397, 87 S.Ct. <em>tions, Inc. v. Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway Company, </em>387 U.S. 397, 87 S.Ct. 1608, 18 L.Ed.2d 847 (1967), in which the Commission had changed its former interpretations and then argued, much as the Commission does in the present case, that its past interpretation was based on an erroneous interpretation of principles enunciated by various judicial decisions. The Supreme Court did not, however, rest its analysis of the propriety of the Commission change in interpretation on the Commission\u2019s argument that its own prior decisions in a course of twenty-five years were <em>erroneous. </em>Rather, instead it specifically recognized the ability of the Commission to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1064\">*1064</page-number>change its mind and to change its prior interpretations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1080-4\">[T]he Commission, faced with new developments or in light of consideration of the relevant facts and its mandate, may alter its past interpretation and overturn past administrative rulings and practice .... Regulatory agencies do not establish rules of conduct to last forever; they are supposed, within the limits of the law and of fair and prudent administration, to adopt their rules and practices to the Nation\u2019s needs in a volatile, changing economy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1080-5\">387 U.S. at 416, 87 S.Ct. at 1618.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-6\">Our principal concern, then, is to determine whether the Commission has observed the statutory limits that Congress has set for its discretion, and that the Commission has exercised such discretion and has explained its departure from previous policy so that a reviewing court may determine that the decision is reasoned and not arbitrary. <em>Burlington Truck Lines v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 156, 167-68, 83 S.Ct. 239, 245, 9 L.Ed.2d 207 (1962); <em>Missouri-Kansas-Texas, supra, </em>632 F.2d at 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-7\">Applying the criteria set forth above, we first note that, under section 10741(b) of the Act, Congress gave the Commission a mandate \u201cto protect persons, places, ports, or traffic types from unreasonable discrimination. This duty was reiterated in transportation policy sections of the revised Interstate Commerce Act 49 U.S.C. 10101.\u201d <em>Corpus Christi II, </em>364 I.C.C. at 276. \u201cWhether a discrimination in rules or services of a carrier is undue or unreasonable has always been regarded as peculiarly a question committed to the judgment of the administrative body, based upon an appreciation of all the facts and circumstances affecting the traffic.\u201d <em>New York v. United States, </em>331 U.S. 284, 347, 67 S.Ct. 1207, 1240, 91 L.Ed. 1492 (1947). Despite the petitioners\u2019 claims to the contrary, Congress has never sanctioned the \u201cnetwork common control\u201d standard, nor is there any semblance of Congressional intent that such standard be frozen into the administrative process of determining whether joint rates are discriminatory.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, the Commission\u2019s abolition of the network common control presumption, and its new practice of requiring proof of actual joint control, is not shown to be a matter not entrusted to the Commission\u2019s sound discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-12\">Likewise, the Commission clearly explained its departure from previous policy so that we may determine whether its deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1065\">*1065</page-number>sion is arbitrary and not irrationally founded. The Commission provided extended discussions of the actual common control standard in both <em>Wheat </em>cases, in its Federal Register announcement of reopening of the <em>Corpus Christi I </em>cases, and in the <em>Corpus Christi II </em>decision itself. The Commission explained that its network common control standard was tantamount to a presumption that imposed strict liability on carriers for the existence of rate disparities. The Commission now wishes to abandon the network common control standard, and adopt a standard that will impose liability only when there is <em>actual </em>control, to accord with actual fact rather than resulting from an arbitrary presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">Thus, the Commission has determined upon an analysis to be utilized that it deems to be appropriate for the decision of discriminatory rate protests, a matter within its statutory authority. The adoption or change of a method of analysis to be used in the administrative decision of such matters is not shown to be beyond the discretion entrusted to the Commission in its administration of matters statutorily regulated by it. The Commission has clearly articulated a non-arbitrary basis for the method of analysis adopted by it. Finding these criteria are met, judicial review extends no further. We affirm the order in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">The petitioners produce seemingly endless arguments about the \u201cevils\u201d of the actual control standard. All of these arguments, however, assume that our court may engage in broad review and substitute its judgment for that of the well-reasoned decision of the Commission. We may not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-7\">II.' <em>The Procedural Attack upon the 1980 </em>Corpus Christi II <em>Vacation of the 1954 and 1961 </em>Corpus Christi I <em>Decisions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1081-8\">In 1979, the Commission reopened the 1954 and 1961 <em>Corpus Christi I </em>decisions to determine whether they should be modified and to consider whether the Commission should move from a conclusive presumption of network common control to an analysis of actual control as had been previously discussed in <em>Wheat II. </em>The Commission did so after service and after publication of notice (see note 7), in'procedures that fully complied with the rule-making requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act. <em>See Corpus Christi II, </em>364 I.C.C. at 271 72. Ultimately, the reopening led to the Commission\u2019s 1980 <em>Corpus Christi II, </em>which not only adopted the new actual control standard (see Part I of this opinion), but also to vacation of the <em>Corpus Christi I </em>1954 and 1961 decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-12\">The petitioners mount a procedural attack upon the vacation of these prior orders. They contend that in the 1980 reopening of the <em>Corpus Christi I </em>case, the Commission should have proceeded by adjudication and not by rulemaking and that the vacation of the <em>Corpus Christi I </em>orders were improper. We find no merit to these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-13\">The choice between rulemaking and adjudication \u201cis one that lies primarily in the informed discretion of the administrative agency.\u201d <em>S. E. C. </em>v. <em>Chenery Corporation, </em>332 U.S. 194, 203, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 1580, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947). The Commission is given rulemaking power in section 10321 of the Act,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the Commission may choose to use its rulemaking power as long as it does not abuse its discretion in so doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-14\">The Commission argues, and we accept, that rulemaking was particularly appropriate in this case because the purpose of re-opening the <em>Corpus Christi I </em>cases was to consider the adoption of a new standard of common control that would transcend the interests of the particular petitioners and carriers originally involved in the <em>Corpus Christi I </em>cases. Further, the petitioners have not shown any harm as a result of the agency decision to proceed by rulemaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-15\">The Commission was entirely reasonable in giving all interested parties an opportunity to comment on agency policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>and the Commission did not abuse its discretion in deciding to proceed by rulemak-ing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-4\">Similarly, the Commission did not act improperly in vacating the <em>Corpus Christi I </em>orders. The Commission has authority to reopen cases at any time, and the petitioners\u2019 claim that the cases should not be reopened simply because they were decided 18 and 25 years ago is without merit. <em>Cf., American Farm Lines v. Black Ball Freight Service, </em>397 U.S. 532, 540, 90 S.Ct. 1288, 1293, 25 L.Ed.2d 547 (1970). The Commission\u2019s vacation of the earlier continuing orders that conflicted with its new policy may reasonably be considered an appropriate method within the Commission\u2019s discretion by which it could implement its adoption of the new actual common control standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-5\">The petitioners\u2019 claim that the vacation was improper because it imposes retroactive liability is mistaken, because no retroactive liability was imposed. The original <em>Corpus Christi I </em>orders applied prospectively, and the only effect of the adoption of the new standard of actual common control is to permit unequalized rates in the future where no actual common control in fact exists. (If such unequalized rates are in fact proposed, the petitioners of course still have adequate remedy to protest them upon any grounds accorded by law.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-6\">The petitioners\u2019 final claim that the Commission should not have vacated the orders without determining whether common control to Corpus Christi exists under the new standard is without merit. As the Commission points out, the effect of vacation is not to change rates currently on file. If carriers subsequently initiate rate changes, they can be examined on an individual basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-7\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-8\">For the reasons stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-9\">(1) We DISMISS petitions in our docket nos. 78-1348, 79-1816, and 80 -1842, which attack the <em>Wheat </em>adjudications that rejected Corpus Christi claims of discriminatory rates, as MOOT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-10\">(2) We AFFIRM the orders complained of by the petition in our docket no. 80 1843, finding that these orders, (a) adopting the new actual control standard and (b) reopening and vacating the 1954 and 1961 <em>Corpus Christi I </em>orders, were procedurally proper and within the Commission\u2019s authority and discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1082-11\">DISMISSED AS MOOT IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-12\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-13\">The consolidated proceedings before us result from four petitions for review of Interstate Commerce Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d or \u201cthe I.C.C.\u201d) orders:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-14\">1. Our docket number 78-1348, being a petition filed by the Nueces County Navigation District No. 1, Corpus Christi (\u201cNueces County\u201d), a political subdivision of the State of Texas, which seeks review of a report and order of the Commission dated December 19, 1977, <em>Wheat, Oklahoma and Kansas to Texas Gulf Ports, </em>I.C.C. docket no. 36491 (Sub-No. 1), 357 I.C.C. 382 (1977), a decision that held that the\u2019 reduced rates of wheat from points in Oklahoma and Kansas to various Texas ports was not unduly preferential to them nor prejudicial to the Corpus Christi port.

Our docket number 80-1843, is yet another petition by Nueces County and by Producers Grain that seeks review of the same July 20, 1980 I.C.C. decision, <em>Corpus Christi II, supra, </em>but which in this instance attacks the reopening of the earlier 1954 and 1960 Nueces County decisions (the (a) holding above), and also attacks the decision\u2019s adoption of the new \u201cactual control\u201d standard in the above (b) portion of the ruling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1083-9\">A number of parties have intervened in the proceedings before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-10\">In support of the respondent Commission, the following rail carriers intervened: The Missouri Pacific Railroad (\u201cMoPac\u201d); the Southern Pacific Transportation Company (\u201cSouthern Pacific\u201d); the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway Company (\u201cSanta Fe\u201d); and Burlington Northern Inc. (successor in interest to the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway Company \u2014 the \u201cFrisco\u201d Railway). Houston Port Bureau, Inc., also intervened in support of the respondent Commission\u2019s orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-11\">The Bunge Corporation and the Louis Dreyfus Corporation (\u201cDreyfus\u201d) intervened in support of the petitioners, Nueces County and Producers Grain.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1074-5\">. In <em>Wheat II, </em>the Commission discussed in detail how the actual common control-good faith offer of divisions test operates.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-6\">According to the Commission, \u201cthe protestant has the initial burden of proving that the originating carrier could serve both the preferred and prejudiced parts either by itself or by means of connecting carriers, acting as a network or otherwise.\u201d 359 I.C.C. at 603. In <em>Wheat II, </em>the Commission noted that Frisco serves the preferred ports directly and can serve Corpus Christi indirectly by means of Southern Pacific or MoPac. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1074-7\">Onde the protestant has satisfied its burden of showing that the origin carrier could serve both points, the burden shifts to the origin carrier (or to the connecting carriers if they too, have actual control, <em>see </em>364 I.C.C. at 275) to rebut the protestant\u2019s evidence of common control by showing that the respondent has made a good faith offer of division of revenues to the connecting carriers, but was unsuccessful in obtaining a concurrence. If the respondent can show that it did make this good faith offer, the Commission contends, \u201cit demonstrates that [the origin carrier] has no actual control of the rates to the ports which it does not serve directly.\u201d 359 I.C.C. at 603.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1074-8\">. In the <em>Wheat </em>adjudications, the Commission likewise rejected the protestant\u2019s alternative request that, even if common control be found absent, the Commission could prescribe nondiscriminatory rates to Corpus Christi pursuant to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10704(a)(1), former Section 15(1) of the Interstate Commerce Act. This provision authorizes the Commission, <em>inter alia, </em>to prescribe a rate (including a maximum or minimum rate) if, after a hearing, it decides that a carrier\u2019s rate violates the Interstate Commerce Act as recodified, Subtitle IV, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10101 et seq. The Commission found that, absent Frisco\u2019s control of the disparate rates to Corpus Christi, no discriminatory-rate violation of the statute was proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-13\">Prescription of a rate under section 10704 differs from the issuance of an alternative order under section 10741(b) in that, as the Commission interprets section 10704, the latter is a remedial section that requires violation of some substantive section of the Act as a predicate for rate prescription. (Of course, if the Commission <em>had </em>found unreasonable discrimination under \u00a7 10741(b), a substantive violation, that would have justified issuance of a rate-prescription; but it did not.) On the other hand, issuance of an alternative order is a specific response to a violation of section 10741(b), prohibiting unreasonable rate discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-14\">No claim was made in the present proceedings that Frisco\u2019s rates were \u201cunreasonable\u201d or violated the statute other than being unreasonably discriminatory to Corpus Christi, a contention rejected by the Commission. The Commission expressly noted that its present decision^) did not preclude the Corpus Christi interests from further proceedings under \u00a7 10704 that raised such issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-15\">In view of our determination that the petitions to review the <em>Wheat </em>holdings are moot, we do not reach this issue. <em>See also </em>note 6, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1075-8\">. These petitions are our docket nos. 78-1348, 79-1816, and 80-1842. The remaining petition, our docket no. 80-1843, raises still viable issues. See appendix to this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1075-9\">. Before the Commission, where petitioners conceded that <em>Wheat I </em>and <em>Wheat II </em>were moot for the reason noted, they also contended that the proper remedy was to vacate these decisions rather than to dismiss them, as was suggested also in oral argument before us. Whatever merit this procedural approach to mootness has where issues of res judicata are implicated, see <em>United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., </em>340 U.S. 36, 71 S.Ct. 104, 95 L.Ed. 36 (1950), the policies there involved do not apply here; for, among other reasons, the non-moot <em>Corpus Christi II, </em>see <em>infra, </em>itself vacated the <em>Corpus Christi I </em>decisions and itself established the new precedential rule concerning \u201ccommon control\u201d (the harms sought to be avoided by petitioners in having <em>Wheat I </em>vacated instead of dismissed).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1075-10\">. Section 10741(b) provides in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1075-11\">A common carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under Chapter 105 of this title [49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10501 et seq., the 1978 recodifi-cation of the Act] may not subject a person, place, port, or type of traffic to unreasonable discrimination. However, subject to subsection (C) of this section, this subsection does apply to discrimination against the traffic of another carrier providing transportation by any mode.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1075-17\">In an Act of October 17, 1978, 92 Stat. 1337, Congress recodified and simplified the language of the Interstate Commerce Act. Section 10741(b) replaces the former section 3(1) of the Act. Section 3(1) forbade \u201cundue or unreasonable preference or advantage,\u201d while 10741(b) forbids \u201cunreasonable discrimination.\u201d The recodification was expressly intended to effect no substantive change in the Interstate Commerce Act. The Commission has stated in one of the decisions in the present appeal that \u201c[bjecause there is no substantive change in the law under the recodified statute and because many of the court and Commission decision (sic) arose under the former act, we shall use interchangeably sections 3(1) and 10741 and the terms \u201cunreasonable discrimination\u201d and \u201cundue preference and prejudice.\u201d <em>Nueces County Navigation District No. 1 v. Abilene &amp; Southern Railway Company, </em>364 I.C.C. 269, 270 n. 3 (1980) <em>(Corpus Christi II). </em>The petitioners concede that the revision made<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> no substantive change in the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1076-7\">. The petitioners argue that the later decisions of <em>Ayrshire Collieries Corporation v. United States, </em>335 U.S. 573 , 69 S.Ct. 278, 93 L.Ed. 243 (1949) and <em>New York v. United States, </em>331 U.S. 284, 67 S.Ct. 1207, 91 L.Ed. 1492 (1947) somehow modified the holdings in <em>Central Railroad </em>and <em>Texas &amp; Pacific Ry. Co., supra, </em>that an <em>alternative order </em>to end rate-discrimination may not be issued unless the carrier(s) effectively participated in the discriminatory joint rate. We reject this contention. As the Commission noted, <em>Wheat II, </em>359 I.C.C. at 597-98, these decisions explicitly did not refer to a situation where an alternative order is the appropriate relief. <em>See, e.g., Ayrshire, supra, </em>335 U.S. at 593-94, 69 S.Ct. at 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-8\">A stronger argument is made by the petitioners, however, that these decisions indicate that, even if an alternative order is not appropriate, the Commission is entitled to <em>prescribe </em>rates if the joint rates are unreasonably discriminatory (i.e., even in the absence of joint control). We have previously noted that the mootness of the <em>Wheat </em>adjudications precludes our reaching the specific demand for prescribed rates in those cases. See note 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-9\">Nevertheless, we recognize that a strong argument could be made that the Commission\u2019s view as to when rate-prescription is appropriate (rather than an alternative order) in discriminatory rate cases, as enunciated in <em>Wheat I </em>and <em>Wheat II, </em>could be regarded as non-moot rule-making in <em>Corpus Christi </em>II; there, in reaffirming the <em>Wheat </em>cases, the Commission specifically modified its <em>Wheat </em>\u201cdiscussion of rate prescriptions in the absence of common control.\u201d 364 I.C.C. at 279. We decline to so characterize the <em>Wheat </em>rate-prescription \u201cdiscussion\u201d and its modification in <em>Corpus Christi II. </em>While it is difficult to disagree in the abstract with the Commission\u2019s view that under present circumstances <em>Ayrshire </em>and <em>New York </em>do not permit rate prescription unless a rate is <em>both </em>unreasonable and discriminatory \u2014 and that a rate cannot be discriminatory under the statute unless the carrier effectively participates in it \u2014 we do not feel it appropriate to rule upon the propriety of the Commission\u2019s views on the matter upon a record devoid of factual data suggesting how the rates at issue could be <em>unreasonably </em>discriminatory in violation of section 10741(b), even though no individual rate at issue is either unreasonable or a violation of section 10741(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1077-7\">. The notice published at 44 Federal Register 67558-559 (No. 228, November 26, 1979), stated that the Commission was reopening the <em>Corpus Christi I </em>decisions and invited briefs and comments. The notice provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-8\"><em>Summary: </em>The above-captioned cases (the Corpus Christi cases) are being reopened to determine if the port equalization orders entered in these proceedings should be modified. As the orders presently exist, the carriers are required to maintain equivalent rates to both the Houston area ports and Corpus Christi. The orders were entered partly on the basis of the railroads\u2019 ability to control the rates to the Gulf ports. Our reexamination of these cases will be limited to the issue of actual control of rates to the Gulf ports and how control of these rates influences the Commission\u2019s authority to order relief in cases arising under 49 U.S.C. 10741. We will focus on situations where carriers cannot agree on rate policies and, as a result, concurrences to joint rate changes cannot be secured. We will also explore the circumstances, if any, in which a violation of 49 U.S.C. 10741 might exist if common control of rates is not found when unequal rates are proposed to the Gulf ports. We believe this action is necessary to appropriate regulation in this area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-9\"><em>Supplemental Information: </em>Our purpose in reopening the <em>Corpus Christi cases is to determine whether these outstanding port equalization orders require modification to recognize current rate-making situations not contemplated when the outstanding orders were issued....</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-10\"><em>We </em>are considering moving from a conclusive presumption of network common control to an analysis of actual control over the joint rates. The principal test of actual control which we are considering is discussed in <em>Wheat, Oklahoma and Kansas to Texas Gulf Ports, </em>357 ICC 382 (1977), 359 ICC 592 (1979) <em>[Wheat II], </em>which is presently pending on court appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-14\">An extended analysis of actual common control is a departure from past Commission decisions and directly affects the operation of the Corpus Christi orders. Accordingly, it is necessary to reopen these proceedings and receive comments. Participants should comment on the appropriate legal analysis of the issue of rate control in cases arising under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10741. Commentors should also address the question of, under what circumstances, if any, unequalized rate proposals should be found to violate \u00a7 10741 when there is no common control.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1077-15\">. The Commission noted, however, <em>Corpus Christi II, </em>364 I.C.C. at 270:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-16\">This limiting of the issues to only one of the criteria under section 10741(b) was not and is not intended to detract from the importance the Commission places on the other three criteria. The fourth factor, similarity or disparity in transportation conditions, continues to be our primary consideration. It is axiomatic that there can be no discrimination if economic and operational analysis proves that different rates are appropriate. This analysis includes review of matters such as the different distances involved, alternative routings available, differences in the cost of service, and, especially, any differences in competitive conditions.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1080-8\">. Notwithstanding the broad discretion that is necessarily accorded to the Commission in these cases, the petitioners offer two arguments to show that the adoption of the actual common control is contrary to legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-9\">First, the petitioners argue that Congress adopted the \u201cnetwork\u201d common control analysis because it made certain amendments to the Act after various alleged \u201cnetwork\u201d common control were decided, and did not challenge \u201cnetwork\u201d control analysis. Even if we are to assume that the cases that the petitioners cite were true \u201cnetwork\u201d common control cases, we cannot accept the petitioners\u2019 argument that all former administrative policy, practice, and regulation are, in effect, \u201cfrozen\u201d every time Congress amends or enacts a statute without disputing the current corpus of agency jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-10\">Second the petitioners claim that Section 202(f) of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976, (the \u201c4R Act\u201d), 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10711, precludes the Commission from changing its policy. Section 10711, provides that ratemaking amendments in the 4R Act should not be construed to modify the application of Section 10741(b). The petitioners conclude from this that Congress impliedly adopted the \u201cnetwork\u201d common control analysis, thus precluding agency abolition of the \u201cnetwork\u201d common control presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-14\">There is nothing in the 4R Act to indicate that Congress wished to do anything to upset Commission discretion in discrimination cases; rather, Section 10711 provides only that the 4R Act is not meant to affect the discrimination statute. In addition, although section 101(b)(3) of the 4R Act was not included when the Interstate Commerce Act was recodified in 1978, it is nevertheless helpful in interpreting the effect of the 4R Act <em>generally. </em>Section 101(b)(3) of the 4R Act provides that Congress intended to \u201cpermit railroads greater freedom to raise or lower rates for rail services in competitive markets.\u201d Abolishing the \u201cnetwork\u201d common control presumption certainly tends to effect that policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1081-9\">.
