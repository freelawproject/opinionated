SKELLY WRIGHT.</p>\n<author id=\"b943-5\">J. SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">The Government in the Sunshine Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552b (1976), requires that meetings of multi-member federal agencies shall be open to the public, with the exception of discussions in ten narrowly defined areas.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In these cases we must decide an important unresolved issue: whether any of the statutory exemptions from the Sunshine Act apply to agency budget deliberations. Interpreting the statutory language in light of the legislative history and underlying policies of the Act, we conclude that there is no blanket exemption for agency meetings at any stage of the budget preparation process. The availability of exemptions for specific portions of budgetary discussions must be determined upon the facts of each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">In the proceedings before us the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (Commission) has failed to bear its burden of proving that its budget meetings of July 25, 1981 and October 15, 1981 were lawfully closed or that it may continue to withhold the transcripts of those meetings. We therefore order the Commission to release the transcripts to the public. We find, however, that the District Court\u2019s injunction of July 2, 1981, ordering the Commission to hold some of its future meetings in public, fails to satisfy the specificity requirements of Rule 65(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. We vacate the injunction, and the District Court\u2019s order, holding the Commission in contempt for violating the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">I. STATEMENT OF THE CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b943-9\">Three interrelated cases have been consolidated in this appeal. Each case turns on the lawfulness of a decision by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to close a meeting to discuss the agency\u2019s budget proposals. In each case the District Court ruled against the Commission. In No. 81-1975 the District Court held that the agency had acted unlawfully in closing a meeting on July 18, 1980, and ordered the Commission to refrain in the future from closing all meetings \u201csimilar in nature.\u201d Subsequently, in No. 81-2002, the court ruled that the Commission had violated the injunction by closing a meeting on July 25, 1981, and adjudged the Commission in civil contempt, which it could purge by releasing the transcript of the meeting. Finally, in No. 81-2147 the court held that the Commission had acted without statutory authorization when it closed a meeting on October 15, 1981, and ordered release of the transcript. The orders in Nos. 81-2002 and 81-2147 have been stayed pending the determination of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-11\">A. <em>No. 81-1975: Commission Meeting on July 18, 1980</em></p>\n<p id=\"b943-12\">In July 1980 the Commission scheduled a series of meetings to discuss preparation of the agency\u2019s annual budget request for fiscal year 1982, and announced that the sessions would be open to the public.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Before the first of the meetings on July 18, 1980, however, the three Commissioners who were present voted unanimously to close all of the budget meetings scheduled to be held within the next 30 days. Joint Appendix (JA) 19. The Commission relied solely on Exemption 9(B) of the Sunshine Act, which permits closing of meetings if premature disclosure of the discussion would be \u201clikely to significantly frustrate implementation of a proposed agency action.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552b(c)(9)(B) (1976). A representative of appellee Common Cause, who wished to attend the July 18, 1980 meeting, was excluded.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At that meeting the Commissioners <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>received a preliminary briefing from the staff concerning the Commission\u2019s budgetary needs and the relationship of each office\u2019s budget requests to agency and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidelines and previous appropriation levels.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">Common Cause filed suit in the District Court on September 15, 1980, seeking a declaratory judgment that closure of the July 18,1980 meeting had violated the Sunshine Act, an injunction ordering release of the transcript of that meeting, and an order to the Commission to permit Common Cause to attend future Commission meetings \u201cthat are similar in nature to the. July 18, 1980 meeting[.]\u201d JA 5-8.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The Commission asserted that Exemption 9(B) permitted closing of the meeting and allowed the transcript to be withheld from the public until the President submitted his budget to Congress in early 1981.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">In a memorandum opinion and order issued on July 2, 1981, JA 69-72, the District Court granted summary judgment for Common Cause. The court ruled that the Commission had unlawfully closed its July 18, 1980 meeting, which it described as a discussion of \u201cthe general proposed budget requests of the NRC and the general relationship between those requests and various budgetary documents.\u201d JA 70. On the basis of its inspection of the transcript the court decided that the Commission had \u201cfailed to establish a reasonable likelihood of any harm to future agency actions by opening budget discussion meetings.\u201d JA 71. It therefore found that Exemption 9(B) was inapplicable, and it enjoined the Commission permanently \u201cfrom closing future meetings of a similar nature.\u201d JA 72. It did not specify the characteristics of the July 18, 1980 meeting which it considered material, nor did it describe with any particularity the future meetings which it ordered to be held in public.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b944-13\">B. <em>No. 81-2002: Commission Meeting on July 27, 1981</em></p>\n<p id=\"b944-14\">In July 1981 the Commission scheduled a series of meetings to discuss its budget request for fiscal year 1988. On the advice of its General Counsel it divided these meetings into two categories: preliminary staff briefings, designed to provide Commission members with background information and staff advice; and meetings in which the Commissioners would decide on specific funding levels for the agency\u2019s budget proposals to OMB (markup), and would also consider intra-agency appeals from initial markup decisions (reclama). It voted to hold the preliminary staff briefings, which it believed to be \u201csimilar in nature\u201d to the July 18, 1980 meeting, in public.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, it decided to close the markup/reclama meeting, originally scheduled for July 23, which eventually took place on July 27. It relied on Exemptions 2 and 6 as well as Exemption 9(B). Common Cause was notified of this decision on July 17, 1981. JA 81-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-15\">On July 21, 1981 Common Cause sought an order from the District Court enforcing the July 2, 1981 injunction by requiring the scheduled markup/reclama meeting to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>held in open session. JA 73-80.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court did not act immediately on the Common Cause motion. On July 27, 1981 the Commission held its markup/reclama meeting in closed session. The meeting discussed the Commission\u2019s final budget figures for submission to OMB, evaluated a number of regulatory programs, determined budgetary priorities, and selected strategies to maximize the budgetary resources that OMB might approve.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-4\">After reviewing the transcript of the closed meeting <em>in camera, </em>the District Court, at a hearing on August 25, 1981, ordered the Commission to release the transcript to the public. On September 9, 1981 the court issued a written order holding the Commission in contempt of court for closing the July 27, 1981 meeting. The memorandum accompanying the order gave a broad construction to the court\u2019s earlier injunction of July 2, 1981. The court explained that its order had been \u201cmade in a wider context than just resolving the legality of closing the prior year\u2019s July 18,1980, budget discussion meeting.\u201d In their motions for summary judgment in that proceeding, the court wrote, both parties had argued the application of the Sunshine Act to \u201cthe entire budget development process.\u201d JA 259. Without referring specifically to any of the claimed Sunshine Act exemptions, the court found that the July 27 meeting was \u201csimilar in nature\u201d to the July 18, 1980 meeting illegally closed by the Commission, JA 260, and that the Commission was guilty of civil contempt. The order allowed the Commission to purge its contempt by releasing the transcript within ten days; if it failed to do so its members were required to appear before the court for sentencing on September 28, 1981. JA 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">On an emergency motion for stay pending appeal this court granted a stay of the September 9 contempt order of the District Court. It also advised the Commission to seek the approval of the District Court if, during the pendency of the appeal, it wished to close any meeting concerning the budget or similar matters. JA 265-266.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">C. <em>No. 81-2147: Commission Meeting on October 15, 1981</em></p>\n<p id=\"b945-9\">The Commission submitted its budget request to OMB in September 1981. OMB proposed substantial reductions in the Commission\u2019s budget, but gave the agency an opportunity to appeal (reclama) the cutbacks on or before October 19, 1981. The Commission sought the District Court\u2019s permission to hold a closed session to discuss , the reclama to OMB. It argued that unless the discussion of its priorities, negotiation strategy, and fallback positions could be closed the agency\u2019s goal of minimizing OMB\u2019s reductions would be \u201csignificantly frustrated\u201d within the meaning of Exemption 9(B). It also invoked Exemptions 2, 6, and 10 of the Sunshine Act.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-10\">The District Court refused permission and ordered the meeting to be held in open session. Appendix to Memorandum for Appellants in No. 81-1247 (App.) at 32. On an emergency motion for stay pending appeal this court granted a partial stay of the District Court\u2019s order. App. 33. The stay permitted the Commission to close those specific portions of the meeting during which it discussed material exempt under Exemptions 2, 6, 9(B), and 10. This court also ordered the Commission to submit a verbatim record of both open and closed portions of the meeting to the District Court within four days of the meeting, and instructed the District Court to rule on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>Commission\u2019s action but to stay its orders pending review on appeal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">On October 15, 1981 the Commission held a two-part budget meeting to prepare its reclama to OMB. The first part, which dealt generally with the status of the Commission\u2019s budget request, was open to the public. The second part, which considered the specific budget items involved in the reclama, was held in closed session. After an <em>in camera </em>inspection of the transcript of the closed portion of the October 15 meeting, the District Court ordered the transcript released. The order, issued on October 22, 1981, stated without further explanation that \u201cthe Court finds exceptions 2 and 9(B) are not applicable.\u201d App. 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">The Commission\u2019s appeals from all three District Court orders have been consolidated for hearing and determination. These eases raise three issues. First, was the District Court\u2019s injunction of July 2, 1981, which ordered the Commission to open all future meetings \u201csimilar in nature\u201d to the July 18, 1980 meeting, sufficiently specific to comply with Rule 65(d)? Second, may budget meetings as a whole be closed to the public under Exemption 9(B) of the Sunshine Act? Third, does an inspection of the transcripts reveal that all or any portion of the meetings of July 27, 1981 and October 15,1981 discussed exempt material and may therefore be withheld from the public?</p>\n<p id=\"b946-9\">We strike down the District Court\u2019s injunction of July 2, 1981 because it is too vague to satisfy the standards of Rule 65(d). Reaching the substantive Sunshine Act issues, we conclude that none of the exemptions to the Sunshine Act provides any blanket exception for budget discussions at any stage \u2014 preliminary staff budget briefings, markup/reclama meetings, or meetings to prepare reclama to OMB. On the basis of our inspection of the transcripts of the Commission\u2019s two closed meetings, we decide that no portion of either meeting is exempt from disclosure, and we therefore order that the full transcripts be released.</p>\n<p id=\"A46\">II. THE JULY 2, 1981 INJUNCTION: RULE 65(d)</p>\n<p id=\"b946-10\">The District Court\u2019s injunction of July 2, 1981 cannot stand. Referring to the Commission\u2019s meeting of July 18, 1980, it provides that \u201cdefendant Nuclear Regulatory Commission is permanently enjoined from closing future meetings of a similar nature.\u201d JA 72. The order does not describe the July 18, 1980 meeting or identify the characteristics of a future meeting \u201cof a similar nature.\u201d The phrase is susceptible to more than one interpretation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>fore fails to satisfy the exacting requirements of Rule 65(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-4\">Every order granting an injunction and every restraining order shall set forth the reasons for its issuance; shall be specific in terms; shall describe in reasonable detail, and not by reference to the complaint or other document, the act or acts sought to be restrained * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">The Supreme Court has explained the fundamental policies underlying Rule 65(d). \u201cThe judicial contempt power is a potent weapon,\u201d the Court asserted. \u201cWhen it is founded upon a decree too vague to be understood, it can be a deadly one. Congress responded to that danger by requiring that a federal court frame its orders so that those who must obey them will know what the court intends to require and what it means to forbid.\u201d <em>Internat\u2019l Longshoremen\u2019s Ass\u2019n, Local 1291 v. Philadelphia Marine Trade Ass\u2019n, </em>389 U.S. 64, 76, 88 S.Ct. 201, 208, 19 L.Ed.2d 236 (1967); <em>see Gunn v. University Committee to End the War in Vietnam, </em>399 U.S. 383, 389, 90 S.Ct. 2013, 2017, 26 L.Ed.2d 684 (1970); <em>Schmidt v. Lessard, </em>414 U.S. 473, 476-477 n.2, 94 S.Ct. 713, 715-16 n.2, 38 L.Ed.2d 661 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">We recognize that the fair notice requirement of Rule 65(d) must be applied \u201cin the light of the circumstances surrounding [the injunction\u2019s] entry: the relief sought by the moving party, the evidence produced at the hearing on the injunction, and the mischief that the injunction seeks to prevent.\u201d <em>United States v. Christie Industries, Inc., </em>465 F.2d 1000, 1007 (3d Cir. 1972). In the context of the litigation, an injunction\u2019s language might be sufficiently specific to notify the parties of the acts the court seeks to restrain. <em>See, e.g., Williams </em>v. <em>United States, </em>402 F.2d 47, 48-49 (10th Cir. 1967) (sustaining injunction in light of defendant\u2019s subjective knowledge).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-18\">In the circumstances of this case, however, the context of the court\u2019s decision to issue the injunction does not cure the ambiguity of the language of the injunction itself. Common Cause\u2019s complaint was no more specific than the court\u2019s July 2, 1981 order; it asked for an injunction \u201ccompelling defendants to permit plaintiffs to attend future Commission meetings that are similar in nature to the July 18, 1980 meeting[.]\u201d JA 7. The evidence before the District Court consisted solely of the transcript of the July 18, 1980 meeting; the court did not consider the transcripts of other meetings which might have been \u201csimilar to\u201d or \u201cnot similar to\u201d the meeting in question. Nor does the memorandum opinion accompanying the order clarify its meaning. It describes the July 18 meeting in several different ways \u2014 in general terms as a \u201cbudget meeting,\u201d \u201cbudget review meeting,\u201d and \u201cbudget discussion meeting,\u201d as a \u201cmeeting concerning the fiscal year 1982 budget,\u201d and more specifically as a discussion of \u201cthe general proposed budget requests of the NRC and the general relationship between those requests and various budgetary documents.\u201d JA 69-71. Under the circumstances, we are compelled to conclude that the injunction of July 2, 1981 violated the specificity requirements of Rule 65(d).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b947-19\">Because the July 2, 1981 injunction failed to give adequate notice to the Commission of the nature of the prohibited activity, we also set aside the District Court\u2019s decision of September 9,1981 that the Commission was in contempt for violating the July 2 order. <em>See Internat\u2019l Longshoremen\u2019s Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>389 U.S. at 76, 88 S.Ct. at 208 (reversing finding of civil contempt for alleged violation of vague decree); <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Kammerer, </em>450 F.2d 279, 280 (3d Cir. 1971) (reversing contempt judgment because \u201cambiguities and omissions in orders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>redound to the benefit of the person charged with contempt\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">III. THE SUNSHINE ACT AND THE BUDGET PROCESS</p>\n<p id=\"Aqen\">We turn now to the validity of the District Court\u2019s determinations, based on <em>in camera </em>inspection of the transcripts, that the Sunshine Act requires the Commission to release the transcripts of its closed meetings held on July 27 and October 15, 1981. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 552b(f)(2), 552b(h)(1) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">The Government in the Sunshine Act establishes the policy that \u201cthe public is entitled to the fullest practicable information regarding the decisionmaking processes of the Federal Government.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Every meeting of a multi-member agency must be open to the public, except that specific portions of a meeting may be closed if the discussion is reasonably likely to fall within one or more of ten narrowly defined exemptions. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552b(c)(1)-(10) (1976). The Commission contends that these exemptions authorize closing of agency budget discussions.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It places primary reliance on Exemption 9(B), which allows an agency to close a meeting or portion of a meeting which is likely to discuss matters whose \u201cpremature disclosure\u201d would \u201cbe likely to significantly frustrate implementation of a proposed agency action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 552b(c)(9)(B). The agency also contends that budget meetings may be closed because they encompass information protected under Exemption 2, matters related \u201csolely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency,\u201d and Exemption 6, material of a personal nature whose disclosure would \u201cconstitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 552b(c)(2), 552b(c)(6). In light of the language, legislative history, and underlying purposes of the Sunshine Act, we reject the Commission\u2019s proposed interpretations of the Sunshine Act exemptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-10\">A. <em>The Purposes of the Sunshine Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b948-11\">Congress enacted the Sunshine Act to open the deliberations of multi-member federal agencies to public view. It believed that increased openness would enhance citizen confidence in government, encourage higher quality work by government officials, stimulate well-informed public debate about government programs and policies, and promote cooperation between citizens and government. In short, it sought to make government more fully accountable to the people.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In keeping with the premise that \u201cgovernment should conduct the public\u2019s business in public,\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the Act established a general presumption that agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>meetings should be held in the open.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Once a person has challenged an agency\u2019s decision to close a meeting, the agency bears the burden of proof.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Even if exempt subjects are discussed in one portion of a meeting, the remainder of the meeting must be held in open session.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b949-4\">The Act went farther than any previous federal legislation in requiring openness in government. In general the Sunshine Act\u2019s exemptions parallel those in the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA),<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> but there is an important difference. Unlike FOIA, which specifically exempts \u201cpredecisional\u201d memo-randa and other documents on the premise that government cannot \u201coperate in a fishbowl,\u201d <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the Sunshine Act was designed to open the predecisional process in multi-member agencies to the public. During the legislative process a number of federal agencies specifically objected to the Sunshine Act\u2019s omission of an exemption for predecisional deliberations. Congress deliberately chose to forego the claimed advantages of confidential discussions among agency heads at agency meetings.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>Express language in the Sunshine Act also demonstrates that Congress did not intend to follow the FOIA pattern for pre-decisional discussions at agency meetings.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The Sunshine Act applies to all \u201cmeetings,\u201d which are defined as deliberations which determine or result in \u201cthe joint conduct or disposition of official agency business[.]\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552b(a)(2) (1976).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The legislative history demonstrates that \u201cofficial agency business\u201d means far more than reviewable final action. The Senate report expressly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-4\">The definition of meetings includes the conduct, as well as the disposition, of official agency matters. It is not sufficient for the purposes of open government to merely have the public witness final agency votes. The meetings opened by Section 201(a) are not intended to be merely reruns staged for the public after agency members have discussed the issue in private and predetermined their views. The whole decisionmaking process, not merely its results, must be exposed to public scrutiny.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b950-10\">S.Rep.No. 94-354, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 18 (1975).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-11\">Notwithstanding the omission of a deliberative process privilege from the Sunshine Act, the Commission asks us to hold that the deliberative process leading to formulation of an agency\u2019s budget request is exempt from the Sunshine Act. To resolve this question, we must examine the statutory underpinnings of the budget process and the specific exemptions from the Sunshine Act which the Commission invokes.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-12\">B. <em>The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921</em></p>\n<p id=\"b950-13\">The Budget and Accounting Act, 42 Stat. 21 (1921), was designed to centralize formu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>lation of the Executive Branch budget. Previously Congress had received \u201cuneom-pared, unrelated, and unrevised\u201d estimates from individual departments and agencies, \u201crepresenting the personal views and aspirations of bureau chiefs[.]\u201d S.Rep.No. 524, 66th Cong., 2d Sess. 6 (1920). The disadvantages of this uncoordinated system led Congress to delegate to the President exclusive authority to submit budgetary requests on behalf of the Executive Branch. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 15 (1976). Congress thereby sought to enhance the government\u2019s ability to control the overall level of expenditures and to choose among conflicting priorities.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b951-4\">The Commission contends that the Budget and Accounting Act mandates secrecy in the budget formulation process, and that the Sunshine Act must therefore be construed to permit closing of agency budget meetings. Brief for appellants at 17-21. We find this statutory argument unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">The Commission first relies on the President\u2019s authority, under the Budget and Accounting Act, to prescribe rules and regulations for preparation of the budget, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 (1976),<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and on the \u201clongstanding practice of confidentiality for Executive Branch discussions leading to the formulation of the President\u2019s Budget.\u201d Brief for appellants at 19.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The statute, however, makes no reference to confidentiality, nor does it authorize the President to prescribe budgetary rules and regulations without regard to the requirements of other federal statutes. The President\u2019s rulemaking authority under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 is therefore subject to the specific requirements of the Sunshine Act. Indeed, the OMB directive to agencies, OMB Circular A-10, recognizes that \u201c[cjertain agencies headed by a collegial body may be required to hold their meetings open to public observation unless the agency properly determines that the matter to be discussed warrants the closing of those meetings for reasons enumerated in the Government in the Sunshine Act * JA 130.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b951-10\">Second, the Commission reasons that the congressional goal of centralized budget formulation cannot be achieved without secrecy. If the proposals of individual agencies must be adopted in public, it suggests, development of the presidential budget would be \u201cfragmented\u201d and the President\u2019s discretion to choose among alternatives would be impaired. Brief for appellants at 19-21. This contention reads too much into the 1921 Act, which simply requires that the President submit a single, unified Executive Branch budget proposal to Congress for consideration. It does not prescribe any method by which he must develop the consolidated budget figures which he submits. Nor does it require that the President\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>proposals be the only budgetary information available to the public.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Even if agencies discuss their budget proposals at public sessions, the President remains capable of revising agency requests and combining them into a unified budget.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">Indeed, the Sunshine Act itself affords persuasive evidence that Congress did not intend to allow presidential claims of confidentiality under the Budget and Accounting Act to override the Sunshine Act\u2019s specific provisions regarding openness and secrecy. Exemption 3, a provision which received extensive consideration in both houses, allows closing of a meeting or portion of a meeting which would \u201cdisclose matters specifically exempted from disclosure by statute,\u201d provided that such statute</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a2c-dedup-0\">(A) requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or (B) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552b(c)(3) (1976).<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, which contains no explicit references to confidentiality, does not qualify under the strict requirements of Exemption 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">Therefore, the budget process is exempt from the open meeting requirement, in whole or in part, only if it fits within the terms of other specific Sunshine Act exemptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-11\">C. <em>No Blanket Exemption for Budget Meetings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b952-12\"> Exceptions to the Sunshine Act\u2019s general requirement of openness must be construed narrowly. H.R.Rep.No. 94 880 (part 1), 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 2 (1976). Congress rejected the approach of establishing \u201cfunctional categories\u201d of agency business whose discussion could automatically be closed to the public.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Instead the Sunshine Act provides for an examination of each item of business to ascertain whether it may be closed under the terms of one of ten specific exemptions. <em>Pacific Legal Foundation v. Council on Environmental Quality, </em>636 F.2d 1259, 1265 (D.C.Cir.1980). Exemptions must be interpreted in light of Congress\u2019 intention that agencies must \u201cconduct their deliberations in public to the greatest extent possible.\u201d S.Rep.No. 94-354, supra, at 11. Nevertheless the Commission claims that Exemption 9(B) permits closing of agency budget meetings in their entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-13\">Exemption 9(B) permits closing of meetings to prevent \u201cpremature disclosure\u201d of information whose disclosure would be likely to \u201csignificantly frustrate implementation of a proposed agency action.\u201d For two reasons, the precept of narrow construction applies with particular force to this exemption, upon which the Commission principally relies. First, as we have seen, Congress decided not to provide any exemption for predecisional deliberations because it wished the process of decision as well as the results to be open to public view. \u2022 See Part III-A supra.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Yet the agencies may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>attempt to seize upon the language of Exemption 9(B) to avoid the perceived discomfort and inconvenience that are, in the words of one commentary, \u201cinherent in the open meeting principle * * R. Berg &amp; S. Klitzman, An Interpretive Guide to the Government in the Sunshine Act 24 (1978). Second, an overly broad construction of Exemption 9(B), which applies to \"all agencies subject to the Act, would allow agencies to \u201ccircumvent the spirit of openness which underlies this legislation.\u201d S.Rep.No. 94-354, <em>supra, </em>at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-4\">The language of the exemption is not self-explanatory; we therefore turn to the legislative history for guidance. The House and Senate committee reports give four concrete examples of Exemption 9(B) situations. First, an agency might consider imposing an embargo on foreign shipment of certain goods; if this were publicly known, all of the goods might be exported before the agency had time to act, and the effectiveness of the proposed action would be destroyed. <em>Id. </em>at 24. Second, an agency might discuss whether to approve a proposed merger; premature public disclosure of the proposal might make it impossible for the two sides to reach agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 24-25. Third, disclosure of an agency\u2019s proposed strategy in collective bargaining with its employees might make it impossible to reach an agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 24. Fourth, disclosure of an agency\u2019s terms and conditions for purchase of real property might make the proposed purchase impossible or drive up the price. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>35</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">We construe Exemption 9(B) to cover those situations delineated by the narrow general principles which encompass all four legislative examples. In each of these cases, disclosure of the agency\u2019s proposals or negotiating position could affect private decisions by parties other than those who manage the federal government \u2014 exporters, potential corporate merger partners, government employees, or owners of real property. The private responses of such persons might damage the regulatory or financial interests of the government as a whole, because in each case the agency\u2019s proposed action is one for which the agency takes final responsibility as a governmental entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">The budget process differs substantially from the examples given by the House and Senate reports. Disclosure of the agency\u2019s discussions would not affect private parties\u2019 decisions concerning regulated activity or dealings with the government. Rather, the Commission contends that opening budget discussions to the public might affect political decisions by the President and OMB.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> In addition, disclosure would not directly affect \u201cagency action\u201d for which the Commission has the ultimate responsibility.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>Instead, the Commission fears that disclosure of its time-honored strategies of item-shifting, exaggeration, and fail-back positions<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> would give it less leverage in its \u201carm\u2019s length\u201d dealings with OMB and the President, who make the final budget decisions within the Executive Branch. The Commission argues that it would thereby be impaired in its competition with other government agencies \u2014 which also serve the public and implement federal legislation\u2014 for its desired share of budgetary resources.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> It is not clear, however, whether the interests of the government as a whole, or the public interest, would be adversely affected.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">Moreover, in the budget context the public interest in disclosure differs markedly from its interest in the four situations described in the committee reports.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> In those eases disclosure would permit either financial gain at government expense or circumvention of agency regulation. In contrast, disclosure of budget deliberations would serve the affirmative purposes of the Sunshine Act: to open government deliberations to public scrutiny, to inform the public \u201cwhat facts and policy considerations the agency found important in reaching its decision, and what alternatives it considered and rejected,\u201d and thereby to permit \u201cwider and more informed public debate of the agency\u2019s policies * * *.\u201d S.Rep.No. 94 354, <em>supra, </em>at 5-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-9\">The budget deliberation process is of exceptional importance in agency policymak-ing. The agency heads must review the entire range of agency programs and responsibilities in order to establish priorities. According to the Commission, a budget meeting \u201ccandidly consider[s] the merits and efficiencies of on-going or expected regulatory programs or projects\u201d and then \u201cdecides upon the level of regulatory activities it proposes to pursue * * Brief for appellants at 30-31. These decisions, the government contends, have a significant impact on \u201cthe Commission\u2019s ability to marshal regulatory powers in a manner which insures the greatest protection of the public health and safety with the most economical use of its limited resources.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-10\">If Congress had wished to exempt these deliberations from the Sunshine Act\u2014 to preserve the prior practice of budget confidentiality, to reduce the opportunities for lobbying before the President submits his budget to Congress, or for other rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>sons \u2014 it would have expressly so indicated. Absent any such statement of legislative intent, we will not construe Exemption 9(B) of the Sunshine Act to allow budget deliberations to be hidden from the public view.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b955-4\">We are not persuaded by the Commission\u2019s contention that the separation of powers principle imposes a constitutional requirement that budget meetings be exempt from the Sunshine Act. The Commission suggests that Congress may not require agency budget meetings to be open to the public because openness would interfere with the Commission\u2019s role of providing opinions and advice to the President under Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> But the Supreme Court has recently rejected the contention that separation of powers requires \u201cthree airtight departments of government^]\u201d <em>Nixon v. Administrator of General Services, </em>433 U.S. 425, 443, 97 S.Ct. 2777, 2790, 53 L.Ed.2d 867 (1977). Taking a \u201cpragmatic, flexible\u201d approach, the Court enunciated a functional test of whether separation of powers has been violated: \u201cthe extent to which [the challenged legislation] prevents the Executive Branch from accomplishing its constitutionally assigned func-lions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 442-443, 97 S.Ct. at 2789 -90. The Court expressly included the Government in the Sunshine Act among the \u201cabundant statutory precedent for the regulation and mandatory disclosure of [information] in the possession of the Executive Branch,\u201d noting that \u201c[s]uch regulation of material generated in the Executive Branch has never been considered invalid as an invasion of its autonomy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 445, 97 S.Ct. at 2791.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b955-9\">We express no view with regard to any constitutional issue of Executive privilege, a question which is narrower than the Commission\u2019s general claim based on separation of powers. <em>See id. </em>at 446, 97 S.Ct. at 2791. Only the President, not the agency, may assert the presidential privilege, see Freund, <em>The Supreme Court, 1973 Term, Foreword: On Presidential Privilege, </em>88 Harv.L.Rev. 13, 29-31 (1974); <em>see generally Nixon v. Administrator of General Services, supra, </em>433 U.S. at 447-449, 97 S.Ct. at 2792-93 and he has not done so in this case.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b955-10\">D. <em>Particularized Exemptions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b955-11\">The Sunshine Act contains no express exemption for budget deliberations as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>whole, and we do not read such an exemption into Exemption 9(B). We recognize, nevertheless, that specific items discussed at Commission budget meetings might be exempt from the open meetings requirement of the Act, and might justify closing portions of Commission meetings on an individual and particularized basis.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> After examining the transcripts of the Commission\u2019s closed meetings of July 27, 1981 and October 15,1981, however, we conclude that none of the subject matter discussed at either meeting comes within any of the exemptions cited by the Commission. The Commission must therefore release the full transcripts of these meetings to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">1. <em>Exemption 9(B)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">Exemption 9(B), as we have discussed, protects agency discussions of material whose premature disclosure could affect the decisions or actions of third parties acting in a nongovernmental capacity, thus causing a significant adverse effect upon the government\u2019s financial or regulatory interests. <em>See </em>Part III\u2014C <em>supra. </em>Budget meetings might include discussions of specific topics within the coverage of the exemption. Premature disclosure of possible elimination of a program involving private contracts might make it difficult for the contractor to retain key personnel, frustrating the Commission\u2019s ability to implement the program effectively if it is not ultimately eliminated. Memorandum for Appellants in No. 81 -2147 at 23 n.20. Premature disclosure of proposed cutbacks in joint research projects with foreign governments might adversely affect the United States government\u2019s position in negotiations concerning the foreign government\u2019s commitment. <em>Id. </em>Premature disclosure of collective bargaining negotiation strategies might adversely affect labor negotiations with the Commission\u2019s own employees.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">Even if a budget meeting is likely to discuss these topics, however, it may not be closed under Exemption 9(B) \u201cin any instance where the agency has already disclosed to the public the content or nature of its proposed action[.]\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552b(c)(9)(B) (1976). The Senate report explained that the exemption \u201conly applies when an agency feels it must act in secret[.]\u201d S.Rep.No. 94-354, <em>supra, </em>at 25. Therefore, if the private contractor, foreign government, or labor union has already been informed by the Commission that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>budget cutbacks are being considered in the programs with which they are concerned, then Exemption 9(B) might no longer apply-</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">Our <em>in camera </em>inspection of the transcripts of the July 27, 1981 and October 15, 1981 Commission meetings leads us to conclude that Exemption 9(B) does not support withholding of any portion of the transcripts.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">2. <em>Exemption 2</em></p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">The Commission also relies on Exemption 2 \u2014 matters that \u201crelate solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agencyU\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552b(c)(2) (1976)\u2014to justify closing portions of budget meetings. Under the Commission\u2019s interpretation, Exemption 2 includes discussions of allocation of personnel among programs, evaluations of the performance of offices and projects within the Commission, and consideration of more economical schemes of \u201cinternal management.\u201d Brief for appellants at 26; Memorandum for Appellants in No. 81-2147 at 23, 30. This construction is belied by the statutory language and legislative history of Exemption 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-8\">The language in Exemption 2 to the Government in the Sunshine Act is virtually identical with that in Exemption 2 to the Freedom of Information Act. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(2) (1976). The conference report on the Sunshine Act expressly adopts the standards of <em>Dep\u2019t of Air Force </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>425 U.S. 352, 96 S.Ct. 1592, 48 L.Ed.2d 11 (1976),<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> the leading Supreme Court decision interpreting Exemption 2 of FOIA. <em>Sec </em>S.Rep.No. 94 1178, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 15 (1976).<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Under this standard, personnel-related discussions at budget meetings fall squarely outside the scope of the exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-12\">Budget allocations inevitably impinge on personnel matters, because government cannot implement programs without j)er-sonnel. Salaries and wages are a sizable proportion of the Commission\u2019s budget. But budget decisions regarding personnel cutbacks, and evaluations of the prior performance of offices and programs, do not relate <em>solely </em>to \u201cinternal personnel rules and procedures.\u201d Discussions of possible administrative cost savings through adoption of new \u201cinternal management\u201d techniques also fall beyond the narrow confines of Exemption 2, because they deal with the impact of budget cuts on the Commission\u2019s ability to carry out its responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-13\">Throughout this litigation the Commission has emphasized the importance of the budget process. An affidavit submitted by the Commission asserts that budget discussions lead to presidential recommendations reflecting the President\u2019s \u201cbest judgment of how the nation\u2019s fiscal resources should be allocated to meet its future economic and social needs.\u201d Affidavit of Carey P. Mod-lin, Office of Management and Budget, JA 118. The affidavit recognizes that \u201cvital policies and billions of dollars [are] at issue every year[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>The public can reasonably be expected to have an interest in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>matters of such importance.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Exemption 2 does not permit the Commission to close budget discussions relating to personnel cutbacks or performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">In some budget meetings the exemption might permit the Commission to close specific portions of the discussion relating \u201csolely to internal personnel rules and practices.\u201d However, <em>in camera </em>inspection shows that Exemption 2 does not apply to any portion of either the July 27, 1981 or the October 15, 1981 meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">3. <em>Exemption 6</em></p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">The government invoked Exemption 6 to justify its decisions to close both meetings at issue; it no longer claims that the exemption protects any of the deliberations at the October 15 meeting. Exemption 6 protects information of a personal nature whose disclosure would constitute \u201can unwarranted invasion of personal privacy^]\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552b(c)(6) (1976). The agency contends that this exemption protects discussion of \u201can individual manager\u2019s particular qualifications, characteristics and professional competence in connection with a budget request for that particular manager\u2019s program.\u201d Brief for appellants at 26. This contention is unsupported by the legislative history of the Sunshine Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">Exemption 6 applies to information of a personal nature, including discussions of a person\u2019s health, drinking habits, or financial circumstances. It provides greater protection to private individuals, including applicants for federal grants and officials of regulated private companies, and to low-level government employees, than to government officials with executive responsibilities. H.R.Rep.No. 94-880 (part 1), <em>supra, </em>at 11; S.Rep.No. 94-354, <em>supra, </em>at 21-22. It was not intended to shelter substandard performance by government executives. The Senate report expressly noted that \u201cif the discussion centered on the alleged incompetence with which a Government official has carried out his duties it might well be appropriate to keep the meeting open, since in that case the public has a special interest in knowing how well agency employees are carrying out their public responsibilities.\u201d Exemption 6, the report added, \u201cmust not be used by an agency to shield itself from political controversy involving the agency and its employees about which the public should be informed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21-22.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> These policy considerations apply a <em>fortiori </em>in the budget process, in which the performance of individual executives may affect the Commission\u2019s willingness to allocate budgetary resources to particular regulatory programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-11\">Given the narrow scope of Exemption 6 as applied to managerial officials, we hold that no portion of the discussion at the July 27,1981 meeting was covered by Exemption 6. The Commission\u2019s discussion of individual performance was limited to managerial officials with executive responsibility.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b958-12\">E. <em>Compliance With the Sunshine Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"A_yW\">Our <em>in camera </em>inspection of the transcripts of the July 27, 1981 and October 15, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>1981 Commission meetings does not show that any portion of either meeting may lie withheld from the public under any of the asserted exemptions to the Sunshine Act. We therefore order the Commission to release the transcripts to the public. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552b(f)(2) (1976). The transcripts shall be made available in a place readily accessible to the public, and copies shall be furnished to any person at the actual cost of duplication. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b959-4\">If in the future the Commission wishes to close all or any portion of a budget meeting, the statute requires it to announce its intention and to give a brief statement of its reasons. If any person objects to closing of the meeting, he may file a civil action in the District Court to compel the Commission to comply with the statute. He may include an application for interlocutory relief in his complaint, if the meeting has not yet been held. The District Court should act promptly on any motion for interim relief to avoid frustration of the purposes of the Sunshine Act through delay.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> In its decision on the merits the District Court may examine <em>in camera </em>the transcripts of closed agency meetings and may issue such relief as it deems appropriate, with due regard for orderly administration and the public interest. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 552b(h)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">IV.

In addition, the injunction of July 2, 1981 was overly broad because it ordered the Commission to open all meetings \u201cof a similar nature\u201d without allowing for the possible applicability of specific exemptions to the Sunshine Act.

The Commission uses the term \u201cfrustration\u201d out of context. Even under this line of reasoning, moreover, the Commission\u2019s argument may be questionable. Our interpretation of the Sunshine Act applies to the budget meetings of all agencies, including those with which the Commission is competing for available funds.

Therefore, an agency might make its budget decisions by circulating staff memoran-da and voting by notation; these documents might be protected under Exemption 5 of FOIA.

When the Commission expects that exempt subject matter will arise at a budget meeting, it should make reasonable efforts to arrange its agenda so that these matters will not be interspersed with non-exempt portions of the discussion. If segregation of exempt and non-exempt material would make a coherent discussion impossible, then it may be reasonable to close the entire meeting. See, <em>e.g., A. G. Becker Inc. v.

Allocation of personnel cutbacks among subdivisions of the agency would come within Exemption 9(B) only if they are actually expected to be the subjects of collective bargaining negotiations. <em>But see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7106(a)(1) (Supp. IV 1980) (nothing in collective bargaining legislation for federal employees \u201cshall affect the authority of any management official of any agency\u2014(1) to determine the mission, budget, organization, number of employees, and internal security practices of the agency\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"48\">\n<p id=\"b957-9\">. In <em>Rose </em>the Court held that Exemption 2 did not authorize the Air Force Academy to withhold summaries of Honor Board hearings dealing with alleged violations of the Honor Code for cadets, from which names were deleted if a guilty verdict had been reached. The Court found that, given the importance of military discipline to the effectiveness of the armed forces and their relations with civilian authorities, the Honor Board summaries contained matters subject to a \u201cgenuine and significant public interest.\u201d 425 U.S. at 369, 96 S.Ct. at 1603.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"49\">\n<p id=\"b957-10\">. We need not decide whether the exemptions to the two acts are identical in all circumstances, a question that has been left unsettled by this court. <em>Compare Crooker v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms, </em>670 F.2d 1051, 1062 n.30 (D.C.Cir.1981) (en <em>banc) </em>(Sunshine Act is \u201can entirely different act\"); <em>id, </em>670 F.2d at 1080-1081 (MacKinnon, J., concurring) (legislative history of two acts \u201cnot contradictory\u201d); <em>id., </em>670 F.2d at 1052 n.1 (Mikva, J., concurring) (\u201clegislation whose application is invoked in entirely different contexts\u201d); <em>id., </em>670 F.2d at 1108 n.70 (Wilkey, J., dissenting) (two statutes have \u201csame basic purpose\u201d and \u201cclose similarity,\u201d and Sunshine Act is \u201cmodeled\u201d after FOIA).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"50\">\n<p id=\"b958-8\">. During the legislative consideration of the Sunshine Act the Commission acknowledged to the House subcommittee chairman that Exemption 2 was likely to be construed so narrowly that it would not cover budget discussions and other similar matters that the Commission wished to exempt. <em>Government in the Sunshine Act: Hearings, supra </em>note 23, at 445.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"51\">\n<p id=\"b958-9\">. Disclosure under these circumstances would serve the general purposes of the Sunshine Act. \u201c[Wjhere the government is not functioning as well as it could,\u201d the Senate report explained, \u201cpublic exposure should help insure that the quality of work remains at the highest possible level.\u201d S.Rep.No. 94-354, <em>supra </em>note 1, at 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"52\">\n<p id=\"b958-13\">. The Commission also claimed that Exemption 10 justified closing its October 15, 1981 meeting. The exemption applies to discussions that \u201cspecifically concern the agency\u2019s issuance of a subpena, or the agency\u2019s participation in a civil action or proceeding, an action in a foreign court or international tribunal, or an arbitration, or the initiation, conduct, or disposition by the agency of a particular case of formal agency adjudication pursuant to the procedures in section 554 of this title or otherwise involving a determination on the record after opportunity for a hearing.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552b(c)(10) (1976). We need not reach this issue because the government no longer claims that Exemption 10 is applicable to the closed discussions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"53\">\n<p id=\"b959-8\">. The statute requires the government defendant to file its answer within 20 days of the service of the complaint. Ordinarily the United States or an officer or agency thereof is accorded 60 days to answer a complaint. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(a). The Sunshine Act, however, establishes an expedited process because Congress recognized that \u201c(i]t is important that actions brought under this subsection be handled expeditiously in order for public participation to be meaningful.\u201d S.Rep.No.94-354, <em>supra </em>note 1, at 33.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
