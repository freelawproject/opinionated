The parties reached a settlement, and the court subsequently awarded attorney fees to the plaintiff on the ground that she was the prevailing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-13\">Having reviewed the arguments of counsel and transcript of the district court proceedings, we find no error in the district court\u2019s ruling. Accordingly, we affirm the award for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Pratt v.
