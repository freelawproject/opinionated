Broussard, brought this action for judicial review of his termination from his position as postmaster of the Wichita Falls, Texas, post office. Seeking reinstatement and damages, Brous-sard sued the United States Post Office, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>Federal Employee Appeals Authority (\u201cFEAA\u201d) of the former Civil Service Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and ten individual defendants who are or were employees of the Commission or the postal service. The district court: 1) dismissed Broussard\u2019s claims against the individual defendants for lack of jurisdiction; 2) held that Brous-sard\u2019s claim against the postal service was barred for failure to exhaust administrative remedies; and 3) affirmed the Commission\u2019s holding that the Commission lacked jurisdiction to consider the merits of Brous-sard\u2019s claim that he had been wrongfully discharged, because Broussard was not a \u201cpreference eligible\u201d veteran. Broussard appeals. We conclude: 1) that Broussard does not have a private cause of action against the individual defendants; and 2) that the Commission\u2019s conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction over Broussard\u2019s claim is correct. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s holding with respect to these issues. However, because Broussard was not given adequate notice of his appeal rights, we reverse the district court\u2019s holding that Broussard\u2019s claim against the postal service is barred, and we direct that the case be remanded to the postal service for a hearing on the merits of Broussard\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-5\">I. <em>The Factual Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1121-6\">Broussard, a sixteen-year federal employee, became the Wichita Falls postmaster in 1973. In March and April of 1978, postal inspectors conducted an investigation of Broussard and uncovered evidence that Broussard had been engaged in unethical conduct while acting as postmaster. After considering this evidence, Broussard\u2019s superiors mailed Broussard two letters \u2014 a \u201cnotice of proposed emergency suspension\u201d and a \u201cnotice of proposed adverse action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-8\">Broussard denied the allegations of improper conduct, and he presented his case, orally and in writing, to the appropriate postal officials. Nevertheless, the postal officials remained convinced that Broussard had acted in a highly improper manner, and Broussard was notified first that he would be suspended, and subsequently that he would be terminated from postal employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-9\">Broussard desired to appeal the decision to terminate him. Postal employees classified as \u201cpreference eligible\u201d veterans, as defined by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2108, had the option of appealing adverse employment decisions either to the Civil Service Commission <em>or </em>to the postal service\u2019s internal appellate authorities. See 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 1005(a)(2); Postal Service Employee and Labor Relations Manual (\u201cELRM\u201d) \u00a7 662.1. Postal employees who were not preference eligible veterans had no such option \u2014 they could only appeal through the postal service internal appellate route. <em>See </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 752.-103(a)(6) (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-10\">Broussard preferred to appeal to the Commission, and, at first blush, he appeared to be entitled to do so, because he had been classified as a preference eligible throughout his entire sixteen-year tenure as a federal employee. However, on the same day that Broussard was suspended, the postal service sent him a letter advising him that a review of his personnel folder had revealed that he was not entitled to preference eligible status. Broussard felt that he was entitled to preference eligible status and that the postal service\u2019s contrary conclusion was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-11\">Thus, although Broussard wanted to appeal to the Commission, he could only do so if he could first convince the appropriate officials that he was indeed entitled to preference eligible status. More importantly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1106\">*1106</page-number>because postal regulations provided that an appeal to the Commission would be regarded as a waiver of the right to appeal to the internal postal service appellate authorities, <em>see </em>ELRM \u00a7 662.1, Broussard needed a method by which he could have the preference eligibility issue resolved <em>before </em>he was obliged to file his appeal either to the Commission (if he was entitled to preference eligible status) or to the postal service internal appellate authorities (if he was not entitled to preference eligible status).</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-4\">The letter informing Broussard that he was deemed not to be entitled to preference eligible status did not inform him as to how he might obtain review of that decision. And the letter informing Broussard of his termination advised him only that he had a right to appeal via the internal postal service route. In response to the termination notification, Broussard, through counsel, informed the postal service that he disputed its conclusion that he was not a preference eligible veteran. He declared that he would \u201cpursue his rights of appeal to the U.S. Civil Service Commission.\u201d However, because the question of preference eligibility was disputed, Broussard stated that he wished to take an internal postal service appeal, an appeal \u201csubject to and conditional upon a final denial of Mr. Broussard\u2019s veteran\u2019s preference, and a dismissal of his concurrent appeal to the . . . Commission.\u201d Broussard asked that the internal postal service proceedings be held in abeyance for a period of sixty days, \u201cor until such earlier time as Mr. Broussard\u2019s rights of veteran\u2019s preference and of appeal to the . . . Commission are finally determined by that agency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-5\">In reply, On May 4, 1978, the postal service sent Broussard\u2019s counsel a letter advising that a conditional appeal would not be acceptable. Although the letter clearly indicated that by filing concurrent appeals, Broussard had chosen an improper method of resolving the threshold jurisdictional question whether Broussard was entitled to preference eligible status, the postal service indicated that there was a different method by which the veteran\u2019s preference issue could be resolved, a method that would preserve Broussard\u2019s right to appeal to the Commission if he won on this threshold issue, and his right to appeal to the postal service if he lost on this issue. The letter stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1122-7\">The question of veteran\u2019s preference is a separate issue which we feel could be determined in a matter of a few days. We would be happy to cooperate with the Civil Service Commission and furnish whatever information they desire to determine Mr. Broussard\u2019s status. We cannot however, agree to a sixty-day extension. It appears to us that the time between now and May 31, 1978 [the deadline for filing an internal postal service appeal], is sufficient for that determination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1122-8\">A subsequent letter from the postal service to Broussard\u2019s attorney reiterated that the service would not honor a conditional appeal, and restated the postal service\u2019s opinion that \u201cthe question of veteran\u2019s preference can be resolved without an appeal to the FEAA.\u201d Significantly, neither letter specified <em>how </em>Broussard could secure a final decision on the veteran\u2019s preference issue \u201cin a matter of days,\u201d and \u201cwithout an appeal to the FEAA.\u201d Instead, both letters simply suggested, rather vaguely, that there was some unspecified method by which this could be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-9\">In response to these letters, Broussard noted in his reply letter of May 16, 1978 that he only wanted to await the Commission\u2019s determination of a collateral \u201cprocedural point,\u201d i.e., the veteran\u2019s preference issue. Broussard requested a written clarification of \u201cthe postal service position with regard to the determination for appeal purposes of the veteran\u2019s preference.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-10\">Two days later, however, without awaiting the requested clarification from the postal service, Broussard filed a formal appeal with the Commission. Although Broussard now asks this court to interpret this as an appeal of only the veteran\u2019s preference issue, it is clear that Broussard asked the Commission to consider the merits of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>termination, in addition to the veteran\u2019s preference issue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1123-5\">Subsequently, without providing the requested clarification as to the veteran\u2019s preference question, the postal service informed Broussard that, because he was persisting with his appeal to the Commission, his appeal to the postal service was unacceptable. The service, through its regional postmaster, declared that it \u201cconsider[ed] the matter closed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-6\">Broussard appealed the regional postmaster\u2019s decision to the Assistant Postmaster General (\u201cAPG\u201d) in charge of employee relations. Broussard argued that his \u201ccase was in effect dismissed below on the procedural point of whether the employee could contend that he was entitled to Veteran\u2019s Preference and preserve his rights of appeal thereby, while at the same trial pursuing an appeal through the postal service.\u201d The APG, however, affirmed the rejection of Broussard\u2019s appeal. The APG conceded that the issue of Broussard\u2019s entitlement to preference eligible status was \u201cultimately a matter for the Civil Service Commission to adjudicate.\u201d However, because Broussard had, despite warnings, persisted with his attempt to file dual appeals, the APG deemed the regional postmaster\u2019s actions to be proper, and he rendered a \u201cfinal decision\u201d to this effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-7\">Having lost any possibility of a postal service appeal, Broussard at this point could only hope that the Commission would rule in his favor on the veteran\u2019s preference issue, so that he could receive review of the merits of his termination from the Commission. However, the Commission found that Broussard was not a \u201cveteran\u201d within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2108, that he was therefore not entitled to preference eligibility, and that the Commission therefore lacked jurisdiction to consider the merits of his termination. Accordingly, Broussard\u2019s appeal to the Commission was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-9\">II. <em>The Proceedings Below</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1123-10\">After the Commission dismissed his appeal, Broussard commenced the present action in the district court. In addition to invoking the district court\u2019s <em>appellate </em>jurisdiction to review the administrative decisions of the postal service and the Commission, Broussard invoked the court\u2019s <em>original </em>jurisdiction by joining direct claims for damages against the postal service, the Commission, and the individual employees of the two agencies who were said to be responsible for Broussard\u2019s allegedly wrongful discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-11\">The postal service responded to this suit in a rather novel manner. Even though Broussard had received a \u201cfinal decision\u201d that he had waived his right to a postal service appeal by appealing to the Commission, the service now decided to waive this procedural argument and grant Broussard a hearing. The service then asked the court to dismiss the case because administrative proceedings were still pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-12\">Broussard felt that, because he had filed suit, the postal service could not unilaterally reopen the administrative proceedings. He decided not to participate in the hearing scheduled by the postal service, and he filed a motion in the district court to abate the postal service hearing. However, before the court could rule on this motion, the hearing was held. Broussard did not attend.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-13\">The court subsequently denied the postal service\u2019s motion for dismissal and, <em>sua sponte, </em>requested that the following two issues be briefed on cross-motions for summary judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-14\">1. Whether it is a denial of due process to require a postal employee to waive his rights to appeal the merits of a dismissal through the United States Postal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1108\">*1108</page-number>Service in order to obtain a ruling on his status as a veteran\u2019s preference eligible where there is a dispute and a ruling would determine his entitlement to an appeal through the Federal Employees Appeal Authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1124-4\">2. If it is a denial of due process to require such a waiver, whether the Court should remand to the agency for an evi-dentiary hearing or determine the existence of substantial evidence to support the dismissal from the present administrative record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1124-5\">In response, the postal service frankly conceded that the court\u2019s first hypothetical had to be answered \u201cyes it is a denial of due process.\u201d However, the service argued that it had not forced Broussard to waive any of his postal service appellate rights in order to obtain a ruling from the Commission on his preference eligibility status. The postal service noted that Broussard had appealed the <em>merits </em>of his termination to the Commission (in addition to the veteran\u2019s preference question), and that, in any event, the service had offered him a hearing but he did not attend.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-6\">After receiving a plethora of briefs on these and other issues, the court issued several memorandum opinions and orders dismissing the direct actions <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and setting a schedule for completion of discovery, supplementation of the record, and final disposition of the action. In one of these opinions, the court expressed doubt that the postal service\u2019s unilaterally-scheduled hearing, offered after the commencement of litigation, could have any effect upon Broussard\u2019s rights in this action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1124-7\">Had this matter been made the subject of a motion to remand, the Court could have considered the adverse issues in an orderly fashion and compelled plaintiff\u2019s attendance at a hearing, if remand was indicated, with an understanding on all sides about the nature of the hearing, its effect on other issues and the timing of further proceedings. If plaintiff had refused to appear and present his case under those circumstances, the Court would be in a position to find a dispositive failure to exhaust. However, the Court declines to treat the simple belated resumption of administrative action as a circumstance requiring the litigant to return to the agency to exhaust whatever irregular proceedings the agency is prepared to offer. The minimal burden involved in first aproaching the court with a motion to remand when the agency has determined that further action is advisable is greatly outweighed by the clarification of positions that would result from an orderly consideration of the aggrieved party\u2019s objections to remand.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1124-11\">Perhaps taking its cue from this opinion, the postal service, without admitting any impropriety, expressed its willingness to provide Broussard with another hearing, and moved for a remand of the case to it, with instructions to grant another hearing to Broussard. Broussard opposed this motion and requested a remand to the Commission, based on the contention that he was entitled to veteran\u2019s preference status as a matter of law. The court deferred ruling on both motions pending completion of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-12\">Thereafter, the record was completed and the opposing litigants renewed their cross-motions for summary judgment. At this time, the postal service expressly stated that it would <em>not </em>argue that the plaintiff\u2019s failure to participate in the unilaterally-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1109\">*1109</page-number>scheduled hearing constituted a failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Instead, the postal service returned to its original argument that Broussard, by persisting with his appeal to the Commission, waived his right to a postal service appeal and therefore failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. Accordingly, the postal service asked for summary judgment in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-4\">The district court, without ruling on the still-pending motions for remand, agreed with the postal service and held that Brous-sard\u2019s suit against the postal service was barred for nonexhaustion of administrative remedies. In addition, the court affirmed the Commission\u2019s decision that Broussard was not entitled to veteran\u2019s preference status. Thus, judgment was granted in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-5\">Broussard then perfected this appeal. He reurges his contention that he is a preference eligible veteran and that the Commission therefore acted improperly by refusing to consider the merits of his appeal. He further contends that the postal service denied him due process and violated its own regulations by failing to accord him a timely hearing. Finally, Broussard contends that the lower court erred by dismissing his direct claims against the individual defendants. Finding that Broussard is entitled to a hearing before the postal service, we reverse the dismissal for nonexhaustion of administrative remedies and direct that the case be remanded to the agency for a hearing. In all other respects, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-6\">III. <em>The Commission\u2019s Decision Must Be Affirmed, Because Broussard Is Not a Preference Eligible Veteran</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1125-7\">The threshold issue, the issue that can rightfully be said to have spawned this entire litigation, is whether Broussard is a preference eligible veteran within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2108. If he is entitled to preference eligible status, then undisputedly Broussard is entitled to have this case remanded for a hearing before the Commission\u2019s successor agency (the Merit Systems Protection Board, see note 1 <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1125-9\">Although below Broussard asserted several theories regarding his entitlement to preference eligible status, for purposes of this appeal he has apparently abandoned all but one of these theories. He contends that he was entitled to preference eligible status because he has a service-connected disability-</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-10\">The relevant statute, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2108(3)(C), provides that a person is \u201cpreference eligible\u201d if he is \u201ca disabled veteran.\u201d A disabled veteran is defined as \u201can individual <em>who has served on active duty in the armed forces, </em>has been separated therefrom under honorable conditions, <em>and </em>has established the present existence of a service-connected disability or is receiving [disability benefits or other specified military benefits].\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2108(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-11\">The Commission found: 1) that Brous-sard had <em>not </em>served on active duty in the armed forces, and 2) that he had <em>not </em>established a service-connected disability. With regard to the first finding, the Commission found that, because all of Broussard\u2019s full-time duty was <em>for training only, </em>he had not served on \u201cactive duty\u201d within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2108. This conclusion was said to be based on chapter 211, subchapter l-la(l) (now chapter 211, subchapter 2-1(2)) of the Federal Personnel Manual, which defines \u201cactive duty\u201d as \u201cFull time duty with military pay and allowances in the armed forces, <em>except for training </em>or for determining physical fitness\u201d (emphasis added). Broussard has not challenged this finding, which we believe is dispositive of the veteran\u2019s preference issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-12\">Broussard <em>does </em>challenge the district court\u2019s affirmance of the Commission\u2019s finding that he had not established a service-connected disability. The Commission\u2019s conclusion on this point was based on a Veteran\u2019s Administration (VA) finding to this effect, a finding that was <em>reversed </em>by VA appellate authorities about one year <em>after </em>the Commission rendered its decision. The district court held that this subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>VA action could not affect the validity of the Commission\u2019s prior decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-4\">We are inclined to believe that Broussard would be entitled- to a remand to the Commission\u2019s successor agency for a redetermination of the preference eligibility issue, if during the pendency of judicial review the VA\u2019s subsequent finding of a service-connected disability would have restored to Broussard the preference eligibility status he had enjoyed during his entire sixteen years of postal employment. However, we do not deem the service-connected disability controversy to be material. The Commission\u2019s decision must be affirmed regardless of whether Broussard is entitled to the benefits of the VA appellate ruling declaring his service-connected disability, because Broussard has not challenged the finding that he never served on \u201cactive duty\u201d within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2108. A contrary finding on this point seems to be an essential prerequisite to a finding of preference eligibility, even for those with a service-connected disability. See <em>supra. See also </em>Federal Personnel Manual, chapter 211, subchapter 2-1(6), footnote 2 (\u201c[E]ven an individual who is receiving [disability compensation from the VA] is not eligible for preference, unless he or she has met the requirement of having served on active duty, other than for training, as defined in 2-1(2) of this section.\u201d) Although Broussard\u2019s disability was service-connected and incurred during full-time military service, as a member of the United States Marine Corps Reserve, the active duty during which Broussard was injured was undisputedly for training only, and, under an administrative interpretative regulation approved by the district court as reasonable and not challenged on appeal, it thus did not constitute \u201cactive duty\u201d within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2108.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-5\">Accordingly, Broussard is not a preference veteran, the Commission properly dismissed his appeal, and the district court correctly affirmed the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-6\">IV. <em>Broussard is Entitled to a Hearing Before the Postal Service</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1126-7\">As we see it, both Broussard and the postal service must share the blame for the unfortunate set of circumstances that led to Broussard\u2019s failing to receive any hearing from anyone on the merits of his termination. Broussard, on the one hand, failed to heed express warnings not to seek Commission review of the merits of his termination while seeking Commission review of the preference eligibility issue: Also, Broussard acted rather precipitously by filing his Commission appeal on May 18, without first awaiting the clarification of the postal service position that he had requested just two days previously.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-9\">The postal service, on the other hand, failed to provide Broussard with sufficient information as to how he could obtain a dispositive ruling on the threshold veteran\u2019s preference issue while preserving his right to a postal service appeal of the merits if he lost on this threshold issue, and his right to a Commission appeal if he won. The postal service: 1) conceded that the Commission had the ultimate authority to adjudicate the veteran\u2019s preference issue; 2) conceded that Broussard had the right to seek review of the veteran\u2019s preference issue without waiving his postal service appeal rights; 3) informed Broussard that the procedural course he was taking in hope of preserving his rights <em>(i.e., </em>concurrent appeals) was improper; 4) hinted that there was some other course that would be proper; <em>but </em>5) failed, despite request, to provide information about the unspecified proper course. We find that this failure to provide Broussard with this information violated Broussard\u2019s right, as provided by ELRM \u00a7 661.34, to notification of his \u201cappropriate appeal rights, including Veterans\u2019 Preference Act appeal rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-10\">It appears that a good part of the problem arises from the complex division of authority between administrative agencies in the determination of the veteran\u2019s preference status of a federal employee. As we understand it, no less than three agencies\u2014 the Commission, the VA, and the employing agency \u2014 all have a role to play in this determination. And this issue simply must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>definitively resolved before an employee such as Broussard can make an informed decision as to where to appeal the merits of a termination or other \u201cadverse action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-5\">Of course, the ideal solution is for agencies to resolve preference eligibility questions long <em>before </em>any \u201cadverse action\u201d against an employee is necessary. While this will not always be possible, in the present case the government allowed Brous-sard\u2019s claim to preference eligible status to remain unchallenged for sixteen years. Where, as here, for whatever reason, an employee is notified simultaneously of an adverse action and of a change in his preference eligible status, the present administrative system gives rise to clashes of important conflicting interests. The employee has a strong interest in preserving his appellate options while he appeals the veteran\u2019s preference issue, perhaps all the way to the United States Supreme Court. The employer, in contrast, has a strong interest in requiring the employee to choose quickly between alternative appellate routes. The employer could ill afford to hold adverse action review proceedings in abeyance for the years it would take an employee to exhaust administrative and judicial procedures in connection with the veteran\u2019s preference issue, because during this time witnesses\u2019 memories would dim and the employer\u2019s potential back pay liability would increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-6\">The postal service did tell Broussard that the veteran\u2019s preference issue could be resolved \u201cin a matter of days\u201d and \u201cwithout an appeal to the PEA A.\u201d Although the postal service has never clarified exactly how this could have been done, as best as we can understand, the postal service was suggesting that Broussard could: 1) appeal the threshold preference eligibility issue, but <em>not </em>the merits of his termination, to the Commission; 2) request expedited treatment of this limited appeal; 3) obtain the Commission\u2019s decision prior to the expiration of the fifteen-day limitations period for filing an appeal of the merits of his termination; and then 4) timely file his appeal of the merits of his termination with the appropriate agency (the Commission if he won on the threshold issue; the postal service if he lost).</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-9\">If this is in fact what the postal service was suggesting (and, of course, we are by no means certain of this), then this should have been spelled out explicitly to Broussard, especially in view of the fact that he expressly requested a clarification. The postal service\u2019s own regulations require it to notify an employee subject to termination of his \u201cappropriate appeal rights, including Veterans\u2019 Preference Act appeal rights.\u201d ELRM \u00a7 661.34.. In most cases, this should be a simple task \u2014 if the employee is undisputedly not a preference eligible veteran, he can be accurately informed that he can appeal only through the postal service; if he undisputedly is preference eligible, he can be informed of his option to appeal either to the postal service or to the Commission. However, where, as here, preference eligibility is disputed, then it is impossible for the postal service meaningfully to inform the employee of his \u201cappropriate\u201d appeal rights without including a clear and accurate explanation as to how he can obtain resolution of the veteran\u2019s preference issue without waiving his right to an appeal of the merits of his termination. We find that, under ELRM \u00a7 661.34, the postal service should have provided Broussard with such an explanation,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> at least after he requested it, and that Broussard is entitled to have, this case remanded for a hearing before the postal service.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-10\">Because we have previously rejected Broussard\u2019s claim to preference eligible status, the postal service is the only agency with jurisdiction to consider his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-11\">In view of our finding that the postal service acted contrary to its own regulation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>we need not decide whether the postal service\u2019s actions deprived Broussard of his constitutional right to due process of law. We also need not decide whether the method impliedly suggested by the postal service for resolving the veteran\u2019s preference issue <em>(i.e., </em>a limited expedited appeal to the Commission, with the issue to be finally resolved within fifteen days) comports with due process. Presumably, the postal service would argue that the employee should have to choose between appellate routes soon after receiving the Commission\u2019s expedited decision as to his preference eligibility, while the employee would argue that, if the Commission\u2019s decision is adverse to him, he should be entitled to await the results of judicial review before being forced to choose. We suggest that the concerned agencies work out a procedure that will eliminate the need for any court ever to have to decide the difficult issues implicated where the employee\u2019s appellate rights are jeopardized by agency action that simultaneously both disciplines him and deprives him of a previously-recognized clear procedural remedy because of a change in the veterans preference status previously accorded him during the period of his government employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-4\">We additionally note that, even if the postal service had been acting within its rights by treating Broussard\u2019s appeal to the Commission as a waiver of his postal service appellate rights, the postal service was willing to ameliorate the harsh effect of its ruling by offering Broussard a hearing and moving to remand the case to it. By granting summary judgment to the postal service without ruling on the motion to remand, the district court, in effect, granted less relief to Broussard than the postal service was willing to give. In any event, we find that Broussard is entitled to a hearing, and we direct that the case be remanded to the postal service for such.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1128-6\">V. <em>Broussard Does Not Have a Private Right of Action Against the Individual Defendants</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1128-7\">Broussard\u2019s remaining contention, that the district court erred by dismissing his claim against the individual defendants, requires only brief comment. Broussard contends that the individual defendants violated his constitutional due process rights by failing to grant him a hearing, and that he is therefore entitled to damages pursuant to a B/vens-type implied private right of action under the fifth amendment of the constitution. <em>See Bivens </em>v. <em>Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-8\">This court recently held, however, that federal employees have no B/vens-type remedy against their employment superiors. <em>Bush </em>v. <em>Lucas, </em>647 F.2d 573 (5th Cir. 1981). The <em>Bush </em>court found that, by providing federal civil servants with a comprehensive, judicially-re viewable administrative remedy for violations of their rights, \u201cCongress has taken to carefully balance the employee\u2019s rights as a citizen with the Government\u2019s interest in the efficient conduct of the nation\u2019s business.\u201d 647 F.2d at 576-77. The court also noted that the inference of a B/vens-type remedy would undermine the government\u2019s control over its internal personnel affairs, encourage aggrieved employees to bypass statutory and administrative remedies, and provide a disincentive for Congress to improve administrative mechanisms. <em>Id. </em>at 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-9\">Broussard argues that <em>Bush </em>is distinguishable because <em>Bush </em>involved only a demotion, whereas the present case involves a termination, and because, in the present case, the defendants allegedly have conspired to deny him access to the available administrative remedies. We find these distinctions to be unpersuasive, and we deem <em>Bush </em>to be controlling. We have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>concluded that Broussard is entitled to a hearing before the postal service; that hearing and subsequent judicial review will provide Broussard with a full and fair opportunity to vindicate his rights. Accordingly, we hold that the district court correctly dismissed Broussard\u2019s claims against the individual defendants.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1129-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-6\">We find that Broussard is not entitled to veteran\u2019s preference eligible status, and that he cannot maintain a private action against the individual defendants. We therefore AFFIRM the district court on these two issues. We conclude that Brous-sard is entitled to a hearing before the postal service, and that the district court\u2019s contrary finding must accordingly be REVERSED. The case is REMANDED to the district court, with instructions to remand the case to the postal service for a hearing on the merits of Broussard\u2019s termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-7\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1121-7\">. Effective January 1, 1979, the Civil Service Commission was reorganized into the Merit Systems Protection Board (Bo\u00e1rd) and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 specified that the adjudicating functions of the Commission would be administered by the independent Board while the management functions of the Commission would become the province of OPM. See Public Law 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111, <em>et seq. </em>For the purposes of this opinion, we shall refer to the Civil Service Commission rather than the Board or OPM, because Broussard complains of the actions of the former Commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1123-8\">. Broussard\u2019s letter to the Commission began:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"alg-dedup-1\">A Letter of Decision \u2014 Adverse Action \u2014 Removal, effective May 16, 1978, has been received by Wichita Falls, Texas Postmaster Eugene J. Broussard. A copy of that document is attached. The employee, Eugene J. Broussard, appeals to your agency that decision, and requests a timely hearing.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1124-8\">. Broussard argued that he could maintain a Bivens-type implied private action for damages against the individual defendants for alleged violations of his constitutional due process rights. The district court found (and we agree, see V, infra) that no Bivens-type remedy could be implied under the facts of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1124-9\">. Although the district judge did not cite any authority in support of his conclusion, his instinct was totally in accord with the prevailing jurisprudence. The rule is that once a judicial suit is filed, an agency should not unilaterally reopen administrative proceedings \u2014 the agency should first ask the court to remand the case to it. <em>See, e.g., Exxon Corp. </em>v. <em>Train, </em>554 F.2d 1310, 1316 (5th Cir. 1977); <em>Anchor Line Ltd. </em>v. <em>Federal Maritime Comm'n., </em>299 F.2d 124, 125 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>370 U.S. 922, 82 S.Ct. 1563, 8 L.Ed.2d 503 (1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1127-7\">. Analogously, when disciplinary action is taken by an agency against a career employee entitled to review by the Commission, the agency is required to notify the employee in writing of his right to appeal to the appropriate office of the Commission, of the time limits, and of \u201c[w]here he [the employee] may obtain information as to how to pursue an appeal.\u201d 5 CFR \u00a7 752.202(f) (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1128-5\">. Broussard contends (without the support of any evidence) that the postal service is \u201cbiased\u201d against him and will not provide him with a fair hearing. He therefore asks that this case be remanded not to the postal service, but to the district court for a <em>de novo </em>hearing. However, we refuse to presume that the postal service will not grant Broussard a fair hearing. Any irregularity can be corrected by judicial review subsequent to the hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1129-17\">. Because Broussard\u2019s claim against the individual defendants is nonfrivolous and it \u201carises under\u201d the federal constitution, the district court technically erred by dismissing this claim for lack of jurisdiction rather than for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. <em>See Williamson v. Tucker, </em>645 F.2d 404, 415 (5th Cir.) cert. denied, - U.S. -, 102 S.Ct. 396, 70 L.Ed.2d 212 (1981). The error is immaterial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
