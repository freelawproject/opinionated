After a hearing an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) agreed with OSHA and found a violation. The Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (Commission) denied discretionary review, issued a final order finding a violation, and imposed a $1440.00 penalty. Pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660(a), petitioner seeks review of the Commission\u2019s decision. \u2019 We affirm/</p>\n<p id=\"b613-19\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b613-20\">OSHA compliance officer John R. God-frey inspected a trench petitioner was digging as part of a municipal sewer project. Godfrey\u2019s experience and expertise in trench inspection were decidedly limited: he lacked formal training in engineering <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and had previously inspected only three or four trenches other than petitioner\u2019s. Despite these handicaps, Godfrey concluded that pe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>titioner\u2019s trench posed a serious cave-in hazard, in violation of OSHA regulations, because he observed small particles of sand sloughing off the top of the trench. God-frey did not measure the slope of the trench\u2019s sides nor did he know whether the trench was in clay, which is cohesive and unlikely to collapse, or sand, which is unstable and given to collapse. Indeed, after conducting a walk around inspection, God-frey was unsure whether an offense even existed, because he \u201cwasn\u2019t really qualified to make this evaluation.\u201d Tr. at 62. Nevertheless, nearly two weeks after the inspection, a citation issued against petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">During the administrative hearing, the government\u2019s evidence consisted of testimony by Godfrey, outlined above, and by Dr. William T. Painter, president of a company specializing in soil mechanics and foundation engineering. Painter, who never visited the trench site, testified that the trench\u2019s angulation was too steep and that its soil consistency was unstable. He based his expert opinion, in part, on a soil sample produced from a test boring taken 100 feet from the location designated in the OSHA citation. Although the boring could accurately illustrate soil composition if drilled within a few feet of the actual site, Painter admitted that subsoil could vary greatly along the length of a trench, thereby casting doubt upon the relevancy of the test boring. He did indicate, however, that his opinion was also based on other factors, such as the type of soil revealed in pictures taken by Godfrey, the moisture in the ground that would normally thaw during late March, and the rapid trench-wall collapse falling rain would cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Petitioner, on the other hand, produced a number of witnesses who testified that the trenching operation was completely safe. For the most part they were engineers, experienced employees, or both. Among other things, these witnesses pointed out that the heavy weight of the trucks and backhoe working the site caused no significant dirt slippage, nor did these vehicles sink into the ground, thereby evidencing the subsoil\u2019s strong support. Similarly, routine tests and inspections by petitioner\u2019s witnesses demonstrated that the ground was mainly composed of cohesive, solid clay. The ALJ, however, accepted Painter\u2019s opinion over those rendered by petitioner\u2019s witnesses and, as a result, concluded that the trench soil was \u201caverage,\u201d meaning unstable. Therefore, the ALJ found a violation of 29 C.F.R. 1926.652(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Petitioner claims that the record, considered as a whole, does not present substantial evidence to support the Commission\u2019s findings. In addition, petitioner argues that a violation can be found only if the trench posed a significant risk of harm in the workplace. We disagree with both contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">Given the conflicting expert opinions, we can understand petitioner\u2019s disenchantment with the decisions of the ALJ and the Commission. Were we the trier of fact in this case, we doubt very much whether we would have believed Painter\u2019s opinion, based largely on photographs and conjecture, over the opinions of petitioner\u2019s witnesses, all of whom were at the site daily. But our role is more limited. \u201cWe clearly may not substitute our judgment for that of the [Commission].\u201d <em>International Harvester Co. v. OSHRC, </em>628 F.2d 982, 987 (7th Cir. 1980). The Commission\u2019s findings of fact, if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, are conclusive. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660(a); <em>International Harvester, </em>628 F.2d at 986.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">The present case turned upon a close question of credibility, and we are not at liberty to overturn credibility resolutions unless they are contradicted by \u201cuncontrovertible documentary evidence or physical facts.\u201d <em>International Harvester, </em>628 F.2d at 986, <em>quoting Olin Construction Co. v. OSHRC, </em>525 F.2d 464, 467 (2d Cir. 1975). No such documentary evidence or physical facts are present here, just differing expert opinions. Therefore, in light of Painter\u2019s testimony, we conclude that the evidence supporting the Commission\u2019s decision, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>though far from overwhelming, is substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">Petitioner\u2019s second argument, that the Commission\u2019s decision must be reversed because it contains no finding that petitioner\u2019s employees faced a \u201csignificant risk\u201d of harm while in the trench, is also without merit. Petitioner\u2019s authority for this proposition is <em>Industrial Union Dept. v. American Petroleum Institute, </em>448 U.S. 607, 100 S.Ct. 2844, 65 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1980). That decision, however, is inapposite. The Supreme Court in <em>Industrial Union </em>was concerned that Congress might have unconstitutionally delegated legislative power to the Secretary of Labor by granting the Secretary sweeping authority to set permanent health standards under section 6(b)(5) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(b)(5). To limit the Secretary\u2019s power, the Court construed section 6(b)(5) as implicitly requiring the Secretary to make a threshold finding that significant occupational risks are present before promulgating any permanent health standard. 448 U.S. at 642, 100 S.Ct. at 2864. Thus, <em>Industrial Union </em>chiefly examined the scope of the Secretary\u2019s rulemaking authority under section 6(b)(5). In this case, however, petitioner challenges the standard governing the Secretary\u2019s enforcement power under section 6(a) of the Act, not the Secretary\u2019s rulemaking authority under section 6(b)(5). Clearly, then, <em>Industrial Union </em>is not controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">To state a prima facie violation of the Act, the Secretary need only prove a regulatory standard and its violation, where the standard is specific. <em>Greyhound Lines-West v. Marshall, </em>575 F.2d 759, 762 (9th Cir. 1978). 29 C.F.R. 1926.652(b), which sets out proper trench dimensions and requires bracing or other supports to prevent cave-ins, is quite specific. Dr. Painter\u2019s testimony provided proof of the violation. Therefore, the Secretary established a prima facie case.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Petitioner\u2019s final argument is that the trench standards under 29 C.F.R. 1926.-652(b) are vague. We disagree. Petitioner principally relies on workshop materials that criticize 29 C.F.R. 1926.652(b), but these materials are designated \u201cnot for reference or publication.\u201d Since the workshop materials obviously are not published regulations, we attach no significance to them. The challenged regulation lists trench measurements and incorporates various tables recommending appropriate trench slope inclination. In addition, 29 C.F.R. 1926.653(q) defines \u201cunstable soil.\u201d The standards, therefore, are not vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">We have considered petitioner\u2019s remaining arguments and find them without merit. Accordingly, the Commission\u2019s decision is</p>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b613-11\">. Section 5(a)(2) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(a)(2), requires that each employer \u201cshall comply with occupational safety and health standards promulgated under this Act.\u201d Section 17(a), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(a), provides a civil penalty of up to $10,000 for a repeated violation of the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b613-12\">. 29 CFR 1926.652(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-13\">Sides of trenches in unstable or soft material, 5 feet or more in depth, shall be sheeted, braced, sloped, or otherwise supported by rneaos of sufficient strength to protect the employees working within them.
