EDWARDS, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"AL\">This appeal has been brought by Western Broadcasting Company, licensee of class A FM radio station KOCM in Newport Beach, California,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> pursuant to Section 402(b) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(b) (1976) (hereafter \u201cthe Act\u201d). Appellant challenges an Order of the Federal Communications Commission (hereafter \u201cFCC\u201d or \u201cCommission\u201d), granting the application of intervenor, Santa Monica Broadcasting, Inc., for a construction permit to change the transmitter location of class A FM radio station KSRF in Santa Monica, California.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">On January 30,1979, \u201cKSRF ... applied for a construction permit to change its transmitter location with an accompanying decrease in its effective radiated power and increase in antenna height above average terrain.\u201d <em>Santa Monica Broadcasting, Inc., </em>79 F.C.C.2d 949 (1980). On May 30, 1979, appellant KOCM filed a Petition to Deny the KSRF application on the ground that the proposed new KSRF mountainside transmitter site would result in \u201c \u2018ruinous\u2019 interference to the KOCM signal.\u201d Joint Appendix (J.A.) 9.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Following receipt of further written pleadings from both appellant and intervenor, but without a hearing on the issues in dispute, the Commission approved the KSRF application for a construction permit and rejected the KOCM Petition to Deny.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In its Memorandum Opinion, the Commission first observed \u201cthat KOCM ... erred in its engineering analysis by substantially underestimating the degree of present interference and overestimating the degree of proposed interference.\u201d 79 F.C.C.2d at 951. The Commission therefore ruled that the grant of the KSRF application would not constitute a modification of the KOCM license because \u201cKSRF\u2019s proposal will involve no additional area of interference with KOCM\u2019s 1 mV/m contour.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Commission then concluded that \u201cKSRF\u2019s compliance with Section 73.213 [47 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.213 (1980)] mandates that KOCM\u2019s objection on contour-interference grounds is inapplicable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, the Commission rejected, as \u201cof no consequence,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 952, KOCM\u2019s contention that the proposed modification would alter KSRF\u2019s status as a small class A station primarily serving Santa Monica.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">On September 16, 1980, KOCM filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the Commission\u2019s grant of KSRF\u2019s application. J.A. 116. This petition was denied by the FCC on January 21, 1981, again without a hearing, on the ground \u201cthat petitioner [had] failed to raise a substantial and material question of fact which would require a hearing.\u201d J.A. 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-12\">On the record before us, we find that appellant\u2019s claim, alleging that the grant of the KSRF application may create objectionable interference, raises a legally cognizable issue under Section 316 of the Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>cordingly, we hold that appellant was entitled to notice and an opportunity to show cause in a public hearing why the proposed order of modification should not issue. We therefore reverse in part the Orders of the FCC and remand this case to the agency for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">KOCM and KSRF are commercial FM radio broadcast stations operating on the same frequency. KOCM\u2019s city of license is Newport Beach and its present areas of coverage include Newport Beach and some surrounding locales in Orange County, California. KSRF\u2019s city of license is Santa Monica and its present areas of coverage include Santa Monica, Beverly Hills and sections of the Westside of Los Angeles, California. The stations have existed as \u201cco-channel\u201d operations on Channel 167A (103.1 MHz) since as early as 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-14\">Under usual Commission rules, it is required that a minimum of 65 miles separate co-channel class A FM stations such as KOCM and KSRF. <em>See Revision of FM Broadcast Rules, First Report and Order </em>(Docket No. 14185), 40 F.C.C. 662, 689 (1962); <em>see also </em>47 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.208 (1980). However, for a number of years now, KOCM and KSRF have operated as \u201cshort-spaced\u201d stations, separated only by a distance of approximately 41.5 miles. This \u201cshort-spacing\u201d is permitted pursuant to an extensive Commission rulemaking in Docket 14185,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in which rules were established to allow co-channel FM stations to operate at spacings below the 65-mile minimum if the stations were already licensed in a short-spaced condition as of November 16, 1964. 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.213 (1981).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>At the time when KSRF applied for a construction permit to change the location of its transmitter, the station was licensed to operate with 1,835 watts of power, with an antenna site at 95 feet below the average terrain. By contrast, KOCM was licensed to operate with 2,000 watts of power, with an antenna site at something over 300 feet above the average terrain. In its construction permit application, KSRF proposed to move its transmitter to a site 44 miles away from KOCM, but with the new antenna at 575.5 feet above average terrain.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> After KOCM objected to the KSRF application, KSRF amended its proposal to include a directional antenna designed to reduce its power in KOCM\u2019s direction from 562 to 360 watts.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As noted by the Commission, KSRF stated in its application \u201cthat the primary reason behind its proposal was the deterioration of its signal to the city of license, Santa Monica, caused by interference from high-rise construction in the city.\u201d 79 F.C.C.2d at 950.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Appellant maintains that KOCM and KSRF have been able to \u201cco-exist\u201d only because the two stations have \u201cutilized antennas which were at relatively low heights.\u201d Appellant\u2019s brief at 2. KOCM further alleges that destructive interference will result if the KSRF application is approved because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-5\">the new site would provide line of sight conditions between the KSRF antenna and Newport Beach since the KSRF antenna would be peering over the terrain obstruction which had previously protected KOCM\u2019s service area from interference ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-6\">KOCM and KSRF are closer together than any other two stations in the Southern California Area. As a result, the sheer distance which protects other co-channel stations from interference can provide no relief to KOCM. Consequently, KOCM must rely upon intervening terrain or the use of low power by KSRF to protect it from interference. Because there are no intervening terrain features to block KSRF\u2019s signal, operation from KSRF\u2019s proposed site would cause interference to KOCM over a large portion of KOCM\u2019s service area.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">Appellant\u2019s brief at 4, 6 (footnotes omitted). Appellant also challenges the adequacy of the proposed directional antenna, claiming that it would \u201cnot provide for adequate protection of the service of KOCM (FM), either as an absolute or by comparison with the present conditions.\u201d <em>Engineering Report of Hatfield and Dawson, </em>accompanying KOCM\u2019s Reply to KSRF\u2019s Opposition to Petition to Deny, <em>reprinted in </em>J.A. at 88, 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-11\">In its written pleadings to the Commission, KSRF contended that (1) \u201cKSRF\u2019s proposed site is ... in full compliance with the Commission\u2019s rules [47 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.213 (1980) ] for site changes to short spaced FM stations,\u201d J.A. at 102; (2) \u201cKOCM and KSRF have successfully co-existed for years with a much higher level of mutual interference than indicated in the engineering exhibit to KOCM\u2019s petition,\u201d J.A. at 39; and (3) \u201c[u]nder KSRF\u2019s amended proposal, no increase in interference will be caused to KOCM from KSRF\u2019s new site,\u201d J.A. at 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-12\">The Commission, in ruling against KOCM, acknowledged that the fact that the KSRF application complied with the standards set forth in section 73.213 of the Commission\u2019s rules, 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.213 (1980), was not dispositive of KOCM\u2019s claim. Rather, the Commission noted that \u201cthe interference issue [must] be examined on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>case-by-case basis in ... situations of short-spaced stations under Section 73.218.\u201d 79 F.C.C.2d at 951. In this case, however, the Commission could find no \u201clegally protectable\u201d interest because, according to the Commission, \u201cKSRF\u2019s proposal will involve no additional area of interference within KOCM\u2019s 1 mV/m contour....\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The principal question facing this court is whether the Commission could properly dispose of the KOCM claims without an evi-dentiary hearing. We hold that, in the light of the clear statutory mandate found in Section 316 of the Act, see note 5 <em>supra, </em>and because of the numerous highly technical and seriously contested factual issues in this case, the Commission erred in summarily rejecting KOCM\u2019s claims of interference without first conducting an evidentiary hearing on the issues in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">II. THE HEARING REQUIREMENT UNDER SECTION 316 OF THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">A. <em>The Applicability of Section 316</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">Section 316 of the Communications Act provides that \u201cany station license ... may be modified by the Commission ... if in the judgment of the Commission such action will promote the public interest, convenience, and necessity.\u201d <em>See </em>note 5 <em>supra. </em>However, \u201cno such ... modification shall become final until the holder of the license . . . shall have been <em>notified in writing </em>of the proposed action and the grounds and reasons therefor, and shall have been given reasonable opportunity ... to show cause by <em>public hearing, </em>if requested, why such order of modification should not issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). In this case, appellant has sought a hearing under section 316 on the claim that the Commission\u2019s grant of the KSRF application will result in increased interference to KOCM causing an indirect modification of the appellant\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">As justifications for the denial of the requested hearing, the Commission offers a two-fold response: First, in the argument before this court, the Commission urged, for the first time, that no hearing was required because the regulations upon which the modification would be based (47 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.213 (1980)) became effective prior to KOCM\u2019s current three-year term of license. In other words, the Commission now contends that, even assuming that there will be increased interference attributable to a change in the KSRF antenna site, the action of the Commission cannot, as a matter of law, be viewed as a \u201cmodification\u201d under section 316. Second, in its Memorandum Opinion and Order denying appellant\u2019s request for reconsideration, the Commission ruled that appellant \u201chas failed to raise a substantial and material question of fact which would require a hearing.\u201d J.A. at 136. Thus, according to the Commission, even if appellant\u2019s claim refers to a legally cognizable \u201cmodification\u201d under section 316, the claim nevertheless may be dismissed pursuant to a summary disposition without a hearing. We reject both of these contentions for the reasons set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-11\">1. <em>The Meaning of a \u201cModification\u201d Under Section 316</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-12\">In its brief to this court, appellee acknowledges that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-13\">[t]he Communications Act explicitly permits the Commission to modify any station license, but only after notification to the licensee and an opportunity for the licensee to show cause in a public hearing why the modification should not be ordered. 47 U.S.C. 316. It has long been established that this provision covers indirect as well as direct modifications of licenses.... Indirect modifications include factual circumstances where it is alleged that a new grant may create objectionable electrical interference to an existing licensee and the existing licensee is protected by Commission policy or regulation from such interference.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-14\">Appellee\u2019s brief at 9-10 (citations omitted). We accept this as an accurate statement of the controlling legal principles in this ease. Indeed, it is for precisely the reasons outlined by appellee that we hold that the Commission erred in denying appellant a hearing under section 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>Despite the acknowledgement that a hearing is required under section 316 <em>\u201cwhere it is alleged </em>that a new grant <em>may </em>create objectionable electrical interference to an existing licensee,\u201d the Commission argues that appellant has no legally pro-tectable interest because the \u201cgrant of KSRF\u2019s application was based on its consistency with Section 73.213 of the Rules and the <em>Fourth Report and Order </em>[see notes 6 and 7 supra], adopted long before KOCM\u2019s current license term.\u201d Appellee\u2019s brief at 10. In short, appellee contends that \u201c[t]he basis for KOCM\u2019s argument that it was entitled to a hearing \u2014 increased objectionable interference within its 1.0 mV/m contour \u2014 was rejected by the Commission as a material consideration in the <em>Fourth Report and Order.\u201d Id. </em>at 10-11. Thus, according to the Commission, appellant\u2019s claim cannot be viewed as a \u201cmodification\u201d under section 316 because, following the conclusion of the rulemaking proceeding in Docket 14185 in 1964, <em>see </em>note 7 <em>supra, </em>\u201cFM licensees were no longer entitled to protection based on their 1.0 mV/m signal contours. They were thereafter protected from interference only to the extent provided by the minimum mileage separations and related rules.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">As has already been suggested above, <em>see </em>note 7 <em>supra, </em>the Commission\u2019s arguments on this point must fail. As noted by appellant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-5\">The Commission premises this argument on the <em>Fourth Report and Order </em>in Docket No. 14185, promulgating Section 73.213 of the Commission\u2019s rules (47 C.F.R. 73.213). However, the provision in that order upon which the Commission relies related only to claims of interference occurring as a result of the change in the rules at that time, not to additional interference, and thus, hearings on subsequent modifications which might result from future changes in another station\u2019s license are not precluded by that Order. KOCM is not arguing that interference caused by KSRF\u2019s existing antenna causes such a modification of its license as to require the holding of a hearing pursuant to Section 316. Rather, KOCM is asserting its rights with respect to the additional interference which would result from the change in KSRF\u2019s antenna site.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7m\">Appellant\u2019s reply brief at 3-4 (footnote omitted). <em>See also </em>discussion at note 7 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">The appellee\u2019s position that appellant\u2019s claim cannot be viewed as a \u201cmodification\u201d under section 316 is wrong as a matter of law and patently inconsistent with the Commission\u2019s own decision here under review. In ruling against appellant, the Commission made it plain that the fact that KSRF\u2019s application complied with the standards set forth in 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.213 was not dispositive of this case. Furthermore, the Commission never suggested, either in its initial decision or in the decision following the request for reconsideration, that appellant\u2019s claim fell outside of the scope of section 316. Rather, the opinion of the Commission first noted that \u201cthe interference issue [must] be examined on a case-by-case basis ... in situations of short-spaced stations under Section 73.213,\u201d and then found that appellant had no \u201clegally pro-tectable\u201d interest in this case because \u201cKSRF\u2019s proposal will involve no additional area of interference within KOCM\u2019s 1 mV/m contour.\u201d 79 F.C.C.2d at 951. These rulings by the FCC surely do not support the contention advanced by appel-lee on this appeal, <em>i.e., </em>that appellant\u2019s claim does not, <em>as a matter of law, </em>raise an issue that is cognizable under section 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">On the record before us, we hold that appellant\u2019s claim, alleging that the grant of the KSRF application may create objectionable interference, raises a legally cognizable issue under section 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">2. <em>The Inapplicability of the \u201cSubstantial and Material Question of Fact\u201d Test</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">The second reason given by the Commission to justify the denial of the requested hearing under section 316 was that appellant had \u201cfailed to raise a substantial and material question of fact which would require a hearing.\u201d J.A. at 136. We reject this justification for two reasons: (1) it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>premised on an erroneous legal standard and (2) it finds no substantial support in the record in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">In ruling that no hearing was required because appellant failed in its written pleadings to raise a \u201csubstantial and material question of fact,\u201d the Commission has employed a legal test that is not authorized by section 316. What the Commission has done is to limit appellant\u2019s rights under section 316 by resort to a standard imported from section 309(d)(2) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(d)(2) (1976). This latter section states, in part, that, with respect to \u201ca petition to deny any application,\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-5\">[i]f the Commission finds on the basis of the application, the pleadings filed, or other matters which it may officially notice that there are no substantial and material questions of fact and that a grant of the application would be consistent with subsection (a) of this section, it shall make the grant, deny the petition, and issue a concise statement of the reasons for denying the petition, which statement shall dispose of all substantial issues raised by the petition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">No such provision appears in section 316. <em>See </em>note 5 <em>supra. </em>Thus, while the Commission may properly dispose of a \u201cpetition to deny\u201d without a hearing under section 309, no comparable authority exists with respect to claims raising legally cognizable issues under section 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">It is undisputed that many claims arising under section 316 also may be covered by section 309. However, the former section is more narrow in scope, limited to cases involving only \u201cmodifications\u201d of station licenses or construction permits. In this limited category of cases, Congress has made it plain that affected licensees \u201cshall,\u201d upon request, have an opportunity to show cause by <em>public hearing </em>why an order of modification should not issue. To follow the test enunciated by the Commission in this case, allowing for summary disposition whenever it appears that there are no substantial and material questions of fact, would be to nullify the clear mandate of section 316. This we will not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-11\">Furthermore, on the facts of this case, we do not understand how the Commission could conclude that there were no substantial questions of fact to be resolved. In support of its petition, appellant submitted engineering statements prepared by the firm of Hatfield and Dawson. <em>See J.A. </em>at 19, 88. Intervenor then offered engineering reports prepared by Jules Cohen &amp; Associates to dispute appellant\u2019s claim of additional interference attributable to the proposed new antenna site. <em>See </em>J.A. at 48, 105. The Commission, relying on the methodology set forth in 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.313 (1980), stated that it \u201cagree[d] with KSRF\u2019s predictions.\u201d 79 F.C.C.2d at 951. The Commission also added that it was \u201cunable to determine the reasons for KOCM\u2019s [engineering] miscalculations.\u201d Id.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-12\">There are at least two obvious flaws in the Commission\u2019s analysis. First, the Commission\u2019s reliance on the calculation methodology specified in 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.313, to the exclusion of appellant\u2019s engineering studies, was misplaced. By its terms, section 73.313 indicates that the calculation methodology set forth therein is to be used for \u201cpredictions of coverage . . . without regard to interference\u201d and \u201conly for the same purposes as relate to the use of field strength contours as specified in \u00a7 73.-311.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s engineering reports ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>plained that although the section 73.313 methodology is relatively easy to apply, it makes no allowances for differences in propagation resulting from variations in terrain, and it fails to take into account unique conditions such as the line of sight (\u201cfree space\u201d) conditions in the present case. Based on their own method of calculation, appellant\u2019s engineers concluded that additional interference would in fact occur if KSRF were permitted to move its transmitter.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Second, in relying solely on the methodology set forth in section 73.313, the Commission not surprisingly concluded that it was <em>\u201cunable </em>to determine the reasons for KOCM\u2019s [alleged engineering] miscalculations.\u201d 79 F.C.C.2d at 951 (emphasis added). The Commission obviously understood that \u201cKOCM [was claiming] that a new method of predicting potential interference must be utilized in this case;\u201d the Commission nevertheless concluded that no hearing was required because appellant had failed \u201cto adequately document this different method.\u201d J.A. at 136. It is difficult to comprehend the Commission\u2019s reasoning. One of the purposes of the hearing requirement under section 316 would be to permit a party to explain and verify engineering calculations with respect to claims of alleged modifications. It is no answer for the Commission,-in the face of highly disputed factual questions, to summarily dismiss a claim that otherwise raises a legally cognizable issue under section 316 merely because the Commission remains \u201cpuzzled\u201d by the claim. <em>See </em>note 10 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">If anything, this case highlights rather well the reasons why a hearing should have been held: the contesting, parties have relied on factual assertions that are flatly contradictory; there are difficult and confusing technical issues to be resolved; there is a serious dispute over the proper methodology to be used in measuring interference; and the Commission has openly admitted to being confused with respect to appellant\u2019s claim. The confusion expressed by the Commission in this case very likely would have been cured if a hearing had been held as required under section 316 and appropriate findings had been made on the issues in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">B. <em>The Nature of the Hearing Requirement Under Section 316</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">The requirement of a \u201cpublic hearing\u201d under section 316, <em>see </em>note 5 <em>supra, </em>is the result of an amendment, made on July 16, 1952, to what was formerly section 312(b) of the Communications Act. The amended statute is recorded at Pub.L.No.554-879, 66 Stat. 711, 718 (codified as amended at 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 316 (1976)). Former section 312(b), as does the present section 316, authorized the FCC to modify a station license; however, section 312(b) provided that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-11\">No such order or modification shall become final until the holder of such outstanding license or permit shall have been notified in writing of the proposed action and the grounds or reasons therefore and <em>shall have been given reasonable opportunity to show cause </em>why such an order or modification should not issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ajs\">Communications Act of 1934, Pub.L.No.416 \u00a7 312(b), 48 Stat. 1064, 1087 (1934) (amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>ed 1952) (emphasis added). Thus, in enacting section 316, Congress made explicit the right of a license holder to show cause <em>\u201cby public hearing\u2019 </em>why an order of modification should not issue. Communications Act Amendments, 1952, H.R.Rep.No.1750, 82d Cong., 2d Sess. 14 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Over the past four decades, the courts have had occasion in a series of cases to construe the statutory \u201cshow cause\u201d requirement with respect to license modifications, first under the former section 312(b) and then under the present section 316. An examination of this case law will help to amplify the nature of the hearing requirement under section 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The first case of note concerned a claim of an \u201cindirect modification,\u201d i.e., an extension of the broadcast facilities of one station resulting in objectionable interference to another existing station within its lawfully protected contour. In <em>FCC v. National Broadcasting Company (KOA), </em>319 U.S. 239, 63 S.Ct. 1035, 87 L.Ed. 1374 (1943), the Supreme Court ruled that such an indirect modification raised a legally cognizable claim under former section 312(b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">To alter the rules so as to deprive KOA of what had been assigned to it, and to grant an application which would create interference on the channel given it, was in fact and substance to modify KOA\u2019s license. This being so, \u00a7 312(b) requires that it be made a party to the proceeding. We can accord no other meaning to the proviso which requires that the holder of the license which is to be modified . . . must be given reasonable opportunity to show cause why an order of modification should not issue.... A licensee cannot show cause unless it is offered an opportunity to participate in [a] hearing.. ..</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq3\"><em>Id. </em>at 245-46, 63 S.Ct. at 1037-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">The Court in <em>KOA </em>left undecided the issue of whether the FCC was required under former section 312(b) to afford a hearing to a party to determine whether <em>in fact </em>an indirect modification would result from a grant of increased or changed facilities to another station. This question was squarely posed and decided in <em>L.B. Wilson, Inc. v. FCC, </em>170 F.2d 793 (D.C.Cir.1948). There the court ruled that former section 312(b)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-10\">must be held to contemplate hearings before the Commission on the issue [of] modification <em>vel non </em>of an outstanding license by the granting of facilities to another station.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">170 F.2d at 803. Thus, even before the passage of the current section 316, providing for a \u201cpublic hearing,\u201d this court held in <em>L.B. Wilson </em>that an outstanding licensee must be accorded a hearing on the issue of whether or not the extension of facilities to another station will indirectly modify the outstanding license through objectionable interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-12\">The decision in <em>L.B. Wilson </em>also discussed the possibility of a summary disposition, without a hearing, of a claim of objectionable interference under former section 312(b). The petition for reconsideration in <em>L.B. Wilson </em>raised the issue of objectionable interference. In response, an argument was advanced that, whether or not there was interference, appellant\u2019s claim did not cite any \u201cobjectionable interference within the meaning of the term as prescribed by the Commission\u2019s Rules and Standards of Good Engineering Practice.\u201d 170 F.2d at 804. The Commission thus contended that it could treat appellant\u2019s claim as if upon demurrer and rule on the pleadings as a matter of law. The court in <em>L.B. Wilson </em>found \u201cthis contention not supportable,\u201d and noted that it was \u201cout of the ordinary for the Commission, in defense of its denial of hearing to the appellant, to seek refuge in such a common law \u2018formality\u2019 as a demurrer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court added that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-13\">[W]e do not rule that the Commission may not, at the threshold of consideration of an issue [of] modification <em>vel non </em>of an outstanding license by the proposed operations of another station, treat the petition asserting such modification as if upon demurrer and thereby avoid the necessity of hearing proof of the truth of the allegations of \u201cobjectionable interference\u201d if as a matter of law they do not \u201cshow\u201d such interference within the Commission\u2019s rules and standards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGP\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>On the issue presented, however, the court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-4\">included within the \u201cquestion of law\u201d raised by [appellant\u2019s petition for reconsideration] is one of fact, to wit, as to the nature of the measurements or data in the Commission\u2019s files, and one of mixed fact and law as to the bearing of this data upon the meaning of the term \u201cobjectionable interference\u201d as used in the Commission\u2019s rules and standards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-5\"><em>Id. </em>A hearing was thus found to be \u201crequisite\u201d in order to dispose of appellant\u2019s claim of interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">In <em>FCC </em>v. <em>WJR, The Goodwill Station, Inc., </em>337 U.S. 265, 69 S.Ct. 1097, 93 L.Ed. 1353 (1949), station WJR objected to the grant of a license to a new station on the ground that the new station would cause objectionable interference with the WJR broadcast signal. The applicant station challenged the legal sufficiency of WJR\u2019s petition, claiming that WJR had not set forth facts which, if accepted as true, would constitute interference with WJR\u2019s normally protected contour. The Commission agreed with the applicant station and denied the WJR petition without oral argument. In upholding the Commission\u2019s action, the Court first ruled that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment did not require that the Commission afford WJR an opportunity for oral argument on its claim of interference. More significantly, however, the Court held that Congress had \u201ccommitted to the Commission\u2019s discretion, by the terms of \u00a7 312(b) and \u00a7 4(j) of the Communications Act, the questions whether and under what circumstances it will allow or require oral argument, except where the Act itself expressly requires it.\u201d 337 U.S. at 281, 69 S.Ct. at 1106. Further, the Court ruled that the requirement in former section 312(b) of a \u201creasonable opportunity to show cause\u201d was not to be construed as always including an opportunity for oral argument. <em>Id. </em>at 282, 69 S.Ct. at 1106.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Thus, for a time, the decision in <em>WJR </em>raised serious questions about whether and under what circumstances a hearing would be required with respect to claims of interference in cases of indirect modification. In 1952, however, after Congress amended section 312(b) and enacted the present section 316, requiring an \u201copportunity ... to show cause <em>by public hearing,\u201d </em>many of the questions raised by <em>WJR </em>were put to rest.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">In 1954, following the passage of section 316 in its present form, this court, in <em>Har-benito Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, </em>218 F.2d 28 (D.C.Cir.1954), reaffirmed the decision in <em>L.B. Wilson, supra, </em>as \u201cgood law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31. The court held, in particular, that \u201cif a petition for reconsideration of a construction permit states facts which raise a substantial question as to objectionable interference with an existing license, the petitioner is entitled to a hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court added, however, that the Commission may</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-10\">as a first step, test the validity of the petition as if upon demurrer and, <em>after oral argument, </em>rule upon its sufficiency as a matter of law assuming its allegations to be correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-11\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-12\">In <em>Hecksher v. FCC, </em>253 F.2d 872 (D.C.Cir.1958), the court adhered to the holding of <em>Harbenito, </em>that the Commission may, as an initial step, subject a petitioner\u2019s \u201cclaims to a test as a matter of law upon oral argument.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 874. The court in <em>Hecksher </em>added that, \u201c[i]f it then appears that there are disputes as to material facts, an evidentiary hearing limited to those facts should be ordered.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b82-13\">Probably the most significant of the decisions concerning the nature of the hearing requirement under section 316 is <em>National Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, </em>362 F.2d 946 (D.C.Cir.1966). In <em>National Broadcasting, </em>the court recognized \u201cthe cardinal importance of the right to be heard where one\u2019s interests are acutely affected by the actions of an administrative agency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 953. In adhering to the principles enunciated in <em>KOA </em>and <em>L.B. Wilson, </em>the court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2z\">the licensee of a station with a specified frequency and power has a right to participate in an evidentiary hearing under Section 316 where another broadcaster seeks a grant to operate on the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>frequency (where the effect of the new grant <em>may be </em>to create objectionable electrical interference to the existing licensee) since this would bring about an \u201cindirect\u201d modification of the existing licensee\u2019s license.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 954-55 (emphasis added). Because the issue of indirect modification in <em>National Broadcasting </em>had been resolved in an earlier clear channel proceeding, the court found that no additional hearing was required under section 316. The court made it clear, however, that but for the prior hearing on the same issue in the clear channel proceeding, the case would have been remanded to the Commission for an eviden-tiary hearing on the petitioner\u2019s claim of indirect modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">In considering the foregoing cases, the following principles emerge regarding the procedural rights due a licensee alleging indirect modification attributable to objectionable interference. First, an existing licensee of a station with a specified frequency has a right to participate in a hearing under section 316 where another broadcaster seeks a grant to operate on the same frequency and where it is alleged that the effect of the new or changed grant may be to create objectionable, electrical interference to the existing licensee.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Second, the type of hearing required depends upon the facts of an individual case and the type of question to be resolved. If, for example, the facts are stipulated and the sole issue involves a question of law (such as, whether petitioner\u2019s claim falls within any applicable legal definition of \u201cobjectionable interference\u201d), the Commission may rule on the basis of written pleadings and oral argument. If, however, as in the instant case, there are questions of fact to be resolved, then an evidentiary hearing is mandated by section 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">Applying these principles to the facts of the case at bar, the conclusion is inescapable that appellant had a right to an evidentiary hearing on its claim of destructive interference. As noted above, appellant\u2019s petition, alleging that the grant of the KSRF application would create objectionable interference, raises a legally cognizable claim of \u201cmodification\u201d under section 316. Since we have found that appellant\u2019s claim is not barred either by the <em>Fourth Report and Order </em>(or any other proceeding related to Docket 14185), <em>see </em>notes 6 and 7 <em>supra, </em>or by any existing Commission rule, we hold that appellant was entitled to notice and an opportunity to show cause in an evidentiary hearing why the proposed order of modification should not issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-12\">Nothing in this opinion should be taken to suggest any conclusions concerning the accuracy of appellant\u2019s engineering reports or the legitimacy of its claims of destructive interference. We will leave these questions to be resolved by the Commission, in appropriate findings, after an evidentiary hearing on the disputed factual issues.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b83-13\">III. ALLEGATIONS OF \u201cDE FACTO REALLOCATION\u201d OF KSRF\u2019S LICENSE</p>\n<p id=\"b83-14\">As an alternative ground for reversal, appellant has claimed that if KSRF is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>allowed to move its transmitter site \u201cout of downtown Santa Monica and into the hills overlooking Los Angeles, KSRF will be decreasing its signal in Santa Monica and placing a 1 mV/m contour over almost all of Los Angeles for the first time.\u201d Appellant\u2019s brief at 13-14. KOCM contends that, as a result of this move, KSRF would be tempted to reduce its broadcast activities to Santa Monica and focus its activities on the more lucrative Los Angeles market. Thus, KOCM questions KSRF\u2019s true intent in moving its transmitter site.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Appellee correctly notes that appellant\u2019s \u201cargument was hinted at in the course of a brief paragraph in a cover sheet attached to Western\u2019s petition to deny, never to be addressed again either in the body of the petition to deny or in any other pleading subsequently filed by Western. And although the Commission took note in its initial order that \u2018KOCM does not claim a de facto reallocation\u2019 ([79 F.C.C.2d at 951] J.A. 113), KOCM did not address that finding in its petition for reconsideration.\u201d Ap-pellee\u2019s brief at 19-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Because we find that appellant has never properly raised a claim of \u201cde facto reallocation\u201d before the Commission, and because we can discern no other legitimate claim in appellant\u2019s alternative ground for reversal, we affirm the decision of the Commission on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">For the reasons set forth above, we affirm in part and reverse in part the Orders of the Commission here under review. After a review of the record, we find that the Commission should have granted a hearing to Appellant KOCM pursuant to section 316 of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 316 (1976) to determine whether indirect modification of KOCM\u2019s license would occur if KSRF\u2019s application were granted. Therefore, we reverse the Commission\u2019s decision granting KSRF\u2019s application and denying KOCM\u2019s petition, and remand for an evi-dentiary hearing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b74-5\">.

No such order of modification shall become final until the holder of the license or permit shall have been notified in writing of the proposed action and the grounds and reasons therefor, and shall have been given reasonable opportunity, in no event less than thirty days, to show cause by public hearing, if requested, why such order of modification should not issue: <em>Provided, </em>That where safety of life or property is involved, the Commission may by order provide for a shorter period of notice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>(b) In any case where a hearing is conducted pursuant to the provisions of this section, both the burden of proceeding with the introduction of evidence and the burden of proof shall be upon the Commission.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b75-7\">. <em>See generally Revision of FM Broadcast Rules, First Report and Order, </em>40 F.C.C. 662 (1962) ; <em>Second Report, Memorandum Opinion and Order, </em>40 F.C.C. 720 (1962); <em>Third Report, Memorandum Opinion and Order, </em>40 F.C.C. 747 (1963) ; <em>Fourth Report and Order, </em>40 F.C.C. 868 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b75-11\">. The Docket 14185 proceeding was \u201cinstituted for the purpose of determining what changes in the FM rules and technical standards [were] necessary for the optimum development of this broadcast service, and how the expansion of the service [could] be achieved with the least amount of delay and burden on the Commission, applicants, and other parties.\u201d 40 F.C.C.2d at 663. In its effort to implement a series of fixed rules governing applications for licenses or for disposal of applications and proposals, the Commission adopted a table of assignments of specific FM radio channels to specific communities, based on minimum mileage separations between stations of particular classes and frequencies. These mileage separations essentially were based on transmitter power and antenna height. <em>See First Report and Order, supra </em>note 6, 40 F.C.C. at 682-89. The current table of assignments is set out in Section 73.-202 of the Commission\u2019s Rules, 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.202 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-12\">One of the proposals rejected by the Commission in the Docket 14185 proceeding was an approach which would have permitted <em>assignments </em>based on protecting existing stations to their 1.0 mV/m contour. A field, strength contour depicts on a map the station\u2019s predicted coverage area at a given signal strength. For FM stations, the two significant contours are the 3.16 mV/m (70 dBu) contour, which the Commission requires a station to place over its city of license (47 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.315(a) (1980)), and the 1.0 mV/m (60 dBu) contour, which is a lower signal strength covering a larger area commonly referred to as the primary service area and which the Commission has described as required for service to city or business, as opposed to rural, areas. <em>See First Report and Order, supra </em>note 6, 40 F.C.C. at 682-83; 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.311 (1980). Prior to adoption of the new allocation plan in Docket 14185 in 1962, the Commission\u2019s assignment scheme had protected existing stations from interference within their 1.0 mV/m contour by newly assigned stations.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-16\">Although the Commission was unwilling to adopt any \u201cplan based only on a \u2018protected contour\u2019 concept,\u201d <em>First Report and Order, supra </em>note 6, 40 F.C.C. at 674, it nevertheless made clear that it was leaving open the question of whether a station could object on contour-interfering grounds. On this point, the Commission stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-17\">[I]t appears that only in relatively few cases would interference be caused within an existing station\u2019s 1 mv/m contour. In the Third Further Notice we tentatively discussed the rights of FM licensees to object to applications for increased facilities by short-spaced stations on the grounds that such proposals would cause interference within their 1 mv/m contours. (See FN 5, Third Further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>Notice). On reflection, we have decided not to attempt to resolve the rights of such objections at this time. They instead will be resolved if presented in a specific case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-8\"><em>Fourth Report and Order, supra </em>note 6, 40 F.C.C. at 884. <em>See also Santa Monica Broadcasting, Inc., </em>79 F.C.C.2d at 951 (\u201cthe interference issue [will] be examined on a case-by-case basis in future situations of short-spaced stations under Section 73.213\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b76-13\">.

If such objectionable interference does become apparent at some future time when the results of tests under actual conditions are known, we assume that some course of remedial action will be undertaken by the Commission, either by way of further conditioning the operations of [Intervenor] or by any alternative course of action which will eliminate the objectionable interference....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-16\">We believe that experience must be the ultimate arbiter of the interference issue.
