We hold that the SSA enjoys no such immunity from the bankruptcy laws and that the overpayment debt is dis-chargeable under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 ef <em>seq. </em>(Supp. III 1979) (the \u201cCode\u201d or \u201cBankruptcy Code\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-15\">The debtor and plaintiff in this action, Randall B. Neavear, began receiving social security disability benefits in 1968.' Beginning in January, 1976, and continuing until August, 1979, Neavear was not disabled, having engaged in substantial gainful activity as a part-time, self-employed real estate broker. Neavear failed to report this activity to the SSA as required by 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1588 (1981), and he and his family continued to receive disability benefits until they were terminated by the SSA in August of 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-16\">In August, 1979, Neavear again became disabled and was thus entitled to receive benefits under the statute. The SSA, however, commenced a proceeding to offset the earlier payments improperly received by Neavear against the future benefits to which he was now entitled. Section 204(a) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 404(a) (1976), authorizes such a recovery or recoupment of overpayments by decreasing future benefits. In a decision issued on February 26, 1980, the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) found that Neavear had been overpaid $19,818.10 in disability benefits. The ALJ further ruled that a waiver of the recoupment was not warranted because, under section 204(b), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 404(b) (1976), Neavear was not \u201cwithout fault\u201d in receiving the overpayments and because recoupment would not \u201cdefeat the purpose\u201d of the statute. The ALJ accordingly ordered that future benefits payable to Neavear be reduced in satisfaction of the overpayment debt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Neavear did not seek administrative or judicial review of this decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1218-17\">On April 8, 1980, Neavear filed his Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition, listing on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>schedule of debts the $19,818.10 overpayment debt to the SSA. Neavear was subsequently granted a discharge by the bankruptcy court but the SSA continued to reduce his disability benefits pursuant to the ALJ\u2019s recoupment order. On July 14, 1980, Neavear filed a complaint in the bankruptcy court seeking a declaration that the overpayment debt had been discharged. The Secretary answered the complaint and interposed four affirmative defenses: (1) that Neavear\u2019s action was barred because of his failure to exhaust administrative remedies; (2) that the court lacked jurisdiction because the government had not waived its defense of sovereign immunity; (3) that section 207 of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407 (1976), rendered the debt nondischargeable in bankruptcy; and (4) that the SSA\u2019s right of recoupment created a statutory lien precluding discharge of the overpayment debt.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The bankruptcy court found in favor of the SSA on the first three affirmative defenses, but did not address the question of a statutory lien. <em>Neavear v. Schweiker, </em>16 B.R. 528 (Bkrtcy, C.D.Ill. 1981). The district court affirmed without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-6\">At the outset we are faced with two issues in the nature of jurisdictional obstacles to Neavear\u2019s action against the Secretary: the applicability of the doctrines of administrative exhaustion and sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-7\">The bankruptcy court held that Neavear\u2019s complaint was barred because of his failure to seek administrative review of the Secretary\u2019s determination that he was at fault in receiving the overpayments of benefits. This ruling was erroneous. \u201cThe basic purpose of the exhaustion doctrine is to allow the administrative agency to perform functions within its special competence \u2014 to make a factual record, to apply its expertise, and to correct its own errors so as to moot judicial controversies.\u201d <em>Continental Can Co. v. Marshall, </em>603 F.2d 590, 597 (7th Cir. 1979); <em>see Parisi v. Davidson, </em>405 U.S. 34, 37, 92 S.Ct. 815, 817, 31 L.Ed.2d 17 (1972); <em>McKart v. United States, </em>395 U.S. 185, 193-95, 89 S.Ct. 1657, 1662-63, 23 L.Ed.2d 194 (1969). None of these purposes would be even remotely served by applying the exhaustion doctrine in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-12\">The bankruptcy court apparently believed that Neavear\u2019s complaint in effect sought review of the ALJ\u2019s recoupment order. To the contrary, Neavear does not contest the validity of that administrative determination but instead seeks from the bankruptcy court an order declaring that the overpayment debt has been discharged. Neavear thus requests relief that could not have been granted in the administrative proceeding, and the issue of dischargeability presented to the bankruptcy court does not invoke the \u201cspecial competence\u201d of the SSA. <em>Rowan v. Morgan, </em>15 B.R. 834, 837-38 (Bkrtcy, N.D.Ohio 1981).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We thus conclude that Neavear was not required, as a condition of obtaining relief in the bankruptcy court, to pursue lengthy and quite possibly groundless administrative appeals of the ALJ\u2019s recoupment decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-13\">There is a somewhat more challenging question whether the Secretary\u2019s invocation of the defense of sovereign immunity precludes Neavear\u2019s action. The bankruptcy court held that it did, reasoning that sovereign immunity may be waived only where the government files a proof of claim. Because the Secretary did not file a claim in the instant case, the court concluded, he was not amenable to suit at the instance of a Chapter 7 debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-14\">The bankruptcy court\u2019s decision appears to have ignored section 106(c) of the Code, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 106(c) (Supp. III 1979).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That section, unlike sections 106(a) and (b), does not condition the waiver of sovereign immunity upon the filing of a proof of claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The legislative history of section 106(c) indicates that it was enacted in order to codify the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Gwilliam v. United States, </em>519 F.2d 407 (9th Cir. 1975). 124 Cong.Rec. H11,091 (daily ed. Sept. 28, 1978); 124 Cong.Rec. S17,407 (daily ed. Oct. 6, 1978). <em>Gwilliam </em>held that, notwithstanding the failure by the government to file a proof of claim, the bankruptcy court possessed jurisdiction under section 17(c) of the former Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 35(c) (1976), to determine the dischargeability of tax debts upon application of the debtor.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See also McGugin v. District Director of IRS (In re Dolard), </em>519 F.2d 282 (9th Cir. 1975). This court followed <em>Gwilliam </em>in <em>McKenzie v. United States, </em>536 F.2d 726 (7th Cir. 1976), where we upheld the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court to determine the dischargeability of a tax debt despite the government\u2019s failure to file a proof of claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-4\">We hold that Section 17(c), in explicitly allowing the bankrupt to file an application for the determination of the dis-chargeability of \u201cany debt\u201d waives the sovereign immunity of the United States <em>in any bankruptcy action in which the United States is alleged to be a creditor of the bankrupt, </em>including instances in which federal taxes have become due and owing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1220-11\">536 F.2d at 729 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-12\">Section 106(c) thus preserves the rule, established in <em>Gwilliam </em>and approved by this court in <em>McKenzie, </em>that a debtor may seek a declaration from the bankruptcy court that a debt owed to an agency of the United States is dischargeable. Just as in <em>McKenzie, </em>we perceive no basis for distinguishing between a debt owed to the SSA and those debts owed to the Internal Revenue Service at issue in <em>Gwilliam </em>and <em>McKenzie. </em>Accordingly, we hold that section 106(c) of the Bankruptcy Code waives the sovereign immunity of the United States with respect to questions relating to the dischargeability of debts owed to the government. The bankruptcy court thus committed error when it refused, on grounds of sovereign immunity, to adjudicate the dischargeability of Neavear\u2019s overpayment debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-13\">Having concluded that the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction to adjudicate the dis-chargeability of the overpayment debt, we turn now to the question whether that debt was dischargeable in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-15\">Section 727(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727(b) (Supp. III 1979), provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>that a discharge in bankruptcy \u201cdischarges the debtor from <em>all debts </em>that arose before the date of the order for relief,\u201d (emphasis supplied), except as provided in section 523.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The issue presented in the instant case is whether section 207 of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407 (1976), confers on the SSA a blanket exemption from the operation of the Bankruptcy Code, so that an overpayment debt is nondischargeable regardless whether the debt falls within one of the exceptions to discharge listed in section 523.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-4\">Section 207 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1221-5\">The right of any person to any future payment under this subchapter shall not be transferable or assignable, at law or in equity, and none of the moneys paid or ' payable or rights existing under this sub-chapter shall be subject to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process, or to the operation of any bankruptcy or insolvency law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1221-6\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407 (1976). By its terms, section 207 is concerned with the protection of social security benefits from the reach of creditors. Since 1963, however, the SSA has interpreted this provision more expansively. Social Security Ruling SSR 63-7 (1963).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The SSA believes that the reference in section 207 to \u201crights existing under this subchapter\u201d embraces not only the rights of social security recipients but also the rights of the agency itself \u2014 including the SSA\u2019s right to recoup overpayments under section 204, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 404 (1976). The SSA asserts, therefore, that Congress in section 207 conferred upon it a total exemption from the operation of all bankruptcy laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-20\">In support of the SSA\u2019s interpretation of section 207, the Secretary relies solely on the language of the statute.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He offers no reasons of policy to explain why Congress supposedly gave the SSA rights enjoyed by no other creditor,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and he does not point to any legislative history supporting his sweeping interpretation. Above all, however, the Secretary\u2019s argument must fail because it asks us, in construing the reference to \u201crights\u201d in section 207, to disregard the surrounding text. Section 207 speaks throughout in terms of the rights of social security <em>recipients </em>(the rights to \u201cfuture payment,\u201d and to \u201cmoneys paid or payable\u201d) and the protection of their <em>benefits </em>from the reach of creditors (through \u201cexecution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process\u201d). The exemption from \u201cthe operation of any bankruptcy or insolvency law\u201d (which should be construed as parallel to the preceding forms of legal process) simply closes off what would otherwise be an additional avenue for creditors to satisfy their claims from the social secur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>ity benefits of the debtor.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, section 207 deals only with the protection of social security benefits from creditor action. The Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the section turns the statute on its head, since this interpretation would transform a provision designed to protect social security recipients from creditors into a provision conferring super-creditor status on the SSA.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We thus conclude that section 207 provides an exemption from the bankruptcy laws only for the benefits of social security recipients, and does not operate to prevent a debtor from obtaining a discharge of a debt owed to the SSA because of an overpayment.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1222-4\">Our conclusion that section 207 poses no obstacle to a debtor seeking a discharge of an overpayment debt does not, of course, mean that every social security recipient who receives, not without fault, an overpayment of benefits may escape his duty to repay those benefits by means of a quick discharge in bankruptcy. To the contrary, section 523 of the Code provides that debts arising from transactions involving \u201cfalse pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud,\u201d are not dischargeable. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) (Supp. III 1979). While we do not necessarily accept what appears to have been the Secretary\u2019s argument in the bankruptcy court \u2014 that the ALJ\u2019s determination that Neavear was at fault in obtaining the overpayments constitutes a finding of a \u201cfalse representation\u201d precluding discharge \u2014 we do agree that at least in some cases an overpayment debt may fall within this category of exceptions to discharge. Whether Neavear\u2019s debt to the SSA is such a nondischargeable debt under section 523 is a question we leave for the bankruptcy court to decide on remand of this case.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1222-9\">Finally, we pause to note that two recent cases, one now awaiting review in this court, have concluded as we do today that overpayment debts owing to the SSA are dischargeable in bankruptcy. <em>Rowan v. Morgan, </em>15 B.R. 834 (Bkrtcy, N.D.Ohio 1981); <em>Gutierrez </em>v. <em>Schweiker, </em>15 B.R. 268 (N.D.Ill.1981), <em>appeal docketed, </em>No. 81-2243 (7th Cir. 1981). The reasoning employed in these cases, however, is different from ours. Both cases held that the SSA had failed to make timely objections under section 523(c) to the discharge of the overpayment debts. Both courts either accepted or ignored the argument that section 207 of the Social Security Act itself exempts overpayment debts from discharge under the Bankruptcy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>Code, and found instead that the Code repealed section 207 by implication.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We take a more direct path, however, and hold that section 207 does not by itself render overpayment debts nondischargeable. We thus have no occasion to reach the question of an implied repeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-6\">For the reasons stated herein, we hold that the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction to adjudicate the dischargeability of an overpayment debt owed to the SSA and that section 207 of the Social Security Act does not prevent the discharge of such a debt. We therefore reverse the judgments of the courts below and remand the case for a consideration of the two issues not yet addressed by the bankruptcy court: whether Neavear\u2019s overpayment debt is nondis-chargeable under section 523 of the Code and whether the overpayment debt creates a statutory lien precluding discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1218-11\">. By June 30, 1980, the overpayment debt had been reduced to $11,407.20 as a result of the recoupment order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1218-12\">. Neavear could have appealed the ALJ\u2019s decision, first to an ALJ appointed by the Associate Commissioner for Hearings and Appeals, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.929 (1981), then to the Appeals Council within the SSA, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.967 (1981), and finally to the district court, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1219-8\">. The SSA also asserted a defense based on an alleged absence of a justiciable case or controversy. That argument appears to have been abandoned.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1219-15\">. <em>Cf. Finnerty v. Cowen, </em>508 F.2d 979 (2d Cir. 1974) (plaintiff not required to exhaust administrative remedies where he sought judicial resolution of a constitutional question that could not be adjudicated by the federal agency).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1220-5\">. Section 106(c), 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 106(c) (Supp. Ill 1979), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-6\">(c) Except as provided in subsections (a) and (b) of this section and notwithstanding any assertion of sovereign immunity\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-7\">(1) a provision of this title that contains \u201ccreditor\u201d, \u201centity\u201d, or \u201cgovernmental unit\u201d applied to governmental units; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-8\">(2) a determination by the court of an issue arising under such a provision binds governmental units.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1220-9\">. That a waiver of sovereign immunity may be found even though the government has not filed a proof of claim is illustrated by <em>Remke, Inc. v. United States, </em>5 B.R. 299 (Bkrtcy, E.D.Mich.1980), in which a bankruptcy court held that a Chapter 11 debtor could recover a preferential transfer from the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to section 547 of the Code. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547 (Supp. III 1979). In reaching this conclusion, the court stated, \u201cthe government\u2019s contention that a governmental unit\u2019s defense of sovereign immunity is waived only in cases in which the government has filed a proof of claim, is without merit.\u201d 5 B.R. at 302 (footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1220-17\">. Section 17(c), 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 35(c) (1976), authorized the bankrupt to file an application with the bankruptcy court for \u201cthe determination of the dischargeability of <em>any debt.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied). This provision was not carried forward into the new Bankruptcy Code, but this fact does not detract from the continued applicability of <em>Gwilliam </em>and related cases. The legislative history of the Code indicates that section 17(c) was \u201cdeleted as unnecessary, in view of the comprehensive grant of jurisdiction prescribed in proposed 28 U.S.C. 1471(b), which is adequate to cover the full jurisdiction that the bankruptcy courts have today over dischargeability and related issues under Bankruptcy Act \u00a7 17c.\u201d H.Rep.No.95-595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 363 (1977), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1978, pp. 5787, 6319.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1221-7\">.

In his brief on appeal, the Secretary did not argue that we should defer to his interpretation of his own governing statute. But even giving full weight to any presumption of correctness to be accorded the Secretary\u2019s interpretation, we think that the Secretary has attempted to reject the plain meaning of section 207. The other reasons set forth in this opinion also more than overbear any presumption upon which the Secretary may want to rely.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1221-21\">. In its interpretive ruling, the SSA relied on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Munsey Trust Co., </em>332 U.S. 234, 239, 67 S.Ct. 1599, 1601, 91 L.Ed. 2022 (1947), as authority for the conclusion that the agency\u2019s right to recoup overpayments is one of the \u201crights\u201d protected by section 207. <em>Munsey Trust </em>was a government contract case, however, and not a case arising under the Social Security Act. The decision thus sheds no light on the question whether Congress intended section 207 to exempt the SSA in its role as a creditor from the operation of the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1221-22\">. Not even the Internal Revenue Service has been accorded the favorable treatment in bankruptcy that the SSA now contends it was granted. Under the Bankruptcy Code, tax claims generally receive a sixth priority, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 507(a)(6) (Supp. III 1979), and are nondischargeable only if they fall within the limited exceptions of section 523, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523 (Supp. III 1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1222-5\">. Under the Bankruptcy Code, social security benefits are included in the property of the estate. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(c) (Supp. III 1979). Such benefits can be exempted, however, either under section 522(d)(10)(A), or, if the debtor so elects, under section 522(b)(2)(A), which grants an exemption for \u201cany property that is exempt under Federal law, other than\u201d section 522(d). Section 207 is one of the \u201cFederal law\u201d exemptions. See <em>In re Smith, </em>640 F.2d 888, 890 (7th Cir. 1981); <em>Cheeseman v. Nachman, </em>656 F.2d 60, 62 n.5 (4th Cir. 1981). Thus, section 207 operates to exempt social security benefits from the property of the estate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1222-6\">. Although the Secretary in his petition for rehearing contends that his reading of the statute is supported by the language of section 207, we believe that our interpretation of the section is firmly based on its plain meaning. Neither party in this case was able to locate any legislative history relevant to the present issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1222-7\">. Section 207 is similar to other statutes that remove government benefits from the reach of creditors. <em>See, e.g., </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8130 (1976); 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 775 (1976); 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 770(g) (1976); 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101 (1976); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1717 (1976). Other statutes that expressly conferred on government agencies in their role as creditors an exemption from discharges in bankruptcy, however, were repealed when the Bankruptcy Code was enacted. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1087-3 (1976), <em>repealed by </em>Pub.L.No. 95-598, Title III, \u00a7 317, 92 Stat. 2678 (1978); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 294f(g) (1976), <em>repealed by </em>Pub.L.No. 95-598, Title III, \u00a7 327, 92 Stat. 2679 (1978); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 656(b) (1976), <em>repealed by </em>Pub.L.No. 95-598, Title III, \u00a7 328, 92 Stat. 2679 (1978). Although not conclusive, the fact that Congress did not repeal section 207 when these other statutes granting exceptions to discharge were repealed is some evidence that Congress never regarded section 207 as rendering social security overpayment debts nondischargeable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1222-11\">. The Secretary apparently raised the argument that the overpayment debt was nondischargeable under section 523(a)(2) for the first time in his memorandum in opposition to Neavear's motion to strike the affirmative defenses. In light of this fact, we suggest that the bankruptcy court on remand consider the timeliness of the Secretary\u2019s objection to discharge. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(c) (Supp. III 1979). <em>See Rowan v. Morgan, </em>15 B.R. 834, 839 (Bkrtcy, N.D.Ohio 1981); <em>Gutierrez v. Schweiker, </em>15 B.R. 268 (D.C.N.D.III.1981), <em>appeal docketed, </em>No. 81-2243 (7th Cir. 1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1223-16\">. <em>Rowan </em>and <em>Gutierrez </em>relied on <em>In re Buren, </em>6 B.R. 744 (D.C.M.D.Tenn.1980), <em>appeal docketed, </em>No. 80-5427 (6th Cir. 1981), for their conclusion that the Bankruptcy Code impliedly repealed section 207. <em>Buren </em>does hold that the Code effected an implied repeal of section 207, but in circumstances quite different than those in the instant case. At issue in <em>Bur\u00e9n </em>was the power of the bankruptcy court under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325(b) (Supp. III 1979) to order the SSA to deduct benefits owing to the debtor and to pay these benefits directly to the Chapter 13 trustee. Thus, the challenged income deduction order implicated the central purpose of section 207: the protection of debtors from the transfer or assignment of social security benefits to creditors. The <em>Bur\u00e9n </em>court held that, given Congress\u2019 expressed desire to broaden the availability of Chapter 13 relief to include individuals whose only regular income consisted of social security benefits, Congress could not have intended section 207 to prevent Chapter 13 debtors from voluntarily subjecting their benefits to income deduction orders. The court held that section 207 was accordingly repealed by implication, but only insofar as it involved income deduction orders under section 1325(b). The <em>Bur\u00e9n </em>case thus has little relevance to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>question whether the discharge provisions of the Code also work an implied repeal of section 207.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
