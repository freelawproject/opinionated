Acting upon a recommendation of the magistrate, the district court dismissed the action for the reason that the Florida parole statutes create no constitutionally protected liberty interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applies when government action deprives a person of liberty or property. <em>Greenholtz v. Nebraska Penal Inmates, </em>442 U.S. 1, 7, 99 S.Ct. 2100, 2103, 60 L.Ed.2d 668 (1979). While there is no inherent or constitutional right to conditional release before the expiration of a valid sentence, a state may create a protectible liberty interest in the establishment of a parole system. <em>Id. </em>at 12, 99 S.Ct. at 2106. The former Fifth Circuit has held, however, that no liberty interest in parole was created by the Florida statutes. <em>Staton v. Wainwright, </em>665 F.2d 686 (5th Cir. 1982). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">Accordingly, we hold that the petition was properly dismissed as there was no deprivation of a federally protected right.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
