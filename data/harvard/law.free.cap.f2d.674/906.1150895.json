This action is cognizable in federal court, appellants contend, because the mortgage for Garfield Hill had been insured since 1948 by the federal government pursuant to the National Housing Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and was therefore subject to HUD regulatory obligations. In December 1978, however, three months before this lawsuit was initiated, Garfield Hill\u2019s owner prepaid the full mortgage terminating the insurance and the government\u2019s erstwhile security or regulatory interest in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-19\">The district court dismissed the action with prejudice on 2 August 1979. The court found that as to the government defendant, HUD, the lawsuit was moot because the mortgage prepayment had elimi- . nated any federal interest or duty. Thereupon, with respect to the private parties, the court found that it was without subject-matter jurisdiction and dismissed those claims as well. Motions for summary disposition made to this court by both sides were denied on 25 January 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-20\">We now affirm the district court, but rely on different grounds. We hold that the proper ground for dismissal was the appellants\u2019 failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-21\">I. FEDERAL INSURANCE FOR THE GARFIELD HILL MORTGAGE</p>\n<p id=\"b927-22\">Section 608 of the National Housing Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was enacted to address the housing needs of war veterans.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To stimulate the construc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>tion of apartment complexes favoring veterans, Congress authorized the federal government to insure mortgages on property meeting certain relevant conditions. One condition for insurance eligibility under section 608 was the application of federal \u201cregulations and procedures\u201d to occupancy priorities and rents, etc., of the mortgaged property.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">Acting through the Secretary for Insurance, the government on 23 August 1948 endorsed a note executed by appellee Garfield Development Corporation, the owner-mortgagor. This endorsement provided mortgage insurance to the original lender, Riggs National Bank of Washington (and later, appellant Institutional Securities Corporation), guaranteeing payment in case of mortgagor\u2019s default. FHA regulations in effect on the date of FHA\u2019s endorsement, 23 August 1948, formed the contract of mortgage insurance between the FHA and the lender.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The regulations empower the Secretary of HUD (originally the Federal Housing Commissioner) to impose regulations on the mortgagor and, in particular, provide that the Secretary may acquire an interest in the mortgagor corporation by purchasing its preferred stock.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The government paid the Garfield Development Corporation 100 dollars for 100 shares of its preferred stock. Thus HUD was in position to exercise its discretion to regulate Garfield Hill within its authority under section 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">For the most part mortgage payments proceeded fairly smoothly, so no demand for insurance benefits was ever made to HUD (or to the FHA, its predecessor agency). Consequently, neither the government nor the lender, for that matter, ever attempted to control the project, or acquire anything beyond a security interest in Garfield Hill.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-14\">Those security interests had themselves terminated in December 1978, several months before the complaint in this action was filed on 16 March 1979. In 1978 the mortgagor, Garfield Development Corporation, exercised its \u201cprepayment privilege,\u201d making full payment to the lender of the remaining balance under the mortgage. Three days later, Garfield Development Corporation paid 100 dollars to HUD, thereby redeeming in full the preferred stock issued to that government agency. Paying off the mortgage naturally satisfied the lender and extinguished its security interest in the property. Similarly, prepayment terminated the government\u2019s contract for mortgage insurance.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In a sense, then, the jurisdictional predicate of governmental involvement may have evaporated before the case began.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b928-15\">The applicable regulations state plainly that \u201c[u]pon the termination of all obligations of the [Secretary] ... all regulations and restriction of the mortgagor shall cease.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> By redeeming HUD\u2019s preferred stock and making full payment of the mortgage, the government\u2019s obligations and restrictions over the mortgaged property were terminated.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Moreover, <em>prepayment </em>is itself contemplated within the federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>regulations.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Hence, the mortgagor may by paying off the loan cancel at anytime the contract for mortgage insurance, and thereby extinguish outside security interests, including HUD\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"a-v-dedup-0\">A. <em>The Parties</em></p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">Real estate transactions usually involve a number of parties, each with distinct interests and obligations. If litigation ensues, it is rarely a two party case, but here the complaint named defendants whose links with the mortgaged property were remarkably attenuated. For instance, appellee Hessick Investment Corporation was sued in its \u201ccapacity\u201d as a <em>prospective purchaser </em>of Garfield Hill. The deal, however, had never gone through, as both parties to the proposed sale agreed to forget it in October of 1978. The <em>former owner </em>of Garfield Development Corporation\u2019s <em>common stock, </em>Karl W. Corby &amp; Company, Inc., was also sued. Corby removed itself from contact with Garfield Hill in December 1977 when it sold its stock to the various individuals, associations, and corporations who are the current stockholders of the Garfield Development Corporation. (The property itself has been owned by the Corporation at all times since 1948.) These parties, along with the Corporation, are all sued together as the landlord of Garfield Hill. And then, there is the crucial defendant, the Secretary of HUD. By insuring the Garfield Hill mortgage from 1948 through 1978, and by promulgating regulations pursuant to the National Housing Act, it is HUD as mortgage insurer which allegedly provides the federal jurisdictional link and the springboard for jurisdiction over the other private parties. The mortgagee, Institutional Securities Corporation, was the beneficiary of that mortgage insurance, and consequently was also sued by appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-11\">We find that appellants\u2019 claims against the prospective purchaser, the former owner of the Corporation\u2019s stock, and the mortgagee are totally unwarranted, the product of legal inventiveness run riot. No cause of action has been stated, or could be at this time. Only the action against the landlord-owner of Garfield Hill and the Secretary of HUD is colorable at all. We turn now to consider the legal basis for the lawsuit against these two parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-12\">B. <em>The District Court Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b929-13\">In a short order entered on 2 August 1979 the district court dismissed the complaint, finding that allegations based on HUD regulatory authority were moot, and that the court was consequently without subject-matter jurisdiction over the nonfederal parties. Though we agree that the complaint cannot stand, we find that the district court was not without subject-matter jurisdiction to consider claims against the federal and private parties under the National Housing Act.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Interpretation of that Act is necessary to determine whether those claims are valid. The district court did not address the question of whether the plaintiffs had a private cause of action under the National Housing Act \u2014 if they did have one, then the possibility of a private <em>damages </em>remedy which would survive any termination of an insured or regulatory interest neatly disposes of the mootness argument. Thus we are compelled to decide the extent of judicial review over HUD\u2019s actions, and whether a private cause of action exists.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b930-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>C. <em>Judicial Review of HUD\u2019s Functions Under Section 608</em></p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">There is no provision for judicial review in the National Housing Act itself. We turn first, therefore, to the Administrative Procedure Act in search of a legal standard applicable to HUD\u2019s conduct here.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">Though HUD\u2019s conduct as mortgage insurer for veterans\u2019 housing is arguably committed exclusively to the agency\u2019s discretion and thereby exempted from judicial review,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> we would reluctantly forgo review on this basis. Consideration is unnecessary, for in this case we run into a specific statutory obstacle to judicial review. The substance of appellant\u2019s complaint against HUD is that the agency failed to enforce its own regulations and exercise its power as a preferred shareholder in the Garfield Development Corporation for the protection of the project\u2019s tenants. Section 1743 of title 12 of the United States Code codified section 608 of the National Housing Act authorizing HUD to acquire such preferred stock.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Likewise, the Secretary\u2019s authority to promulgate regulations for federally insured veterans\u2019 housing derives from that same statutory section. In the Administrative Procedure Act we find that judicial review of \u201cfunctions conferred by section[ ] . . . 1743 ... of title 12\u201d is explicitly excluded.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> As the relevant regulations and any rights growing out of the preferred shareholder interest are all pursuant to section 1743, Congress has removed these functions from our review under the Administrative Procedure Act.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b930-13\">In effect, then, our only source of, and standard for, review must spring from the substantive statute itself \u2014 the duties of the obligors and the rights of the beneficiaries as contemplated by the National Housing Act.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We proceed now to examine the question of a private right of action under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-14\">D. <em>Private Remedy Under the National Housing Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b930-15\">The Act does not provide an express private cause of action \u2014 the statute\u2019s various intended beneficiaries are thus without an explicit remedy either against HUD or against any of the other private parties also involved in the statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-16\">Conceivably, however, it might be appropriate for this court to infer the existence of a private cause of action according to the principles of <em>Cort v. Ash.</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We find that the statute does not support a judicial inference that tenants in federally insured veterans\u2019 housing have a right to sue the government or these private parties in a federal court to force compliance with HUD <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>regulations.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We join the First Circuit in holding that mortgage insurance provided under the National Housing Act is an insufficient predicate for implication of a private cause of action.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\"><em>Cort v. </em>Ash<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> outlines four factors indicative of an implied cause of action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-6\">First, is the plaintiff \u201cone of the class for whose <em>especia] </em>benefit the statute was enacted,\u201d ... \u2014that is, does the statute create a federal right in favor of the plaintiff? Second, is there any indication of legislative intent, explicit or implicit, either to create such a remedy or to deny one? ... Third, is it consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme to imply such a remedy for the plaintiff? .. . And finally, is the cause of action one traditionally relegated to state law, in an area basically the concern of the States, so that it would be inappropriate to infer a cause of action based solely on federal law?<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGe\">The provision of the National Housing Act at issue<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> \u201cneither creates federal rights in favor of any private party nor proscribes the behavior herein complained of.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Rather, what is clear is that the statute embodied Congress\u2019 hope that the possibility of federal mortgage insurance would encourage lenders to lend, builders to build, and developers to develop new housing that would culminate in a benefit for the war veterans. This was fairly complex legislation that created and relied on financial incentives to accomplish a welfare objective. Congress thereby induced private entrepreneurs to enter the housing market through investments in projects ultimately redounding to the advantage of prospective tenants who were also veterans. In fact, the codification of the mortgage insurance provisions for \u201csection 608 housing\u201d is in the \u201cBanks and Banking\u201d title of the United States Code, and not in the \u201cPublic Health and Welfare\u201d title where other sections of the National Housing Act are codified.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Plainly, though, veterans and tenants are the vicarious beneficiaries of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-11\">They are not, however, the Act\u2019s only beneficiaries \u2014 obviously, the benefit of mortgage insurance operates directly in favor of the bankers, builders, and developers. To be sure, HUD has limited authority to regulate the housing projects whose mortgages it insures; this permits HUD to ensure that the projects will continue to be financially viable, and will not, therefore, require the government to pay out on its default obligations. Section 608 thus does not so \u201cespecially\u201d benefit tenants that it can be said, under the first <em>Cort v. Ash </em>criterion, that the statute creates an enforceable duty running to tenants, which can be claimed by them as a matter of right.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b931-12\">The second <em>Cort v. Ash </em>factor refers us to the presence or absence of a legislative intent to create a private remedy. We see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>here no indication that Congress intended a private right of action to emanate from the provision of mortgage insurance pursuant to the National Housing Act. Neither the statutory history nor the terms of the statute itself contradict this conclusion.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Without some palpable indication of legislative intent we would be most ill-advised to discover an implied private cause of action.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">Consistency with the overall legislative scheme is the third <em>Cort </em>v. Ash factor. Since a primary objective of the statute was to stimulate <em>the construction </em>of housing,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> an implied cause of action giving tenants the right to sue HUD and private parties in the real estate market might <em>impede, </em>rather than promote, the construction of housing units.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">Whether the cause of action in question is traditionally relegated to state law is the fourth <em>Cort v. Ash </em>factor. Here too we must hold for the appellees. Without reflecting at all on the merits of appellants\u2019 claims, we are compelled to recognize that the stated claims are typical of the landlord-tenant relationship, local in character and generally reserved for resolution by the states.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Complaints of excessive rent, improper maintenance, and unlawful evictions are cognizable in the state courts, but have no basis for remedy under federal law, or at least not under section 608 of the National Housing Act which simply authorizes HUD to insure mortgages. The federal involvement here is minimal; it is insufficient for the purpose of authorizing private parties to require HUD to compel landlords, or of compelling the landlords directly, to utilize their property in particular ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">HUD is granted authority in connection with the mortgage insurance provisions so that it may implement <em>national </em>housing policy, not administer in detail a particular privately owned housing project. That policy requires the financial viability of projects like Garfield Hill, and it is not clear at all that an implied private, <em>federal </em>cause of action by tenants against anyone would serve that policy. We therefore hold, on <em>Cort v. Ash </em>principles, that tenants in section 608 housing projects have no right of action to' proceed against their landlord, against HUD, or against other private parties based simply on the mortgage insurance provisions of the National Housing Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">We do not here decide the merits of appellants\u2019 claims that they are the victims of unlawful evictions, illegal rents, and deficient maintenance, etc. These are charges which the local jurisdiction, the District of Columbia, may resolve according to its own laws. We hold simply that the National Housing Act does not harbor an implied right of action allowing tenants in housing developments whose mortgages have been insured by the federal government to sue the government or private parties for alleged breaches of landlord-tenant obligations. We thus affirm the dismissal of this action on the ground that appellants have failed to state a claim on which relief can be granted. We also find that we are without jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act to review HUD\u2019s conduct with respect to regulations it has issued pursuant to 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1743.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b927-17\">. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701 <em>et seq. </em>(1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b927-25\">. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1743 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b927-23\">.
