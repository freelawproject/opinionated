Several of the findings of \u00a7 8(a)(1) violations are adequately supported by the record. The record reveals, for example, that Paterson, a supervisor, spoke to West, an employee and the brother-in-law of Santillo, another employee who was a union activist. In the conversation Paterson referred to Santillo\u2019s union activity, suggested that he (Paterson) was taking it \u201cpersonal,\u201d noted that he had previously given Santillo favors (such as letting him park his car in Paterson\u2019s yard and giving him time off in the summer to work on another job), and threatened that in the future, \u201cI\u2019ll remember it.\u201d Paterson also told a different employee, Baer, that he would \u201cget even\u201d with Santillo. While Paterson\u2019s motives were the subject of conflicting testimony, there is ample ground for a fact finder to conclude that Paterson\u2019s threats were union-oriented, gave an impression of surveillance, <em>see NLRB v. Rich\u2019s of Plymouth, Inc., </em>578 F.2d 880 (1st Cir. 1978), and constituted unlawful coercion. <em>NLRB v. A. Lasaponara &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>541 F.2d 992, 996-97 (2d Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 U.S. 914, 97 S.Ct. 1325, 51 L.Ed.2d 592 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">The Board also found the Company\u2019s discharge of Santillo unlawful under both \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(3) of the Act. In making this finding, however, the Board did not conclude that \u201cupon the preponderance of the testimony taken,\u201d it was \u201cof the opinion\u201d that the Company had engaged in an unfair labor practice. National Labor Relations Act \u00a7 10(c), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(c). Rather, it based its finding of a violation upon a conclusion that the Company \u201cfailed to meet its burden of <em>overcoming </em>the General Counsel\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>case by establishing by competent evidence that Santillo would have been discharged even absent his union activities.\u201d (Emphasis added.) While this court has upheld the Board\u2019s practice of imposing upon the Company the burden of <em>neutralizing </em>the implication of sufficient anti-union motive arising from the General Counsel\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>case, <em>Statler Industries, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>644 F.2d 902 (1st Cir. 1981); <em>NLRB v. Amber Delivery Service, Inc., </em>651 F.2d 57 (1st Cir. 1981); <em>NLRB v. Cable Vision, </em>660 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1981), it has rejected both explicitly, <em>NLRB v. Wright Line, </em>662 F.2d 899 (1st Cir. 1981), and implicitly, <em>NLRB v. Amber Delivery Service, Inc., </em>651 F.2d at 69; <em>NLRB v. Cable Vision, </em>660 F.2d at 8; <em>NLRB v. Eastern Smelting &amp; Refining Corp., </em>598 F.2d 666, 671 n.12 (1st Cir. 1979),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> any effort by the Board to impose a <em>greater </em>burden than this upon the Company, as outside the Board\u2019s statutory authority. We therefore remand this case to the Board for reconsideration under the standard of <em>NLRB v. Wright Line, supra. SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>318 U.S. 80, 63 S.Ct. 454, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943). Since the Board\u2019s order is based in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>large part upon Santillo\u2019s discharge, we do not believe that partial enforcement at this time is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b159-8\">.

Wright Line, </em>662 F.2d 899 (1st Cir. 1981), and has asked for reconsideration. While I join the court\u2019s opinion here, I also concur separately to state my reasons for rejecting the Board\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">First, I think the Board may overestimate the extent of the difference between its formulation and our own. Both Board and court agree that in a \u201cdual motive\u201d discharge case \u201cthe initial inquiry is whether the Board has made a <em>prima facie </em>showing that a \u2018significant improper motivation\u2019 underlay the Company\u2019s action.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Cable Vision, </em>660 F.2d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1981); <em>NLRB v. Amber Delivery Service, </em>651 F.2d 57, 69 (1st Cir. 1981); <em>Statler Industries, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>644 F.2d 902, 905 (1st Cir. 1981); <em>NLRB v. Eastern Smelting &amp; Refining Corp., </em>598 F.2d 666, 671 (1st Cir. 1979). In making this <em>prima facie </em>case, the Board must establish the \u201crequisite knowledge by the Company of union activity.\u201d The \u201cbad reason may [then] be shown by independent evidence or by the circumstances of the discharge itself.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Eastern Smelting &amp; Refining Corp., </em>598 F.2d at 670. Both Board and court also agree that thereafter \u201cthe burden . .. shifts to the Company to \u2018prove that it had a good reason, sufficient in itself, to produce\u2019 the [discharge] . .. <em>Statler Industries, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>644 F.2d at 905, <em>quoting NLRB </em>v. <em>Eastern Smelting &amp; Refining Corp., </em>598 F.2d at 671.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Cable Vision, </em>660 F.2d at 8. But, the Board and court apparently do not agree about who should win if, after both sides have submitted their evidence, the evidence is in \u201cequipoise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">We made clear both in <em>Cable </em>Vision and in <em>Amber Delivery </em>that in such a situation the employer must prevail, for we wrote, \u201cThis shift [of the burden of proof to the Company] does not impose an overall burden upon the Company of proving itself \u2018innocent\u2019 of violating the statute. Rather, it must simply come forward with enough evidence to convince the trier of fact that, under the circumstances, there is no longer a preponderance of evidence establishing a violation.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Cable Vision, </em>660 F.2d at 8. This language generalized the court\u2019s statement in <em>Eastern Smelting </em>that when the employer presents evidence of a good and sufficient motive for the discharge, the Board \u201cmay not reject the employer\u2019s proof, absent a reasonable basis.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Eastern Smelting &amp; Refining Corp., </em>598 F.2d at 671 n.12. In turn, <em>Cable Vision </em>and <em>Amber Delivery </em>elaborated this point, and finally the point was analyzed still more carefully in <em>Wright Line. </em>Yet there is nothing in <em>Wright Line </em>that reflected any departure from prior court decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">While the <em>Wright Line </em>formulation does, of course, mean that the employer wins in a case where the record cannot be fairly said to make out a violation by a preponderance of the evidence, this is surely what one would expect. <em>See Edison Co. v. Labor Board, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 216, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938). The burden of proof formulation does not itself add to, or detract from, the requirement of substantial evidence. <em>Cf. Miranda v. HEW, </em>514 F.2d 996, 998 (1st Cir. 1975). Thus, I do not see the court\u2019s <em>Wright Line </em>formulation as being of great practical significance. <em>Wright Line, </em>for example, does not tell the Board what it can, or cannot, conclude from silences in the record; that is a matter governed by the facts of a particular case, experience, and common sense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rather, <em>Wright Line </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>simply tells the Board that after the evidence is in, it must itself make a judgment about whether the evidence <em>overall </em>does or does not support a finding of violation; it cannot avoid this issue by retreating to the language of \u201cburdens of proof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Second, as the court pointed out in <em>Wright Line, </em>the relevant statutes compel the result we reached. Section 10(c) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(c), provides that the Board must dismiss a complaint when \u201cupon the preponderance of the testimony taken\u201d the Board \u201cshall not be of the opinion\u201d that an unfair labor practice was committed. Section 7(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 556, states that \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by statute, the proponent of [an] order has the burden of proof.\u201d And, the Board\u2019s rules themselves state that the Board\u2019s attorney has the burden of proof of violations of section 8.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.-10(b). How, in the face of this language, is it possible not to hold that the overall burden of proving a violation remains with the Board?</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">The Eighth Circuit has recently written that there is a \u201creasonable basis in law\u201d for the Board\u2019s <em>Wright Line </em>burden shifting, apparently disagreeing as well with the narrow \u201coverall burden\u201d question at issue here. <em>NLRB v. Fixtures Mfg. Corp., </em>669 F.2d 547 at 550-551 n.4 (8th Cir. 1982)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Eighth Circuit rests its opinion, however, upon its belief that the \u201coverall burden\u201d question is one as to which a court should defer to agency views. I doubt that this is so: Whether the Board can impose such an overall burden on the employer is a pure question of law. It involves a major and important section of the authorizing statute; it is not \u201cinterstitial;\u201d and the language of the statute as well as its legislative history seem clear. <em>Packard Motor Car Co. v. NLRB, </em>330 U.S. 485, 491-93, 67 S.Ct. 789, 793-94, 91 L.Ed. 1040 (1947); <em>Constance v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>672 F.2d 990, 995 (1st Cir. 1982). The fact that the agency might find such burden shifting administratively useful would be significant had Congress intended to delegate such authority to the agency, but that is not the case here. <em>Social Security Board v. Nierot-ko, </em>327 U.S. 358, 368-69, 66 S.Ct. 637, 642-43, 90 L.Ed. 718 (1946). Here the issue is one of statutory language and congressional intent. These indicate quite clearly that the Board, not the employer, must bear the overall burden of showing a violation of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-13\">Finally, it is worth recalling that one major purpose underlying court review of administrative agency decisions is that of keeping agency action within statutory bounds laid down by Congress \u2014 including those statutory qualifications that limit the agency\u2019s more important basic mission. Stewart, <em>The Reformation of American Administrative Law, </em>88 Harv.L.Rev. 1667 (1975). To do so, Congress has entrusted courts with primary responsibility for determining questions of law related to the agency\u2019s mission. Administrative Procedure Act \u00a7 10(e), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706. And, to prevent the agencies from extending that mission or escaping statutory limitations through one-sided fact-finding, Congress has required the courts to make certain that factual findings are supported by \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d on the basis of the \u201cwhole record.\u201d <em>Id. See Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 487-92, 71 S.Ct. 456, 463-67, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). This historic division of tasks between court and agency, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>and the major purpose underlying it, suggests why it is desirable to require the Board to certify that, after hearing both sides, it still believes the evidence in the record by a preponderance shows a violation of the statute: Doing so forces the agency to focus directly on what Congress told it to do; it prevents the agency from retreating behind the opaque language of \u201cburden of proof;\u201d and it simplifies the work of a reviewing court, which would otherwise be uncertain as to when it could, and when it could not, properly overturn an agency decision. (Compare the difficulty of deciding whether there is substantial evidence on the record as a whole that the employer has not <em>proved </em>that the bad motive did <em>not </em>move him.)</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">In sum, this court\u2019s <em>Wright Line </em>opinion imposes little practical burden on the Board; it is required by statute; and it is, in terms of general agency/court relations, simplifying. I therefore think this court is correct in deciding not to modify it.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b160-8\">. <em>E.g., </em>if I see water pouring down outside the window, I can reasonably infer that it is raining, although my inference in part depends upon the absence of evidence that there are small boys with a garden hose standing on the roof. Add to the record, however, the facts that there are such small boys and the sun is shining, and my inference of rain becomes unreasonable. If I try to support it by pointing to an <em>absence </em>of evidence in the record that the hose was turned on, I am still acting unreasonably. Because of the <em>facts </em>involved, a conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>sion based in part upon the record\u2019s silence is reasonable in the first instance but not in the second. Most silences in an administrative record are of this factual sort; burden of proof rules only occasionally affect the conclusions that might be drawn from them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b161-11\">. There are decisions in other circuits either <em>accepting</em>\u2014NLRB <em>v. Robin American Corp., </em>654 F.2d 1022 (5th Cir. 1981); <em>NLRB v.
