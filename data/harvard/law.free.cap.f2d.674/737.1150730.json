The plaintiffs claim that the defendants\u2019 denial of an application for a liquor license resulted in violation of their rights to due process and equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. We hold that no substantial federal question is presented and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Plaintiff Phillips is the owner of an off-sale liquor store known as Bridge Liquors located at 204 West Broadway in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In 1974 plaintiff Herbert Kapaun leased Bridge Liquors from Ms. Phillips, and in due course was issued an off-sale liquor license for the premises by the Minneapolis City Council. Later he subleased the premises to various people, all of whom were issued licenses to sell liquor. Then, in 1978, Bridge Liquors was leased to Paul and Robert Bouthilet, who were also granted a license. This license, like all the others, was due to expire the following year if not renewed. The Bouthilets, however, failed to make the proper license payments, and the license expired on January 1, 1979. There was evidence that the expiration date of January 1,1979, appeared on the license, along with a reminder to renew the license \u201cbefore November 1, 1979.\u201d It is unclear whether this erroneous reminder led to the Bouthilets\u2019 failure to renew the license.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">In any event, plaintiff Kapaun was unaware of the lapse until February of 1979. At that time he sought the assistance of plaintiff Amar Upper Midwest, Inc., to sell his interest. One prospective purchaser applied for an off-sale license, and it was denied. The City considered the application to be a request for a new license and therefore barred under Minneapolis Ordinance 362.40, which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-10\">After August 1, 1974, no off sale license shall be issued for a location, the main entrance of which is within a radius of two thousand (2,000) feet from the main entrance of an existing off sale location. Any license in existence on August 1, 1974, may be renewed or reissued for such locations without regard to such distance limitations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-11\">Bridge Liquors is within 2,000 feet of two other off-sale liquor stores.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-12\">After this denial, Kapaun himself applied for a license, citing the language in Ordinance 362.40 exempting licenses in existence on August 1, 1974, from the territorial restriction. The City Attorney, however, interpreted the \u201crenewed or reissued\u201d language of the ordinance to require the existence of a license that had neither expired nor been revoked at any time prior to application. On October 13, 1979, after a hearing before the City Council Committee on Licenses and Consumer Services, Kapaun\u2019s application was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-13\">Several months later this action was filed against the five members of the Committee on Licenses and Consumer Services and the City of Minneapolis. The plaintiffs\u2019 theory was that the actions of the City somehow denied them federal rights to due process and equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-14\">On August 31, 1981, counsel appeared before Judge Larson pursuant to a calendar call. Within a month thereafter, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment with accompanying affidavits. On October 9, 1981, an affidavit of prejudice directed to Judge Larson was filed by plaintiffs. On October 19 plaintiffs filed a motion which opposed the granting of summary judgment and requested that the case be \u201cremoved\u201d to a Minnesota state court. After a hearing on these motions the District Court granted the motion for summary judgment, denied the request for \u201cremoval,\u201d and declined to disqualify itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">It is unnecessary for us to add to the District Court\u2019s discussion of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims of violations of their rights to due process and equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. See 8th Cir. Rule 14. The crux of the matter is that the plaintiffs\u2019 case must stand or fall on the interpretation of Minneapolis Ordinance 362.40. No substantial issue is raised under the Fourteenth Amendment. As to the request that the case be \u201cremoved\u201d to a state court, the District Court correctly explained to counsel for plaintiffs that the term \u201cremoval\u201d refers to the transfer of a case from the state courts to the federal courts, and not the other way around.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">The argument that the affidavit of prejudice should have been given effect also merits little discussion. The entire issue arose out of a statement made by the District Court to defendants\u2019 counsel at a pretrial hearing. The affidavit asserts that soon after plaintiffs\u2019 counsel stated that more discovery would be needed, Judge Larson suggested to opposing counsel that he move for summary judgment. Judge Larson further suggested that the affidavits previously introduced on the motion for temporary injunction would be sufficient to develop the facts for purposes of ruling on a motion for summary judgment. The comments complained of were in no way improper and were only a reflection of the Court\u2019s assessment of the status and merits of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">From our reading of appellants\u2019 brief it appears that, apart from their federal constitutional claims, they also sought to state a claim under Minnesota state law \u2014 that the savings clause in Minneapolis Ordinance 362.40 \u201cgrandfathered in\u201d appellants\u2019 right to continue their use of the property. Appellants\u2019 Brief pp. 2, 7-9. The District Court\u2019s order does not specifically deal with any state-law claims, and of course its jurisdiction over such claims was pendent only. The normal practice where federal claims are dismissed prior to trial is to dismiss pendent claims without prejudice, thus leaving plaintiffs free to pursue their state-law claims in the state courts. See <em>Stokes v. Lokken, </em>644 F.2d 779, 785 (8th Cir. 1981); <em>Pharo v. Smith, </em>621 F.2d 656, 674-75 (5th Cir. 1980). As in <em>Stokes, supra, </em>we construe the District Court\u2019s order to dismiss the federal claims with prejudice, and to dismiss the pendent state-law claim without prejudice to plaintiffs\u2019 asserting it in a state court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b758-8\">. The Hon. Earl R. Larson, Senior United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
