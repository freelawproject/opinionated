WINTER, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b274-14\">Plaintiffs, Michael L. Gurley and David W. Davis, sued Documation, Inc., S. Ray Halbert, Richard J. Testa, and the law firm of Testa, Hurwitz, and Thibeault, for securities fraud in violation of \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b), as implemented by Rule 10b- -5, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5. To this federal cause of action, plaintiffs appended state causes of action for common law fraud and breach of corporate fiduciary duties. The district court dismissed the \u00a7 10(b) count under Rule 12(b)(6), F.R.Civ.P., for failure to state a claim upon which relief might be granted. Having disposed of the sole federal claim, the district court declined to exercise pendent jurisdiction over the state-law causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-15\">The district court also ruled that the statute of limitations provided by Virginia\u2019s blue sky law, Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 13.1-522(d) (Repl. Vol. 1977) applied to plaintiff\u2019s \u00a7 10(b) claim. However, it concluded that the record was not yet sufficiently developed to permit a determination of whether the limitations period expired prior to the bringing of this suit. The district court therefore declined to employ the statute of limitations as an alternative ground for dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-16\">Plaintiffs contest the district court\u2019s ruling that they failed to state a federal claim. They also insist that the applicable statute of limitations was Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 8.01-243, subd. B (Repl. Vol. 1977), which provides a five-year limitations period, instead of the blue sky law, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 13.1-522(d), which prescribes a two-year period. Defendants cross-appeal on the question whether plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 10(b) claim is time barred. We agree with plaintiffs that they stated a cause of action in part. We hold that the two-year period is the proper limitations to apply. We are also in agreement with the district court that the question of whether the action is time barred cannot yet be decided. Thus we affirm in part and reverse in part, remanding for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">We begin by reviewing the allegations of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, which in the present posture of the case must be taken as true.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Plaintiffs are former shareholders of Doc-umation, Inc. (Documation), a Delaware corporation doing business in Virginia. Defendant Halbert is chairman, president, and chief executive officer of Documation as well as a major shareholder in that company. Defendants Richard J. Testa and the law firm of Testa, Hurwitz, and Thibeault served as general counsel to Documation at all times material to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Documation was incorporated in March 1970, and Halbert was one of two original shareholders. Plaintiffs became shareholders within a month of the incorporation. To persuade plaintiffs to buy Documation stock, Halbert promised them that they would be permitted to sell their shares in conjunction with any future public offering by the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Plaintiffs made it clear that they desired to sell their stock and to \u201cpiggyback\u201d on any registered public offering the company might undertake. At a shareholders\u2019 meeting on April 7,1976, Halbert and Testa told plaintiffs that a public offering was contemplated for some indefinite future date. Halbert and Testa also informed plaintiffs that, as individual shareholders, they would not be permitted to piggyback on the offering.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">Defendants did not disclose that preparations were already underway for the offering, which was to be made at the earliest possible date. Nor did they reveal that Halbert and other shareholders would be piggybacking. Furthermore, they informed plaintiffs that Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 144, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.144, would bar them from selling their unregistered shares for ninety days after the commencement of a registered public offering. In fact, however, defendants were aware that Rule 144 did not apply to plaintiffs\u2019 shares, which were issued before the rule took effect, and that plaintiffs were entitled to sell their holdings under other SEC rules. The purpose of these misrepresentations and omissions was to keep plaintiffs\u2019 stock off the market temporarily and thereby to support the price of Documation\u2019s publicly issued shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">Between April 8 and April 14,1976, plaintiff Gurley sold 3,900 shares of Documation stock to an employee of the company for $6.50 per share. Gurley made this sale in reliance on Documation\u2019s deliberate misrepresentations and omissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-12\">On June 4, 1976, Documation filed with the S.E.C. a registration statement that became effective on June 8, 1976. A total of 474,000 registered shares were sold to the public, consisting of 300,000 new shares by Documation, 100,000 by Halbert, and 34,000 by other piggybacking shareholders. Each share brought a price of $17.00. Immediately after the public offering, the price of Documation stock began to fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-13\">At the time of the public offering, plaintiff Gurley owned 19,900 shares of Documation stock, and plaintiff Davis owned 46,900 shares. During the ensuing ninety days, both contacted stockbrokers in an effort to sell their shares. These attempts were unavailing, however, because defendants, purporting to abide by Rule 144, refused to transfer plaintiffs\u2019 shares until ninety days after the public offering. After ninety days elapsed, plaintiffs began to dispose of their stock. Sold over an extended period of time, their stock brought prices ranging from $7.00 per share to $10.54 per share.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-15\">The district court held that <em>Blue Chip Stamps </em>v. <em>Manor Drug Stores, </em>421 U.S. 723, 95 S.Ct. 1917, 44 L.Ed.2d 539 (1975), bars plaintiffs\u2019 claim under \u00a7 10(b) of the 1934 Act. In <em>Blue Chip, </em>the Supreme Court endorsed the so-called <em>Birnbaum </em>rule under which a person who is neither a purchaser nor a seller of securities may not sue under \u00a7 10(b). <em>See Birnbaum v. Newport Steel Corp., </em>193 F.2d 461 (2 Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>343 U.S. 956, 72 S.Ct. 1051, 96 L.Ed. 1356 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-16\">Plaintiffs in <em>Blue Chip </em>claimed they were fraudulently induced not to <em>purchase </em>certain securities. The Supreme Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>however, left little doubt that it approved the <em>Birnbaum </em>rule not only as regards non-purchasers, but also as regards those who allege that they were fraudulently induced not to <em>sell </em>securities. 421 U.S. at 737-38, 95 S.Ct. at 1926-27. Courts had previously applied <em>Birnbaum </em>to foreclose such \u201cretention\u201d claims, <em>see, e.g., Ingenito v. Bermec Corp., </em>376 F.Supp. 1154, 1174-76 (S.D.N.Y. 1974), and they have uniformly adhered to that interpretation in the wake of <em>Blue Chip, see Sacks v. Reynolds Securities, Inc., </em>593 F.2d 1234, 1239-41 (D.C.Cir.1978); <em>Williams v. Sinclair, </em>529 F.2d 1383, 1389 (9 Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>426 U.S. 936, 96 S.Ct. 2651, 49 L.Ed.2d 388 (1976); <em>Clinton Hudson &amp; Sons v. Lehigh Valley Cooperative Farms, </em>73 F.R.D. 420, 425-26 (E.D.Pa.1977), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>586 F.2d 834 (3 Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">To determine the proper application of <em>Blue Chip </em>here, it is necessary to separate . out the various strands of plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 10(b) theory. Their first claim is that they were wrongfully and fraudulently prevented from piggybacking on Documation\u2019s public offering. Their second contention is that defendants\u2019 deceptive and manipulative conduct prevented them from selling their shares for ninety days after the public offering. Finally, plaintiff Gurley maintains that he sold 3,900 shares prior to the public offering, and that he did so in reliance on defendants\u2019 intentional misrepresentations.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The implications of <em>Blue Chip </em>are clear with respect to the first and last of plaintiffs\u2019 claims. Their allegation that they were prevented from piggybacking on the public offering involves no sale of securities. Under a straight-forward application of <em>Blue Chip, </em>that allegation is not actionable. <em>See Blue Chip, </em>421 U.S. at 737-38, 95 S.Ct. at 1926-27; <em>Sacks, </em>593 F.2d at 1239-41; <em>Williams, </em>529 F.2d at 1389; <em>Haynes v. Anderson &amp; Strudwick, Inc., </em>508 F.Supp. 1303, 1317-18 (E.D.Va.1981). Just as plainly, however, Gurley satisfies the <em>Blue Chip </em>purchaser-or-seller requirement with respect to the 3,900 shares he sold before the public offering in reliance on defendants\u2019 alleged deliberate misrepresentations. Hence, <em>Blue Chip </em>furnishes no ground for dismissing the complaint as to those particular sales.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">There remains to be determined whether plaintiffs pled a good cause of action in alleging that they were prevented from selling their shares until ninety days after the public offering. The district court treated this claim as indistinguishable from a claim of fraudulently induced failure to sell, and hence as barred by <em>Blue Chip. </em>Plaintiffs contend that they meet the purchaser-or-seller test of <em>Blue Chip, </em>since they eventually sold their shares. Because they are sellers of securities in the literal sense, plaintiffs maintain that they are entitled to relief if they can show that the alleged frauds were \u201cin connection with\u201d their sales, as required by \u00a7 10(b) of the 1934 Act and by Rule 10b-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">Plaintiffs rely on <em>Travis v. Anthes Imperial Ltd., </em>473 F.2d 515 (8 Cir. 1973), and <em>Stockwell v. Reynolds &amp; Co., </em>252 F.Supp. 215 (S.D.N.Y.1965). These cases, which antedate <em>Blue Chip, </em>permit \u00a7 10(b) actions for fraudulently induced delay in the sale of securities on the theory that the 1934 Act is to be liberally construed for the protection of investors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Travis, </em>473 F.2d at 522; <em>Stockwell, </em>252 F.Supp. at 219. <em>See generally Bolger </em>v. <em>Laventhol, Krekstein, Horwath &amp; Horwath, </em>381 F.Supp. 260, 266 (S.D.N.Y. 1974) (explaining and distinguishing <em>Stock-well </em>and Travis); <em>In re Penn Central Securities Litigation, </em>62 F.R.D. 181, 186 (E.D.Pa. 1974) (same). More recently, the Sixth Circuit has held that a deferred sale is actionable under \u00a7 10(b) if the sale took place sufficiently soon after the alleged fraud to support an inference that the seller acted in reliance on the fraud. <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>Armada Corp., </em>533 F.2d 978, 981-82 (6 Cir. 1976), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number><em>cert. denied, </em>430 U.S. 954, 97 S.Ct. 1598, 51 L.Ed.2d 803 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Defendants argue with considerable force that <em>Stockwell, Travis, </em>and <em>Marsh </em>are inconsistent with <em>Blue Chip. </em>Indeed, at least two <em>post-Blue Chip </em>eases have disallowed deferred sale claims under \u00a7 10(b). <em>See O\u2019Brien v. Continental Illinois Mutual Bank &amp; Trust, </em>593 F.2d 54, 58 (7 Cir. 1979); <em>Ohashi v. Verit Industries, </em>536 F.2d 849, 852-53 (9 Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1004, 97 S.Ct. 538, 40 L.Ed.2d 616 (1976). Analysis of the policies underlying the <em>Blue Chip </em>decision persuades us that one who claims that he was fraudulently induced to delay a sale of securities must, like a nonseller, be denied standing under \u00a7 10(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The Supreme Court\u2019s central concern in <em>Blue Chip </em>was to reduce the incidence of nuisance suits under \u00a7 10(b). The penden-cy of a securities fraud case can seriously disrupt a defendant\u2019s normal business activities unrelated to the suit. Absent the <em>Birnbaum </em>rule, moreover, such cases would be highly resistant to disposition by pretrial motion because they usually turn on conflicting oral testimony as to critical elements of the plaintiff\u2019s claim. These factors, coupled with the magnitude of potential liability under \u00a7 10(b), exert heavy pressure on defendants to settle even frivolous cases, and can be expected to attract numerous plaintiffs willing to exploit merit-less claims for their settlement value. <em>See </em>421 U.S. at 739-44, 95 S.Ct. at 1927-29. In short, litigation under \u00a7 10(b) poses \u201ca danger of vexatiousness different in degree and in kind from that which accompanies litigation in general.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 739, 95 S.Ct. at 1927. Since private rights of action under \u00a7 10(b) arise by implication rather than by express congressional directive, judicial resort to a restrictive rule of standing is appropriate to guard against abuse of the litigation process. <em>See id. </em>at 748-49, 95 S.Ct. at 1931-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Of course, a literal application of <em>Blue Chip </em>does not foreclose a claim that the defendant\u2019s fraud caused the plaintiff to sell his shares later than he would otherwise have done. But such deferred sales claims pose the same risk of abuse as the pure retention claims which are barred by <em>Blue Chip </em>and <em>Birnbaum. </em>A deferred seller\u2019s allegations, like those of a nonseller, are likely to rest in large part on his own oral testimony. The timing and volume of sales he would have undertaken but for the alleged fraud are almost inevitably matters of speculation. The ease with which parties can manufacture deferred sales claims with sufficient plausibility to survive summary proceedings raises a high risk of the kind of spurious litigation which the <em>Blue Chip </em>court sought to weed out. Furthermore, <em>Blue Chip </em>would be completely undercut if an investor disgruntled by the market performance of his stock could create \u00a7 10(b) standing by making a sale and alleging prior fraud. <em>See O\u2019Brien, </em>593 F.2d at 58; <em>cf. Blue Chip, </em>421 U.S. at 747, 95 S.Ct. at 1931 (\u201cIn the absence of the Birnbaum doctrine, bystanders to the securities marketing process could await developments on the sidelines without risk, claiming that inaccuracies in disclosure caused nonselling in a falling market .... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">We recognize that barring deferred sales claims under \u00a7 10(b) will penalize some deserving plaintiffs. The <em>Blue Chip </em>court likewise took account of that disadvantage but concluded that it is outweighed by the benefits of a prophylactic rule. <em>See </em>421 U.S. at 738-39, 95 S.Ct. at 1926-27. Due regard for the policies expounded in <em>Blue Chip </em>compels us to strike the same balance here. We therefore hold that a plaintiff who claims he was fraudulently caused to delay the sale of securities lacks standing to sue under \u00a7 10(b) of the 1934 Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">Since we hold that plaintiff Gurley\u2019s stock sales in April 1976 give him standing to litigate \u00a7 10(b) claims with respect to these sales, we must address the other issues raised on appeal \u2014 namely, which statute of limitations applies, and whether it is apparent on the record that the statute has run.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">Where, as under \u00a7 10(b), a federal cause of action has no express limitations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>period, the action is subject to the state statute of limitations \u201cwhich most clearly addresses the same or similar policy considerations as are addressed by the federal right being asserted.\u201d <em>O\u2019Hara v. Kovens, </em>625 F.2d 15, 18 (4 Cir. 1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1124, 101 S.Ct. 939, 67 L.Ed.2d 109 (1981). <em>See Holmberg v. Armbrecht, </em>327 U.S. 392, 395, 66 S.Ct. 582, 584, 90 L.Ed. 743 (1946). On this principle, we have subjected private actions under \u00a7 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77q(a), to the limitations period prescribed by Virginia\u2019s blue sky law. <em>Newman v. Prior, </em>518 F.2d 97, 99-100 (4 Cir. 1975). Similarly, we have held that the statute of limitations provided by Maryland\u2019s blue sky law applies to private actions under \u00a7 10(b). <em>O\u2019Hara, </em>625 F.2d at 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><em>Newman </em>and <em>O\u2019Hara </em>lend obvious support to the district court\u2019s holding that the limitations period of Virginia\u2019s blue sky law, Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 13.1-522(d) (Repl. Vol. 1977) applies to the \u00a7 10(b) claims in this case. Plaintiffs contend, however, that the appropriate statute of limitations is Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 8.01 243 subd. B (Repl. Vol. 1977). Section 8.01 243 addresses all actions for which no other limitations period is otherwise provided \u2014 a designation which encompasses common law fraud.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-12\">In <em>Newman </em>and <em>Prior, </em>we declined to apply such catchall statutes of limitations to federal securities claims. Plaintiffs nevertheless insist that Virginia\u2019s blue sky law is inapposite because it prohibits only fraud against buyers of securities, not fraud against sellers such as is alleged here.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <em>O\u2019Hara </em>we rejected a similar argument partly on the ground that the Maryland blue sky law made the defrauding of sellers a criminal offense, although it created no private remedy for such conduct. <em>See </em>625 F.2d at 17 18. Noting that Virginia\u2019s blue sky law accords neither public nor private remedies for frauds against sellers, plaintiffs contend that the reasoning of <em>O'Hara </em>precludes the application of Virginia\u2019s blue sky law in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Plaintiffs take too narrow a view of the controlling analysis. In <em>O\u2019Hara </em>we emphasized the critical policy link between the federal right being asserted and the applicable state statute of limitations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\">It is not necessary that the state statute operate in the same fashion as the federal scheme, nor is it necessary that the state statute describe a cause of action identical to the federal cause at issue. There simply must be a commonality of purpose between the federal right and the state statutory scheme so that it is reasonable to subject the federal implied right to the statute of limitations provided by state law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 18 (citations omitted). Virginia\u2019s blue sky law shares with \u00a7 10(b) of the 1934 Act the central purpose of protecting investors from fraud in the securities markets. \u201cBy comparison, the shared purposes between \u00a7 10(b) and common law fraud are generalized at best.\u201d <em>O\u2019Hara, </em>625 F.2d at 18. <em>See generally Morris v. Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Co., </em>600 F.2d 139 (8 Cir. 1979); <em>Parrent v. Midwest Rug Mills, Inc., </em>455 F.2d 123, 125-28 (7 Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">We think the fact that both \u00a7 10(b) and the blue sky law address the problem of misinformation in securities transactions is far more significant, for present purposes, than the fact that the blue sky law does not specifically speak to frauds against sellers. <em>Accord, Roberts v. Magnetic Metals Co., </em>611 F.2d 450, 462-63 (3 Cir. 1979) (Seitz, C. J., dissenting); <em>Dupuy v. Dupuy, </em>551 F.2d 1005, 1023 n.31 (5 Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 911, 98 S.Ct. 312, 54 L.Ed.2d 197 (1977); <em>see also Fox v. Kane-Miller Corp., </em>542 F.2d 915 (4 Cir. 1976). <em>Contra, Roberts v. Magnetic Metals Co., </em>611 F.2d at 454-55 (plurality opinion); <em>id. </em>at 459-60 (concurring opinion). Because the blue sky law is the Virginia statute which most clearly addresses the policy concerns of \u00a7 10(b) of the 1934 Act, we hold that the two-year limitations period of the blue sky law applies to private actions under \u00a7 10(b).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">Like the district court, however, we conclude that it would be premature to dismiss otherwise proper claims in this lawsuit on the basis of the statute of limitations. We cannot at this early juncture exclude the possibility that plaintiff Gurley will be able to show that he could not reasonably have been expected to discover the alleged fraud earlier than he did. <em>See Johns Hopkins University v. Hutton, </em>422 F.2d 1124, 1131 (4 Cir. 1970) (the question of plaintiff\u2019s diligence in uncovering fraud is for the jury where the facts give rise to conflicting inferences). Accordingly, we remand this case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b276-6\">. Contrary to defendants\u2019 suggestion, we think that the allegations regarding Gurley\u2019s April 1976 sale were well pleaded in the amended complaint and therefore were sufficiently brought to the attention of the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b276-10\">. The <em>Travis </em>court also relied on an alternative holding that plaintiffs satisfied the <em>Birnbaum </em>rule by operation of the \u201cforced seller\u201d doctrine. 423 F.2d at 522.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b278-5\">.

Were this statute still in force, we might have a nice question as to whether plaintiffs\u2019 action is such as would survive the death of a party and thus entitles them to the five-year, rather than the one-year, limitations period. <em>See generally, Newman, </em>518 F.2d at 99.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b278-15\">. The blue sky law provides, <em>inter alia :</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-16\">(a) Any person who: ... (2) Sells a security by means of an untrue statement of a material fact or any omission to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statement made, in the light of the circumstances under which they [sic] were made, not misleading (the purchaser not knowing of such untruth or omission), and who shall not sustain the burden of proof that he did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of such untruth or omission,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOV\">Shall be liable to the person purchasing such security from him who may sue either at law or in equity to recover the consideration paid for such security, together with interest thereon at the rate of six percent per annum, costs, and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, less the amount of any income received on the security, upon the tender of such security, or for the substantial equivalent in damages if he no longer owns the security.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-18\">(d) No suit shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under this section unless brought within two years after the transaction upon which it is based ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-19\">Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 13.1-522(a)(2), (d) (Repl. Vol. 1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b279-8\">. That the express limitations periods of the federal securities acts are generally short indicates a federal policy of repose that militates against applying the long limitations period for common law fraud to implied private causes of action under \u00a7 10(b). <em>See Newman, </em>518 F.2d at 100 n.4. We recognize that it is in some sense anomalous that plaintiffs\u2019 state claims may be brought within five years while, under our decision in this case, federal claims arising from the same facts must be brought within two years. It would be a much greater anomaly, however, if sellers were accorded five years to sue under \u00a7 10(b), while buyers must, under <em>Newman, </em>sue within two years.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
