The amount of \u201cnet proceeds realized\u201d is of consequence because the fee payable by Riverside\u2019s trustees in bankruptcy (the \u201cTrustees\u201d) to the Referees\u2019 Salary and Expense Fund (the \u201cFund\u201d) is calculated as a percentage of the \u201cnet proceeds realized.\u201d We conclude that the judgment in this matter must be vacated and the cause remanded for a redetermination of whether the sale of the properties in question was \u201cfree and clear of\u201d or \u201csubject to\u201d several liens, how such redetermination may affect the \u201cnet proceeds realized\u201d from the sale, and related matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b655-17\">The facts of this case are difficult to understand independent of a knowledge of the applicable law defining \u201cnet proceeds realized\u201d in a sale of the property of a bankrupt. Hence, we shall discuss these legal standards before attempting a detailed analysis of the facts surrounding the Trustees\u2019 sales in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-18\">The law governing the collection of fees in this ease from the bankrupt\u2019s estate for payment into the Fund is set forth in sections 40(c)(2)(a) and 40(c)(2)(c) of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898 (the \u201cAct\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 40(c)(2)(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>Additional fees for the referees\u2019 salary and expense fund shall be charged, in accordance with the schedule fixed by the [Judicial] conference (a) against each estate wholly or partially liquidated in a bankruptcy proceeding, and be computed upon the <em>net proceeds realized </em>in asset cases ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 68(c)(2)(a) (1976) (repealed) (emphasis supplied). Although the Act does not define \u201cnet proceeds realized,\u201d section 40(c)(2)(c) does contemplate that \u201c[t]he Director [of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts], with the approval of the [Judicial Conference of the United States], may make .. . rules and regulations prescribing methods for determining net proceeds realized . ... \u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 68(c)(2)(c) (1976) (repealed).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">In 1947 the Judicial Conference promulgated a rule for computing \u201cnet proceeds realized\u201d which, as amended in 1966, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-7\">1. <em>Determination of Net Proceeds Realized in Asset Cases. </em>In determining the amount of net proceeds realized in asset cases for the purpose of Section 40(c)(2) of the Bankruptcy Act as amended, the term \u201cnet proceeds realized in asset cases\u201d shall mean, <em>in the case of sale or liquidation, </em>the amount of money coming into the estate of a bankrupt as assets of such estate <em>which shall include the entire sale price of encumbered property when sold free and clear of all liens </em>or, if not sold or liquidated, the fair cash market value of all property coming into the estate as assets of such estate, exclusive of all statutory exemptions whether State or Federal and exclusive of all expenses directly incurred in the operation of the debtor\u2019s business after bankruptcy; <em>provided, however, that where property is sold or transferred subject to a valid existing mortgage, lien or other encumbrance, the amount of such mortgage, lien or other encumbrance not affected by such sale shall not be included in determining the amount of net proceeds realized.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-10\"><em>Reports of the Proceedings of the Judicial Conference of the United States </em>22 (1966) (emphasis supplied) <em>reprinted in </em>2A <em>Moore, Oglebay &amp; King, Collier on Bankruptcy </em>140.05[2.5], at 1580.2 (14th ed. 1978) (hereinafter 2A <em>Collier on Bankruptcy). </em>The Conference rule, which is a \u201ccontemporaneous construction of section 40c(2) by those charged with administering the [Fund], ... is entitled to great deference.\u201d <em>Mesa Farm Co. v. United States, </em>475 F.2d 1004, 1007 (9th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-11\">The effect of the Conference\u2019s rule is that when the bankrupt\u2019s property is sold <em>\u201cfree and clear </em>of all liens,\u201d the <em>full sale price </em>of the property constitutes the \u201cnet proceeds realized.\u201d The fee schedule established by the Conference is then applied against this amount to compute the sum payable by the estate to the Fund.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, when property is sold <em>\u201csubject to\u201d </em>a lien, mortgage or encumbrance, \u201cthe amount of such mortgage, lien or encumbrance <em>not affected </em>by such sale\u201d is not included in \u201cnet proceeds realized.\u201d The dispute in this case is whether the Trustees sold some of Riverside\u2019s property \u201cfree and clear of\u201d or \u201csubject to\u201d certain liens. If the property was sold free and clear of the liens involved here, the \u201cnet proceeds realized\u201d must include the value of those liens, thereby increasing the amount upon which fees payable to the Fund are calculated. On the other hand, if the property was sold \u201csubject to\u201d those liens <em>and </em>if the liens were not affected by the sales, the \u201cnet proceeds realized\u201d must exclude the value of the liens, thereby reducing the base from which fees payable to the Fund are calculated. To the extent that fees must be paid, the residual estate available to general creditors is reduced or eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b656-13\">The basic facts, as found by the district court and the bankruptcy court, are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>disputed. On August 30, 1976, the bankruptcy court issued orders approving the sale by the Trustees of three parcels of real estate located in Rockford, Illinois. The parcels \u2014 all apartment complexes \u2014 were encumbered with numerous liens and mortgages. The Trustees assert that throughout the process which culminated in the sales of these properties, they deliberately structured the proposed transfers so that the property would be sold \u201csubject to\u201d certain liens and \u201cfree and clear of\u201d other liens. \u201cIn all available applications, notices, closing documents, real estate deeds, and releases of liens, the three sales were labeled as sales \u2018subject to\u2019 certain encumbrances.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 3. Moreover, the three orders issued by the bankruptcy court approving the sales specified that each sale was \u201csubject to\u201d certain liens and \u201cfree and clear of\u201d certain other liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">At the time of sale, the Trustees transferred the deeds to the properties to an escrow agent \u201csubject to\u201d certain specified liens. The buyer paid to the escrow agent the proceeds of a loan secured from an independent source, and the agent then discharged the outstanding liens on the properties before transferring the deeds to the buyer. The difference between the sale price and the amount of outstanding liens was then paid to the Trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">The Trustees do not dispute that the value of the properties, to the extent they were sold \u201cfree and clear of\u201d any liens specified in the bankruptcy court\u2019s order, must be included in \u201cnet proceeds realized.\u201d The controversy here is limited to the inclusion in \u201cnet proceeds realized\u201d of the amount of the liens to which the bankruptcy court\u2019s orders approving the sales contemplated that the properties were subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">A dispute arose at closing about a mortgage on one of the three properties in the amount of approximately $450,000 held by Bell Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association (\u201cBell\u201d). After arrangements for the sale were completed between the Trustees and the buyer, Bell insisted that, as a condition of discharging its lien at the time of sale, it receive a prepayment penalty of $19,000. Because the sale could not be completed without payment of the penalty, the Trustees agreed to allow the buyer to pay the penalty out of the sale price, thus reducing the proceeds paid by the buyer to the Trustees by $19,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">The Trustees (against whom the prepayment penalty had thus been effectively assessed) then instituted a suit against Bell in the bankruptcy court to recover the penalty. Under these special circumstances, the bankruptcy court first determined that the sale of the property upon which Bell held its lien was a sale \u201cfree and clear of\u201d all liens (including the Bell lien) and not \u201csubject to\u201d any liens. The court reasoned that if the sale were actually \u201csubject to,\u201d the buyers \u2014 not the Trustees \u2014 would be prosecuting the action against Bell. Moreover, the court noted that, since none of the liens were assumed by the buyers but were instead discharged by the escrow agent, the sale could not have been \u201csubject to.\u201d In any event, the Trustees were successful on the merits of the specific issue involved in the proceeding since the bankruptcy court concluded that the Trustees were not required to pay Bell a prepayment penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-12\">The bankruptcy court\u2019s holding that the sale of the parcel encumbered by the Bell mortgage was sold free and clear of all liens prompted the Trustees, who had assumed that the sales of all parcels of property were \u201csubject to\u201d specified liens, to request from the bankruptcy court a determination of the amount payable by the Trustees to the Fund.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In its decision and order determining the \u201cnet proceeds realized,\u201d the bankruptcy court did not specifically state whether it concluded as a matter of either fact or law that the sales in question were \u201cfree and clear of\u201d or \u201csubject to\u201d the various liens. Instead, the court cited an example from the Manual for Bankruptcy Judges<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which includes the value of liens in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>the \u201cnet proceeds realized\u201d when outstanding liens on a bankrupt\u2019s property are discharged by an escrow agent at the time of sale. The bankruptcy court also concluded, as a matter of law, that the liens were \u201c <em>affected </em>by the sales.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, the court concluded that the \u201cnet proceeds realized\u201d from the Trustees\u2019 sales amounted to the full sale price of the three parcels of property \u2014 slightly more than $2 million \u2014 and that the fee payable to the Referees\u2019 Salary and Expense Fund should be computed based on that amount.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">Upon the Trustees\u2019 appeal, the district court reversed the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision except to the extent that the bankruptcy court had included the value of the Bell mortgage in the \u201cnet proceeds realized.\u201d The district court, like the bankruptcy court, did not specifically conclude whether the sales, which purported to be \u201csubject to\u201d certain liens, were actually \u201cfree and clear of\u201d or \u201csubject to\u201d those liens. Rather, the court noted that, where sales are \u201ctechnically \u2018subject to\u2019 a lien,\u201d the Judicial Conference\u2019s regulation defining \u201cnet proceeds realized\u201d provides that only liens \u201caffected by\u201d the sale are to be included in the calculation of \u201cnet proceeds realized.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Bell lien, according to the district court, was \u201caffected by\u201d the sale and thus was properly included in the \u201cnet proceeds realized\u201d; however, no other \u201csubject to\u201d liens were similarly affected by the sale. The district court therefore held that the bankruptcy court erred by including the value of these other liens in the amount of \u201cnet proceeds realized.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b658-12\">Both the bankruptcy court and the district court focused their concern on determining whether the sales of the three parcels of property \u201caffected\u201d the liens which were discharged by the escrow agent at the time of sale. We believe that the district court properly analyzed this issue when it concluded that, except for the Bell mortgage, the purportedly \u201csubject to\u201d liens were not \u201caffected by\u201d the sales. After an agreement on the assumption of the liens could not be reached with the lienholders, the buyer paid off those current lien-holders coincident with the sale of the parcels. The district court noted, however, that \u201c[t]he record does not reflect any further dealings or subsequent litigation by the co-trustees or the bankruptcy court with reference to the liens.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The mere discharge of these liens by the buyer is not, under the circumstances shown, an act which results in the liens being \u201caffected by\u201d the sale. In the context of the Judicial Conference regulation, the phrase \u201caffected by\u201d connotes action or activity by the <em>bankruptcy court </em>that, for example, contributes to altering legal relations under a lien which survives the sale, or contributed to establishing (or even disestablishing) legal rights under a surviving lien. Unlike the other liens in question, however, the Bell mortgage is a lien which, if it actually survived the sale, is \u201caffected by\u201d the sale because the bankruptcy court resolved a question about the payment of a penalty allegedly arising from the sale of the property encumbered by the Bell lien.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>Very importantly, however, the question whether liens are \u201caffected by\u201d a sale is only the second step of the analysis under the Judicial Conference regulation. The first question that must be addressed is whether the sale of the bankrupt\u2019s property was \u201cfree and clear of\u201d or \u201csubject to\u201d liens; a court should properly reach the \u201caffected by\u201d issue only if the sale was \u201csubject to\u201d liens.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">In the instant case, neither the district court nor the bankruptcy court expressly stated whether the sales of the three parcels of property were \u201cfree and clear of\u201d or \u201csubject to\u201d the specified liens. It appears that the bankruptcy court may have determined, as a matter of law, that the sales here were actually \u201cfree and clear of\u201d all liens.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the bankruptcy court, although apparently under no compulsion from the Conference regulation, further concluded that the liens in question were \u201caffected by\u201d the sales. But that question, as explained above, is only reached if the sales are \u201csubject to\u201d liens. Thus, we are unable to determine with certainty which analysis \u2014 \u201cfree and clear\u201d or \u201csubject to\u201d and \u201caffected by\u201d \u2014 governed the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">The district court, on the other hand, since it considered in detail whether the liens were \u201caffected by\u201d the sales, apparently determined that the sales were \u201csubject to\u201d the liens. The court did not, however, explain or even clearly articulate its conclusion on this point. This failure by the district court to explicate its reasoning is significant because it is not crystal clear that the district court flatly disagreed with the bankruptcy court on the \u201csubject to\u201d issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">Moreover, the significance of the failure of either court to expressly and specifically consider the \u201cfree and clear\u2019\u2019/\u201csubject to\u201d dichotomy assumes considerable importance in light of circumstances surrounding the sales. The orders issued by the bankruptcy court approving the sales state that the sales would be made \u201csubject to\u201d specified liens.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As a matter of form, the Trustees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>set up the sales so that all the necessary documents incident to the transactions also stated that the sales were \u201csubject to\u201d specified liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">However, as a matter of what actually took place, (although we do not decide the point), it may be difficult \u2014 perhaps impossible \u2014 to characterize the sales as anything but sales \u201cfree and clear of\u201d liens. The Trustees told the buyer that they \u201ccould only consider an offer that was subject to\u201d the valid liens;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> however, the mortgagees would not permit the buyer to assume the liens. The buyer thereafter secured financing from another source. At the time of the sale, the buyer and the Trustees, using the same escrow agent, tendered, respectively, the purchase money and the deeds. The escrow agent paid off the outstanding liens on the property and transferred the deeds to the buyer; the Trustees received a check from the escrow agent in an amount representing the difference between the total sale price and the amount of the liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Generally, in a \u201cfree and clear\u201d sale, the liens are impressed on the proceeds of the sale and discharged at the time of sale; in a \u201csubject to\u201d sale, on the other hand, the lien survives the sale in some form for some period of time, however slight. <em>Compare Trend Mills </em>v. <em>Socher, </em>4 B.R. 465 (D.C.D.N.J.1980) (lien survives in \u201csubject to\u201d sale) <em>with Circus Time, Inc. v. Oxford Bank and Trust, </em>5 B.R. 1 (D.Me.Bkrtcy.Ct.1979) (if property sold free and clear of lien, lien attaches to proceeds of sales). <em>See also Second National Bank v. Blake, </em>600 F.2d 160, 165 (8th Cir. 1979) <em>(per </em>curiam); <em>Farmers Bank v. Julian, </em>383 F.2d 314, 322 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>389 U.S. 1021, 88 S.Ct. 593, 19 L.Ed.2d 662 (1967). In the instant case, the deed was not transferred to the buyer until after the liens were discharged. Thus, because the liens did not survive the sale but instead were impressed on the sale proceeds, the sale is probably most accurately characterized (although we do not decide the point) as \u201cfree and clear of\u201d liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-14\">Although the facts suggest that, contrary to the order of the bankruptcy court, the sales were not made \u201csubject to\u201d liens, it may not be appropriate in this case for the bankruptcy court to recompute the fee payable to the Fund based on a \u201csecond glance\u201d recharacterization of the sales. As a general rule, the bankruptcy court should not order property sold \u201cfree and clear of\u201d liens unless the court is satisfied that the sale proceeds <em>will fully compensate secured lienholders and produce some equity for the benefit of the bankrupt\u2019s estate. See Freeman Furniture Factories, Inc. v. Bowlds, </em>136 F.2d 136, 140 (6th Cir. 1943); <em>Hoehn v. McIntosh, </em>110 F.2d 199, 202 (6th Cir. 1940); <em>In re Unikraft Homes of Virginia, Inc., </em>370 F.Supp. 667, 670-71 (W.D.Va.1974); <em>In re Bernhard Altmann International Corp., </em>226 F.Supp. 201, 205-06 (S.D.N.Y.1963). <em>Cf. Standard Brass Corp. v. Farmers National Bank, </em>388 F.2d 86, 89 (7th Cir. 1967) (trustees abused discretion by selling property free of lien when sale returned no equity to bankrupt\u2019s estate). The Trustees here argue that if they had been aware at the time of the sales that the bankruptcy court would later assert that the sales were free and clear of all liens, they might not have consummated the sale of the properties because insufficient equity would have been produced to cover all costs and to return equity for the benefit of general creditors. In support of this allegation, the Trustees note that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-15\">[t]he negotiations surrounding and leading up to these three sales recognize[d] that the sales had to be subject to certain uncontested liens and encumbrances by reason of the fact that a simple, mathematical computation revealed that the total of the uncontested liens, contested liens and court costs (if computed on the full price) exceeded the total purchase price. If that were to be the case, then there would have been no benefit to the creditors to pursue and complete the sales. In addition, settlements were negotiated by the Co-Trustees and their counsel relative to the contested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>liens, and these were negotiated with full reliance that the three parcels of real estate had been sold subject to certain liens and encumbrances, thereby limiting the full extent of the court costs .... <footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"any-dedup-1\">Neither the bankruptcy court nor the district court considered whether these allegations, if true, would be sufficient to estop the government from challenging the bankruptcy court\u2019s previous order that the sales were \u201csubject to\u201d liens. <em>Cf. Matter of Prescott College, </em>10 B.R. 316 (D.C.D.Ariz.1981) (county government estopped from challenging sale free and clear of tax liens).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Further, in light of the strong policy protecting both secured and general creditors evinced in part by court decisions requiring the bankruptcy court to consider <em>before </em>the sale whether it will order the sale free and clear of liens, we believe that the bankruptcy court must on remand give serious consideration to these factors. The bankruptcy court should also develop a record on what amounts, if any, would be available to meet general creditors\u2019 claims depending on whether the liens in question were included in or excluded from \u201cnet proceeds realized.\u201d The bankruptcy court must also consider and clearly decide whether the sales as carried out by the Trustees were \u201csubject to\u201d or \u201cfree and clear of\u201d the liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The judgment of the district court is vacated and the cause is remanded to the district court with instructions to remand the proceedings to the bankruptcy court to determine the impact of various determinations of \u201cnet proceeds realized\u201d on the position of general creditors, to determine if the sales here in question were \u201cfree and clear of\u201d or \u201csubject to\u201d liens, to consider the possible application of principles of estoppel or other equitable principles and to consider the propriety of charging the bankrupt\u2019s estate with an assessment payable to the Fund greater than that approved by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">Vacated and Remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b655-11\">.

Hence under the Conference\u2019s regulation, as discussed <em>infra, </em>the court need not analyze the sale to determine if the lien was \u201caffected.\u201d Indeed, such an interpretation of \u201caffected by\" is superfluous in such cases since in a \u201cfree and clear\u201d sale it is inherent that the liens will be affected by being discharged. The \u201caffected by\u201d analysis is appropriate, however, in cases where the sale is made \u201csubject to\u201d liens. Rather than merely excluding from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>\u201cnet proceeds realized\u201d the value of liens to which sales are subject, the Conference chose to maximize revenues to the Fund by including those sales where the lien survived but the bankruptcy court still acted in some capacity to \u201caffect\u201d the surviving lien. We do not now determine whether the property encumbered by the Bell mortgage, as discussed <em>infra, </em>was or was not sold \u201csubject to\u201d liens. On remand, only if this property is found to have been sold \u201csubject to\u201d liens, is it appropriate to determine whether those liens were \u201caffected by\u201d the sale.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b659-6\">. This two step analysis is evident not only from the face of the regulation but also from the circumstances prompting the Judicial Conference\u2019s 1966 amendment. The 1966 amendment, which added the phrase \u201cfree and clear of\u201d liens to the regulation, was intended to create uniformity in the application of the regulation so that in all cases of sales free and clear of liens, the \u201cnet proceeds realized\u201d would include the value of the discharged liens. See <em>Reports of the Proceedings of the Judicial Conference of the United States </em>22 (1966). This amendment thus created a bright line between \u201cfree and clear\u201d sales, which are always included in \u201cnet proceeds realized,\u201d and \u201csubject to\u201d sales, which are included in \u201cnet proceeds realized\u201d only if the sales \u201caffected\u201d the liens. Although the general principle, expressed in 2A <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>\u00b6 40.05[1.2], at 1567-68, that \u201cnet proceeds realized\u201d often depends upon whether the property \u201chas been justifiably administered\u201d by the bankruptcy court is sound, <em>see generally Lutheran Hospitals &amp; Home Soc. v. Duecy, 422 </em>F.2d 200, 208-10 (9th Cir. 1970), that \u201ctest\u201d cannot be substituted for the test prescribed in the Conference\u2019s regulation. Consideration of the Collier principle is, we believe, more appropriate after the court first determines if the sales were \u201cfree and clear of\u201d or \u201csubject to\u201d liens. It appears to us that the district court may have placed more emphasis on this principle than on the Conference\u2019s regulation, which is entitled to deference.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b659-11\">. Indeed, this conclusion is buttressed by the court\u2019s citation to section 605.06(1)(c) of the Bankruptcy Manual and the court\u2019s previous <em>explicit </em>holding in the Bell litigation that the sale of the property encumbered by Bell\u2019s mortgage was a sale \u201cfree and clear of\u2019 all liens. We agree, however, with the district court that \u201cthe examples in the Manual are merely indicative of the interpretation placed upon the regulations by the Administrative Office when it recommended the rules and regulations actually promulgated by the Conference.\u201d Slip op. at 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b659-12\">.

We do not suggest that principles of estop-pel should necessarily govern the disposition of this case on remand. On the other hand, we note that this case may raise equitable questions which neither the bankruptcy court nor the district court have explored or articulated. We note that the bankruptcy court observed that the Trustees acted with the utmost diligence by finding a buyer for the properties and by compromising the numerous claims so as to produce some equity for the estate and its general creditors. Under these circumstances, it is important that the lower courts specifically consider and explain whether the sales were \u201cfree and clear of\u2019 or \u201csubject to\u201d liens in terms of the Conference regulations and further consider the role, if any, of equitable principles when an after-the-fact recharacterization of the fee payable to the Fund may deprive the estate of any equity remaining after the sale.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
