In November of 1980, the hospital withdrew these privileges based upon the conclusion of its medical staff that he was not professionally competent. Plaintiff has contended on appeal that the withdrawal of his privileges was attributable to the state because defendant received Hill-Burton Act funds, accepted Medicare and Medicaid patients, and was required by Statute to report the withdrawal to state medical licensing authorities.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>To determine whether or not defendant\u2019s termination of plaintiff\u2019s privileges is \u201cstate action\u201d, we must inquire \u201cwhether there is a sufficiently close nexus between the State and the challenged action of the regulated entity that the action of the latter may fairly be treated as that of the State itself.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., </em>419 U.S. 345, 351, 95 S.Ct. 449, 453, 42 L.Ed.2d 477 (1974); <em>accord, Flagg Brothers, Inc. v. Brooks, </em>436 U.S. 149, 157, 98 S.Ct. 1729, 1733, 56 L.Ed.2d 185 (1978). In holding that a privately-owned utility\u2019s termination of service is not \u201cstate action\u201d, the Court in <em>Jackson </em>makes it clear that state involvement without state responsibility cannot establish this nexus. <em>See </em>419 U.S. 358, 95 S.Ct. 457. A state becomes responsible for a private party\u2019s act if the private party acts (1) in an exclusively state capacity, (2) for the state\u2019s direct benefit, or (3) at the state\u2019s specific behest. It acts in an exclusively state capacity when it \u201cexercises powers traditionally exclusively reserved to the state[,]\u201d 419 U.S. 352, 95 S.Ct. 454;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> for the state\u2019s direct benefit when it shares the rewards and responsibilities of a private venture with the state, <em>see id., </em>357-58, 95 S.Ct. 456-57, <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Wilmington Parking Au-thoriiy, </em>365 U.S. 715, 723 -24, 81 S.Ct. 856, 860- 61, 6 L.Ed.2d 45 (1961);<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and at the state\u2019s specific behest when it does a particular act which the state has directed or encouraged. <em>See </em>419 U.S. 354, 357, 95 S.Ct. 455, 456.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We must examine plaintiff\u2019s contentions in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-11\">Turning to his first, the Hill-Burton Act provides funding for the construction of private nonprofit hospitals in areas where there is a need for such facilities, and subjects recipients to considerable state and federal regulation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We have held in decisions prior to <em>Jackson </em>that a recipient hospital\u2019s action is state action because the hospital implements the Act\u2019s congressional purpose of providing health care. <em>See Simkins v. Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital, </em>323 F.2d 959, 967-68 (4th Cir. 1963), <em>cert. denied, </em>376 U.S. 938, 84 S.Ct. 793, 11 L.Ed.2d 659 (1964); <em>see also, Duffield v. Charleston Area Medical Center, Inc., </em>503 F.2d 512, 515 (4th Cir. 1974); <em>Christhilf v. Annapolis Emergency Hospital Ass\u2019n., </em>496 F.2d 174, 178 (4th Cir. 1974); <em>Sams v. Ohio Valley General Hospital Ass\u2019n, </em>413 F.2d 826, 828-29 (4th Cir. 1969). We implicitly recognized in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Charleston Area Medical Center, </em>529 F.2d 638 (4th Cir. 1975), the possible inconsistency of these past decisions with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number><em>Jackson, see </em>529 F.2d 642, but did not reach the issue because the state criminal abortion statute involved in that case provided support independent of Hill-Burton for finding the recipient hospital\u2019s abortion policy to be state action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-4\">The case before us squarely presents the question reserved in <em>Doe. </em>We find that our former position that the mere receipt of Hill-Burton Act funds makes the recipient\u2019s every act state action is inconsistent with <em>Jackson, </em>which is controlling on us.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Recipient hospitals undoubtedly \u201coperate as integral parts of comprehensive joint or in-termeshing state and federal plans or programs designed to effect proper allocation of available medical and hospital services for the best possible promotion and maintenance of public health.\u201d 323 F.2d 967 (4th Cir. 1963). But the mere fact that the hospitals implement a governmental program does not establish the nexus which <em>Jackson </em>requires.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The recipients do not act in an exclusively state capacity. Although health care is certainly an \u201cessential public service\u201d, it does not involve the \u201cexercise by a private entity of powers traditionally exclusively reserved to the State.\u201d 419 U.S. 352, 95 S.Ct. 454, <em>see Newsome v. Vanderbilt University, </em>653 F.2d 1100, 1114-15 (6th Cir. 1981); <em>Simkins </em>v. <em>Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital, </em>323 F.2d 973 (Haynsworth, J. dissenting).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Although the hospitals are within a legislative design to better public health and are subject to extensive regulation, they remain solely responsible for providing the service and solely entitled to the profits therefrom. <em>See </em>419 U.S. 358, 95 S.Ct. 457. Finally, the Act does not require states to direct or encourage the procedure for making staff privileges decisions which was employed in this case. Although it prescribes that states compel recipients to make personnel decisions on a merit basis, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C., \u00a7 291d(8), it does not specify the method used here.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>See </em>419 U.S. 357, 95 S.Ct. 456. At most, it declares that states must approve the policies which recipient hospitals adopt. Mere state approval is not \u201cstate action.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1042-7\">As for plaintiff\u2019s second contention, we have indicated in previous decisions that acceptance of patients receiving Medicare and Medicaid benefits does not make the accepting hospital\u2019s actions attributable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>the state. <em>See Trageser v. Libbie Rehabilitation Center, </em>590 F.2d 87, 90 (4th Cir. 1978) (Medicare; veterans\u2019 benefits); <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>560 F.2d 609, 613 (4th Cir. 1977) <em>(dicta </em>; Medicaid). The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Jackson </em>does not affect this position. As these benefits are paid to the patients and not the hospitals, they have even less of a relationship to the challenged action than do Hill-Burton Act funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s final contention is likewise without merit. The state statutes, Va.Code \u00a7\u00a7 54-325.1(a)(3) and 8.01-581.8, do not authorize state officials to make privileges decisions<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>, or to set forth directions governing the outcome of such decisions <footnotemark>16</footnotemark>, or attach consequences to their results.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> They simply require that revocations be reported, and confer immunity from civil liability upon the persons making the report. Absent evidence of authority to revoke a license, the mere duty to report the revocation of privileges does not involve the \u201cexercise by a private entity of powers traditionally exclusively reserved to the State.\u201d 419 U.S. 352, 355 57, 95 S.Ct. 454, 455-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-6\">Nor do plaintiff\u2019s contentions, taken together, form a whole which is greater than the sum of its parts. The staff privileges decisions of a hospital which receives Hill-Burton Act funds, accepts Medicare and Medicaid patients and reports privileges revocations to state medical licensing authorities do not constitute \u201cstate action.\u201d As state action is an essential prerequisite to obtaining relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, the district court\u2019s decision dismissing plaintiff\u2019s claims should be affirmed. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1040-12\">. Plaintiffs complaint also raised state and federal anti-trust claims, and state contract breach and tortious interference claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1040-13\">. <em>See, e.g., Matthews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976); <em>see generally, </em>L. H. Tribe, <em>American Constitutional Law, </em>501-06 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1040-14\">. Purely private behavior does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, as the Amendment\u2019s language limits its application exclusively to acts attributable to the state. <em>See Flagg Brothers, Inc. v. Brooks, </em>436 U.S. 149, 157, 98 S.Ct. 1729, 1733, 56 L.Ed.2d 185 (1978); <em>Civil Rights Cases, </em>109 U.S. 3, 3 S.Ct. 18, 27 L.Ed. 835 (1883); <em>see generally, </em>U.S.Const. amend.

Kress &amp; Co., </em>398 U.S. 144, 148, 161-69, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 1610-14, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970); <em>Trageser v.

In <em>Burton, </em>the court found \u201cstate action\" where a private sandwich shop leasing space in a public parking garage refused to serve black customers. The Court based its decision upon th\u00e9 interdependence of the shop and the state. <em>See </em>365 U.S. 724 25, 81 S.Ct. 861-62. The Court in <em>Jackson </em>limited <em>Burton </em>to cases involving economic interdependence, finding no state action where a privately-owned utility did not share its profits or its responsibility to provide service. We need not decide whether or not economic interdependence requires that the state and the private entity share both. <em>Compare Greco </em>v. <em>Orange Memorial Hospital Corp., </em>513 F.2d 873, 881 (5th Cir. 1975) (lease with county did not make hospital policy \u201cstate action\u201d where lease was not conditioned upon policy\u2019s enactment) <em>with Ludtke v.
