(Credithrift) perfected liens on personal property of the debtors .between the enactment date (November 6, 1978) and the effective date (October 1, 1979) of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978. Credithrift has appealed from two decisions of the Bankruptcy Court for the District of Oregon which applied 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(f) of the Reform Act to those liens, thereby allowing their avoidance by the debtors. The sole question on appeal is whether \u00a7 522(f) may constitutionally be applied to liens perfected after the enactment date but before the effective date of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-22\">I. <em>Legislative Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b817-23\">The Reform Act was passed by Congress on October 6, 1978 and signed into law by the President on November 6, 1978. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>effective date of the Act was October 1, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">A primary goal of the Reform Act, the first major revision of the Bankruptcy Act since 1938, was to provide an effective modern bankruptcy mechanism for consumer debtors. Congress recognized that consumer credit had become a fundamental element of the post-war economy and that the laws needed reform to make \u201cbankruptcy a more effective remedy for the unfortunate consumer debtor.\u201d H.R.Rep.No.95-595, 95th Cong., 2nd Sess. 4 (1978), <em>reprinted in </em>5 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 5787, 5966 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Congress found that most state bankruptcy laws were as outmoded as the federal laws and that there was a federal interest in seeing that a debtor survives bankruptcy with adequate possessions to avoid becoming a public charge and to make a fresh start. <em>Id. </em>at 126, <em>reprinted in </em>5 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 6087. Accordingly, Congress established a set of federal exemptions which serve as an alternative to state bankruptcy law exemptions. Section 522(d) of the Reform Act provides for the exemption of specified personal property from the portion of the debtor\u2019s estate subject to sale in bankruptcy for the satisfaction of debts, including</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-9\">(3) The debtor\u2019s interest, not to exceed $200 in value in any particular item, in household furnishings, household goods, wearing apparel, appliances, books, animals, crops, or musical instruments, that are held primarily for the personal, family, or household use of the debtor or a dependent of the debtor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-10\">As the bankruptcy court noted, \u201cAny excess value will usually be exempt through the use of subsection (d)(5) which gives the debtor another $400.00 general exemption and the right to apply the \u2018spill over\u2019 from the unused portion of the homestead exemption under subsection (d)(1).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b818-11\">Congress recognized, however, that something more was needed, because the purpose of household property exemptions had often been frustrated by creditors who acquired dragnet security interests in otherwise exempt property when making consumer loans. Consequently, Congress included \u00a7 522(f)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the Reform Act to allow debtors to avoid certain security interests of creditors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-12\">(f) Notwithstanding any waiver of exemptions, the debtor may avoid the fixing of a lien on an interest of the debtor in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>property to the extent that such impairs an exemption to which the debtor would have been entitled under subsection (b) of this section, if such lien is\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-4\">(1) a judicial lien; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-5\">(2) A nonpossessory, nonpurchase-mon-ey security interest in any\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-6\">(A) household furnishings, household goods, wearing apparel, appliances, books, animals, crops, musical instruments, or jewelry that are held primarily for the personal, family, or household use of the debtor or a dependent of the debtor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-7\">(B) implements, professional books, or tools, of the trade of the debtor or the trade of a dependent of the debt- or; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-8\">(C) professionally prescribed health aids for the debtor or a dependent of the debtor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">II. <em>Factual and Procedural Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">On July 2,1979, defendant/appellant Cred-ithrift made a loan to Everett and Elizabeth Yoder. The Yoders executed a note for $2,508.90, payable to Credithrift, and signed a form pledging their household furnishings, goods and appliances as security for the loan. On July 23, 1979, Credithrift made a loan to Harry G. and Susan Marie Webber, who executed a note for $3,224.96 and signed a similar security agreement. The parties stipulated that each lien is a \u201cnonpossessory, nonpurchase-money security interest\u201d that arose after November 6, 1978 and before October 1, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-11\">The Webbers and Yoders subsequently filed petitions in bankruptcy on May 5,1980 and July 1, 1980 respectively. Each couple sought to avoid the Credithrift liens in their exempt household goods pursuant to \u00a7 522(f)(2)(A). Credithrift asserted that \u00a7 522(f)(2)(A) cannot be constitutionally applied in these cases because the security interests were perfected prior to the effective date of the Reform Act. The constitutional question was certified to the Attorney General of the United States, who, through the United States Attorney, intervened, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2403, in support of the constitutionality of the challenged provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-14\">On November 17, 1980 the bankruptcy court concluded in the Webber case that \u201c\u00a7 522(f)(2) is constitutional in so far as it applies to liens arising between November 6, 1978 and October 1, 1979, and the plaintiffs are entitled to the voiding of the defendant\u2019s lien on their household furnishings, household goods and appliances.\u201d <em>In re Webber, </em>7 B.R. 580, 586 (Bkrtcy.D.Or. 1980). A stipulated judgment was subsequently entered in the Yoder case allowing similar relief based upon the <em>Webber </em>decision. Both cases have come to this court on direct appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1293(b). In this court, the United States, in effect, represents the debtors/appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-15\">III. <em>Contentions of Parties</em></p>\n<p id=\"b819-16\">Appellant contends that (1) \u00a7 522(f)(2)(A) cannot be given retroactive effect because to do so would be manifestly unreasonable; (2) a creditor whose rights in specific property have attached prior to the effective date of the law may not be deprived of those rights by legislative enactment, and giving retroactive effect to \u00a7 522(f)(2) amounts to an unconstitutional taking of property under the holding in <em>Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford, </em>295 U.S. 555, 55 S.Ct. 854, 79 L.Ed. 1593 (1935); (3) the public cannot be considered to be \u201con notice\u201d of a statute until it is made effective and both parties were on notice of the effective date; and (4) the Fifth Amendment protects all property interests, whether real or personal, regardless of monetary value.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-17\">Appellee contends that (1) the bankruptcy law comports with due process because it is not so grossly unreasonable or arbitrary as to be incompatible with fundamental law; (2) because appellant was on notice of the contents of \u00a7 522(f)(2)(A) when the liens were perfected, there is no retroactive effect of constitutional dimension; (3) even if considered to be retroactive, application of \u00a7 522(f)(2)(A) is constitutional because it effectuates sound Congressional policy; (4) <em>Radford </em>has been severely limited by subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>quent case law and is inapplicable to this case; and (5) the Fifth Amendment does not protect ownership of these liens because they are not property interests of \u201csubstantial value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">IV. <em>Prior Court Decisions</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ama\">At the outset it may be noted that both the bankruptcy courts and the courts of appeal are divided with respect to the retroactive applicability of \u00a7 522(f)(2)(A). Bankruptcy courts in Oklahoma, Colorado, Oregon, Michigan, Washington, Kansas, and New Mexico have held that it cannot be applied to liens perfected before the Reform Act\u2019s enactment date.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This holding was followed by the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in <em>Rodrock v. Security Industrial Bank, </em>642 F.2d 1193 (10 Cir. 1981), <em>prob. jur. </em>noted, - U.S. -, 102 S.Ct. 969, 71 L.Ed.2d 108 (U.S.1981) and by the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in <em>In the Matter of: Willis R. Gifford and Jacqueline M. Gifford, </em>669 F.2d 468, 474, (7 Cir. 1982) <em>(\u201cGifford\u201d).</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Bankruptcy courts in Ohio, Utah and Wisconsin have held that \u00a7 522(f)(2)(A) may be applied to pre-enactment liens.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This holding was followed by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in <em>In re: Charles E. Ashe and Susan J. Ashe, t/a C &amp; S Fuel Service, Debtors, et al., </em>669 F.2d 105 (3 Cir. 1982) <em>(\u201cAshe\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b820-20\">Bankruptcy courts in Tennessee, Illinois, Wisconsin, Nevada (dealing with \u00a7 522(f)(1)\u2014judicial liens), Texas, Oregon, Colorado, Louisiana, Missouri, Kansas, Georgia and Ohio have held that \u00a7 522(f)(2)(A) may be applied to liens created after the Reform Act\u2019s enactment date but before its effective date, i.e., in the so called \u201cgap\u201d period.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Both <em>Ashe </em>and Gifford<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> impliedly support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>this holding, while <em>Rodrock </em>is equivocal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Courts in Michigan, Washington, Oklahoma, Colorado (dealing with \u00a7 522(f)(1) \u2014 judicial liens) Kansas and Florida have held that the effective date is controlling and that \u00a7 522(f)(2)(A) cannot be applied to liens vested before that date.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It will be noted that the bankruptcy courts in Colorado and Kansas are themselves divided. In <em>In Re Henderson, </em>10 B.R. 19 (Bkrtcy.N.D. Indiana 1980), the court ruled against giving retroactive effect to \u00a7 522 but left open the question of whether the controlling date was the enactment date or the effective date. Aside from what is implied in <em>Ashe </em>and <em>Gifford, </em>no appellate court has directly ruled on the applicability of \u00a7 522(f) to liens vested during the \u201cgap\u201d period.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">V. <em>Retroactive Effect</em></p>\n<p id=\"amp-dedup-0\">The significance of \u201clegislative intent\u201d in determining whether a statute may be applied retroactively was well stated in <em>Matter of Ward, </em>14 B.R. at 557-58:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-7\">A retroactive statute is one \u201cwhich takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws, or creates a new obligation, imposes a new duty or attaches a new disability, in respect to transactions or considerations already past.\u201d 16A Am.Jur.2d <em>Constitutional </em>Law \u00a7 661, at 641 (1979). As a general rule of construction, \u201c \u2018legislation must be considered as addressed to the future, not to the past ... [and] a retrospective operation will not be given to a statute which interferes with antecedent rights .. . unless such be the unequivocal and inflexible import of the terms, and the manifest intention of the legislature\u2019.\u201d <em>Greene v. United States, </em>376 U.S. 149, 160, 84 S.Ct. 615, 621, 11 L.Ed.2d 576 (1964) (quoting <em>Union Pac. R. Co. v. Laramie Stock Yards Co., </em>231 U.S. 190, 199, 34 S.Ct. 101, 102, 58 L.Ed. 179 (1913)). Thus, the issue whether section 522(f) has retroactive application turns on a determination of legislative intent. See <em>Hassett v. Welch, </em>303 U.S. 303, 58 S.Ct. 559, 82 L.Ed. 858 (1938). (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-16\">Each of the appellate courts which has considered \u00a7 522(f) has either expressly or implicitly ruled that Congress intended \u00a7 522(f) to apply to post enactment security interests. <em>Rodrock, </em>642 F.2d at 1196-97; <em>Ashe, supra; Gifford, </em>669 F.2d at 474 n.3. The bankruptcy courts are in general accord. As is exhaustively discussed in those cases, both the transition sections prescribed in Title IV of the Reform Act<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>the \u201cfresh start\u201d concept inherent in \u00a7 522<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> provide forceful argument favoring retroactivity. We agree that Congress intended \u00a7 522(f) to apply retroactively to security interests created before October 1, 1979. There remains for consideration, however, the crucial question of whether the provisions of \u00a7 522(f) could constitutionally be applied to a security interest which vested prior to the effective date of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">VI. <em>Constitutionality</em></p>\n<p id=\"AoS\">(a) <em>Power of Congress</em></p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">The Constitution expressly confers on the Congress the power to establish uniform laws on bankruptcy throughout the nation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Generally, this authority \u201cincludes the power to discharge the debtor from his contracts and legal liabilities as well as to distribute his property.\u201d <em>Hanover National Bank v. Moyses, </em>186 U.S. 181, 188, 22 S.Ct. 857, 860, 46 L.Ed. 1113 (1902). Thus, bankruptcy legislation has traditionally operated to affect creditors\u2019 interests which vested prior to the effective date of the legislation. See <em>Wright v. Union Central Life Ins. Co., </em>304 U.S. 502, 516, 58 S.Ct. 1025, 1033, 82 L.Ed. 1490 (1938).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Unlike the states, Congress is not prohibited from passing laws that impair contractual obligations.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Continental Bank v. Rock Island Ry., </em>294 U.S. 648, 680, 55 S.Ct. 595, 608, 79 L.Ed. 1110 (1935). See also <em>Kuehner </em>v. <em>Irving Trust Co., </em>299 U.S. 445, 452, 57 S.Ct. 298, 301, 81 L.Ed. 340 (1937). In fact, the very essence of bankruptcy laws is the modification or impairment of contractual obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-10\">There is, however, \u201cas respects the exertion of the bankruptcy power, a significant difference between a property interest and a contract, since the Constitution does not forbid impairment of the obligation of the latter.\u201d <em>Kuehner, </em>299 U.S. at 451-52, 57 S.Ct. at 301. But the \u201cbankruptcy power, like the other great substantive powers of Congress, is subject to the Fifth Amendment.\u201d <em>Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford, </em>295 U.S. 555, 589, 55 S.Ct. 854, 863, 79 L.Ed. 1593 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-11\">(b) <em>Radford</em></p>\n<p id=\"b822-12\">The split in the case law with respect to the constitutional issue presented is due in large part to divergent interpretations of <em>Radford. </em>In <em>Radford </em>the Court held that the Frazier-Lemke Act was unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment. The Act, an amendment to the Bankruptcy Code, was emergency legislation designed to provide relief for insolvent farmers by permitting them to obtain from the bankruptcy court a five-year stay of state foreclosure proceedings while paying a fair annual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>rental which would be divided among secured and unsecured creditors. At the end of the five year period the mortgage could be extinguished by the payment of the appraised price at the beginning or end of the period at the option of the mortgagee. The Act specifically provided that it was to have retroactive effect. In concluding that the Frazier-Lemke Act was unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment, the Court recognized that under the bankruptcy power the court may discharge a debtor\u2019s personal obligations, but held that it could not take for the benefit of the debtor substantive rights in specific property acquired by the creditor prior to the Act.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">In <em>Ashe, supra, </em>the court concludes that <em>Radford </em>was effectively limited, if not tacitly overruled by <em>Wright v. Vinton Branch of the Mountain Bank of Roanoke, </em>300 U.S. 440, 57 S.Ct. 556, 81 L.Ed. 736 (1937), and <em>Helvering v. Griffiths, </em>318 U.S. 371, 400-401 &amp; n. 52, 63 S.Ct. 636, 651-652 n. 52, 87 L.Ed. 843 (1943). 669 F.2d at 474. On the other hand, the court in <em>Rodrock </em>held that while <em>Wright </em>and other cases may well refine the rule of <em>Radford, </em>\u201cthey do not destroy the fundamental teaching of <em>Radford </em>that Congress may not under the bankruptcy power completely take for the benefit of a debtor rights in specific property previously acquired by a creditor.\u201d 642 F.2d at 1198<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The court in <em>Gifford </em>agreed with the holding in <em>Rodrock. </em>669 F.2d at 472.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-15\">(c) Notice of Enactment</p>\n<p id=\"b823-16\">While <em>Radford </em>may still be controlling as to property rights which vested prior to the enactment of new bankruptcy legislation, we conclude that it is inapplicable to the issue considered here. Justice Brandeis carefully noted that while the bankruptcy legislation considered in <em>Radford </em>was unconstitutional, \u201c[t]he power over property pledged as security <em>after the date of the Act </em>may be greater than over property pledged before.\u201d <em>Radford, </em>295 U.S. at 589, 55 S.Ct. at 863 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-17\">Here the liens were acquired approximately eight months after the passage of the Reform Act and approximately four months before its effective date. Obviously both parties had notice of the enactment and the provisions of the Act with respect to when its various sections and subsections would take effect. Whether the enactment date or effective date is controlling under the circumstances of these cases presents a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>close question. It is not surprising that the bankruptcy courts have reached different conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">The bankruptcy court in these cases held that the retroactive effects of \u00a7 522(f)(2) are not so unreasonable or arbitrary as to deny due process; and that \u201cIt is not unreasonable to impute to credit companies and their attorneys the knowledge and understanding of a new law <em>after </em>that law has been enacted.\u201d 7 B.R. at 584. The court concluded accordingly that there should be a distinction between cases where the lien arose before November 6, 1978, and those where it arose \u201cbetween the enactment and effective dates of the Bankruptcy Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">Typical of the cases holding that debtors are not entitled to avoid liens acquired before the effective date of October 1,1979, is <em>Schulte v. Beneficial Finance of Kansas, </em>8 B.R. 12 (Bkrtcy.D.Kan.1980). The decision in that case contains an analysis of prior cases involving the effect of notice of the passage of legislation with a postponed effective date.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The court concluded that where a statute itself \u201cschedules a specific effective date, it is that postponed date and not the earlier date of enactment which controls.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">Although a close question is presented, we agree with the bankruptcy court in the instant cases that it is \u201cnot unreasonable to impute to credit companies and their attorneys the knowledge and understanding of a new law <em>after </em>that law has been enacted.\u201d When Credithrift made the loans in July, 1979, it should have been fully aware that the exemption provisions of \u00a7 522 would become effective on October 1, 1979, and that any bankruptcy filed subsequent to that date could result in an avoidance of their liens on the exempt property. The bankruptcy court properly distinguished between cases where the liens arose before the enactment date and those arising after the enactment date where the creditor had knowledge of the prospective exemption provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b818-6\">. The purpose of Section 522(f) of the Bankruptcy Code is stated in the following excerpt from the House of Representatives Report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-7\">In addition, the bill gives the debtor certain rights not available under current law with respect to exempt property. The debtor may void any judicial lien on exempt property, and any nonpurchase-money security interest in certain exempt property such as household goods. The first right allows the debtor to undo the actions of creditors that bring legal action against the debtor shortly before bankruptcy. Bankruptcy exists to provide relief for an overburdened debtor. If a creditor beats the debtor into court, the debtor is nevertheless entitled to his exemptions. The second right will be of more significance for the average consumer debtor. Frequently, creditors lending money to a consumer debt- or take a security interest in all of the debt- or\u2019s belongings, and obtain a waiver by the debtor of his exemptions. In most of these cases, the debtor is unaware of the consequences of the forms he signs. The creditor\u2019s experience provides him with a substantial . advantage. If the debtor encounters financial difficulty, creditors often use threats of repossession of all of the debtor\u2019s household goods as a means of obtaining payment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-14\">In fact, were the creditor to carry through on his threat and foreclose on the property, he would receive little, for household goods have little resale value. They are far more valuable to the creditor in the debtor\u2019s hands, as they provide a credible basis for the threat, because the replacement costs of the goods are generally high. Thus, creditors rarely repossess, and debtors, ignorant of the creditors\u2019 true intentions, are coerced into payments they simply cannot afford to make.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-15\">The exemption provision allows the debtor, after bankruptcy has been filed, and creditor collection techniques have been stayed, to undo the consequences of a contract of adhesion, signed in ignorance, by permitting the invalidation of nonpurchase money security interests in household goods. Such security interests have too often been used by overreaching creditors. The bill eliminates any unfair advantage creditors have. H.R.Rep.

As noted in <em>Rodrock:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-19\">Cases filed in bankruptcy court shortly after the October 1, 1979, effective date of the Reform Act would necessarily involve creditors\u2019 interests which came into being prior to the effective date of the Reform Act. As of October 1, 1979, the old Bankruptcy Act stood repealed. So, if, in a bankruptcy case filed on or after October 1, 1979, the Reform Act does not apply to creditors\u2019 interests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>which came into existence prior to October 1, 1979, then there would be <em>no </em>bankruptcy law governing the particular matter at hand.

If section 522(f) were to apply prospectively only, then the abuses intrinsic in nonpur-chase-money security interests in household possessions, as congressionally discerned, would linger for an indefinite period after Congress had acted to remedy the problem. Moreover, prospective application would effectively delimit a debtor\u2019s entitlement to exemptions which would otherwise be realized through lien avoidance. Thus, debtors filing petitions on or after October 1, 1979, which in the majority of proceedings would relate to debts acquired prior to the Reform Act\u2019s effective date, would be denied the benefit of a \u201cfresh start\u201d to the full extent intended by Congress. It is evident, therefore, that without the retroactive operation of section 522, including the lien avoidance authority prescribed in section 522(f), the fresh start concept, one of the central policy aspects of the Reform Act, would be significantly diluted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALu\"><em>Matter of Ward, </em>14 B.R. at 559.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b822-14\">. \u201cThe Congress shall have Power ...

Appellees argue that even assuming its continued vitality, <em>Radford </em>is limited to protecting interests of \u201csubstantial value\u201d in real property. A lien is clearly an interest in property, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(28), and for Constitutional purposes, it makes no difference whether liens are on personal or real property. Cf. <em>Armstrong v. United States, </em>364 U.S. 40, 44, 80 S.Ct. 1563, 1566, 4 L.Ed.2d 1554 (1960); <em>Kuehner, supra. </em>It is true that Congress noted the typically small market value of the exempted household effects, see note 1, para. 3, <em>supra, </em>and several courts have based their decisions to apply \u00a7 522(f) retroactively on their conclusion that creditors were not losing property rights of significant monetary value. <em>E.g., Matter of Rutherford, 4 </em>B.R. 510, 512-13 (Bkrtcy.S.D.W.D.Ohio 1980); <em>In Re Ambrose, 4 </em>B.R. 395, 400 (Bkrtcy.N.D.Ohio 1980). As noted in <em>Gifford, </em>however, \u201cit is the value of that right which is at issue, not the worth of the collateral.\u201d 669 F.2d at 473. We agree that a \u201cproperty right is of value regardless of the worth of the object in which it is held, and is protected from governmental appropriation by the taking clause of the Fifth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id.; In Re Hoops, </em>3 B.R. 635, 639-40 (Bkrtcy.D.Colo.1980), <em>aff\u2019d., </em>642 F.2d 1193 (10 Cir. 1981), <em>prob. jur. </em>noted, - U.S. -, 102 S.Ct. 969, 71 L.Ed.2d 108 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b824-8\">.

The 1978 Bankruptcy Reform Act exemption, which makes certain liens unenforceable after the effective date of the Act, constitutionally can be applied to a lien created after the statute was enacted but before it became effective. I write separately only because I think the majority makes the problem harder than it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-11\">Congress clearly intended this result. The statute unambiguously provides for it. At the time this lien was created, the creditor had full notice that under the new law the lien would be unenforceable in the event the debtor filed for bankruptcy after the new Act became effective. In my view, application of the statute to liens created after the statute was passed simply does not present a substantial question, much less a close one. <em>See, e.g., </em>Note, <em>Bankruptcy</em>\u2014Section <em>522(f) of the 1978 Cod</em>e\u2014Con<em>stitutionality of its Application to Security Interests Pre-Dating Enactment of the Code, </em>27 Wayne L.Rev. 1281, 1288-90, 1293, 1299, 1302 n.143 (1981); Note, <em>Constitutionality of Retroactive Lien Avoidance Under Bankruptcy Code Section 522(f), </em>94 Harv.L.Rev. 1616, 1617 n.10 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-12\">Congress could have made the Act effective from the date of its passage. Had it done so, application of the exemption provisions to this post-enactment lien would raise no possible question of retroactive interference with property rights. Instead, Congress gave some lead time for the public to gain familiarity with the new Act and to adjust debtor/creditor practice accordingly. The creditor can hardly claim to have been prejudiced by Congressional leniency in deferring the effective date.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
