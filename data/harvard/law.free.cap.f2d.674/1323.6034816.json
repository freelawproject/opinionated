Because we hold that the use of trained canines in this case was improper absent a showing of \u201cfounded suspicion,\u201d we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-13\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-14\">As appellant Beale was convicted in a bench trial on stipulated facts, we consider the facts, as stipulated and as adduced at the suppression hearing, to be undisputed. The following rendition is gleaned from the trial \u201crecord,\u201d in the light most favorable to the Government. <em>See United States v. Nelson, </em>419 F.2d 1237, 1241 (9th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-15\">On April 17, 1980, Detective Rick Berks of the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Department was assigned to the airport detail at the Fort Lauderdale (Florida) Airport. This detail, which Detective Berks had performed for at least two years, is responsible for the \u201cinterdiction\u201d or interception of narcotics contraband passing through the airport. Also on duty were Deputy Sheriff Larry Burk and a trained canine, \u201cNick.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AnjG\">Berks observed two male Caucasians, subsequently identified as John Beale and Joseph Pulvano, exit a taxicab in front of the National Airlines terminal. Beale and Pul-vano checked three pieces of luggage with a \u201cskycap\u201d and then entered the terminal together. Upon reaching a security checkpoint inside, they separated and obtained their seating assignments from the ticket counter independently. They both possessed first-class tickets to San Diego, with a change of planes in Houston. Berks ascertained that Beale\u2019s suitcase bore an identification tag indicating a New Jersey address. After separately departing from the ticket counter, Beale and Pulvano entered the National Airlines boarding area and sat down together.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-16\">Detective Berks, suspicious of the foregoing behavior,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> approached Beale and Pulva-no, identified himself, explained that they were not under arrest, and requested that they answer a few questions and produce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1329\">*1329</page-number>some identification. Beale complied, producing his New Jersey driver\u2019s license. Pulvano, who appeared very nervous, stated that his identification was in his luggage, which he had just checked. Berks then asked the pair if they had ever been arrested. Pulvano said he had been arrested six years earlier on a narcotics charge. Berks thanked them for their cooperation and walked away. About five minutes later, Pulvano walked over to Berks and inquired if anything was wrong. Berks told Pulva-no, who exhibited signs of abnormal anxiety \u2014 trembling hands, cracking voice, palpable agitation \u2014 that there was no problem at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-5\">Berks proceeded to the baggage area, where he and Deputy Burk had \u201cNick\u201d sniff or smell the vicinity of the suspects\u2019 bags. \u201cNick,\u201d an experienced and reliable drug detector, \u201calerted\u201d on Beale\u2019s suitcase. As Beale and Pulvano had already boarded their flight to Houston, Berks contacted the Houston Police Department\u2019s airport detail and ran a computer check on the pair. Pul-vano, the computer check revealed, had been arrested and convicted of possessing a large quantity of cocaine in an Atlanta airport approximately six months earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-6\">Police officers in Houston kept the suspects and their luggage under surveillance as they changed planes in Houston. They deplaned separately and appeared as though they were not traveling together; they were the last two passengers to board the plane to San Diego. Agents in San Diego were alerted to the suspects\u2019 arrival.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-7\">When the plane arrived in San Diego, Beale and Pulvano, each carrying a shoulder bag, exited quickly and behaved warily. Beale did not go to the luggage area to claim his bags, but left the terminal and immediately attempted to board a taxicab. He was accosted by agents and, when asked about his luggage, asserted that he had lost the claim checks. While Pulvano was waiting inside the terminal at the baggage claim area, a United States Customs Service Officer and a trained canine \u201cDuster\u201d briefly intercepted the suspects\u2019 luggage. \u201cDuster,\u201d an experienced and reliable narcotics detector, \u201calerted\u201d on Beale\u2019s suitcase. When Pulvano retrieved the bags \u2014 including Beale\u2019s \u2014 and started to leave the airport, he too was accosted. \u201cDuster\u201d later \u201calerted\u201d on Beale\u2019s shoulder bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-9\">Based on a sworn affidavit containing this information, the officers obtained a search warrant for Beale\u2019s suitcase and shoulder bag. Approximately 961 grams of cocaine were discovered in the shoulder bag and approximately 137 grams of marijuana were discovered in the suitcase.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-10\">Beale\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence obtained in these searches was denied. On the foregoing stipulated facts Beale was convicted of possession with intent to distribute and conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance\u2014 cocaine \u2014 in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-12\">ISSUES ON APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-13\">The only issue not subject to stipulation is the constitutional propriety of the principal police encounters with Beale and Pulvano, <em>i.c., </em>their questioning in the Fort Lauder-dale Airport, the \u201csniffing expedition\u201d of their luggage in Fort Lauderdale, and their ultimate arrest and the search of their bags in San Diego.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-14\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-16\">Beale contends that the officer\u2019s initial approach and non-custodial questioning of him and his companion constituted a \u201cseizure\u201d or detention under the Fourth Amendment, requiring founded suspicion or probable cause. The District Court, however, concluded otherwise<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and we agree. The suspects\u2019 mobility was not impaired; the situation was non-coercive; Berks did not request that they follow him or otherwise alter their destination, schedule, or location; the questions were routine and brief, and in an atmosphere not dominated by law enforcement personnel; and the sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1330\">*1330</page-number>pects agreed to answer Berks\u2019 queries \u201cin a spirit of apparent cooperation.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Sibron </em>v. <em>New York, </em>392 U.S. 40, 63, 88 S.Ct. 1889, 1902, 20 L.Ed.2d 917 (1968); <em>United States v. Fry, </em>622 F.2d 1218, 1219-21 (5th Cir. 1980) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Elmore, </em>595 F.2d 1036, 1041-42 (5th Cir. 1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>447 U.S. 910, 100 S.Ct. 2998, 64 L.Ed.2d 861 (1980); 3 W. La Fave, Search and Seizure: A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment 48-55 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-4\">Thus, we need not consider whether \u201cfounded\u201d or \u201carticulable\u201d suspicion existed at that time. <em>Cf. United States v. Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 64 L.Ed.2d 497 (1980); <em>Brown v. Texas, </em>443 U.S. 47, 99 S.Ct. 2637, 61 L.Ed.2d 357 (1979); Adams v. <em>Williams, </em>407 U.S. 143, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 32 L.Ed.2d 612 (1972); <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968); <em>United States v. Corbin, </em>662 F.2d 1066, 1068-71 (4th Cir. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-6\">Beale next contends that even if the initial encounter was not an unlawful seizure, the use of the trained canine \u201cNick\u201d to \u201cconduct a sniffing expedition\u201d of his luggage in the baggage area of the Fort Laud-erdale Airport constituted an illegal search. If the \u201csniffing expedition\u201d were an illegal search, the Government would face a difficult, perhaps impossible, burden of showing that this did not taint or infect the ultimate search of Beale\u2019s luggage in San Diego. <em>See Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 484-88, 83 S.Ct. 407, 415-17, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-7\">Unfortunately, the parties have treated the \u201cdog sniffing\u201d issue in absolute terms. Beale argues, for instance, that the primary issue is whether the use of \u201cNick\u201d to sniff his suitcase was a search requiring probable cause. The District Court, in the suppression hearing, held that the use of trained canines in this case was not a search and, hence, that no showing of suspicion was required.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Similarly, the Government argues on appeal that \u201cit is well-established that the use of trained dogs to sniff the exteriors of containers, including luggage, is not a search in violation of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d Brief of Appellee at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-11\">Not only do these arguments oversimplify our holding in <em>United States v. Solis, </em>536 F.2d 880, 882 (9th Cir. 1976), they also misapprehend the importance of a person\u2019s privacy interest in personal luggage. <em>See Arkansas </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>442 U.S. 753, 762, 764-65, 99 S.Ct. 2586, 2592, 2593, 61 L.Ed.2d 235 (1979); <em>United States v. Chadwick, </em>433 U.S. 1, 11, 13, 97 S.Ct. 2476, 2483, 2484, 53 L.Ed.2d 538 (1977). <em>See also United States v. Allen, </em>644 F.2d 749 (9th Cir. 1980); <em>United States v. Homberg, </em>546 F.2d 1350, 1354-55 (9th Cir. 1976) (Ely, J., dissenting), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 940, 97 S.Ct. 2654, 53 L.Ed.2d 258 (1977); <em>United States v. Moore, </em>483 F.2d 1361, 1363 64 (9th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-12\">Focusing on the precise physical nature of the canine sniffing obscures, we believe, the underlying Fourth Amendment interests. The Government emphasizes that only the \u201cexterior of containers\u201d were sniffed. Likewise, the Government relies on <em>United States v. Bronstein, </em>521 F.2d 459, 461-63 (2nd Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>424 U.S. 918, 96 S.Ct. 1121, 47 L.Ed.2d 324 (1976), to counter Beale\u2019s argument that the use of trained canines is as intrusive under the Fourth Amendment as a magnetometer. <em>Bronstein, </em>however, like the earlier <em>United States v. Fulero, </em>498 F.2d 748, 749 (D.C.Cir. 1974) (per curiam), is a <em>pre-Chadwick </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-13\">We seriously doubt whether the reasoning employed in <em>Bronstein </em>and <em>Fulero </em>is still sound. In <em>Bronstein </em>the Second Circuit stated that \u201c[t]here can be no reasonable expectation of privacy when one transports baggage by plane, particularly today when the menace to public safety by the skyjacker and the passage of dangerous or hazardous freight compels continuing scrutiny of passengers and their impedimenta.\u201d 521 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1331\">*1331</page-number>F.2d at 462. By applying <em>Chadwick </em>to transcend and limit the \u201cautomobile exception\u201d to the warrant requirement in <em>Arkansas v. Sanders, </em>442 U.S. at 763 65, 99 S.Ct. at 2592-93, the Supreme Court seems to have rejected the <em>Bronstein </em>reasoning.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The D.C. Circuit\u2019s characterization as \u201cfrivolous\u201d of the <em>Fulero </em>appellant\u2019s argument that a canine\u2019s sniffing of personal luggage was an unconstitutional intrusion into the lockers seems similarly flawed. 498 F.2d at 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-5\">Our analysis must begin with the premise that \u201cthe Fourth Amendment protects people, not places.\u201d <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 351, 88 S.Ct. 507, 511, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967). \u201c[M]ore particularly, it protects people from unreasonable government intrusions into their legitimate expectations of privacy.\u201d <em>United States v. Chadwick, </em>433 U.S. at 7, 97 S.Ct. at 2481. The protection of the Fourth Amendment is invoked when the individual claiming it had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the invaded place. <em>Rakas v. Illinois, </em>439 U.S. 128, 143, 99 S.Ct. 421, 430, 58 L.Ed.2d 387 (1978). The Supreme Court has recognized that \u201cluggage is a common repository for one\u2019s personal effects, and therefore is <em>inevitably </em>associated with the expectation of privacy.\u201d <em>Arkansas v. Sanders, </em>442 U.S. at 762, 99 S.Ct. at 2592 (emphasis added). \u201c[T]he critical factor relied on [in <em>Arkansas v. Sanders] </em>was the objective nature of the suitcase as personal luggage, <em>i.e., </em>the inherent nature of the container itself rather than the behavior of its owner.\u201d <em>United States v. Cleary, </em>656 F.2d 1302, 1304 (9th Cir. 1981), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>50 U.S.L.W. 3466 (U.S. Nov. 20, 1981) (No. 81-953).</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-7\">Our inquiry, then, is whether the use of independent monitoring devices, such as drug-trained canines, to detect the presence of contraband within personal luggage<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> is an invasion of the owner\u2019s \u201cinevitable\u201d and \u201cinherent\u201d privacy interest in the contents therein.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1332\">*1332</page-number>In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Solis, </em>536 F.2d 880 (9th Cir. 1976), we avoided characterizing the use of trained canines in terms of conventional detection devices. Instead, we applied a general reasonableness standard. <em>See id. </em>at 881-83. <em>Solis </em>noted, without drawing an analogy, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1344-4\">Generally evidence acquired by unaided human senses from without a protected area is not considered an illegal invasion of privacy, but is usable under doctrines of plain view or open view or the equivalent. Odors so detected may furnish evidence of probable cause of \u201cmost persuasive character,\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>333 U.S. 10, 13, 68 S.Ct. 367, 368, 92 L.Ed. 436 (1948) ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1344-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 881. Looking at the totality of the circumstances, we held in <em>Solis </em>that Customs Officers\u2019 use of trained \u201cdrug dogs\u201d to sniff a semi-trailer parked on the lot of a gas station was reasonable and not a prohibited Fourth Amendment search for the following reasons: \u201cThe agents had a founded suspicion based on the partial corroboration of the informant\u2019s statements\u201d; the semi-trailer was parked in an area open to the public; \u201c[t]here was no invasion of the \u2018curtilage\u2019 \u201d; and \u201c[t]he investigation was not indiscriminate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 882.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-7\">Beale\u2019s privacy interest in the contents of his suitcase was far greater than Solis\u2019 expectation of privacy in his semi-trailer. <em>See Arkansas v. Sanders, </em>442 U.S. at 761-66, 99 S.Ct. at 2591-94; <em>United States v. Chadwick, </em>433 U.S. at 11, 13, 97 S.Ct. at 2483, 2484; <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Cardwell v. Lewis, </em>417 U.S. 583, 589-92, 94 S.Ct. 2464, 2468 70, 41 L.Ed.2d 325 (1974); <em>Carroll v. United States, </em>267 U.S. 132, 153, 45 S.Ct. 280, 285, 69 L.Ed. 543 (1925). In fact, the Supreme Court has elevated personal luggage to the Fourth Amendment status accorded private residences:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1344-11\">No less than one who locks the doors of his home against intruders, one who safeguards his personal possessions [by locking them in a piece of luggage] is due the protection of the Fourth Amendment Warrant Clause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1344-12\"><em>Chadwick, </em>433 U.S. at 11, 97 S.Ct. at 2483.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a4m-dedup-0\">Whether arrested in a hotel lobby, an airport, a railroad terminal, or on a public street, as here, the owner has the right to expect that the contents of his luggage will not, without his consent, be exposed on demand of the police.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1344-13\"><em>Arkansas v. Sanders, </em>442 U.S. at 767, 99 S.Ct. at 2594 (Burger, C. J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-14\">This distinction between <em>Solis </em>and the present case, while relevant, is not dispositive. Had Detective Berks, utilizing only his own natural senses, been able to detect the odor of controlled substances emanating from Beale\u2019s suitcase, this would not have been a Fourth Amendment intrusion. <em>See United States v. Solis, </em>536 F.2d at 881. \u201cWhat a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection.\u201d <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. at 351, 88 S.Ct. at 511.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1333\">*1333</page-number>The superficially appealing analogy between the use of a canine\u2019s acute sense of smell and, for instance, mechanical enhancement devices such as flashlights<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> or binoculars<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> is, upon reflection, inapt. A trained canine\u2019s sense of smell is more than eight times as sensitive as a human\u2019s. <em>See United States v. Solis, </em>536 F.2d at 881. Moreover, the dog does not amplify its handler\u2019s perception; it is an independent detection device, alerting the officer to information he would have been utterly unable to detect with his own senses. Nick\u2019s nose did not enhance Detective Berks\u2019 senses; it replaced them.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Accord, United States v. Bronstein, </em>521 F.2d at 464 (Mansfield, J., concurring); Comment, <em>United States v. Solis: Have the Government\u2019s Supersniffers Come Down With a Case of Constitutional Nasal Congestion?, </em>13 San Diego L.Rev. 410, 423 (1976). Thus, the use of trained canines to monitor the contents of personal luggage cannot be analyzed as a variant of human plain view or plain smell. <em>Cf. United States v. Leazar, </em>460 F.2d 982, 983-85 (9th Cir. 1972) (police officer\u2019s olfactory detection of marijuana odor in car created probable cause for arrest). <em>Accord, United States v.

(per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>413 U.S. 920, 93 S.Ct. 3063, 37 L.Ed.2d 1041 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-14\">The molecules of contraband emanating from the interior of luggage are so subtle and incapable of human perception that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1334\">*1334</page-number>canine\u2019s detection of them constitutes an intrusion into the owner\u2019s privacy interest in the contents of the container. <em>See Hernandez v. United States, </em>353 F.2d 624, 626 (9th Cir. 1965), <em>cert. denied, </em>384 U.S. 1008, 86 S.Ct. 1972, 16 L.Ed.2d 1021 (1966). The \u201ctrespassory\u201d or \u201cphysical penetration\u201d mode of Fourth Amendment analysis was abandoned in <em>Katz v. United States </em>in favor of a normative \u201cexpectation of privacy\u201d standard. 389 U.S. at 352-53, 88 S.Ct. at 511-12; <em>see Smith v. Maryland, </em>442 U.S. 735, 740-41 n.5, 99 S.Ct. 2577, 2580 n.5, 61 L.Ed.2d 220 (1979); <em>United States v. Taborda, </em>635 F.2d 131, 136-39 (2nd Cir. 1980); <em>United States v. Davis, </em>482 F.2d 893, 905 (9th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-4\">To paraphrase <em>Katz, </em>what Beale sought to exclude when he locked his suitcase was not only the intruding human eye \u2014 it was also the intruding canine nose. One who reposes his personal effects, including contraband, in a locked suitcase is surely entitled to assume that a trained canine will not broadcast its incriminating contents to the authorities.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>See </em>389 U.S. at 352, 88 S.Ct. at 512. <em>Cf. Stanley v. Georgia, </em>394 U.S. 557, 565, 89 S.Ct. 1243, 1248, 22 L.Ed.2d 542 (1969) (\u201cWhatever may be the justifications for other statutes regulating [, <em>inter alia, </em>the sale and purchase of] obscenity, we do not think they reach into the privacy of one\u2019s own home.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 571-72, 89 S.Ct. at 1251 (Stewart, J., concurring) (reaching same conclusion on Fourth Amendment grounds).</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-5\">However, we do not agree with Beale that the use of drug-detecting canines is identical to the use of a magnetometer, x-ray machine, or other electronic or mechanical surveillance device, invoking the full rigors of the Fourth Amendment rubric. While x-ray scans and the use of magnetometers are \u201csearches\u201d subject to the full requirements of the Fourth Amendment, <em>see United States v. Henry, </em>615 F.2d 1223, 1227-28 (9th Cir. 1980), we find the use of drug dogs sufficiently distinct and less intrusive to warrant a different treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-9\">Drug-detecting canines may be \u201cutilized with minimal invasion of privacy.\u201d <em>United States v.

While the use of independent electronic or mechanical detection devices constitutes a search, the corollary is not necessarily true in the case of sense-enhancing devices. Generally, we have limited our exemption of the use of sense-enhancing devices from the strictures of the Fourth Amendment to cases in which ordinary, commercially available devices, which citizens might expect members of the general public as well as the law enforcement community to possess, are employed <em>and </em>their use occurs in a location from which the ordinary citizens might otherwise observe the property or activity.
