Following a bench trial, the court concluded that although one of the grounds of Avery\u2019s discharge was arguably impermissible, the presence of another, permissible, ground rendered the termination lawful. Accordingly, the court entered judgment for the defendants. The district court erred by holding that the mere presence of a permissible ground for Avery\u2019s discharge rendered the discharge lawful. On the record before it, the court was required to enter judgment for Avery. We therefore vacate the judgment of the district court and direct the entry of judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-21\">Jean Avery, a black woman, taught remedial .reading at Shades Cahaba Elementary School in Homewood City, Alabama, from 1972 until her discharge on February 8, 1977. A written policy of the Homewood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>City Board of Education (the Board) required teachers who became pregnant so to inform the Superintendent of Education (the Superintendent) no later than the fourth month of pregnancy (the notice rule). In mid-November, 1976, Avery, who was not married, informed her principal that she was expecting to give birth in late December. The principal commented that Avery was in violation of the notice rule and instructed her to inform the Superintendent of her pregnancy, which Avery did.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Avery and the Superintendent, Dr. French, discussed Avery\u2019s situation in early December, 1976. According to Dr. French\u2019s testimony, he emphasized Avery\u2019s violation of the notice rule. According to Avery, Dr. French urged her to resign because of the \u201cmoral issue\u201d of conception out of wedlock.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">In any event, Dr. French notified Avery by letter of December 15, 1976, that the Board would meet to determine whether to cancel her contract for three reasons: insubordination, neglect of duty, and immorality. As Superintendent, Dr. French was authorized to recommend Avery\u2019s dismissal, and the three grounds stated in the December 15 letter were charges he would be bringing before the Board. As Dr. French testified, both \u201cinsubordination\u201d and \u201cneglect of duty\u201d referred to Avery\u2019s violation of the notice rule, and \u201cimmorality\u201d referred to her pregnancy out of wedlock.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">On February 8, 1977, the Board voted to terminate Avery\u2019s employment immediately, and instructed Dr. French so to inform Avery. Dr. French did so by letter of February 11,1977, specifying no reasons for the discharge. At trial, however, Dr. French, who recorded and transcribed the Board\u2019s deliberations as its secretary, testified that the reasons for the decision to dismiss Avery were the three grounds specified in the December 15 letter. The decision of the Board was affirmed by the Alabama State Tenure Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">Avery sued the Board, Dr. French, and the Board members (collectively appellees), alleging that her discharge violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq. </em>(1976); Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681 et seq. (1976); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 (1976); and, because it deprived her of rights guaranteed by the equal protection and due process clauses of the fourteenth amendment, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1976). She sought reinstatement with back pay, tenure status, lost benefits, declaratory and injunctive relief, and attorney\u2019s fees. Underlying each legal theory in the complaint was the premise that the Board unlawfully based its decision to dismiss Avery on her immoral conception of a child out of wedlock. Avery has at no time claimed that the notice rule is unlawful either facially or as applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-13\">The district court found that Avery\u2019s employment had been terminated in part for immorality and acknowledged that a discharge for that reason might be unconstitutional. However, the court found that it was not necessary to reach the issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWe\">Immorality was only one of the grounds for termination. Defendants contend that the plaintiff\u2019s employment was also terminated on the grounds of insubordination or neglect of duty in not reporting her pregnancy. Clearly she did not comply with the school rules with respect to reporting. . . . The notice rule ... is reasonable, and the School Board was justified in terminating her for this refusal. That being the case, the court finds it unnecessary to reach the constitutional issue and the other issues raised by plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-15\">The district court held in effect that, without regard to the immorality charge, Avery\u2019s dismissal was lawful because it was based in part on a permissible ground. This holding contravened the standards of proof and causation mandated by the Supreme Court for mixed-motive discharge cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>such as this one. In <em>Mt. Healthy City School Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, </em>429 U.S. 274, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977), a teacher, who had previously been involved in an altercation with another teacher, an argument with school cafeteria employees, and incidents in which he swore at and made obscene gestures to students, communicated to a radio station the substance of a memorandum from his principal relating to teacher dress and appearance. The radio station announced the adoption of the dress code as a news item. Thereafter, the school board advised the teacher that he would not be rehired, citing his lack of tact in handling professional matters, with specific reference to the radio station and obscene gesture incidents. Claiming that the discharge violated his first and fourteenth amendment rights, the teacher sought reinstatement and damages in a suit against the school board. The district court concluded that the communication to the radio station was protected by the first amendment, and that because it had played a substantial part in the decision to discharge the teacher, he was entitled to reinstatement with back pay. The court of appeals affirmed. On certiorari, the Supreme Court vacated the judgment of the court of appeals and remanded the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">The Court concluded that the fact that constitutionally protected conduct played a substantial part in the termination decision did not necessarily indicate a constitutional violation justifying remedial action. 429 U.S. at 285, 97 S.Ct. at 575. Rather, the proper test would protect against the invasion of constitutional rights without commanding consequences not necessary to the assurance of those rights:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-5\">Initially, ... the burden was properly placed upon [the. plaintiff] to show that his conduct was constitutionally protected, and that this conduct was a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d \u2014 or to put it in other words, that it was a \u201cmotivating factor\u201d in the Board\u2019s decision not to rehire him. [Plaintiff] having carried that burden, however, the District Court should have gone on to determine whether the Board had shown by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have reached the same decision as to [plaintiff\u2019s] reemployment even in the absence of the protected conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 287, 97 S.Ct. at 576 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">The framework of proof established in <em>Mt. Healthy </em>applies to Avery\u2019s constitutional claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The burden was initially on Avery to show that her conduct was constitutionally protected and was a substantial or a motivating factor in the Board\u2019s decision to discharge her. We assume, <em>arguen-do, </em>that Avery\u2019s out of wedlock pregnancy was constitutionally protected. The district court found that the pregnancy was one of the reasons for Avery\u2019s discharge; the ap-pellees did not dispute at trial that a motivating factor in Avery\u2019s discharge was immorality, and do not challenge the district court\u2019s finding to that effect on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">Having found that Avery had carried her initial burden, the district court should have gone on to determine whether the appellees had proven by a preponderance of the evidence that they would have discharged Avery even in the absence of her out of wedlock pregnancy. Since the court instead held that the other, unchallenged, ground for Avery\u2019s dismissal rendered the Board\u2019s decision lawful, the district court\u2019s judgment must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-12\">Having concluded that the district court\u2019s application of the wrong framework of proof caused it to neglect an essential factual inquiry, our usual course would be to remand the case to the district court for that inquiry. Having thoroughly reviewed the record, however, we are convinced that the district court could not permissibly find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>that the appellees proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the Board would have discharged Avery even absent her out of wedlock pregnancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The appellees insist that the record shows that Avery\u2019s violation of the notice rule was a substantial factor in the Board\u2019s decision to discharge her. This is correct, but irrelevant; the appellees\u2019 burden was to prove not that their decision was substantially motivated by that violation, but rather that Avery would have been dismissed even in the absence of her out of wedlock pregnancy. The record includes no evidence whatever to permit that inference. Dr. French charged Avery with immorality when he recommended her discharge and, according to Dr. French\u2019s testimony, the reasons for her discharge were the three grounds specified in his December 15 letter. Neither Dr. French nor the one Board member who testified offered any evidence, direct or circumstantial, to suggest what they would have done about Avery\u2019s violation of the notice rule if she had been married.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The appellees offered no evidence of the Board\u2019s treatment of married teachers who had violated the notice rule.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Since no evidence in the record supports the proposition that Avery would have been dismissed absent consideration of her out of wedlock pregnancy, we would set aside as clearly erroneous a finding by the district court that the appellees proved that proposition by a preponderance of the evidence. Fed.R. Civ.P. 52(a). Therefore, we find that the appellees did not carry their burden to show that they would have discharged Avery even absent her asserted immorality.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">The only remaining question is whether a discharge on account of pregnancy out of wedlock is, as Avery maintains, unlawful. As we have noted, Avery challenges her dismissal on both statutory and constitutional grounds. Ordinarily, we would address the statutory claims first. However, the presence in this case of controlling authority that Avery\u2019s discharge on account of unwed pregnancy was unconstitutional counsels that we address Avery\u2019s constitutional claims first.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">In <em>Andrews v. Drew Municipal Separate School Dist., </em>507 F.2d 611 (5th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. dismissed as improvidently granted, </em>425 U.S. 559, 96 S.Ct. 1752, 48 L.Ed.2d 169 (1976), the defendant school district automatically disqualified from employment any parent of an illegitimate child. In a suit brought by an affected teacher aide and an affected applicant for a position as a teacher aide, we held that the prohibition against the employment of unwed parents violated the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment. Inquiring whether the classification established by the school district\u2019s policy was rationally related to a legitimate government interest, we rejected all three rationales offered in support of the contention that the rule furthered the creation of a properly moral scholastic environment: (1) that unwed parenthood is prima facie proof of immorality; (2) that unwed parents are unfit role models; (3) that employment of an unwed parent in a scholastic environment materially contributes to the problem of school-girl pregnancies. <em>Id. </em>at 614.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-13\">The appellees argue, as did the school district in <em>Andrews, </em>that unwed parenthood is <em>per se </em>proof of immorality and that a parent of an illegitimate child is an unfit role model. The appellees offer no support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>for either assertion that was not before us in <em>Andrews, </em>nor do the appellees offer any meaningful distinction between <em>Andrews </em>and this case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, we hold that Avery\u2019s discharge was in violation of her rights under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment. So holding, we need not reach her other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">The judgment of the district court is vacated. The case is remanded to the district court, which is instructed to determine the relief to which Avery is entitled and to enter judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">VACATED and REMANDED, with instructions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b359-9\">. No distinction was made at trial or on appeal among conception, pregnancy, and delivery out of wedlock. This case requires no such distinction, and we use the three terms interchangeably.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b360-6\">. As noted at p. 341, <em>infra, </em>we depart from the usual sequence in this case by addressing the constitutional claims before the statutory claims. Therefore, we need not decide whether the <em>Mt. Healthy </em>analysis would apply to Avery\u2019s claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e, <em>et seq., </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b361-8\">. Conversely, Dr. French did testify that he would have recommended her discharge for immorality even if she had given timely notice of her pregnancy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b361-9\">. Avery offered documentary and testimonial evidence that the Board continued to employ married teachers who tardily notified the Superintendent of their pregnancies. That evidence, however, was somewhat equivocal, and we do not consider it in reaching our decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b361-14\">. Although we do not customarily make such factual findings, our authority to do so on a record permitting only one factual inference is clear. <em>See, e.g., Grosso v. United States, </em>390 U.S. 62, 71-72, 88 S.Ct. 709, 715, 19 L.Ed.2d 906 (1968); <em>Levin v. Mississippi River Fuel Corp., </em>386 U.S. 162, 170, 87 S.Ct. 927, 932, 17 L.Ed.2d 834 (1967); <em>Felder v. United States, </em>543 F.2d 657, 671 (9th Cir. 1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b362-17\">. One reason for our conclusion in <em>Andrews </em>that the first rationale offered by the school district was unconstitutional was that unwed parents were denied a due process hearing to which employees charged with other immoral conduct were entitled. <em>Id. </em>at 616. Avery was not denied a hearing. The equal protection component of the <em>Andrews </em>analysis is nonetheless applicable here. Furthermore, the discussion of due process in <em>Andrews </em>was dictum, since the holding of the case was that the school district\u2019s policy created an irrational classification and therefore violated the equal protection clause. <em>See id. </em>at 614, 617.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
