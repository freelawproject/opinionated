Reed, </em>547 F.2d 971 (6th Cir. 1977). We remanded Getty\u2019s case for trial on his complaint \u201cthat his rights to freedom of speech had been curtailed by the six months disciplinary suspension \u2014 at least part of it was occasioned by what he said during three somewhat heated state court trials.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 977.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-17\">We noted that the District Judge at hearing \u201cshould keep in mind the warnings of the Supreme Court that relief from state disbarment proceedings can only be had in unusual and limited circumstances \u2014 and then only upon proof of federal constitutional violation. <em>See generally Theard v. United States, </em>354 U.S. 278 [77 S.Ct. 1274, 1 L.Ed.2d 1342] (1957); <em>Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners of New Mexico, </em>353 U.S. 232 [77 S.Ct. 752, 1 L.Ed.2d 796] (1957); <em>Konigsberg v. State Bar of California, </em>353 U.S. 252 [77 S.Ct. 722, 1 L.Ed.2d 840] (1957); <em>Taylor v. Kentucky State Bar Association, </em>424 F.2d 478 (6th Cir. 1970).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b589-18\">A major part of this court\u2019s concern was that a number of the charges against Getty pertained to statements and actions outside of the courtroom, albeit, they were associated with the three trials referred to. Before this case was heard by the District Court on remand (but after this court\u2019s first decision), the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Mt. Healthy v. Doyle, </em>429 U.S. 274, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977), where, a unanimous Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-19\">Initially, in this case, the burden was properly placed upon respondent to show that his conduct was constitutionally protected, and that this conduct was a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d \u2014 or, to put it in other words, that it was a \u201cmotiv.ating factor\u201d in the Board\u2019s decision not to rehire him. Respondent having carried that burden, however, the District Court should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>gone on to determine whether the Board had shown by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have reached the same decision as to respondent\u2019s reemployment even in the absence of the protected conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 287, 97 S.Ct. at 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">In our instant case, Judge Siler properly noted that the Kentucky Court of Appeals had suspended Getty from practice for six months on charges which involved both in-court and out-of-court conduct. Judge Siler thereupon concluded that the case was controlled by <em>ML Healthy v. Doyle, supra, </em>and without approving Getty\u2019s out-of-court statements held that they were constitutionally protected conduct. He then concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-6\">Nevertheless, when the decision of the Kentucky Court of Appeals in this case is examined, it is clear that the Kentucky court would have decided to suspend Getty had it considered only permissable (sic) reasons, <em>i.e., </em>his conduct in court. Of the four counts against Getty, the Kentucky Court discusses, three focus on Getty\u2019s trial-related behavior. The basis of the Kentucky Court\u2019s decision is revealed by its statement that \u201cGetty\u2019s misconduct in <em>the courtroom </em>indicates that he has failed to honor the law.\u201d <em>Kentucky Bar Ass\u2019n v. Getty, </em>[535 S.W.2d] at 94 (emphasis added). Therefore, the Kentucky court would have suspended Getty based solely on permissible reasons, that is, Getty\u2019s in-court conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-7\"><em>Getty v. Reed, </em>No. 76-14 Slip op. at 3 (E.D.Ky. June 12, 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">This court notes that the Kentucky Court of Appeals (now the Kentucky Supreme Court) makes three findings. The first of which was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-9\">This court does not view the conduct of Mr. Getty so lightly. On that occasion Getty not only called the County Attorney a damned liar on two occasions, but his conduct toward the County Judge was reprehensible. Getty paid no attention to the ruling of the judge. He badgered and harassed a witness. He was loud and boisterous. He accused the court of attempting to influence the jury against his client. He approached the bench, and within a very short distance from the judge pointed his finger at the court in a threatening and disrespectful manner. Getty\u2019s conduct during the trial caused the court to declare a mistrial. The judge found Getty in contempt for his boisterous and contemptuous attitude.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ag_\"><em>Kentucky Bar Assoc. v. Getty, </em>535 S.W.2d 91, 93 (Ky.1975). While the second sentence quoted above dealt with Getty\u2019s confrontations with the county attorneys and therefore may have pertained to out-of-court conduct, it is clear that the balance of the paragraph concerns in-court conduct which is subject to judicial discipline based on the standards of professional conduct. We agree with the District Judge that \u201cthe Kentucky Court would have suspended Getty based solely on permissible reasons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Auzv\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
