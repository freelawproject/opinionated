Feil, Inc., and on review of the briefs and oral argument in said case wherein the Board had found that the petitioner had violated section 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act by coercively interrogating employees, by threatening less desirable working conditions and by granting a new benefit, hospitalization coverage, during the union\u2019s organizing efforts; and noting that the Board also found an appropriate bargaining unit consisting of petitioner\u2019s warehouse employees and entered a <em>Gissel </em>-type of bargaining order pertaining to said unit on the basis of violations previously catalogued; and further on review of the record, this court having determined that the Board\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence on the whole record and that its bargaining order is appropriate under <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Gissel Packing Co., </em>395 U.S. 575, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969) because although the unfair labor practices found are less than \u201coutrageous and pervasive,\u201d nonetheless the Board found that they were sufficient to tend to undermine the union\u2019s majority strength and interfere with the electoral process;</p>\n<p id=\"b588-12\">Now therefore, enforcement of the Board\u2019s order should be and hereby is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
