No. 90-486, 82 Stat. 755 (Aug. 13, 1968), Congress extended federal retirement benefits, among other benefits, to National Guard technicians but only if they worked as such technicians on or after January 1, 1969. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 8332(b)(6). Appellant, a former National Guard technician from 1948 to 1959, challenges the constitutionality of the Act by alleging the exclusion of former technicians serves no rational purpose and the choice of January 1, 1969 as the eligibility date is arbitrary. We find the Act to be constitutional for the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s opinion at 519 F.Supp. 54 (N.D.Ga.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-11\">It is obvious that Congress had as one of its purposes in passing the challenged legislation the encouragement of persons to join the National Guard technician\u2019s program or remain a member if already a member on January 1,1969. Plaintiff was not a member on that day and had not been in the National Guard for approximately ten years. Plaintiff has no basis for complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
