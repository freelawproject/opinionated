Main and others, against Rachael Ryder and James, Emily and Caroline Miner, and the other by the same plaintiffs against Horace and Henry Miner and Catharine Hooker.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-16\">The plaintiffs claimed as the legal heirs of Daniel Miner, deceased, and the defendants as devisees under his will. In 1825, Daniel Miner Main married Phoebe Dennison in the state of New York, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>\u25a0with whom he had several children, born in lawful wedlock, and who are the plaintiffs in this suit. About thirteen years thereafter, said Main left his wife and children in New York and came to Wayne county, under the name of Daniel Miner, in company with a woman named Catharine Hooker, with whom he lived, cohabited and had children. Three of these children are defendants in these suits, James A. Miner being a defendant in one and Horace and Henry Miner in the other. Four years after his coming to Wayne county, Daniel Miner commenced to live and cohabit with Eachael Eyder, and continued to live with her until the day of his death, twenty-six years thereafter. By her he had several children, two of whom, Emily and Caroline Miner, are joined as defendants in the suit against James A. Miner, in which also Eachael Eyder is a defendant. Catharine Hooker was joined as a defendant in the suit against Horace and Henry, because of her being in possession of one of the farms. Daniel Miner was never married to either Catharine Hooker or Eachael Eyder. At the time of his death, he lived on a farm with Eachael Eyder and her two daughters. 'Catharine Hooker, with her two sons, Horace and Henry,\u2022 resided on another farm. These two farms are the subjects of controversy in these suits. It was admitted that these properties were owned by Daniel Miner at the time of his death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-6\">At the trial, before Dreher, P. J. (of the 43d judicial district), the plaintiffs proved the marriage, in 1825, of Daniel Miner Main with Phoebe Dennison; that they had lived together some thirteen years in New York state, and had seven children; that said Main had abandoned his wife and children and came to Wayne county with Catharine Hooker, with whom he lived under the name of Daniel Miner, and that his first wife, Phoebe, died in 1869.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-7\">The plaintiffs, who were his children by this first marriage, claimed the farms as his heirs at law. The defendants claimed under a will of Daniel Miner, who died on 4th of January 1873. The will was dated the 26th of December 1872, and was proved the 15th day of January 1873.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-8\">This will contained the following provisions affecting the parties herein concerned:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-9\">\u201c I give and bequeath to my wife, Eachael Eyder, the use of my farm, on which I now live, as long as she shall live.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-10\">\u201c2.

If the jury believe from the evidence that at the time of the execution of the 'will of Daniel Miner (Main) the testator had not a full and intelligent knowledge and understanding of the act in which he was engaged, of the property he possessed, an intelligent perception of the disposition he desired to make of such property, and the persons he desired should be his beneficiaries, then the testator did not possess a disposing mind and memory, and the will is invalid and the verdict must be for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-16\">The court answered:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-17\">\u201c Affirmed, with this explanation: That if a testator understands in detail all he is about, it is quite sufficient to sustain his will. It is not necessary at the time that he should have a recollection of all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>his estate, his family relations in life, their condition in general, and the probable effect the proposed disposition will have, and to collect all this in one view.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-6\">2. If the jury believe from the evidence that Daniel Miner (Main) had for a long period of time been living in unlawful intercourse with Rachael Ryder and Catharine Hooker, that the will was made in the presence of said Rachael and of the children of such unlawful intercourse, and that such will is made for the benefit of the parties to or issue of such unlawful intercourse, the law pr\u00e9sumes the exercise of an influence upon the mind of the testator, which is unlawful and therefore undue. And if the testator was at the time suffering from weakness of body or mind by reason of his last sickness, the presumption of law is against the validity of the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-7\">Which the court negatived.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-8\">In their general charge the court said:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-9\">\u201c Undue influence to destroy a will must be such that the mind and will of some one else are substituted for the will of the testator, so that the testator in his will does not express his own free will and wishes.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-10\">In both cases the verdict was for the defendants, and the plaintiffs took this writ, assigning for error the answers of the court to the foregoing points and the portion of the charge noted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b222-11\"><em>H.

L. 249, it was held that a will could not be executed by a mark, nor could the name be signed by any other than the testator, except in the extremity of last sickness. An illiterate man, therefore, could only execute his will when upon his death-bed: Asay <em>v. </em>Hoover, 5 Barr 33. It was to relieve this difficulty that the Act of 1848 was passed (Long <em>v. </em>Zook, 1 Harris 404), and it should be limited in its construction to the case it was intended to relieve.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-12\">The court substantially instructed the jury that a name written at the bottom of a will at the request of the testator, was a good execution, although such name was intended at the time not as the act of execution, but simply as a preparation for the execution by the act of the testator making his mark.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-13\">The evidence shows that Thorpe not Daniel Miner made the mark.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-14\">From the unlawful relations of these parties and the other circumstances undue influence Avas to be presumed: Dean <em>v. </em>Negley, 5 Wright 317 ; Rudy <em>v. </em>Ulrich, 19 P.

They involve the same question. The contention relates to the will of Daniel Miner.' All the assignments of error present substantially these questions, involving its validity:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">1. The manner of its execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">2. The mental capacity of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-12\">3. The influences under which it was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-13\">We will first consider the manner of its execution. Under the Act of 1833, it was held that a will signed by the testator putting his mark to it, was not properly executed. To cure this ruling, which was questioned in Vernon <em>v. </em>Kirk, 6 Casey 218, the Act of 27th January 1848, Pamph. L. 16, was passed. It declares that every last will and testament \u201c to which the testator hath made his mark or cross, shall be deemed and taken to be valid in all respects, provided the other requisites under existing laws are complied with.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-14\">The will of Daniel Miner bears date the 26th December 1872. It appears to have been executed by the testator making his mark or cross at the end thereof. It has two subscribing witnesses, and is wholly regular on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-15\">It is contended that the Act of 1848 applies only to cases where the testator is unable to write his name by reason of want of. education, and does not excuse the absence of the signature of one who is able to write. We discover nothing in the act 'sustaining that view. It makes no mention of insufficient education or of physical inability. It declares that form of execution as sufficient in all cases. The manifest object of the act is to permit a will to be signed as any other written instrument may be signed. Hence in Vandruff <em>et al. v. </em>Rinehart, 5 Casey 232, it was held that if one is unable from palsy or other cause, to make his signature or mark to his will, another person may steady his hand and aid him in so doing. If so done by the assistance of another it is the testator\u2019s own act. So in Cozzens\u2019s Will, 11 P. F. Smith 196, the testator was paralyzed, and said he was unable to write, but would put his mark to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>will. He was raised in bed; a pen was put into his hand, which was held by another while he made his mark. This was held to be a valid execution of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">In the case we are now considering, it appears by the evidence of Thorpe, who drew the will, that he handed it to the testator, who was lying in bed, to sign. The latter said, \u201c You sign it.\u201d Case or Stanton said, \u201c Yes, he can make his mark just as well.\u201d Case and Stanton each testified substantially corroborating Thorpe, and added that Miner made the further remark that he had written his name, but did not know as he could do it then, or did not know but he' could do it again. Thereupon Thorpe wrote Miner\u2019s name, not in a manner indicating that it was to stand as Miner\u2019s fully executed signature, but preparatory only to his making his mark. Thorpe</p>\n<p id=\"ANE\">his</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">wrote it \u201c Daniel Miner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A0W\">mark</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">In that portion of the charge covered by the eighth assignment the court said, \u201cwe therefore charge you that if Thorpe wrote Daniel Miner\u2019s name to1 the will in Miner\u2019s presence and by his express directions, and Miner made the attempt to make his mark, but failed to complete the mark, or to make it in the manner required by the statute, still the will is sufficiently executed if these facts are proved by two witnesses, who Avere present at the time, although Miner when he directed his name to be signed intended to make his mark also, and Thorpe, when he wrote the name, intended that Miner should make his mark.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">This, we think, Avas clearly error. It assumes that although the testator directed his name to be written Avith the view of adding his mark, and thus making his signature, yet the will is completely executed before the mark is made. This cannot be so. It gives to an unexecuted intention the same effect as if fully executed. It gives to the statute a construction not sanctioned by its letter or its spirit. It is undoubtedly true the statute does provide, if the testator\u2019s name is subscribed by his direction and authority, it is a valid execution of the will. That, hoAvever, is when the testator has directed his name to be written as his complete signature; If' so directed and intended, it becomes sufficient in itself. In such case the testator Avould not have intended to make any signature with his own hand, and none would be required. The learned judge holds the will may be sufficiently executed, although the testator failed to make his mark \u201cin the manner required by the statute,\u201d and when neither the testator nor the Scrivener had done any act, which either intended as a full execution of the will, and when the will would show on its face that it was not fully executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">This error, however, was harmless in its consequences. It is shown by the testimony of four witnesses, who are uncontradicted, that the testator did make his mark. They all testify that his hand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>was on the pen when his mark was made, and he thus assisted in making it. As then the plaintiff in error sustained no injury by this instruction we will not reverse therefor: Phelin <em>v. </em>Kenderdine, 8 Harris 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">2. The evidence in regard to mental incapacity was very slight. It was fairly submitted to the jury, and substantially in the very language often used by this court. On this branch of the case, the learned judge is fully sustained by Thompson <em>v. </em>Kyner, 15 P. F. Smith 368, and the numerous cases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">3. The fact that the testator lived with a woman to whom he was not legally married, and that she and their illegitimate offspring were the devisees of much of his property, are urged as creating a presumption in law that the will was executed under improper influences. The case of Dean <em>et al. v. </em>Negley <em>et al. </em>is cited to support this view. The opinion of the judge in that case expressly declares that the court does not decide such relations create a presumption of law of undue influence; but leaves the effect thereof as a question of fact for the jury. To the same effect is the case of Rudy <em>v. </em>Ulrich <em>et </em>al., 19 P. F. Smith 177. No clearly defined weight can be given to such testimony. Much must depend on the particular circumstances of each case. It is an element undoubtedly to be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">It appears that Miner had been entirely separated from his lawful wife and children for nearly thirty-five years. So far as it appears .none of them had met him in all that time. She had not sought any reconciliation of her marital relations, nor they of their filial relations. They all resided in another state. She died in April 1869. For more than twenty-six years the testator and the woman named in his will as his wife, had lived and cohabited together as husband and wife. During all that time they so recognised each other. She had borne him several children. To them he also devised a portion of his estate. A separation for more than thirty years from his legitimate children naturally weakened his parental affection towards them. It needed no special effort on the part of his other family, with which he had lived more than a quarter of a century, to make them the objects of his bounty. The court fairly submitted the fact of his illicit associations to the jury to consider in determining the question of undue influence. On the whole record we diseov\u00e9r no sufficient cause for reversal, therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">Judgment affirmed in each case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
