This note was given for supplies furnished Reynolds in the prosecution of his work under his contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-6\">On the 6th of February 1874, Heise &amp; Kauffman issued this attachment execution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-7\">About the 17th of February 1874, eleven days after this attachment issued, Brinks came to Lancaster, having been told by Kauffman, one of the plaintiffs, that the creditors of Reynolds would meet him there to make arrangements how the work of Reynolds was to go on. He did not see or meet any of the creditors there, but met Reynolds. He then and there arranged Avith Reynolds that he, Brinks, should be his paymaster and go on with the Avork \u2014 Brinks to pay the hands and all expenses, and to give Reynolds money to pay his personal expenses; and then the balance that was left when the work Aras done ay as to go to, or for the benefit of, the creditors, Ayhoever Avere entitled to it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-8\">Then Brinks came back to Columbia, and saAV Messrs. Heise &amp; Kauffman, the plaintiffs, and told them the arrangement that was made, and they said they Avere perfectly satisfied with it. Under that arrangement Reynolds Avent on Avith the Avork and finished it, and Brinks retained in his hands and accounted for $2978.96, which it was agreed was the correct balance due Reynolds. Of this balance Heise &amp; Kauffman claimed $921.21, to satisfy their judgment, Avhich claim Avas resisted by BaldAvin, Avho claimed the Avhole fund by virtue of the assignment contained in the above agreement. This agreement it appeared was delivered to BaldAyin some ten days after its date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-9\">The plaintiffs contended that this assignment Avas fraudulent and was made to defraud the creditors of Reynolds. At the trial before Patterson, A. L. J., Day, the subscribing witness to the above agreement, was called by the garnishee to prove its execution. The garnishee then read the paper to the jury. Brinks was then called to prove his signature to the endorsement on the instrument, and the plaintiff recalled Day for cross-examination, to. which the garnishee objected. The court overruled the objection, Avhich Avas the first assignment of error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ASL\">Day was then asked, \u201c Did you see the $2888, recited in the agreement as part consideration, \u2018 borrowed at previous dates,\u2019 paid to Mr. Baldwin?\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-11\">This question, under objection, was allowed, and Ayas the second assignment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-12\">Plaintiff in rebuttal recalled Brinks, and asked him, \u201c When did you first know anything about this indebtedness of $2888 to Mr. BaldAA\u00dan \u2014 the previous indebtedness ?\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-13\">The allowance of this question Avas the third assignment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>The fourth point of the garnishee and the answer thereto were as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-6\">Fraud is not to be presumed; it must be proved by the party alleging it. There is no proof of fraud, or want of consideration in the assignment or transfer by defendant to George E. Baldwin, and the testimony of defendant and of said Baldwin as to the consideration, and the said balance being insufficient to pay said Baldwin\u2019s claim, said Baldwin is entitled to said balance due by the garnishee, and the verdict must be in favor of A. H. Brinks, garnishee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-7\">Answer. \u201c It is true, fraud cannot be presumed; those alleging fraud must show it to the satisfaction of the jury, by proof, by facts \u2022 \u2014 the jury, it is true, may infer fraud from facts clearly proved. The jury in this case, therefore, will pass upon that question, and the question of consideration in the assignment or transfer by \u2022defendant J. B. Reynolds to George E. Baldwin, is for your determination, under all the evidence in this case, and if you find there is want of consideration, in the assignment referred to, or that the same is fraudulent, then Baldwin would not be entitled to the balance in the hands of Mr. Brinks, the garnishee, and the verdict should be in favor of the plaintiffs in this attachment for the amount of said balance, or the amount of their judgment and interest; but if the jury should be of opinion, from all the evidence, that no fraud exists in the assignment or transfer of Reynolds to Baldwin, and that a good and valuable consideration subsisted between them, by reason of Reynolds having honestly borrowed money from Baldwin and owed him for same at the time, then in this issue the verdict should be for A. H. Brinks, the garnishee.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-8\">The court charged:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-9\">\u201c It is alleged by the plaintiffs that the assignment is fraudulent \u2014made to defraud the creditors of Reynolds.

H. Brinks. But if you should find from all the evidence in the case that the assignment to George E. Baldwin was made for the purpose of hindering and defrauding the creditors of the said J. B. Reynolds, the plaintiffs in this suit, or others, then your verdict should find the amount of money in the hands of Brinks, the garnishee, and also in favor of the plaintiffs, Heise &amp; Kauffman.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-11\">The answer to the foregoing points and the portions of the charge quoted constituted the remaining assignments of error.

Whether a fraudulent design existed was for the jury : Dean <em>v. </em>Connelly, 6 Barr 239.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AEL\">October 1st 1877.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b251-6\">Mr. Justice Woodward</author>\n<p id=\"ARS\">delivered the opinion of the court,</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">It is not apparent how any hazard of mistake or injury was incurred by the permission given to recall Frank P. Day for cross-examination. He was the subscribing witness to the agreement between Reynolds, Brinks and Baldwin, and the question put to him was, whether or not payment of part of the consideration for the agreement was made at the time of its execution. In regular order, the cross-examination should have been closed before the paper was read, but its admission or rejection could have been in no manner controlled by the new evidence. Offered at any stage of the trial, the effect of the paper would not be changed. The whole subject was within the discretion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">\u25a0 At the very foundation of the case of the plaintiffs, in their attempt to fasten a fraud upon Reynolds and Baldwin, was the allegation that the sum of $2888 had never been advanced by Baldwin, and that the claim for it was fabricated and baseless. Surely it was competent to show by Brinks that the fact of such an advance had not been made known to him up to the time when he bound himself conditionally to pay it in the agreement that was executed on the 29th of October 1873. It was a fact illustrating the relations and conduct of the parties, and was relevant and competent, if there was any relevant and competent testimony throughout the causp, to sustain the charge of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">Nor are the objections better founded that have been made to the portions of the charge set out in the fifth, sixth and seventh assignments of error. The jury were instructed in substance that an alleged fraud must be established either by direct proof or by facts to warrant a presumption of its existence clearly and conclusively proved. They were instructed also that if the assignment to Baldwin was made for the purpose of hindering and delaying the creditors of Reynolds, that fact, as against the plaintiffs, who were contesting creditors, would be fatal to its validity. This was in accordance with recognised authority. Lord Mansfield said, in discharging a rule for a new trial in Cadogan <em>v. </em>Kennett, 2 Cowper 432 : \u201c If the transaction be not bona fide, the circumstance of its being done for a valuable consideration will not alone take it out of the statute. I hav'e known several cases where persons have given a fair and full price for goods, and where the possession was actually changed, yet being done for the purpose of defeating creditors, the transaction has been held fraudulent, and therefore void.\u201d And it was ruled in Ashmead <em>v. </em>Hean &amp; Moulfair, 1 Harris 584, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>that a conveyance of real estate, made with the intent on the part of the vendor, known to the vendee, to delay, defeat and hinder a particular creditor from obtaining his debt, though made for a valuable and full consideration, is, as against such creditor, fraudulent and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">In reality, there is but a single significant question in this cause. Was there any evidence of the existence of a fraudulent combination legitimately entitled to the consideration of the jury ? On the 2d of October 1872, A. H. Brinks, the garnishee and defendant below, entered into a written contract to grade sections 6 and 7 of the track of the Columbia and Port Deposit Railroad Company. One-sixth of the money earned was to be retained until the completion-of the contract. On the 9th of January 1873, J. B. Reynolds entered into a sub-contract with Brinks to grade part of section 7. Brinks was to receive as his profit on the sub-let section one-half of the one-sixth of the estimates retained. Although the contract was executed in January, Reynolds did not begin his work until May 1873, and until that time, and indeed until the 1st of July following, remained in the service of the Union Railroad Company in Baltimore at a salary of $100 a month. The work was carried on by him until October 1873, when his funds were exhausted, and he had fallen into debt, Heise &amp; Kauffman, the plaintiffs below, who had furnished him with powder, fuse and other materials, being among his creditors. In that month Reynolds, Brinks and Baldwin met in Philadelphia. In the course of a conversation between them, Reynolds told Brinks that if he had $1000 he could pay off all his debts and go on with the work without any trouble. Brinks replied that.he \u201cshould not stick for $1000.\u201d And Baldwin then remarked: \u201c If you haven\u2019t got the money, I have got money in bank, and I will lend it if you will endorse or stand good for it.\u201d Reynolds and Baldwin went to Baltimore, and a few days afterwards Reynolds returned with a note for $3888 instead of $1000. This note Brinks refused to sign. Then the agreement of the 29th of October 1873 was executed, by which Brinks bound himself to pay Baldwin $1000 absolutely, and $2888 (recited as \u201c having been borrowed at previous dates\u201d), provided that amount should be due to Reynolds on the final estimate for his work under the contract. The plaintiffs obtained their judgment against Reynolds on the 8th of December 1873, and issued an attachment against him making Brinks garnishee on the 6th of February 1874. A new arrangement, of which the plaintiffs were informed and to which they agreed, was the consequence of this attachment. Reynolds was to continue working, and Brinks was to receive the .estimates and pay the wages of the men, the necessary charges for materials and Reynolds\u2019s personal expenses. At the completion of the contract, the balance due Reynolds, if any, was, according to the testimony of Brinks, \u201cto go to, or for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>benefit of the creditors, whoever were entitled to it.\u201d The balance found due in the end was $2978.96.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">In the course of the trial it was ascertained that no notes or receipts had been given for any of- the sums of money which, it was alleged, Reynolds had received from Baldwin. The dates and amounts were obtained from a small memorandum-book, on one page of Avhich they had been entered in pencil, and it Avas contended that their appearance indicated that all the entiles had been made at one time. Tayo sums of $500 each were charged before Reynolds\u2019s work under the contract was begun. Advances to the amount of $2500 were charged before he relinquished his position as superintendent of the Union Railroad Company. Nothing was said of these advances in Philadelphia, when Reynolds\u2019s need of $1000 to pay his debts and complete his contract was explained. Brinks knew nothing of Baldivin\u2019s claim until Reynolds brought the note from Baltimore. And no notice Avas given to the plaintiffs of the existence of that claim Avhen they were informed of the modification of the contract betAveen Reynolds and Brinks. They AYere encouraged to, suspend proceedings on their attachment by the assurance that any balance that should eventually be found due to Reynolds should \u201cgo for the benefit of his creditors.\u201d To say the least, the acts of the parties' in this transaction were, in a good many respects, exceptional and peculiar. It is not in the usual course of business to make loans at intervals during a period of six months, amounting to a sum so significant as $2888, without providing some more authentic evidence of indebtedness than a pencil memorandum made by the lender, and remaining undisclosed throughout a protracted negotiation 'for a fresh loan, for which a third person was to be security. What ought to be the effect of the evidence in relation to Reynolds\u2019s statements in Philadelphia ? Was the knowledge of Baldwin\u2019s claim fraudulently withheld from the plaintiffs? Was the Avhole arrangement, which was consummated by the agreement of the 29th of October 1873, a fraudulent contrivance to AYithdraw any balance due Reynolds on his contract from the grasp of his creditors ? These were questions which only a jury could answer. They Avere to weigh the evidence in each detail and as a whole, and adjust its value. It has not been shown that they did not weigh it justly.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
