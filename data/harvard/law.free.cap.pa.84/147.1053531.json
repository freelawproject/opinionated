We therefore direct you to find in favor of the defendants.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-15\">Verdict for the defendants, and plaintiffs took this writ, assigning the foregoing portion of the charge and the direction of the court for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b148-16\"><em>Hughes Farquhar, </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-j\">There is no bequest, gift or devise of anything to the parties named, and there is nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>to show whether the testator\u2019s intention was to dispose of all or a part of his real estate, or all or a part of his personal property, and the will, therefore, is void for uncertainty: Kelley <em>v. </em>Kelley, 1 Casey 460; Wallize <em>v. </em>Wallize, 5 P. F. Smith 242.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-5\">If anything whatever passed, it must be wholly by implication, because of the second clause, viz.: \u201c Item \u2014 my son Daniel and Jarrett and my daughter Sarah and Louisa\u2019s child Edward Hummel they shall have nothing of my estate, they have more now than their shairs come to.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-6\">These words do not import a testamentary disposition, and therefore cannot be construed into a devise: Houser <em>v. </em>Moore, 7 Casey 347; Duffield <em>v. </em>Morris, 8 W. &amp; S. 348; Burford <em>v. </em>Burford, 5 Casey 221. Mere negative words in a will are not sufficient to exclude the title of the heir or next of kin: Hitchcock <em>v. </em>Hitchcock, 11 Casey 393. An heir can only be disinherited by express devise or necessary implication: McIntyre <em>v. </em>Ramsey, 11 Harris 317; Rupp <em>v. </em>Eberly, 29 P. F. Smith 141. No intention as against an heir can avail a devisee that is not expressed in the will: Brendlinger <em>v. </em>Brendlinger, 2 Casey 131. Where a devise is uncertain, the law adopts the principles of the intestate laws: Lip-man\u2019s Appeal, 6 Casey 180.

F. Smith 76 ; Abbott <em>v. </em>Middleton, 21 Beav. 143; Langston <em>v. </em>Pole, 2 M. &amp; P. 490. The word estate in a will carries everything unless restrained by particular expressions : Turbett <em>v. </em>Turbett, 3 Yeates 187; Heffner <em>v. </em>Knepper, 6 Watts 21; Blewer <em>v. </em>Brightman, 4 McCord 60; A her <em>v. </em>Deneale, 1 Peters 585 ; Jackson <em>v. </em>Babcock, 12 Johns. 389.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-8\">To use the language of the court below, \u201c The word property is one of large signification and comprises things both real and personal. It is as extensive as the Avord \u2018estate,\u2019 and its use Avill authorize the selling of the testator\u2019s real estate, unless the word has become limited in its meaning by the use of the definite article. See Foster <em>v. </em>SteWart, 6 Harris 23, where the authorities are-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>reviewed and commented upon as to the extent of the word. The definite article, as used here, is evidently synonymous with \u2018my\u2019 and should be so construed.\u201d</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AP2\">March 26th 1877,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The judgment of the Supreme Court was entered,</p>\n<author id=\"AE3\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AB6\">We are all of opinion that judged <em>ex visceribus, </em>this will contains a sufficient devise and bequest of all the estate of the testator, to carry his real and personal property to the persons named in the will as his devisees and-legatees. That Daniel Zerbe made what' he himself terms his last will and testament appears by the written paper duly signed, sealed and witnessed, and by the witnesses attesting as such. That he intended to will his property to the persons named to take under the will, is not denied; but it is insisted that in fact he made no devise and bequest of his property. We do not agree to this statement. We have only to read the will in its own order, striking out the superfluous words which obscure the sense, and we have a sufficient and- consistent disposition of his property. Thus: \u201c I give and bequeath unto my sons Edward and Peter and my daughter Catharine and Mary\u2019s children in equal <em>shairs, </em>but to my sons Daniel and Jarrett and my daughter Sarah, and Louisa\u2019s child <em>nothing, </em>of my <em>estate, </em>they (viz., the last named) having more than their <em>shairs </em>would come to.\u201d Now, it is clear that the word \u201cestate\u201d belongs to the first clause of the sentence as much as it does to the last clause, and that the word \u201c shares\u201d in the first clause corresponds to the same word in the last clause, and both refer to the same estate. This is further strengthened by the fact that the second clause excludes the children named in it from the estate, and thus, by an -irresistible conclusion, refers the estate therein named to the persons named in the first, to whom, by express words, the testator declares he gives and bequeaths. Then, if anything were wanting, the power given to the executors, immediately following, to sell the \u201cproperty,\u201d makes the subject of the devise more manifest.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">We think the court below gave a proper interpretation to the will, and therefore the judgment is affirmed..</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
