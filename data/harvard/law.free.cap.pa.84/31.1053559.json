Rhoads to the use of John Wilhelm against Reuben Blatt, wherein Aaron Blatt was summoned as garnishee. The garnishee pleaded <em>nulla </em>bona, with leave, &amp;c., and issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-15\">The case was this:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-16\">On the 21st- of January 1871, Rhoads obtained a judgment against Reuben Blatt, which, on the 16th of June 1874, was marked to the use of Wilhelm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-17\">On the 26th day of April 1871, Reuben Blatt, being seised of an undivided interest in a farm which had descended to him and his brothers and sisters from their father, Benjamin K. Blatt, under the intestate laws, executed an assignment for the benefit of creditors to John K. Derr, of \u201c all the goods, chattels, and effects and property of every kind, .personal and mixed, of the said Reuben <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Blatt;\u201d which assignment was duly recorded on the day of its date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-5\">The 12th day of May, following, the assignee filed an inventory, wherein said interest was appraised at $2000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-6\">The assigned estate of Reuben Blatt was settled, and proved insolvent, paying the creditors a pro rata dividend of only 23J- per centum.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-7\">On the 7th day of August 1871, proceedings in partition were commenced, which terminated in Aaron Blatt, the brother of Reuben, accepting the above-mentioned farm at the valuation thereof, to wit: $12,920, and entering into a recognizance to secure the shares of his brothers and sisters.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-8\">The widow died; and the interest of Reuben Blatt in the recognizance aforesaid was $2583.99. Reuben Blatt made assignments of portions of his interest in said recognizance to divers persons, some dated before and some after his assignment for the benefit of creditors, aggregating $1423.31, with a small amount of interest. This left a balance of $1159,98 with interest, due Reuben from Aaron. This attachment execution was issued and served upon Aaron Blatt, who was summoned as garnishee. Upon being ruled to reply to interrogatories, he filed answers, admitting that he had in his possession the above balance, but alleging that Reuben had on the 31st day of July 1872, assigned it to J. Warren Tryon, Esq., the consideration mentioned in this assignment being $400, the receipt whereof was acknowledged therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-9\">The cause was then put at issue and at the trial before Sassaman, A. L. J., the plaintiff contended that this assignment to Tryon was made with the intent to defraud creditors, but the court ruled that there was no evidence of fraud.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-10\">In their general charge they also held that the real estate of Blatt passed to the assignee for the benefit of creditors, and if it did not at the time of the assignment it subsequently did when converted into personalty after the proceedings in partition, and therefore the remedy of plaintiff must be against said assignee; and the jury were instructed to find for defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-11\">The plaintiff took this writ, assigning these rulings of the court for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b32-12\"><em>Cyrus G. Derr, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2M\">The real estate did not pass to the assignee for creditors, as no apt words were used in the assignment, and the use of the words \u201cpersonal and mixed,\u201d excluded the realty. If the land did not pass the money arising from a sale thereof did not pass.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-13\">The inadequacy of the consideration named in the assignment to Tryon was evidence of fraud, the assignor being largely indebted: Davidson <em>v. </em>Little, 10 Harris 252.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b32-14\"><em>Henry Q.

By that instrument he assigned \u201c all the goods, chattels, and effects and property of every kind, personal and mixed, of the said Reuben Blatt.\u201d Whatever might have been the effect of the words \u201c goods, chattels, effects and property of every kind,\u201d had they stood alone, the addition of the words \u201c personal and mixed\u201d certainly limited them to the personal estate. It is equally clear that if the real estate did not pass by the assignment, the assignee could have no claim upon the proceeds thereof, after a sale and conversion by the assignor.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">The question of fraud should have been submitted to the jury. The learned judge refused the plaintiff\u2019s first point upon the ground that there was no evidence of fraud. This was error.- The record shows that Blatt was insolvent. He had made an assignment for the benefit of his creditors. It appears from the report of the auditor that his estate yielded but a small dividend. The assignment to Mr. Tryon was of a \u2022claim of $1200, charged as a first lien upon a farm said to be worth $13,000. The consideration for the transfer of this claim was $400. In a sale by an insolvent vendor, inadequacy of price is evidence of fraud. It was said in Davidson <em>v. </em>Little, 10 Harris 252, that <em>\u201c </em>the sale of lands or goods by an indebted person for less than their value is <em>ipso facto </em>a fraud in both vendor and vendee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">The judgment is reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
