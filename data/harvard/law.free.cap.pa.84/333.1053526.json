F. Haskell, were extravagant and unnecessary; that the gross amount of his expenditures was greatly above the legitimate cost of opening and working the mines on plaintiffs\u2019 lands, then little if any weight should be given to the evidence of the amount expended by him, and it should be so regarded by the jury in ascertaining the real or legitimate cost of mining, or the value of the ore in place.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-10\">The court answered as follows, which was the 14th assignment:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Axj\">\u201cWe decline to answer this point as requested.

The increase is a permanent increase if the value of the land has been increased by the permanent improvements made or put upon it; and if such improvements have increased the the value of the land, they are a lasting and permanent benefit to it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-13\">The 5th point of the plaintiffs was:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-14\">\u201c If the jury believe that the machinery, buildings and conveniences for mining ore, put by the lessees of the defendants upon the land of the plaintiffs, were for temporary use only, and not structures of a lasting and permanent character, then they are not such improvements as entitle defendants to credit against the plaintiffs\u2019 demand in this action.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>The qualification contained in brackets in the following answer to this point was the 12th assignment:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-6\">\u201cWe answer this point in the affirmative, and so instruct you. If you believe the machinery, buildings, and conveniences for' mining ore were for temporary use only, and not structures of a lasting and permanent character, then they are not such improvements as entitle defendants to credit against the plaintiffs\u2019 demand in this action. [And we also instruct you that they are structures of a lasting and permanent character, if they are annexed to and made part of the freehold and give an increased value to it,\u201d]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-7\">The defendants\u2019 5th point was:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-8\">\u201c The engines, boilers-, washers, planes, drums, pumps, ropes, cars and all other matters necessary to convert unimproved land into ore-banks opened and ready to operate as such, are permanent improvements to the property, whether they will last a limited number of years or not, and the defendants are entitled to the difference in value between the property as it was without them and as it was when the plaintiffs were put in possession of it on October 26th 1874, with them in its distinctive character as ore-banks ready to operate, as a defence to the value of the ore in place and before it was taken from the ground.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-9\">The 16th assignment was the following answer of the court to this point:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-10\">\u201c In answer to this point, we instruct you that the engines, boilers, washers, planes, drums, pumps, ropes, cars, and all other matters necessary to convert unimproved land into ore-banks opened and ready to operate as such, are permanent improvements to the property, whether they will last a limited number of years or not, provided they be necessary parts of the machinery and fixtures erected and put upon the land for that purpose, and provided also such machinery and fixtures were annexed to the freehold and made part of it and give an increased value to the land. And if, therefore, you find these things to be permanent improvements giving increased value to the land, the defendants will be entitled to the difference in value between the property as it was without them and as it was when the plaintiff's were put in possession of it on October 26th 1874, with them in its distinctive character as ore-banks ready to operate, as a defence to the value of the ore in place and before it was taken from the ground; just to the extent, however, that such difference of value was produced by such improvements made and put upon the premises by the defendants and their lessees.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-11\">The 17th assignment was to the affirmance by the court of the sixth point of the defendants, which was:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-12\">\u201c Whether fast or loose, all the machinery of an ore-bank which is necessary to constitute it such and without which it would not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>an ore-bank equipped and ready for use as such, are \u00e1 part of the freehold, and the recovery of the land by the plaintiffs in the action of ejectment gave to them the ore-banks on it with all the machinery, whether fast or loose, and necessary to constitute them such equipped and ready for use.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-6\">The 19th assignment was to the leave given by the court to the defendants to send out with the jury a statement w7hich, by its highest estimate, allowed the plaintiffs $17,394.23, being for 30,249.12 tons of ore, at 50 cents per ton, with interest from Novembers 1st 1874, against which the defendants claimed $17,222.2D as the average value of improvements, or $21,666.67 as average increased value by machinery and development of ore, to the property as ore-banks. This statement was also accompanied by a list of the various improvements made to the several ore-banks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-7\">The verdict was for the plaintiffs for $1839.30, and judgment was entered thereon. The defendants took this writ, the errors assigned being those noted heretofore.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b338-8\"><em>S. Hepburn, Jr., </em>and <em>S. Hepburn, </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQ45\">The testimony offered from which the jury were to ascertain the value of the ore in place was inadmissible, as it consisted chiefly of hearsay and secondary evidence, and the court erred therefore in submitting to the jury the questions as to the cost of mining, cleansing and putting the ore in market, and the market value of the ore, as there was no legitimate evidence upon any of these questions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-9\">\u2022 The various admissions of testimony and instructions of the court on the subject of permanent improvements were contradictory, and tended to confuse the jury. The value of the machinery, &amp;c., as personal property \u2014 the only way in which it was valued \u2014 was confounded with the permanent increase of value which the developments and improvements gave to the land. This was wrong in any event, but particularly so if it belonged to the lessees of defendants and they w7ere permitted to retain it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-10\">The action for mesne profits is an equitable one. Is it equity to forbid plaintiffs to recognise the rights of their tenants? The royalty \u2014 the rent \u2014 had been paid to Kille. Was it right, in an action against him, to make his tenants pay it again by confiscating their property ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-11\">The average value of the improvements \u201c and the average increased value by machinery, &amp;c.,\u201d were certainly not supported by any evidence, and therefore the statement sent out with the jury by defendants was an improper one: Morrison <em>v. </em>Moreland, 15 S. &amp; R. 61; Terry\u2019s Executors <em>v. </em>Drabenstadt, 18 P. F. Smith 400.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b338-12\"><em>L. Todd </em>and <em>John Hays, </em>for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqg\">What better mode could be adopted to ascertain the value of ore in place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>than the result of mining at the banks for the ore for which compensation is sought ? And the evidence to show this result was competent. The charge of the court upon the measure of damages was in accord with Forsyth <em>v. </em>Wells, 5 Wright 291, and with the positive evidence as to the cost of mining ore, of its market value, supported by the amounts expended in mining by the principals \u2022 who paid and the agents who disbursed the money, it would have been error not to submit the question to the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-6\">The instructions of the court upon the questions of permanent improvements are abundantly sustained by authority: Voorhis <em>v. </em>Freeman, 2 W. &amp; S. 119; Pyle <em>v. </em>Pennock, Id. 390; Hill <em>v. </em>Sewald, 3 P. F. Smith 274.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-7\">The plaintiffs were rightly in possession of the machinery. When one fixes his own chattels on another\u2019s land, it is in legal effect a gift of them to the owner of the land: Hill <em>v. </em>Sewald, 3 P. F. Smith 271.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANY\">The recovery in ejectment evicted the tenants: Bauders <em>v. </em>Fletcher, 11 S. &amp;. R. 419; Ross <em>v. </em>Dysart, 9 Casey 452; Tiley <em>v. </em>Moyers, 7 Wright 410; Steel <em>v. </em>Frick, 6 P. F. Smith 175; Schuylkill Improvement Co. <em>v. </em>Schmoele, 7 P. F. Smith 271. It terminated the relation of landlord and tenant between the defendants and their lessees, and the right to remove any of the fixtures \u2014anything that gave the property its changed and distinctive character \u2014 was gone: Hill <em>v. </em>Sewald, 3 P. F. Smith 272; Heffner <em>v. </em>Lewis, 23 Id. 302; Hey <em>v. </em>Bruner, 11 Id. 87. The answers of the court were therefore consistent throughout.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-10\">The statement sent out with the jury was based upon evidence and was proper : Blight\u2019s Executors <em>v. </em>Ewing, 2 Casey 135.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A6X\">October 1st 1877.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b339-11\">Mr. Justice Mercur</author>\n<p id=\"A_3\">delivered the opinion of the court,</p>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">This was an action of trespass for mesne profits. Twenty errors are assigned. It is unnecessary to consider each separately. They involve a few principles only. The controlling questions are, the value of the ore taken; the manner of proving that value; and the character of the improvements which may be recouped or set off against the value of the ore mined and appropriated by and under the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-13\">1. The evidence shows the defendants were bona fide purchasers of the land for value, and were in possession under color of title when the trespasses were committed. At the time they took possession the mines were unimproved. They expended large sums of money in their development. They made permanent improvements of great value. Having acted in good faith in the working of the mines and in the removal of the ore, they should be chargeable for the latter only with its value in place: Forsyth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number><em>v. </em>Wells, 6 Wright 291; Herdic <em>v. </em>Young, 5 P. F. Smith 176; Coleman\u2019s Appeal, 12 Id. 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">. 2. Ore-leave, or the right to dig and take ore, can have no general market value. Its value depends on the position and circumstances of each particular mine; on the quality of the ore ; the cost of mining and preparing it for market; its proximity to the places where it is to be used ; and on the facilities for transportation : Coleman\u2019s Appeal, <em>supra. </em>Hence there was no error in the court charging as it did, substantially, that the value of the ore in place was to be ascertained by deducting the cost of mining, cleansing and delivering the ore in market, from its market value thus delivered \u2014 the difference being its value in place. Those costs and expenses only which are reasonable and necessary should be deducted from the gross receipts. The court very correctly said, to the jury, \u201c no extravagant or unnecessary expenditures, but only such, or so much thereof, as are proper and legitimate expenditures, should be taken into account in ascertaining the real or- legitimate cost of mining, or the value of the ore in place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">We discover no error in the mode of proving the necessary costs and expenses of operating the mines. Due regard should always, be had to the usual and ordinary manner of conducting the particular business in question. Each branch of industry has its usages and its practices. The work of mining is one of magnitude. It requires the employment of many men. Laborers, overseers, superintendents and operatives must perform their allotted parts. The keeping of a pay-roll is a usual and convenient practice. It furnishes a prompt and concise method oHmaking a daily record of current expenses. Confirmed, as its correctness was in this case, by the testimony of the operator and superintendent, it was clearly evidence proper to submit to the jury of the sums expended in operating the mines. Its effect was properly guarded and restricted by the learned judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">3. The action for mesne profits is equitable in its character: Morrison <em>v. </em>Robinson, 7 Casey 456; Zimmerman <em>v. </em>Eshbach, 3 Harris 417; Kille <em>et al. v. </em>Ege <em>et al, </em>1 Norris 102. Hence a bona fide occupant, under claim of title, who has made permanent and valuable improvements, may show' them to be a full compensation for the use of the premises: Morrison <em>v. </em>Robinson, <em>supra; </em>Kille <em>v. </em>Ege, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">The criterion of a fixture depends on the business for which the premises\u2019 are used. A fixture in a manufactory, mill or colliery may have no adaptation to many other kinds of business. Although not attached, yet, if it be designed for the convenience of trade on the premises, and be so used, or subject to be called into use at any time, it becomes a fixture. If the article is indispensable in carrying on the specific business, it becomes a part of the realty: Voorhis <em>v. </em>Freeman, 2 W. &amp; S. 116; Pyle <em>v. </em>Pennock, Id. 390. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>This rule, however, does not prevent a tenant, who erects fixtures for the benefit of his trade or business, from removing them from the demised premises within his <em>term. </em>The question here is between persons who were hostile claimants to the land. As between them, all the machinery and implements necessarily used in working the mines became a part of the realty. There was therefore no error in.the court charging, \u201cwhether fast or loose, all the machinery of an ore-bank which is necessary to constitute it such, and without which it .would not be an ore-bank equipped and ready for use as such, are a part of the freehold, and the recovery of the land by the plaintiffs in the action of ejectment gave to them the ore-banks on it, with all the machinery, whether fast or loose, necessary to constitute them such equipped and ready for use.\u201d That some machinery was essentially necessary to raise the ore and prepare it for market is very manifest. It was therefore proper to show what machinery was actually used for that purpose, and to submit its necessity and value to the jury. The evidence was rightly received.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The defendants are entitled to an' allowance for such improvements only as are of a lasting and permanent character, and which gave a permanently increased value to the land. This is substantially the third point submitted by the plaintiffs and affirmed by the court. We see no error in the qualification that the increased value may be of limited .duration. In answer to the plaintiffs\u2019 fifth point, the court said if they \u201cwere for temporary use only, and not structures of a lasting and permanent character, then they are not such improvements as entitle defendants to credit against the plaintiffs\u2019 demand.\u201d An examination of the answers to the numerous points presented to the court fails to discover any error. All questions relating to the permanency of improvements and of value to the premises were correctly answered.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">By the recovery of the land the plaintiffs also recovered all the fixtures thereon put there by the defendants or their lessees. By the execution of the writ of <em>habere facias possessionem </em>the plaintiffs were put in possession thereof. Right of property and actual possession were thus united in them. The right of the defendants to their equitable defence then became fixed. That right could not be impaired by the plaintiffs afterwards permitting the former lessees of the defendants to remove a portion of the machinery. Such a voluntary relinquishment by the plaintiffs of their property to those having no right thereto, either with or without consideration, could not affect the rights of the defendants, who were not a party to the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">\u25a0 Inasmuch as there was ample evidence of increased value to the premises by reason of the machinery and improvements, the court committed no error in permitting the defendants to send out a statement with the jury: Blight's Executors <em>v. </em>Ewing, 2 Casey 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>The case was well and carefully tried. The law was clearly and accurately stated by the learned judge. Substantial justice appears to have been reached; therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
