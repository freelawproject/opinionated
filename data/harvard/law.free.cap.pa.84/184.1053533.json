I give to my nephew, Enos P.

Barnard agreed to sell and convey to Milton Edwards, by good and sufficient title in fee clear of all encumbrances, all that part of the testator\u2019s lands devised to said Barnard, consisting of about. 180 acres, excepting a lot of 9 acres and 56 perches charged with the annual payment of thirty dollars to. be applied to the cemetery lot, and it was submitted to the court to determine whether the devisee had such an estate in the land as would enable him to convey an indefeasible fee to said Edwards.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-8\">The court did not file an opinion, but entered judgment <em>pro forma </em>for the plaintiff Barnard, which was the error assigned.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b185-9\"><em>H. C. Howard, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8q\">Barnard has a fee subject to be defeated by his dying without children and without having devised the lands; in which case the limitation over would take effect as an executory devise and be good unless the power of disposition here conferred is repugnant to any limitation over. There is, however, a broad distinction between an absolute power of disposition and a limited one, and when its power is limited, as here, to a simple right to dispose of the estate by will, which cannot take effect until the death of the first taker, there is nothing in the limitation over repugnant to the enjoyment of the estate by the first taker as fully as the testator intended, and the rule fails, and cannot be invoked to give Barnard an indefeasible title. There is no case in Pennsylvania which rules that a mere naked power of testamentary disposition is sufficient to destroy a limitation over which would be otherwise good as an executory devise where such devise was the manifest intent of the testator.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b185-10\"><em>Wm. M. Hayes, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AfW\">The proviso in the 7th item has no reference to the second item. If the testator had not intended a fee simple to be vested in Enos he would not have used the language \u201cto hold to him, his heirs and assigns,\u201d and had he proposed any limitation or proviso as to the devise to him he would have made it in the item itself. But even if the proviso does apply it does not take from Enos the fee, as the will gives him absolute control over the subject of the devise, power to will it without limiting him as to where he shall will it, and he has therefore an indefeasible estate: Reifsnyder <em>v. </em>Hunter, 7 Harris 41; Walker and Wife <em>v. </em>Vincent, Id. 369.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-11\">In the construction of wills, the law in doubtful c^ses leans in favor of an absolute rather than a defeasible estate; of a vested rather than a contingent one; of the primary rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>than the secondary intent; of the first rather than the second taker as the principal object of the testator\u2019s bounty, and of a distribution as nearly conformed to the general rules of inheritance as possible: Amelia Smith\u2019s Appeal, 11 Harris 9; Estate of Mary Biddle, 4 Casey 59; Naglee\u2019s Appeal, 9 Id. 89 ; McKee <em>v. </em>McKinley, Id. 92; Hitchcock <em>v. </em>Hitchcock, 11 Id. 393; Schoonmaker <em>v. </em>Stockton\u2019s Adm\u2019rs, 1 Wright 461; M\u00fctter\u2019s Estate, 2 Id. 314; Musselman\u2019s Estate, 3 Id. 469 ; Fulton <em>v. </em>Fulton, 2 Grant\u2019s Cases 28 ; Shutt <em>v. </em>Rambo, 7 P.

Barnard was expressly to him, his heirs and assigns. This clearly gave him full power over the estate in his lifetime. He could therefore sell and convey it at pleasure, there being no legal restriction upon his power. The proviso which it is supposed operates upon his estate in fact imposes no restrictions upon the power of alienation, but is simply an attempt on the part of the testator to provide for a contingency of dying without children, to enable Enos to devise the estate; a power which he would possess by the very nature of his absolute estate in fee. So in case he died without children, and without making a will; the testator gave the estate to his next of kin of the blood of the testator\u2019s father. This was merely an attempt to regulate the descent when cast. There was no devise over to any one, as the object of the testator\u2019s bounty, \u25a0 evincing a design to create an executory devise or a conditional fee. So far as the devise to Enos is involved, the proviso was simply a work of supererogation, the fee given to him being absolute and unrestricted, and no other person being intended to take in the event of his being, childless. His power to alien in his lifetime was therefore not restricted either at law or by the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">Judgment afiirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
