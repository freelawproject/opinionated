Subsequently, a difficulty arising about the construction to be given to this order, the'court made another order, explanatory of the first, and directing that if the terms of the second order were not accepted that the motion for a new trial should be reinstated. The plaintiff refused, whereupon the court made absolute the original motion for a new trial. <em>Held, </em>that this action of the court was not erroneous.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b328-9\">May 17th 1877.</otherdate>\n<judges data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"Aqq\">Before Agnew, O.

Defendants moved for a new trial which the court laid over to await the verdict in the second case. This second case was called for trial on the 24th of April 1876, and on the 2d of May following a sealed verdict was rendered, \u201c For the plaintiffs for the land in dispute, and we assess the damages at twelve cents per ton for coal and fifty cents per tree.\u201d This verdict the court ordered the prothonotary to record as follows, \u201c For plaintiffs for the land in dispute.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-6\">The plaintiffs moved the court for a rule on defendants to show cause why the verdict should not be -amended according to the sealed verdict of jury, by assessing damages or mesne profits, at twelve cents per ton for coal and fifty cents per tree; and should this motion be denied, then they moved for a new trial, because no damages were allowed by the verdict as recorded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-7\">Subsequently plaintiffs moved the court for leave \u201cto withdraw so much of said motion as requests the court to grant them a new trial,\u201d and followed this with a petition asking leave to amend the record \u201c so that the subject of mesne profits might be entirely omitted from the same.\u201d The court refused this petition, but gave leave to plaintiffs, if they so desired it, \u201c to file a motion in ordinary form to strike out all claims for mesne profits, so that the issue can be tried hereafter on a separate issue after adjudication of the title.\u201d The court made no disposition of the motion to withdraw the motion for a new trial. On the same day \u2014 the 12th of July 1876, which was the last day of the term \u2014 the motions for new trials in both cases were argued, and the following order made by the court:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-8\">\u201c The motions for new trials are refused on the following terms and conditions, to be accepted .by the counsel \u2014 acceptance to be indicated by signing this paper. The record is amended in both \u25a0\u2019the cases so as to strike out all that relates to mesne profits and damages, and the verdicts are to stand for the plaintiffs for the land in dispute. The question of damages is to be settled hereafter in a separate action or actions for mesne profits, to be brought at any time and tried after the final adjudication of the title to the land; plaintiffs not to be prejudiced by lapse of time from this date on the question of mesne profits.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-9\">The counsel of both plaintiffs and defendants accepted and signed these terms, and they were filed of record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-10\">A controversy subsequently arising about the construction to be given them, the defendants filed a petition which set forth:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-11\"><em>\u201c </em>That at the time said order was made and accepted, it was the understanding of the counsel of the defendants, as wrell as of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>court, and, as your petitioners believe, of the counsel of the plaintiffs, that if, upon final adjudication of the title to the lands in dispute, it should be determined that the title to said lands is in the defendants (the Riddlesburg Coal and Iron Company), the plaintiffs were not to demand or claim mesne profits, and any action or actions that they might institute for mesne profits should be discontinued, and that that is the construction which the court intended should be put upon said order; and further, that the counsel for plaintiffs now insist upon an entirely different construction of said order, and claim that the plaintiffs have the right to recover mesne profits, even if the defendants should obtain two verdicts and judgments in ejectment for the land \u2014 a construction utterly at variance with that which was intended by the court, and your petitioners are apprehensive that great wrong and injustice may result to them if the construction of said order contended for by the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel should prevail. They therefore pray the cpurt to take such action in the premises as will effect and carry out the intentions of the court and the understanding of the counsel of the parties at the time the order aforesaid was made.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-5\">Whereupon the court, on the 26th of September 1876, made the following order:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-6\">\u201c The order of the court of 12th of July, refusing the motions for new trials, and amending the record by striking out all relating to mesne profits, in both cases, wasunade with the design to eliminate from both cases all that related to mesne profits, and allow the title to the land to be first settled by two verdicts and judgments in ejectment, and thereafter Lingenfelter\u2019s claim to damages, provided he ultimately recovered the land. It was not the intention that Lingenfelter should recover any mesne profits whatever, if the title to the land was ultimately settled to be in the defendants. The oral explanation of the court b\u00e9fore the order was made was full and explicit, and, as the court understood it, the contemplated action of the court was accepted and concurred in by the counsel on both sides.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-7\">\u201c If the order of court, as reduced to writing, will admit of any other construction, it is an error and must be corrected. It is hereby supplemented by this writing, intended to make plain its meaning (if, indeed, there can be any doubt in regard thereto), to be accepted by the counsel on both sides by appending their signatures hereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-8\">\u201c If not so accepted, the said order of the court is hereby revoked, and the motions for new trials are reinstated on the argument list, with the like effect as if no such order had been made.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-9\">The defendants accepted this order, but the plaintiffs refused, and thereupon the court reversed the oi\u2019der of the 12th of July 1876, and reinstated the motions for new trials, which were granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>on October lltli 1876.

In granting new trials the court knows no limitations, except in some particular cases, but will grant a new trial where it tends to the advancement of justice: Steinmetz <em>et al. v. </em>Curry, 1 Dallas 234; Cowperthwaite <em>v. </em>Jones, 2 Id. 56; Jordan <em>v. </em>Meredith, 3 Yeates 318; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Eberle, 3 S. &amp; R. 9.

On the argument of these motions on the 12th of July, the last day of the term and last sitting of the court, much discussion took place, in which the court participated. The account of the plaintiffs in error is, that after defendants\u2019 attorney had concluded his ai-gument, the \u201c court began to intimate opinions, saying if the defendants did not agree to so and so, new trials would be refused, and if plaintiffs did not consent to this and that, new trials would be granted. Before the attorney for plaintiffs had fairly commenced his reply, the court stated the substance of the agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>of that date, and the plaintiffs at once accepted.\u201d After consultation, the defendants also accepted, and the court reduced the agreement to -writing. The judge says, in his amendment of September 26th 1876, that the \u201coral explanation of the court before the order was made was full and explicit, and, as the court understood it, the contemplated action of the court was accepted and concurred in by the counsel on both sides. If the order of the court as reduced to writing will admit of any other construction, it is an error and must be corrected.\u201d The court accordingly stated in writing the agreement as proposed by it and accepted, to stand as an amendment of the former writing, and, to prevent all complaint of injustice, ordered it to be presented for acceptance by the counsel, and if not accepted, then ordered a new trial. It was not accepted, and after a full time allowed, viz., on the 11th of October, a new trial was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Thus the undeniable history of the case makes it plain that the ordinary course of trial by jury was interrupted by the act of the court itself, which at that instant had power to grant or refuse the pending motions, and that the judgment following the agreement was not an adversary judgment in due course of law, but was upon consent, and is to be likened rather to a confessed judgment. Being founded on the agreement, in one sense imposed by the court, it is plain that an error in the agreement ought to be corrected, and that no court, having the interests of justice in view, would suffer its own act to conclude the parties. It is perfectly evident that the agreement became immediately the subject of difference of opinion between the opposite counsel, for the motion to reform the judgment came on the first day of the next term, at the first opportunity. And- that this difference of opinion is vital, is made manifest by the argument of the counsel \u2018of the plaintiffs in error, which attributed to the judge a want of knowledge, when the agreement was written, of the effect of a verdict in ejectment upon the right of the plaintiffs to recover mesne profits. The purpose of the judge was to defer the question of mesne profits until a final determination of the title, and then to make the recovery of any profits contingent on .this question of title. Instead of this, the plaintiffs in error seek to make the judgment absolute as to the right to the mesne profits for the space intervening between the service of the writ and execution of the <em>habere facias possessionem,, </em>which-we do not doubt is contrary to the intention of the agreement of July 12th, though not expressed so as to save it from a decided difference of opinion on this point. The court was therefore right in amending the agreement, if agreed to, and if not, in setting it aside as contrary to its own intention when drawn up and offered for acceptance. Unless this power be admitted the grossest injustice might be done. Courts do not sit to catch parties in legal traps.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Proceeding affirmed in both cases.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
