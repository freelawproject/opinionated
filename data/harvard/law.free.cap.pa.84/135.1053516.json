It appeared by the deposition taken under this rule'that Sarah Wessner was the wife of S. Wessner,'who acted as her agent, and that Unangst was only surety. The court struck off the judgment as to Sarah Wessner but discharged the rule as to Unangst. A motion was then made \u2022to strike it off as to him, which was refused, and this refusal was the error here assigned.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b136-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number><em>W. F. Shepherd, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"As1\">The release of the principal discharged the surety. In a joint action the plaintiff must succeed against all the defendants or none: O\u2019Neal <em>v. </em>O\u2019Neal, 4 W. &amp; S. 131; Schoneman <em>v. </em>Fegley, 7 Barr 433; 1 Phillips on Ev. 507; Weall <em>v. </em>King, 12 East 452; Lopes <em>v. </em>DeTastet, 1 B. &amp; B. 538 ; Loew <em>v. </em>Stocker, 11 P. F. Smith 347 ; and the rule is the same in the dase of two joint debtors in a judgment: Burson <em>v. </em>Kincaid, 3 P. &amp; W. 57 ; Milliken <em>v. </em>Brown, 1 Rawle 391, 398; and especially is it held in the case of principal and surety in judgment ; if principal is released the surety is also released: Mortland <em>v. </em>Himes, 8 Barr 265. The reason for this doctrine is found in the fact that the effect of the discharge of the principal is to increase the responsibility of the surety. This the court will not permit.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b136-6\"><em>J. W. Roseberry, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3z\">A release is defined to be \u201c a contract whereby a man gives or discharges a right of action which he has or may claim against another, or that which is his.\u201d But there is no evidence of such a contract, nor is there a particle of evidence tending, to show in the remotest degree, anything by word or deed that could be construed into a release, or intention to release, either of the debtors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b136-7\">The argument therefore that a release of the principal discharges the surety falls, founded as it is on premises which have no existence.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A0g\">March 26th 1877,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b136-8\">The judgment of the Supreme Court was entered,</p>\n<author id=\"b136-9\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AXg\">When one goes upon a note or bond with a married woman, whether as a principal or a surety, he is the only party bound. When Mrs. Wessner\u2019s name was stricken out of the judgment, which was irregularly confessed against her, Unangst stood where he was before and at the time of the execution of the single bill, and his being a surety made no difference in' his liability. We perceive no error in striking out her name.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
