At the time of the death of the testator Elizabeth and Mary were both unmarried and considerably advanced in years. The widow of testator died in 1838, and Elizabeth died unmarried in 1864.

The other third, $4289.60, was claimed by John Gensemer, as surviving husband of Mary, and under the above-cited clause in the will as the heir of his wife. This claim was resisted by the appellants, who were the heirs and next of kin of Mary Gensemer, who claimed to have the fund distributed among them, as the persons designated by the testator to take the fund realized from the sale of the property devised to her for life, and after her death to be converted and a portion thereof limited to her heirs by the terms of the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-6\">On behalf of John Gensemer it was contended before the auditor that as heir of the wife, or as standing relatively to her personal estate in a position corresponding to that of the heir of realty, he was entitled to the one-third of the fund; while for the testator\u2019s grandchildren it was urged that the term \u201c heirs\u201d is to be taken as used in its strict legal sense and does not include a husband.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-7\">The auditor, A.

Exceptions were taken to this report, which the court overruled and confirmed the report, from which decree this appeal was taken.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b243-8\"><em>Thos. E. Franklin </em>and <em>N. </em>Ellmaker, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AuT\">The surviving husband is not the heir of his wife and does not take under that designation, unless the will clearly shows that such was the testator\u2019s intention. His interest in her real estate is not that of heir, but of tenant by the curtesy, to affect which the wife must have been, during her lifetime, seised of an estate in fee. But, as the direction to sell after Mary\u2019s death works, as is stated, a conversion into personalty, it is contended that the husband surviving is entitled to claim as her personal representative under the Act of Distributions. We think it very clear that he cannot claim directly through her as her personal representative, because she never had, and in the nature of things never could have, any interest whatever in the legacy. Her interest was altogether real, a life estate in the land. The legacy was not to her and her heirs, nor to her or her heirs, but directly to her heirs. The word \u201cheirs\u201d must, therefore, be construed,- not as substitutionary, but as a designation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>of the persons to take after her death, and as it could not he known who would be her heirs until her death, it follows that no vesting of the legacy could take place during her lifetime, and that no interest therein could pass from her to her personal representative at her death. This presents a striking difference from the class of cases relied on by the learned auditor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-6\">If then it be admitted, as we think it must be, that Grensemer, the surviving husband of Mary, cannot claim any share in this bequest as the personal representative of his deceased wife, can he claim it as filling the description contained in the will designating the person to receive it as her heir ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-7\">The word \u201c heirs\u201d applied to personalty, means next of kin: Vaux <em>v. </em>Henderson and Horseman <em>v. </em>Abbey, 1 Jac. &amp; Walk. 388; Guttings <em>v. </em>McDermott, 2 Myl. &amp; K. 69; 3 Redfield on Wills, p. 434, chap. 13, sect. 46, and authorities there cited; Scudder <em>v. </em>Vanarsdale, 2 Beasley 109 ; Hankins\u2019s Estate, 4 W. &amp; S. 300 ; Doody <em>v. </em>Higgins, 9 Hare, App. 35 (41 Eng. Chan. Rep.).</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-8\">And \u201c next of kin\u201d means nearest of kin without reference to the Statute of Distributions: Elmsley <em>v. </em>Young, 2 Myl. &amp; K. 270 (7 Eng.

This is the doctrine of the civil law, and is universally recognised by all the authorities, both in England and in this country: Watt <em>v. </em>Watt, 3 Ves. Jr. 244 and Sumner\u2019s note; Garrick <em>v. </em>Lord Camden, 14 Id. 372; 2 Kent\u2019s Com. 136; Storer <em>v. </em>Wheatly\u2019s Ex\u2019rs, 1 Barr 506. Furguson <em>v. </em>Stuart\u2019s Ex\u2019rs, 14 Ohio 140, cited by the auditor, is not at all in conflict with these authorities.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b244-11\"><em>H. C. Brubaker, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AH9\">The cases of Patterson <em>v. </em>Hawthorn, and the other authorities in the report, were applied by the auditor, not for the purpose of showing that they were strictly analogous to the present one, as contended by the counsel for appellants in their argument', hut merely as authority for the construction of the word \u201c heirs\u201d with reference to p\u00e9rsonalty, so as to include the husband. The auditor says expressly that he \u201c does not wish to be understood as holding that in this, as in the cases cited, the bequests were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>vested in the persons whose distributees or representatives are claiming the money so bequeathed. On the contrary, in his opinion they clearly did not so vest, for the legacies are not given to Elizabeth and Mary, or their heirs by substitution for them, but <em>directly </em>to those heirs \u2014 that is, to those who shall be found to answer that description, when the fund out of which the legacies are to be paid comes to be distributed. If, therefore, the husband of Mary is entitled to a share of this fund, he is so entitled, not derivatively, but directly, as falling within the terms used to designate the legatee.\u201d</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Aq9\">May 28th 1877.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b245-6\">Mr. Justice Gordon</author>\n<p id=\"AmT\">delivered the opinion of the court,</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">The main intent of the testator was to provide for the support and maintenance of his wife and two unmarried daughters, Elizabeth and Mary, for and during their several lives. For this purpose he set apart his plantation adjoining John Becker and others, together with the furniture of his house, stock, farming utensils, &amp;c., and should the property so set apart prove insufficient to afford the maintenance thus designat\u00e9d, he directed that it should be supplemented from other parts of his estate. Having in this manner carefully provided for those whom he considered the most dependant1 upon his care and providence, he next proceeds to dispose of such of his estate as should remain after the death of these prime objects of his bounty. To this end he directs that the whole of his property, real and personal, thus remaining undisposed of, shall be sold by his executors, and the proceeds thereof divided in the manner following, viz.: \u201c.My son Christian shall have no part of the money raised out of my real estate; that is to be divided among my three daughters, Esther, the wife of Abraham Shelly, and the heirs of Elizabeth and Mary, in equal shares, including such sums received by them previous to such settlement.\u201d ^From the foregoing it is apparent that the fund for distribution is strictly personal, and even the idea that any part of it sprang from real estate, is maintained only in order to indicate from what portion of that fund Christian shall be excluded. 'Git follows, that this matter must be governed by the ordinary rules applicable to the distribution of personal property. (/Such being the case, unless a contrary intent is indicated by the will, we must construe the word \u201cheirs,\u201d as founcHn that will, as equivalent to \u201c representatives\u201d or \u201c distributees.\u201d Gin such case, the husband must be taken to be an \u201cheir\u201d of his wife as to her personal estate; and not only do our distribution acts so in effect provide, but this idea is sustained by many decisions, commencing with Patterson <em>v. </em>Hawthorn, 12 S. &amp; R. 113, and ending with McGill\u2019s Appeal, 11 P. F. Smith 46. This conclusion is objected to for the reason, that, as this legacy did not vest in Mary, wife of , John Gens\u00e9mer, the appellee, but was limited directly to her heirs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>the above cited cases do not apply, inasmuch as the husband could not take as administrator or representative of his wife. But chis seems to be the very point met in the case of Gibbons <em>v. </em>Eairlamb, 2 Casey 217; for the question therein arose whether the husband of a female legatee, who died before the time at which the bequest would have vested was to be regarded as her \u201c heir or representative,\u201d within the meaning of the will, and it was held that he must so be considered though he could not take as administrator. Regarding the matter from the stand-point of legal interpretation and we conclude that the decree of the court below must be sustained. Nor can we come to a different conclusion in seeking for the testamentary intent. Without a single expression to the contrary, why should we suppose that Jacob Schumaker intended that the words which he used should have a meaning different from that of their well known legal signification ? In the case of Esther, the wife of Abraham Shelly, the gift is absolute and unconditional, and yet the testator must have known that, in the event of her death, her husband would take as her representative. But if he did not intend to exclude the husband of Esther from the possibility of his bounty, we may reasonably infer that he did not intend to treat in 'a different manner the husband which Mary might choose. That he contemplated the possibility of her marriage is sufficiently obvious from the fact that he limits the legacy to her heirs directly, whereas, had he considered it certain that she would die unmarried, it is more than probable that he would have provided for the distribution of this remainder of his estate among his own heirs and beneficiaries. If, however, he had her marriage in view he must at the same time have had in view the relation which her husband would occupy to her personal property in case of her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
