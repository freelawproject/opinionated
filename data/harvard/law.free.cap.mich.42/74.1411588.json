The action was brought by Markham against Thomas J. Fitzgerald, a building contractor; -and James Gehan, William Farrell and Denis McCarthy, a building committee who had contracted with him, were brought in as garnishees. . Their disclosure showed that the contract was made with Fitzgerald and J. W. GriswiPld jointly. The garnishees were discharged with a judgment for costs in their favor.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b90-12\"><em>Frank G.

There was therefore no ground for a recovery, and the judgment in favor of defendants must be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b90-15\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
