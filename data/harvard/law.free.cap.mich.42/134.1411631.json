Doggett, </em>6 Pick., 359; 1 Chitty Pl., 11; where a minor joins in a contract as a member of a firm, the law implies a promise to himself and not to some one representing him, <em>Corey v. Corey, </em>19 Pick., 29.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b150-13\">Campbell, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2H\">In this case the court below held that where a joint contract was sued on, made by an infant and an adult, under which money had been earned, the father of the infant could not sue with the adult in his own name' as the infant\u2019s substitute in the action, as if himself had been joint contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-14\">This ruling is correct. An infant\u2019s contract of partnership is not void. <em>Dunton v. Brown, </em>31 Mich., 182. The suit was for a completed cause of action, which is for the infant\u2019s benefit. The contract was either the joint contract of the firm, or the sole contract of Jenkinson; and there was never any contract relation between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>Farr and John Osburn, the father of the minor George. The infant should have been the plaintiff, and not his father. <em>Teed v.
