Archer, </em>2 Term.R., 270; <em>Rex v. Bowen, </em>5 Term R., 156; in Massachusetts they have been held to be <em>quasi </em>criminal cases, <em>Hill v. Wells, </em>6 <em>Pick., </em>104; <em>Cummings v. Hodgdon, </em>13 Met., 246; <em>Hyde v. Chapin, </em>2 Cush., 77; the requirement that the jury should be convinced, beyond a reasonable doubt, of the guilt of the defendant, applies in bastardy cases, <em>Zweifel v. State, </em>27 Wis., 397.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b157-12\">Attorney General <em>Otto Kirchner </em>for the People.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AmT\">The object of proceedings under the Bastardy Act (Comp. L., ch. 54) is not punitory merely, but to enforce obedience to a father\u2019s duty to support his offspring, <em>Coon v. Hitchcock, </em>11 Chic. Leg. News, 258; 1 Chitty\u2019s Bl. Com., 458 et seq.; 4 id., 65.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b157-13\">Campbell, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXS\">The only error set up in this cause, which is a bastardy case, is that the court below denied a request to charge the jury that they should not find against the respondent below unless the testimony satisfied them beyond a reasonable doubt of his guilt, and did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>charge them that they might be satisfied by a clear preponderance of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-3\">The nature of these proceedings was explained in <em>Cross v. People, </em>8 Mich., 118, as not criminal in the proper sense of the term, but special and peculiar. The judgment, if it can be properly called a judgment, involves none but civil consequences. We do not think the rule holding it necessary to establish misconduct beyond- a reasonable doubt is one which needs any extension. It is very proper where a person is subjected to criminal punishment, and is well rooted in criminal jurisprudence. But it is the nature of the prosecution and not the character of the act which authorizes its application. We held in <em>Elliott v. Van Buren, </em>33 Mich., 49, that when a criminal act came in controversy in a civil cause, the rule did not apply. We think the principle of that case governs this, and that there was no error in the rulings below.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b158-5\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
