Complainant Parks testified that he saw the mortgagee Allen driving past the place where he was at work, and that he called to him to stop and went out to where he was. and asked him if he had the mortgage with him. Allen said he had, and also said that he had some other mortgages and was going to Caro to get some money on them; Parks said he would pay him some money, and Allen asked him how much; Parks- said $40, and Allen said he would not take any of it unless he could have the whole; Parks then said, \u201c Very well, I will pay you the whole of it,\u201d and Allen replied that he had all the money he wanted to use that day and had not time to figure up the interest. Parks then went to his house and got his coat and some money, while Allen waited for him \u25a0 in his wagon, and when Parks returned he got in and 'they drove on together. Parks told Allen that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>the money there to pay him that mortgage, and held it out towards him; Allen answered as before that he had all the monay he wanted to use, and would not take it; Parks repeated his offer and Allen his reply ten or a dozen times on the road, and when they reached the place of a mutual acquaintance named Covey, Parks alighted and in Covey\u2019s presence repeated his tender. The money was in greenbacks with one or two National bank bills.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-4\">Defendant\u2019s testimony set forth that the offer of money was involved with other matters of mutual indebtedness. He claimed that when the money was first offered he said \u201cGive me your money,\u201d and Parks said \u201cGive me the mortgage;\u201d Allen replied that he, Parks, could not discharge the mortgage, and after some other talk asked him how much money he had; Parks said \u2018more than enough to pay him.\u2019 Allen replied \u201cCount out your-money; I don\u2019t know as this mortgage has anything to do with our other deal;\u201d and he then laid down his lines and took out some papers and looked them over to find the mortgage. Both parties appear to have lost their tempers, and Parks accused Allen of talking about him and his wife, on which both began quarreling and swearing, and Allen put' up his papers and drove on. He afterwards left the mortgage with an attorney for foreclosure, but sent word to Parks to pay before a certain time if he wanted to save costs, but Parks did not pay and he proceeded to foreclose, on which Parks filed his bill to compel a discharge. This bill was dismissed below and complainant appeals.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b499-5\"><em>W. C. Buchanan </em>and <em>H. P. Atwood </em>for complainants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Az3\">A tender is good if enough money is offered, and must be received, <em>Wheeler v. Knaggs, </em>8 Ohio, 169; 2 Jones on Mortgages, \u00a7 893 et seq.; an unconditional tender discharges the lien of a mortgage even though not kept good, <em>Potts v. Plaisted, </em>30 Mich., 149; and if refused the mortgagee is entitled to the statutory penalty, <em>Barnard v. Harrison, 30 </em>Mich., 8; <em>Collar v. Harrison, </em>id., 66.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b500-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number><em>B. W. Huston </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYuQ\">A tender made without notice at an unfit place may be declined until the creditor can examine the account, <em>Waldron v. Murphy, </em>40 Mich., 668.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b500-4\">Marston, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ai8\">We are of opinion that there was no such tender made as would discharge the mortgage lien, much less entitle the complainants to the statutory penalty. The place where the tender was made and the circumstances attending the same, show that there was no willful refusal by the defendant to receive the amount due, while he did decline going into other matters of dealing between himself and the complainant, and he afterwards and before any posts were incurred offered to receive the amount due on the mortgage note.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">In view of all 'the facts we think complainants should be permitted to redeem, the bill in this case having been filed before the time for redemption expired, upon paying the amount of the note with interest thereon at the rate therein prescribed, together with the costs of foreclosure, with interest thereon, but not the attorney\u2019s fee provided for in the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">The defendant herein should recover full costs in both courts.</p>\n<judges id=\"b500-7\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
