The whole agreement between the parties was oral.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">. The circuit judge was of opinion that there was a sufficient transfer of possession of the property to constitute a delivery under the circumstances. We agree in this view. It was all the delivery that could well have been made under the circumstances without requiring Anderson to remove the hogs from the farm where he was employed to some other place where they would have been less in his possession than where they were; and for this there could have been no sufficient reason. The case is within the reason of <em>Adams Mining Co. v. Senter, </em>26 Mich., 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The judgment must be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b571-7\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
