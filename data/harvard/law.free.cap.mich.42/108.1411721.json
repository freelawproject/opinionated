If he had delivered the deed, the grantee was the owner in fee simple; if not, she had no interest.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-10\">Appeal from Wayne.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"AlD\">Submitted October 22.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ANL\">Decided October 30.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Bill to set aside a deed.

The prayer of complainant for a release was denied, and the court being of opinion that in making the deed to defendant complainant reserved to himself the use of the premises until his death, decreed that he have a life estate therein and enjoined defendant from any interference therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Under the pleadings in this case, and the deed of conveyance which was in the usual form, we do not quite see how a life estate, only could be given to the complainant. If there was a delivery of the deed the defendant was the absolute owner in fee simple of the property, while if the deed was not delivered she had no interest whatever therein. A careful examination of the. evidence satisfies us that the complainant never delivered or 'authorized the delivery or recording of this deed. Of this we have no reasonable doubt. It follows therefore that complainant is entitled to the relief sought, and a decree will be entered accordingly, with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b125-8\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
