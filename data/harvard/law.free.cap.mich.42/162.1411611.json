B sought to prove this defense by calling the plaintiff L as a witness, but L testified that he did not authorize his clerk to sell on his own account or to sell for wood, and that it had not been his custom to allow him to sell in that way. <em>Held </em>that B could hardly complain of the refusal to allow him <em>to </em>ask L if \u00a3ie had not <em>on </em>other occasions permitted his clerk to sell on his own account; or to go over in a general way the ground which had already been occupied by more definite questions and answers.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b178-9\">An*action for the value of merchandise was defended on the ground that by plaintiff\u2019s authority the sale had been made by his clerk on the latter\u2019s own account, and payment had been made to the clerk in wood. Defendant called the plaintiff as his witness, \u2022 and the latter\u2019s testimony showed that the sale had been in part on credit and in his presence, but that he had not authorized the clerk to sell on his own account. The bill of exceptions states that it did not appear that plaintiff knew of any other arrangement between defendant and his clerk, and there was no evidence that any part of the negotiation took place at any other time. <em>Held </em>that the court did not err to defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>prejudice in refusing to allow him to swear that on the occasion of the sale he had made a private arrangement with the clerk to pay him in wood.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-4\">Error to Wayne.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"AnV\">Submitted Oct. 15.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AEq\">Decided Nov. 29.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-5\">Assumpsit.

He recovered before the justice and afterwards on appeal, and Burger has brought the ease here on exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">At the time the articles were sold one Herbst was serving Limbaeh as his clerk, and the theory of the defense in the circuit court was that Herbst, by authority of Limbaeh, sold the goods for wood to be paid to himself, and that the wood had been paid, and to prove this defense he made Limbaeh his witness; and the latter, testifying in that character, swore that Herbst was clerk for him, and sold the goods to Burger, and in effect that the sale was in his presence. But he further , testified, as Burger\u2019s witness, that- he did not authorize Herbst to sell on his own account, or to sell for wood, and moreover that Herbst on the very occasion told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>him that Burger wanted to buy on credit, and inquired of witness if he should sell in that way, and that witness told him to do so, and that Burger said he would pay and actually did pay five dollars. He also swore on Burger\u2019s part that it had not been his custom to allow Herbst to sell goods for pay to be taken by himself. Having made this explicit showing by Limbach as his own witness, Burger is hardly justified in complaining of the refusal to allow him to inquire further of Limbach whether he had not on other occasions permitted Herbst to sell on his own account; nor of the refusal to let him go over the same ground in a general way, which had been covered already by more definite questions and answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">The defense impliedly admitted that Burger knew he was buying at Limbach\u2019s shop and that the goods were his, and that Herbst could not sell them as his own without authority from Limbach. And the bill of exceptions states that it did not appear that Limbach knew of any other arrangement between his clerk and Burger than that which Burger had proved by Limbach. Moreover there seems to have been no evidence given or offered to prove that the sale or any part of the negotiation occurred at some other time. \u2018 Hence it is not perceived that the court erred to Burger\u2019s prejudice in refusing to permit the latter to swear that on the occasion specified he made a private arrangement with Herbst to pay him in wood.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Whilst some of the rulings might very well have been different, we are not satisfied that there are any which would justify a reversal. The case derives a peculiar complexion from the showing actually made on Burger\u2019s part through Limbach himself, and from the shape of the questions which were ruled down.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">After considerable attention to the record we think the judgment should be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b180-7\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
