If such was the fact, it would have been proper to join him as defendant (Comp. L., \u00a7 6207), but the suit would not fail for the non-joinder. The only effect upon the verdict would be to limit the recovery by excluding that which the father occupied. Comp. L., \u00a7 6206. The case ,bears no resemblance to <em>Hodson v. Van Fossen, </em>26 Mich., 68, where the possession in question was that of husband and wife, and incapable of severance on judicial process.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">The case does not show that the father claimed a right to occupy and enjoy the whole land jointly with the defendant; but if it had, the plaintiff would have been entitled to go to the jury on that question. The charge was broad enough to put the plaintiff out of court on the fact \u2014 which seems not to have been disputed\u2014 that the father occupied a part of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The judgment must be reversed with costs and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b121-6\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
