The other defendants suffered default.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-13\">The issue between the bank, and the corporation defendant was tried before the circuit judge without a jury, and he allowed a recovery for the amount of the note on special findings which are brought up for review by writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-14\">There is no bill of exceptions and the evidence on which the circuit judge acted is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-15\">The only question possible is whether the facts support the judgment, and we are entirely satisfied they do.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>It is suggested that the case fails to establish authority in Morrison to execute the paper, but this' is not so. The facts are abundantly sufficient to show authority. It is objected, however, that it appears from the judge\u2019s report that the facts in question wer\u00e9 found \u201con parol proof, duly objected to,\u201d and on what appeared in and by the printed report or books referred to marked \u201cExhibit 1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-3\">Were it true that record evidence was required, we cannot say it was not given. The report and books here mentioned are not in the record, and it is incumbent on \u25a0 an excepting party to make it appear-that his exception is well taken. , But it was competent for the corporation to authorize the treasurer by parol. The point is wholly untenable on many grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">The case presents nothing further that deserves comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The judgment should be affirmed with costs</p>\n<judges id=\"b479-6\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
