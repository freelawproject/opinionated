Rocco, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b578-17\">{\u00b6 1} Defendant-appellant, Shawn Geiter, appeals from the trial court\u2019s order denying his motion to suppress evidence; a jury subsequently convicted Geiter of drug possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>{\u00b6 2} Geiter presents one assignment of error. He argues that the trial court incorrectly denied his motion to suppress evidence, because the facts failed to justify the application of the \u201cgood faith\u201d exception to the exclusionary rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">{\u00b6 3} Upon a review of the record, this court finds that the trial court committed no error. Therefore, Geiter\u2019s argument is rejected, and the trial court\u2019s order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">{\u00b6 4} The state presented the testimony of Cleveland police officer Vasile Nan at the hearing on Geiter\u2019s motion. On the afternoon of October 4, 2008, Nan was on routine patrol in his zone car. His car was not equipped with a computer; thus, he relied upon information he obtained from the police dispatcher.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">{\u00b6 5} As was his regular practice, Nan performed a random \u201ccheck on a plate\u201d of a car in front of him. Nan testified, \u201cInitially, the dispatcher said [it] checked okay and gave the description of the vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">{\u00b6 6} However, \u201c[a] few seconds later, she came back and stated that [the plate] was showing as a stolen vehicle in our local system, meaning the Cleveland [one].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">{\u00b6 7} Based upon that information, Nan decided to conduct a traffic stop. Nan testified that the vehicle, which Geiter drove, \u201cpulled into the parking lot of the rec center\u201d in compliance with Nan\u2019s signal to stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">{\u00b6 8} As Nan approached the driver\u2019s side on foot, Geiter \u201crolled the window down.\u201d Nan stated that he asked Geiter who the car belonged to and \u201cnoticed at this point there was a strong odor of burned marijuana coming from inside the vehicle.\u201d Nan arrested Geiter at once; several other officers arrived on the scene to assist him.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-11\">{\u00b6 9} Geiter was handcuffed, patted down, and placed in the zone car. The pat-down search yielded \u201csuspected crack cocaine.\u201d Nan and his colleagues \u201clooked around the area [Geiter] was sitting in, located some burned marijuana and also under the seat of the driver [Nan] found a nine millimeter High Point pistol.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-12\">{\u00b6 10} Nan further testified that approximately 20 minutes later, \u201c[o]nce everything settled down,\u201d he \u201crequested [his] dispatcher to do a search of the reports [about the vehicle], and she found the report of the recovery,\u201d i.e., Nan learned that the vehicle Geiter drove was his mother\u2019s and that although the vehicle had been stolen in July 2008, Geiter\u2019s mother had recovered it the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-13\">{\u00b6 11} Nan explained, \u201cAnd somehow, when [the Cleveland police officers] did the recovery [report], the city part was not clicked to clear the vehicle as a stolen vehicle, and it was still active.\u201d Nan conceded that at the time of the traffic stop, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>the other two police databases, \u201cNCIC and LEADS,\u201d showed accurate information, viz., that the vehicle was \u201crecovered\u201d by its owner. The evidence presented at the hearing further showed that Getter\u2019s mother arrived at the scene to retrieve her car before the officers transported Getter to the station.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">{\u00b6 12} Getter later was indicted on four counts: carrying a concealed weapon, possession of drugs, drug trafficking, and possession of criminal tools. Each count contained at least one forfeiture specification, and counts two and three also contained a firearm specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">{\u00b6 13} Getter filed a motion to suppress evidence, but the trial court denied his motion after conducting a hearing. The trial court explained its reasoning as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c[In] examining the facts known at the moment of the arrest. Information an officer receives over police radio must ordinarily be considered trustworthy.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cMoreover, a mistake of fact will not lead to the suppression of evidence where the mistake was understandable and a reasonable response to the situation facing the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cTherefore, I do make the finding that the actual stop of the vehicle in this case is not unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c * * * I don\u2019t find the police acted in bad faith in pulling the vehicle over based on what he was told from dispatch.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-11\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cI also don\u2019t find he acted improperly when he * * * took the defendant out of the vehicle and patted him down for his own safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-12\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c * * * [A]t that point in time, he found the crack cocaine that was on the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-13\">{\u00b6 20} The trial court further explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b580-14\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c[U]pon finding out that the vehicle wasn\u2019t stolen, the police officer in this matter had already removed the Defendant from the car. [Nan] had already smelled the marijuana emanating from the car, and they had already searched the vehicle and also searched the Defendant and found * * * cocaine on the Defendant and then they found the gun in the car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-15\">{\u00b6 22} The court concluded its analysis by stating that the police search of the area in which Getter was sitting also was permissible; Nan by that time had \u201cevidence of [the existence of] criminal activity because there was marijuana emanating from the vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-16\">{\u00b6 23} After the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence, Getter elected to try the forfeiture specifications to the bench while the rest of his case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>proceeded to a jury trial. At the conclusion of the state\u2019s case-in-chief, the trial court granted Getter\u2019s motion for acquittal on counts three and four.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">{\u00b6 24} The jury ultimately found Getter not guilty on count one, but guilty on count two, drug possession. The trial court also found Getter not guilty on most of the forfeiture specifications, but did order forfeiture of the gun. The trial court eventually sentenced Getter to one year of conditional community-control sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">{\u00b6 25} In this appeal, Getter challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence. His assignment of error states:</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cI. The trial court violated Appellant\u2019s rights under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and Article I, Section 10 of the Constitution of the State of Ohio by denying Appellant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">{\u00b6 27} Getter argues that the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress evidence because the \u201cgood faith\u201d exception to the exclusionary rule should not apply in circumstances in which the police themselves were responsible for the error that led to the warrantless stop of the vehicle he drove. Although Getter\u2019s argument is clever, this court disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">{\u00b6 28} The Ohio Supreme Court set forth the applicable analysis of the trial court\u2019s decision on a motion to suppress evidence as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cAppellate review of a motion to suppress presents a mixed question of law and fact. When considering a motion to suppress, the trial court assumes the role of trier of fact and is therefore in the best position to resolve factual questions and evaluate the credibility of witnesses. Consequently, an appellate court must accept the trial court\u2019s findings of fact if they are supported by competent, credible evidence. Accepting these facts as true, the appellate court must then independently determine, without deference to the conclusion of the trial court, whether the facts satisfy the applicable legal standard.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State v. Burnside, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 152, 2003-Ohio-5372, 797 N.E.2d 71, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">{\u00b6 30} In <em>State v. Burke, </em>188 Ohio App.3d 777, 2010-Ohio-3597, 936 N.E.2d 1019, after quoting the foregoing, this court additionally made the following comments:</p>\n<p id=\"b581-12\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cInitially, we observe that an investigative stop of a vehicle is permissible if a police officer has a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the person stopped may be involved in criminal activity. See <em>Terry v. Ohio </em>(1968), 392 U.S. 1, 20, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>{\u00b6 32} \u201cThe Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. Searches conducted without a warrant are per se unreasonable, subject to a few \u2018jealously and carefully drawn\u2019 exceptions. <em>State v. Smith, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 163, 2009-Ohio-6426, 920 N.E.2d 949, \u00b6 10, citing <em>Jones v. United States </em>(1958), 357 U.S. 493, 499, 78 S.Ct. 1253, 2 L.Ed.2d 1514, and <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire </em>(1971), 403 U.S. 443, 454-455, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 29 L.Ed.2d 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\"> {\u00b6 33} \u201cOne of the exceptions to the warrant requirement is a search incident to a lawful arrest, \u2018which allows officers to conduct a search that includes an arrestee\u2019s person and the area within the arrestee\u2019s immediate control.\u2019 <em>Smith, </em>supra, at \u00b6 11, citing <em>Chimel v. California </em>(1969), 395 U.S. 752, 762-763, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685. \u2018The exception derives from interests in officer safety and evidence preservation that are typically implicated in arrest situations.\u2019 <em>Arizona v. Gant </em>(2009), 556 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1710, 1716, 173 L.Ed.2d 485. In <em>Arizona v. Gant, </em>the court held that an officer may search a vehicle incident to a recent occupant\u2019s arrest only when the arrestee is unsecured and within reaching distance of the passenger compartment at the time of the search or when it is reasonable to believe that the vehicle contains evidence relevant to the offense of arrest. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cIn this case, a search of the vehicle incident to arrest was impermissible because Burke was handcuffed and under arrest at the time of the search and the officer had no reason to believe that the vehicle contained evidence of the offense of arrest, i.e., open container. Nevertheless, alternative grounds existed upon which a warrantless search could be conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cA warrantless search of a vehicle may be justified when an officer has probable cause to believe that the vehicle contains contraband based upon the well-established automobile exception to the warrant requirement. <em>State v. Moore </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 47, 52, 734 N.E.2d 804. \u2018[T]he search of an auto on probable cause proceeds on a theory wholly different from that justifying the search incident to an arrest.\u2019 <em>Chambers v. Maroney </em>(1970), 399 U.S. 42, 90 S.Ct. 1975, 26 L.Ed.2d 419, citing <em>Carroll v. United States </em>(1925), 267 U.S. 132, 158-159, 45 S.Ct. 280, 69 L.Ed. 543. Under this exception, when an officer has probable cause to believe that a person has been smoking marijuana based on the odor of marijuana emanating from the vehicle, a warrantless search is permissible. <em>Moore; State v. Hopper, </em>Cuyahoga App. Nos. 91269 and 91327, 2009-Ohio-2711, 2009 WL 1623105; see also <em>State v. Farris, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 519, 2006-Ohio-3255, 849 N.E.2d 985 (recognizing that the scope of the search does not necessarily extend to the trunk of the vehicle).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>{\u00b6 36} \u201cIn this case, [the officer] testified that he detected a strong odor of marijuana emanating from the vehicle. This alone provided the officer with probable cause to search the passenger compartment of the vehicle without a warrant. Accordingly, we find that a lawful search of the vehicle was conducted in this case.\u201d <em>Burke, </em>188 Ohio App.3d 777, 2010-Ohio-3597, 936 N.E.2d 1019, \u00b6 16-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">{\u00b6 37} Geiter seeks to circumvent the application of the foregoing to the facts of this case by asserting that Nan\u2019s initial <em>stop </em>was illegal. He claims that the trial court improperly determined that the \u201cgood faith\u201d exception to the exclusionary rule applied. To the contrary, Geiter argues, Nan lacked a good-faith basis for conducting the stop, because it was Nan\u2019s own department\u2019s negligence that wrongly still included his mother\u2019s car in the Cleveland police \u201cstolen vehicle\u201d database. As authority for his position, Geiter cites <em>Herring v. United States </em>(2009), 555 U.S. 135, 129 S.Ct. 695, 172 L.Ed.2d 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">{\u00b6 38} In examining the good-faith exception to a search of a premises conducted without a legal warrant, the court stated as follows in <em>State v. Jacob, </em>185 Ohio App.3d 408, 2009-Ohio-7048, 924 N.E.2d 410, at \u00b6 27:</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cThe Supreme Court established the \u2018good faith\u2019 exception to the exclusionary rule in <em>United States v. Leon </em>(1984), 468 U.S. 897, 918-923, 926, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677. In doing so, the Supreme Court <em>declined </em>to apply the exclusionary rule when police reasonably and in good faith relied upon a warrant <em>subsequently </em>declared to be invalid, because excluding evidence under such circumstances <em>would not deter </em>police misconduct. Id. at 922, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677. The good-faith inquiry established in <em>Leon </em>is confined to the objectively ascertainable question of whether a reasonably well-trained officer would have known that the search was illegal despite the issuance of a warrant; subjective beliefs of the officer are not to be considered. <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 922, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677, fn. 23; <em>State v. Klosterman </em>(1996), 114 Ohio App.3d 327, 332, 683 N.E.2d 100. The Supreme Court now prefers to discuss this issue in terms of an officer\u2019s \u2018objectively reasonable reliance\u2019 on a warrant, commenting that the term \u2018good faith\u2019 has perhaps been confusing. <em>Herring v. United States </em>(2009), 555 U.S. [135], 129 S.Ct. 695, 172 L.Ed.2d 496.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">{\u00b6 40} Moreover, the Twelfth Ohio Appellate District also examined the holding of <em>Herring </em>and observed:</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">{\u00b6 41} \u201c \u2018The fact that a Fourth Amendment violation occurred \u2014 i.e., that a search or arrest was unreasonable \u2014 does not necessarily mean that the exclusionary rule applies\u2019 <em>Herrings </em>[sic] <em>v. United States </em>(2009) [555] U.S. [135], 129 S.Ct. 695, 700, 172 L.Ed.2d 496. The United States Supreme Court has \u2018repeatedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>rejected the argument that exclusion is a necessary consequence of a Fourth Amendment violation.\u2019 Id. \u2018To trigger the exclusionary rule, police conduct must be sufficiently deliberate that exclusion can meaningfully deter it, and sufficiently culpable that such deterrence is worth the price paid by the justice system.\u2019 Id. [555 U.S. 135, 129 S.Ct.] at 702 [172 L.Ed.2d 496].</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cAt its core, the good faith exception recognizes that the purpose of the exclusionary rule, to deter unlawful police conduct, cannot be furthered by excluding evidence seized <em>by an officer who had reasonable grounds </em>to believe the search warrant was <em>properly </em>issued. See <em>Leon </em>at 919, 923 [104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677]. Thus, \u2018evidence should be suppressed only if it can be said that the law enforcement officer had knowledge, or may be <em>properly charged </em>with knowledge, that the search was unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment.\u2019 <em>Herrings </em>[sic], [555 U.S. 135] 129 S.Ct. at 701 [172 L.Ed.2d 496]; <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 919 [104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677].\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State v. Cummins, </em>Clinton App. Nos. CA2009-06-004 and CA2009-06-005, 2009-Ohio-6415, \u00b6 25-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">{\u00b6 43} For purposes of this case, the word \u201cstop\u201d may be substituted for the word \u201csearch\u201d in the foregoing opinions. In applying the relevant analysis, therefore, the trial court properly focused on Nan\u2019s objective reliance on the information conveyed to him via police dispatch. Nan had no reason to question the reliability of the local system\u2019s information, particularly to justify a minimally intrusive traffic stop. <em>State v. Commins, </em>2009-Ohio-6415, 2009 WL 4574886; cf. <em>State v. Jacob, </em>185 Ohio App.3d 408, 2009-Ohio-7048, 924 N.E.2d 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">{\u00b6 44} Applying the exclusionary rule under these circumstances would not deter \u201cunlawful police conduct\u201d because Nan himself could not know that his conduct in stopping a car to investigate possible criminal activity would subsequently prove to lack a foundation. In fact, <em>Terry v. Ohio </em>(1968), 392 U.S. 1, 20, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889, precisely permits such an action.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">{\u00b6 45} Consequently, Getter\u2019s assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">{\u00b6 46} The trial court\u2019s order and Getter\u2019s conviction are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b584-11\">Sweeney, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b584-12\">Stewart, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b584-13\">Sweeney, J., retired, of the Eighth District Court of Appeals, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
