Prescott was convicted of the offense in a jury trial conducted in the Wood County Court of Common Pleas in September 2009. In a November 18, 2009 judgment, the trial court sentenced appellant to serve three years\u2019 community control with conditions for the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant asserts three assignments of error on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Assignments of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cI. The trial court erred in instructing the jury that a private citizen may not resist arrest by a law enforcement officer through the use of force.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cII. Appellant received ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of his rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article I, \u00a7 10 of the Constitution of the State of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cHI. Appellant\u2019s conviction was against the sufficiency and/or manifest weight of the evidence presented at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b740-11\">{\u00b6 6} On February 21, 2009, Prescott was engaged in a fistfight in front of the Clazel, a bar in downtown Bowling Green, Ohio. Officers Terry Davis and Jeff Lowery, police officers of the Bowling Green Police Department, were on patrol nearby.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-12\">{\u00b6 7} Officer Davis testified that he was across the street from the bar issuing a citation at approximately 2:30 a.m., heard a commotion, and turned to see a fight in progress on the sidewalk across the street, 30 feet away. Davis testified: \u201cI saw two people engaged in a fight, a fist fight. I moved to that location, pulled the people apart.\u201d Davis testified that the two men fighting were Prescott and another man named Avila.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-13\">{\u00b6 8} Davis testified that he announced more than once that he was a police officer and told the men to stop fighting. He separated them, at first holding Avila, but he lost his grip. Prescott continued to fight and punched Davis in the head. Davis testified that he tripped and fell to the ground with Prescott on top of him, face to face. Davis testified that Prescott continued to punch him while face to face. By this time, Officer Lowery arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-14\">{\u00b6 9} Lowery testified that he was approximately ten seconds behind Davis in arriving at the location of the fight. As he arrived, Lowery yelled, more than once, \u201cPolice,\u201d and for the men to stop fighting. Lowery pulled Avila away. He testified that he saw appellant punching Officer Davis with his fist. Lowery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>recalled that he was no more than five feet away when he saw appellant face to face with Davis and punching him.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">{\u00b6 10} Lowery testified that Officer Garman and he pulled Prescott from Davis, instructed Prescott several times to stop fighting, and ultimately forced Prescott to the ground to restrain him. Lowery testified that the incident all happened \u201cwithin a couple minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">{\u00b6 11} Katherine Brown<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> testified that before police arrived, a group of five men attacked Prescott and that when police did arrive, a crowd was yelling and no one knew what was going on. She saw a man wearing a black coat run into the fight and place a choke hold around Prescott. Brown identified Officer Davis as the man and testified that Davis was wearing a plain black jacket.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">{\u00b6 12} Katherine Brown testified that at some point she was knocked to the ground and while on the ground saw a badge and realized that Prescott was on top of a police officer and struggling with him. She testified that Prescott rolled off the officer and stopped struggling once she told him: \u201cDavid, it is okay, you are safe, you don\u2019t have to, like it is okay, you are safe, it is a police officer, you don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">{\u00b6 13} Alexandra Brown testified that five or more men attacked Prescott. One punched him on the back of the head, and the group forced him to the ground. While he was on the ground, others kicked him in the ribs and his head. Prescott got back up and was knocked to the ground again. Afterwards, police arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">{\u00b6 14} Alexandra Brown testified that when Officer Davis arrived, she did not know he was a police officer. She testified that he was wearing a dark knit hat and dark jacket and she saw no emblems or patches on his jacket. She realized he was a police officer when Davis and Prescott fell to the ground. It was then that she saw a badge on the sleeve of his jacket. She testified that Prescott stopped when her sister screamed: \u201cDavid, it is a cop. Stop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-10\">{\u00b6 15} Under assignment of error No. I, Prescott argues that the trial court erred in instructing the jury \u201cthat a private citizen may not resist arrest by a law enforcement officer through the use of force.\u201d However, the trial court gave no such instruction. The trial court instructed:</p>\n<p id=\"b741-11\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cWhen the situation involves the use of force against a law enforcement officer, a private citizen may not, in the absence of excessive or unnecessary force by an arresting officer, use force to resist arrest by one he knows, or has good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>reason to believe, is an authorized police officer engaged in his duties, whether or not the arrest is legal under the circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">{\u00b6 17} The instruction is an almost identical word-for-word restatement of the law announced by the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Columbus v. Fraley </em>(1975), 41 Ohio St.2d 173, 70 O.O.2d 335, 324 N.E.2d 735, paragraph three of the syllabus. In the decision, the court strictly limited circumstances in which a citizen may use force against a police officer:</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cWe agree with those courts and legislatures which have chosen to abandon the rule allowing forcible resistance to arrest. We believe it [is] essential that potentially violent conflicts be resolved, not in the streets, but in the courts. Thus, we hold that in the absence of excessive or unnecessary force by an arresting officer, a private citizen may not use force to resist arrest by one he knows, or has good reason to believe, is an authorized police officer engaged in the performance of his duties, whether or not the arrest is illegal under the circumstances.\u201d Id. at 180, 70 O.O.2d 335, 324 N.E.2d 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">{\u00b6 19} The <em>Fraley </em>rule has been applied in instances involving investigatory stops and searches in addition to arrests. <em>State v. Haines </em>(Feb. 24, 1995), 6th Dist. No. L-94-023, 1995 WL 75297. Because the instruction accurately sets forth the law announced by the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Fraley, </em>we find that appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">{\u00b6 20} Under assignment of error No. II, appellant argues that he was denied effective assistance of counsel at trial due to trial counsel\u2019s unfamiliarity with trial procedure. Appellant argues that trial counsel was deficient because she \u201cwas unaware of the procedural requirements of the Ohio Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(B)(1)(g) as it pertains to impeachment of a witness by a prior written or recorded statement.\u201d At the time of trial,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(g) provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cCrim.R. 16 Discovery and inspection</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b742-11\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c(B) Disclosure of evidence by the prosecuting attorney</p>\n<p id=\"b742-12\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c(1) <em>Information subject to disclosure.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b742-13\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b742-14\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c(g) In camera inspection of witness\u2019 statement. Upon completion of a witness\u2019 direct examination at trial, the court on motion of the defendant shall conduct an in camera inspection of the witness\u2019 written or recorded statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>with the defense attorney and prosecuting attorney present and participating, to determine the existence of inconsistencies, if any between the testimony of such witness and the prior statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cIf the court determines that inconsistencies exist, the statement shall be given to the defense attorney for use in cross-examination of the witness as to the inconsistencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cIf the court determines that inconsistencies do not exist the statement shall not be given to the defense attorney and he shall not be permitted to cross-examine or comment thereon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">{\u00b6 29} Here, the state provided the defense during discovery with a copy of the report, prepared by Officer Lowery. Appellant argues that trial counsel failed to secure an in-camera inspection of the report or court approval of its use for impeachment before counsel attempted to cross-examine Lowery at trial based upon claimed inconsistencies between Lowery\u2019s trial testimony and his prior report.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">{\u00b6 30} To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must prove two elements: \u201cFirst, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. Proof of prejudice requires a showing \u201cthat there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d Id. at 694; <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">{\u00b6 31} The state argues that appellant was not prejudiced by counsel\u2019s error as to criminal trial procedure. Upon objection to the attempted use of the report to impeach, the court fully addressed the Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(g) issues in a side-bar conference and ruled on the merits whether the report could be used to impeach. Appellant does not claim that the trial court erred in refusing to permit use of the report for impeachment due to its finding, under Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(g), that no inconsistency existed between Officer Lowery\u2019s trial testimony and his written report.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-10\">{\u00b6 32} We agree that the record fails to support any claim of prejudice by counsel\u2019s initial failure to follow Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(g) procedure in cross-examining Officer Lowery. We find that the second assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>{\u00b6 33} Under assignment of error No. Ill, appellant contends that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction or, alternatively, that the conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">{\u00b6 34} An appellant is required under App.R. 12(A)(2) to separately argue assignments of error on appeal. Appellant provided no argument on this assignment of error other than to refer to earlier arguments under the first two assignments of error. In our discretion, we choose to consider the assigned error.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">{\u00b6 35} Sufficiency of the evidence and manifest weight of the evidence are quantitatively and qualitatively different legal concepts. <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386, 678 N.E.2d 541. Sufficiency of the evidence is purely a question of law. Id. Under this standard of adequacy, a court must consider whether the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction as a matter of law. Id. The proper analysis is \u201c \u2018whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Williams </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 569, 576, 660 N.E.2d 724, quoting <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">{\u00b6 36} Appellant was convicted of assault on a police officer, a violation of R.C. 2903.13(A) and 2903.13(C)(3). R.C. 2903.13(A) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cNo person shall knowingly cause or attempt to cause physical harm to another or to another\u2019s unborn.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-10\">{\u00b6 38} R.C. 2903.13(C) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b744-11\">{\u00b6 39} \u201c(3) If the victim of the offense is a peace officer * * *, while in the performance of their official duties, assault is a felony of the fourth degree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-12\">{\u00b6 40} One of the issues submitted for jury consideration was self-defense. At the request of appellant, the trial court instructed the jury on self-defense through the use of nondeadly force. As part of that instruction, the trial court instructed that \u201c[i]f the defendant used more force than reasonably necessary, if that force is greatly disproportionate to the apparent danger, then the defense of self-defense is not available.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-13\">{\u00b6 41} In <em>State v. Johnson, </em>6th Dist. No. L-08-1325, 2009-Ohio-3500, 2009 WL 2096286, this court recognized:</p>\n<p id=\"b744-14\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cThere are limitations to the application of self-defense. The defense is not available unless the defendant shows that the force used to repel the danger was not more than the situation reasonably demanded. <em>Close v. Cooper </em>(1877), 34 Ohio St. 98, 100. \u2018One may use such force as the circumstances require.\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number><em>Chillicothe v. Knight </em>(1992), 75 Ohio App.3d 544, 550, 599 N.E.2d 871. The defense is not applicable \u2018if the force is so grossly disproportionate to [the] apparent danger as to show revenge or an evil purpose to injure.\u2019 <em>State v. Weston </em>(July 16, 1999), 4th Dist No. 97CA31[, 1999 WL 552732], \u2018The force used to defend must be objectively necessary and reasonable under the facts and circumstances of the case and in view of the danger apprehended.\u2019 <em>Martin v. Cent. Ohio Transit Auth. </em>(1990), 70 Ohio App.3d 83, 93, 590 N.E.2d 411. When one uses a greater degree of force than is necessary under all the circumstances, it is not justifiable on the ground of self-defense. <em>State v. McLeod </em>(1948), 82 Ohio App. 155, 157, 80 N.E.2d 699.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">{\u00b6 43} In addition to the instruction regarding self-defense and over appellant\u2019s objection, the trial court also instructed the jury as to the limited circumstances in which a private citizen may use force against police officers in the performance of their duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">{\u00b6 44} Construing the evidence most favorably to the prosecution, in our view a rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant knowingly caused or attempted to cause physical harm to Officer Davis. A rational trier of fact could also have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Davis did not engage in the use of excessive or unnecessary force at the time he confronted appellant and attempted to stop the fight and that appellant knew or had good reason to believe that Davis was an authorized police officer engaged in the performance of his duties at the time. Such a determination would make the use of force against the responding police officer unavailable under <em>Fraley.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">{\u00b6 45} Even if a rational fact-finder were to find that appellant did not know or did not have good reason to believe that Davis was an authorized police officer engaged in the performance of his duties, a rational juror could have determined that appellant used more than necessary and reasonable force under the circumstances in view of the danger presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">{\u00b6 46} As to enhancement of the seriousness of the offense under R.C. 2903.13(C)(3), a rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Davis was acting in the performance of his duties in attempting to break up a fight on a public street when the assault occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">{\u00b6 47} In our view, there was sufficient evidence in the record to support appellant\u2019s conviction of assault on a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">Manifest Weight of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">{\u00b6 48} A claim that a jury verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence requires an appellate court to act as a \u201cthirteenth juror.\u201d <em>Thompkins, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 387, 678 N.E.2d 541. An appellate court, \u201c \u2018reviewing the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>ty of witnesses and determines whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. The discretionary power to grant a new trial should be exercised only in the exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>State v. Martin </em>(1983), 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 20 OBR 215, 485 N.E.2d 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">{\u00b6 49} In our view, although the case presented significant issues for jury resolution, the evidence did not weigh heavily against conviction and the jury acted reasonably within its province in rendering a guilty verdict. We conclude that the verdict convicting appellant of assault on a police officer is not against the manifest weight of the evidence. Accordingly, we find that the third assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">{\u00b6 50} We conclude that substantial justice was done the party complaining. We affirm the judgment of the Wood County Court of Common Pleas. Appellant is ordered to pay the costs, pursuant to App.R. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b746-8\">Singer and Cosme, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b741-12\">.
