Hendon, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">{\u00b6 1} This case arises out of a labor dispute between defendant-appellee, Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority (\u201cSORTA\u201d), and plaintiff-appellant, Amalgamated Transit Union Local 627 (\u201cthe union\u201d). In its sole assignment of error, the union asserts that the trial court erred when it confirmed an arbitration award in favor of SORTA. The union is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">SORTA Failed to Respond to the Union\u2019s Grievance</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">{\u00b6 2} SORTA provides public bus transportation services in the Greater Cincinnati area. Its buses are equipped with wheelchair lifts. After SORTA sent some wheelchair-lift repair work to a nonunion shop, the union filed a grievance against SORTA, following the procedure set forth in the parties\u2019 memorandum of agreement (\u201cthe agreement\u201d). The grievance stated, \u201cDivision is doing wheelchair platform replacement. This is a [union] body shop job.\u201d In its grievance, the union\u2019s requested remedy was that wheelchair-lift repair work be sent to the union shop.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">{\u00b6 3} Under Section 3(c) of the parties\u2019 agreement, SORTA was required to respond to the union\u2019s grievance in writing within five days, sustain or deny it, and state the reasons for its decision. SORTA failed to do so. Section 3(i) of the agreement states, \u201cIn the event that Management fails to respond to any aggrieved employee or his/her Union representative in any of the steps of the grievance procedure, such non-response shall be deemed a ruling in favor of grievant or Union.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">The Arbitrator\u2019s Award</p>\n<p id=\"b717-11\">{\u00b6 4} The dispute eventually proceeded to arbitration. The union argued the grievance on its merits, as well as on procedural grounds. The arbitrator decided the case under Section 3 of the agreement, concluding that since SORTA had violated the time provisions in Section 3(c), the union\u2019s grievance had to be upheld under Section 3(i). The decision further stated that \u201cthe remedy sought by the Union is unavailable * * * under the terms of the Memorandum of Agreement and cannot be granted.\u201d The decision to deny the union\u2019s remedy was apparently based on SORTA\u2019s position that it retained the right to determine how to assign repair work under the terms of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-12\">{\u00b6 5} In the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas, the union moved to vacate, modify, or correct the arbitration award. SORTA moved to confirm the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>award. After extensive briefing by the parties, the trial court denied the union\u2019s motion and granted SORTA\u2019s. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">{\u00b6 6} In its single assignment of error, the union now asserts that the trial court\u2019s judgment must be reversed because the arbitrator\u2019s award directly conflicts with Section 3 of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Limited Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">{\u00b6 7} Because the private resolution of disputes by arbitration is favored, judicial review is limited.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A court cannot vacate an arbitrator\u2019s award absent any of the narrowly defined circumstances set forth in R.C. 2711.10.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Here, the union claims that the award should have been vacated under R.C. 2711.10(D) because the arbitrator exceeded his authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">{\u00b6 8} In labor disputes such as this, an arbitrator\u2019s authority is limited to that granted to him by the contracting parties through the terms of their collective-bargaining agreement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> An arbitrator exceeds his authority if the award does not \u201cdraw its essence\u201d from the agreement at issue.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under the essence test, an award must be confirmed \u201cwhen there is a rational nexus between the agreement and the award, and where the award is not arbitrary, capricious, or unlawful.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In contrast, an arbitrator\u2019s award departs from the essence of the parties\u2019 agreement when (1) it conflicts with the express terms of the agreement or (2) it lacks rational support or cannot be rationally derived from the agreement\u2019s terms.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>The Award Fails the Essence Test</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">{\u00b6 9} Here, the arbitrator\u2019s award conflicts with the express terms of Section 3(i) of the parties\u2019 agreement. It is undisputed that SORTA failed to respond to the union\u2019s grievance within the time set forth in Section 3(c). And Section 3(i) unequivocally states that SORTA\u2019s failure to respond \u201cshall be deemed a ruling in favor of grievant or Union.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">{\u00b6 10} Separating the remedy sought by the union from a grievance that was otherwise upheld, as the arbitrator did in this case, disregarded Section 3(i). The union and SORTA had bargained for and agreed to the exclusive remedy for SORTA\u2019s failure to respond within the prescribed time limits, i.e., \u201ca ruling in favor of [the] grievant or Union\u201d- \u2014 not a \u201cpartial\u201d ruling in the union\u2019s favor, as occurred here. We acknowledge that an arbitrator generally has broad discretion to fashion a remedy, but that discretion was limited in this case by Section 3(i).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The arbitrator therefore exceeded his authority by failing to grant the union the relief required by the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">{\u00b6 11} Since the award conflicts with the express terms of Section 3, it fails the essence test. There is no rational nexus between the award and the agreement. We therefore hold that the trial court erred when it confirmed the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">{\u00b6 12} The union also contends that the award was in conflict with Section 28 of the agreement and that the arbitrator was guilty of misconduct. Resolution of the union\u2019s first argument renders these issues moot, so we do not address them.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">{\u00b6 13} In sum, the union\u2019s sole assignment of error is sustained. The trial court\u2019s judgment is reversed. We hereby vacate the arbitration award and remand this case for the trial court to enter a corrected award in accordance with the terms of this decision and law.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b719-10\">Cunningham, P.J., and Hildebrandt, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b718-9\">. <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v.
