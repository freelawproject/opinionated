Howard contends that the trial court erred in disapproving shock incarceration, intensive-program prison, and transitional control.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">{\u00b6 2} We conclude that the trial court erred when it disapproved of shock incarceration and intensive-program prison without making the findings required by R.C. 2929.19(D). We further conclude that the court erred by including disapproval of transitional control in the termination entry. A trial court\u2019s ability to approve or disapprove of transitional control occurs only after a person has been incarcerated and the adult parole authority sends a notice to the trial court indicating that it intends to grant transitional control under R.C. 2967.26(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">{\u00b6 3} Accordingly, the sentence imposed by the trial court is reversed, and this cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">{\u00b6 4} In July 2008, Andrew Howard was indicted on one count of domestic violence in violation of R.C. 2919.25(A) and one count of abduction in violation of R.C. 2905.02(A)(2). Howard subsequently pleaded no contest to abduction, and the domestic-violence charge was dismissed. Howard was sentenced to five years of community-control sanctions, which included intensive probation supervision, obtaining and maintaining employment, maintaining no contact with the victim, and attending a Stop the Violence program. After modifying the probation from intensive to basic in March 2009 due to Howard\u2019s positive strides, the trial court issued an order of capias in June 2009, requiring that Howard be arrested and held without bail. The court noted that Howard\u2019s whereabouts had been unknown since June 2009 and that a charge of domestic violence had been filed against him in Montgomery County Area II court.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-10\">{\u00b6 5} Howard was subsequently arrested and held in jail. In December 2009, the trial court held a revocation hearing, during which Howard admitted violating orders requiring him to maintain proof of employment. He also admitted that he was an absconder. Accordingly, the court revoked community control and sentenced Howard to a one-year prison term in the Corrections Reception Center. In a subsequent termination entry, the court added the following provision, which had not been mentioned during the revocation and sentencing hearing:</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>{\u00b6 6} \u201cThe Court disapproves of the Defendant\u2019s placement in a program of shock incarceration under Section 5120.031 of the Revised Code, or in the intensive program prison under Section 5120.032 of the Ohio Revised Code, and disapproves of the transfer of the defendant to transitional control under Section 2967.26 of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">{\u00b6 7} Howard filed a motion with the court asking that the sentencing entry be corrected to remove the above language. Howard also filed a notice of appeal in January 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">{\u00b6 8} Howard\u2019s sole assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe trial court erred by disapproving shock incarceration, intensive program prison and transitional control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">{\u00b6 10} Under this assignment of error, Howard contends that shock incarceration and intensive-program prison are important correctional programs that have been shown to reduce recidivism. Howard points out that a trial court can either recommend or disapprove participation in these programs or can make no recommendation at all. However, if the court makes a recommendation, R.C. 2929.19(D) requires the court to make a finding giving its reason for the recommendation or disapproval. Howard contends that the trial court violated this requirement by failing to address the matter during sentencing and by failing to make a finding in the termination entry. In addition, Howard contends that the trial court did not have statutory authority to disapprove or recommend transitional control at the time of sentencing, because that matter is not ripe until after the Adult Parole Authority has screened an offender and has made a preliminary decision to transfer the offender to transitional control.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cIntensive-program prison\u201d (\u201cIPP\u201d) includes institutions that have military-type regimen programs as described in R.C. 5120.031 and institutions that focus on \u201ceducational achievement, vocational training, alcohol and other drug abuse treatment, community service and conservation work, and other intensive regimens or combinations of intensive regimens.\u201d R.C. 5120.032. As noted by the Ohio Department of Correction and Rehabilitation:</p>\n<p id=\"b773-11\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe \u2018Second Chance to Change\u2019 initiative is the newest phase in the Department\u2019s development strategy for Intensive Program Prisons (IPP\u2019s). \u2018Intensive Program Prisons\u2019 refers to several ninety-day programs, for which certain inmates are eligible, that are characterized by concentrated and rigorous specialized treatment services. An inmate who successfully completes an IPP will have his/her sentence reduced to the amount of time already served and will be released on post-release supervision for an appropriate time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>{\u00b6 13} \u201cThese intensive treatment programs offer inmates a genuine \u2018Second Chance to Change\u2019 for two important reasons. First, the programs are based on correctional programs that have been shown to be effective in reducing the likelihood of recidivism. Second, each participating inmate is assessed to determine areas of need and is assigned to a program that matches his or her needs.\u201d http://www.drc.ohio.gov/web/ipp.htm.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">{\u00b6 14} Trial courts have statutory authority under R.C. 2929.14 to address IPP and shock incarceration at the time of sentencing. This statute provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c[T]he court may recommend the offender for placement in a program of shock incarceration under section 5120.031 of the Revised Code or for placement in an intensive program prison under section 5120.032 of the Revised Code, disapprove placement of the offender in a program of shock incarceration or an intensive program prison of that nature, or make no recommendation on placement of the offender. In no case shall the department of rehabilitation and correction place the offender in a program or prison of that nature unless the department determines as specified in section 5120.031 or 5120.032 of the Revised Code, whichever is applicable, that the offender is eligible for the placement.\u201d R.C. 2929.14(K).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">{\u00b6 16} If the trial court disapproves IPP, the Department of Rehabilitation and Correction may not place the offender in a program. However, if the court does not make a recommendation, the Department of Rehabilitation and Correction must screen the offender and decide if there is a program in which the offender\u2019s placement is suitable. The department must then notify the court of the proposed placement, and the court has an opportunity to veto the placement. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">{\u00b6 17} R.C. 2929.19(D) further provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cThe sentencing court, pursuant to division (K) of section 2929.14 of the Revised Code, may recommend placement of the offender in a program of shock incarceration under section 5120.031 of the Revised Code or an intensive program prison under section 5120.032 of the Revised Code, disapprove placement of the offender in a program or prison of that nature, or make no recommendation. If the court recommends or disapproves placement, it shall make a finding that gives its reasons for its recommendation or disapproval.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-10\">{\u00b6 19} In the case before us, the trial court did not address IPP, shock incarceration, or transitional control at the sentencing hearing. The court, however, did reject Howard\u2019s potential participation in these programs in the termination entry that was subsequently filed. The state contends that the court\u2019s error, if any, is harmless, because Howard is not eligible for placement in IPP. In this regard, the state contends that Howard was convicted of a third-degree felony and caused or attempted to cause harm to his victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>{\u00b6 20} R.C. 5120.131(A)(4) and 5120.032(B) provide that certain categories of persons are not eligible to participate in shock incarceration and IPP. As relevant here, this includes a prisoner in the following category:</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cThe prisoner is serving a prison term for a felony of the third, fourth, or fifth degree that either is a sex offense, an offense betraying public trust, or an offense in which the prisoner caused or attempted to cause actual physical harm to a person, the prisoner is serving a prison term for a comparable offense under the law in effect prior to July 1, 1996, or the prisoner previously has been imprisoned for an offense of that type or a comparable offense under the law in effect prior to July 1, 1996.\u201d R.C. 5120.032(B)(2)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">{\u00b6 22} Howard was convicted of having violated R.C. 2905.02(A)(2), which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cNo person, without privilege to do so, shall knowingly do any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cBy force or threat, restrain the liberty of another person under circumstances that create a risk of physical harm to the victim or place the other person in fear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">{\u00b6 26} Assuming for purposes of argument that there is no distinction between \u201cattempting to cause physical harm\u201d and circumstances that \u201ccreate a risk of physical harm,\u201d a conviction for abduction does not necessarily require proof of attempted physical harm. Abduction can be established when a defendant, by threat, restrains the liberty of a person \u201cunder circumstances that * * * place the other person in fear.\u201d There are obvious circumstances in which a person can be placed in fear without an attempt having been made to physically harm the person. Accordingly, an abduction conviction does not necessarily exclude a person from being considered as a possible candidate for IPP.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-11\">{\u00b6 27} The record in the case before us is silent concerning the specific circumstances of the alleged crime, and the trial court did not mention the facts of the crime at the revocation hearing. The state suggests that the record as a whole could be sufficient to meet the requirements of R.C. 2929.19(D). This is consistent with a theory adopted by other Ohio appellate districts, which have held that R.C. 2929.14(K) does not impose a duty on the trial court to address the IPP issue during the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-12\">{\u00b6 28} In <em>State v. Heger, </em>Perry App. No. 2008-CA-l, 2009-Ohio-2691, 2009 WL 1610842, the defendant claimed that his guilty plea was invalid because the trial court failed to orally inform him that he would not be recommended for IPP. Id. at \u00b6 17. The Fifth District Court of Appeals rejected this contention because \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>convicted person has no constitutional right to be conditionally released prior to the expiration of a valid sentence.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 23. The Fifth District Court of Appeals also stressed, \u201cLikewise, \u2018Ohio law gives a convicted person no legitimate claim of entitlement to parole prior to the expiration of a valid sentence of imprisonment.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>State ex rel. Seikbert v. Wilkinson </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 489, 490, 633 N.E.2d 1128. Thus, because no constitutionally protected liberty interest is involved, the Fifth District Court of Appeals concluded that a trial court need only substantially comply with the requirements of Crim.R. 11. Id. at \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">{\u00b6 29} Although shock incarceration and IPP were not orally mentioned during sentencing in <em>Heger, </em>the plea agreement did contain a statement indicating that the defendant would not be recommended for shock incarceration or IPP. Id. at \u00b6 17. Accordingly, the Fifth District concluded, \u201cThe record, when read as a whole establishes the court\u2019s specific reasons for disapproving appellant for shock incarceration or an intensive prison program and is sufficient to meet the requirements of R.C. 2929.19(D), which contains no requirement to orally inform a defendant of its recommendation, if it is indeed issuing one, at the sentencing hearing.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">{\u00b6 30} The appellant in <em>State v. Heger </em>did not raise the issue of whether the trial court was required to make specific findings before disapproving of shock incarceration or an intensive-program prison, confining himself instead to arguments that his guilty plea was defective because of the trial court\u2019s failure to have discussed these subjects with him at the plea colloquy and that his trial counsel was ineffective for having failed to inform him that he would be ineligible for either program. Indeed, although it is apparent from the opinion in <em>Heger </em>that the trial court did not recommend the appellant in that case for either program, it is not clear that the trial court affirmatively disapproved him for either or both programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">{\u00b6 31} In <em>State v. Lowery, </em>Trumbull App. No. 2007-T-0039, 2007-Ohio-6734, 2007 WL 4376377, the Eleventh District Court of Appeals rejected a defendant\u2019s claim that the sentencing hearing must cover all items that end up in the sentencing entry, including disapproval of IPP and shock incarceration. Id. at \u00b6 9. The Eleventh District Court of Appeals stressed that the trial court did not even have to make a recommendation. Id. at \u00b6 14. The court concluded:</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c[T]he transcript read as a whole establishes the court\u2019s specific reasons for disapproving Mr. Lowery for shock incarceration or an intensive prison program and is sufficient to meet the requirements of R.C. 2929.19(D), which contains no requirement to orally inform a defendant of its recommendation, if it is indeed issuing one, at the sentencing hearing. Thus, the court\u2019s failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>inform Mr. Lowery of its disapproval is harmless error at best and clearly did not prejudice Mr. Lowery.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">{\u00b6 33} We agree that the trial court in the case before us was not required to address the issue during the sentencing hearing. As noted by the Fifth and Eleventh Appellate Districts, the statutes do not require trial courts to make any kind of recommendation. Once the court makes a recommendation, however, the court is also required by R.C. 2929.19(D) to make a finding \u201cthat gives its reasons for its recommendation or disapproval.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">{\u00b6 34} In neither <em>State v. Heger </em>nor <em>State v. Lowery </em>did the appellant assign as error the trial court\u2019s failure to make a finding in its sentencing entry \u201cthat gives its reasons for its * * * disapproval [of shock incarceration of an intensive program prison].\u201d That issue, therefore, was not before either court.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">{\u00b6 35} In <em>State v. Jackson, </em>Knox App. No. 05 CA 46, 2006-Ohio-3994, 2006 WL 2205651, \u00b6 14-15, the Fifth District Court of Appeals found sufficient compliance with the findings requirement of R.C. 2992.19(D) in certain other findings that the trial court made in deciding to impose a greater-than-minimum sentence. See also <em>State v. Sears, </em>Franklin App. No. 02AP-1343, 2003-Ohio-2696, 2003 WL 21213410, \u00b6 32 (applying trial court\u2019s comments as to the seriousness of the offense under R.C. 2929.19(B)(2)(a) to the consideration of whether early release under R.C. 2929.19(D) would be appropriate).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">{\u00b6 36} In the case before us, the trial court did not make any specific comments when imposing a one-year sentence, other than noting generally that it had considered the purposes and principles of sentencing in R.C. 2929.11 and the seriousness and recidivism factors of R.C. 2929.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">{\u00b6 37} The state contends that a presentence investigation report would have been submitted to the trial court for consideration before Howard was originally sentenced. The state also argues that we must presume the regularity of the trial court proceedings because Howard failed to submit either this document or the transcript of the original sentencing hearing to the appellate court. In contrast, Howard contends that the record is complete for purposes of appeal because the order from which his appeal is taken is the revocation and sentencing hearing in December 2009, which has been transcribed and filed with our court.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-10\">{\u00b6 38} The transcript of the revocation hearing does not contain any reference to the presentence investigation or the prior sentencing hearing. Because the trial court did not indicate that it relied on these matters, we fail to see their relevance. The relevant issue, for purposes of the revocation hearing was whether Howard had failed to comply with his community-control sanctions and, if so, what punishment should be administered. The trial court was aware that Howard had failed to comply with his community-control sanctions, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>Howard\u2019s own statements indicate that he had absconded and had failed to maintain proof of employment. Howard also mentioned during the hearing that he had had contact with the victim of his offense, even though the court had forbidden contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">{\u00b6 39} The record does not contain any finding by the trial court \u201cthat gives its reasons for its * * * disapproval [of shock incarceration or an intensive program prison].\u201d Nor does the record contain any other findings by the trial court that could be deemed to constitute its implied reasons for disapproval of either program. In short, the record reflects a complete failure by the trial court to have complied with the finding requirement of R.C. 2929.19(D). We are therefore unable to conclude that the trial court substantially complied with that requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">{\u00b6 40} We also agree with Howard that the termination entry could not appropriately contain a statement disapproving transitional control. While not specifically conceding this point, the state has not offered any argument to support the inclusion of transitional control in the termination entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">{\u00b6 41} R.C. 2967.26(A)(1) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cSubject to disapproval by the sentencing judge, the adult parole authority may grant furloughs to trustworthy prisoners, other than those serving a prison term or term of life imprisonment without parole imposed pursuant to section 2971.03 of the Revised Code or a sentence of imprisonment for life imposed for an offense committed on or after October 19, 1981, who are confined in any state correctional institution for the purpose of employment, vocational training, educational programs, or other programs designated by the director of rehabilitation and correction within this state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">{\u00b6 43} R.C. 2967.26(A)(2) requires the adult parole authority to give the trial court three weeks\u2019 notice of the pendency of a prisoner\u2019s intended furlough, and of the fact that the court may disapprove the furlough. Upon request of the adult parole authority, the head of the institution in which the prisoner is confined must give the trial court a report on the prisoner\u2019s conduct in the institution, any disciplinary action, and the prisoner\u2019s participation in school, vocational training, and other rehabilitative programs. After receiving the notice and report, the trial court must give the adult parole authority timely notice of its disapproval. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">{\u00b6 44} Because the furlough recommendation does not occur until after a prisoner has been confined, the trial court\u2019s disapproval was premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-10\">{\u00b6 45} Howard\u2019s sole assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">{\u00b6 46} Howard\u2019s sole assignment of error having been sustained, the sentence imposed in this case is reversed, and this cause is remanded for resentencing in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b779-6\">Donovan, P.J., and Brogan, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
