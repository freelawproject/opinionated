Arde contends that she was required only to comply with the rules set out by the court in order to receive her agreed prison term, and since she did comply, she should have received the agreed prison term. Because Arde complied with the conditions of the plea agreement, the three-year sentence should have been imposed, instead of the nine-year sentence. For the following reasons, the judgment of the trial court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b233-12\">{\u00b6 2} For a few years, Angela Arde was employed as a financial manager for Direct Management, L.L.C. Between September 1, 2005, and September 30, 2009, she managed the books for four small companies. While acting as the financial manager, Arde embezzled money totaling $348,953.82. Arde embezzled money by writing checks to herself from these businesses. After creating the checks, she erased the checks from the computer database, enabling her to hide her thefts. She was not discovered until the various companies, on the verge of dissolving, took a closer look at the books.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-13\">{\u00b6 3} On December 29, 2009, Arde waived indictment, and she pleaded guilty to three felony charges: one count of aggravated theft in excess of $100,000, a felony of the third degree; one count of grand theft in excess of $5,000, a felony of the fourth degree; and one count of tampering with records, a felony of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>third degree. Arde and the state of Ohio negotiated an agreement in which Arde would plead guilty to the three above charges in exchange for a three-year prison sentence and restitution in the amount of $348,953.82.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">{\u00b6 4} Before delivering the plea colloquy, the trial court stated, \u201cI\u2019m agreeing to sentence you to three years. That\u2019s conditioned on the fact that you don\u2019t get into trouble between now and then, that you show up for your reporting dates to the probation department and that you show up for sentencing.\u201d The trial court went on to say, \u201cIf you don\u2019t do any of those things, the pleas stand, but rather than three years, I can sentence you to more or less depending upon what I decide after I read the PSI.\u201d Arde knowingly and voluntarily pleaded guilty to the charges, and a date for sentencing was set.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">{\u00b6 5} A week before sentencing, the trial court held a hearing and asked Arde where the embezzled money went. Arde responded that her ex-husband was a drug addict who bounced checks in them joint account, and that she had paid that back. She also said, \u201cI know I paid bills and fed my kids and just living expenses, and trying to get myself out of debt that he got me into when we were going through the divorce.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">{\u00b6 6} The trial court judge then stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cAt the time of the pleas, I agreed that I would sentence you to three years with restitution of approximately $350,000 on the condition that you show up for your appointments, which you did; you show up today, which you did; you do not get into any trouble, pick up a new \u2014 any new offenses; that\u2019s fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cAnd cooperate with the writer. Be honest and complete in what was going on. I believe that you did not comply with that agreement. And I do not feel that I can stick to my part of the agreement that I would sentence you to three years. I think with no indication of where the money went and with $200 in your checking account, there\u2019s no way anyone is going to see a penny of restitution. And that was part of the plea agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">{\u00b6 9} The trial court concluded by declaring, \u201cBased upon [Arde\u2019s] failure to give any specifics about what happened to the money in this case, I do not believe that I am bound by a three-year sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">{\u00b6 10} The day of sentencing, the trial court stated, \u201cBefore we proceed, last week I indicated on the record that I did not believe the defendant was cooperating with Pre-trial Services and with the Probation Department. And, therefore, I was going to allow her to withdraw her plea if she so chose because I do not feel that I can go forward with the three year sentence.\u201d Upon asking Arde what her decision was, her counsel stated, \u201cYour Honor, we\u2019re going to stand on the plea and ask the Court to enforce the three-year agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>{\u00b6 11} The trial court sentenced Arde to four years for the aggravated-theft charge, one year for the grand-theft charge, and four years for the tampering-with-records charge. The sentences were to run consecutively, for an aggregate prison sentence of nine years. Arde was also to pay restitution in the amount of $348,953.82.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">{\u00b6 12} It is from this sentence that Arde now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">{\u00b6 13} Arde sets forth two assignments of error. The first assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cWhether it was error for the court to sentence defendant to nine years prison instead of the three year term negotiated by the state and defendant that was ratified by the court at defendant\u2019s plea hearing and thereby compromised defendant\u2019s constitutional rights to due process under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I Section 10 of the Ohio State Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">{\u00b6 15} Arde argues that there was an agreement made between her and the state for a three-year prison term, as long as the conditions given by the trial court were met. Arde contends that since she followed the conditions of the trial court, it should honor the plea agreement made between her and the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">{\u00b6 16} The state argues that Arde did not meet the conditions given to her by the trial court because she failed to be forthcoming to the probation department in regard to the location of the embezzled money, or for what it was used. Since Arde did not meet the conditions of the plea, the state contends that the trial court was not bound by the agreed three-year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">{\u00b6 17} The principles of contract law are generally applied to the enforcement as well as the interpretation of plea agreements. One of the principles is that when there is an ambiguity in a plea agreement, the ambiguity is to be construed against the prosecution. <em>State v. Bethel, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 416, 2006-Ohio-4853, 854 N.E.2d 150, \u00b6 50-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-12\">{\u00b6 18} The decision to accept or reject a plea bargain rests solely within the discretion of the trial court. <em>State v. Asberry, </em>173 Ohio App.3d 443, 2007-Ohio-5436, 878 N.E.2d 1082. If the trial court accepts a plea agreement on the record, it must honor it. If the trial court imposes anything other than the agreed-upon sentence, the sentence is rendered void or voidable. <em>State v. Patrick, </em>163 Ohio App.3d 666, 2005-Ohio-5332, 839 N.E.2d 987.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-13\">{\u00b6 19} In the present case, the trial court agreed to the plea agreement negotiated between Arde and the state, on the conditions (1) that Arde did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>\u201cget into trouble\u201d between the plea agreement and sentencing, (2) that Arde show up for reporting dates to the probation department, and (3) that Arde show up for sentencing. Nowhere in the agreement did Arde have to be honest or forthcoming about how the embezzled money was spent or if Arde had any money left. If the trial court was interested in the whereabouts of the money, it should have expressly made that one of the conditions of the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">{\u00b6 20} While the state argues that Arde did not follow the condition that she stay out of trouble because she was not forthcoming with the probation department, that argument is flawed. Since the phrase \u201cdon\u2019t get into trouble\u201d can encompass many different interpretations, it is ambiguous. This phrase should be construed in favor of Arde. The general meaning of \u201cdon\u2019t get into trouble\u201d is generally interpreted in these situations as not getting arrested, which Arde complied with. If the trial court wanted a condition of the agreement to be that Arde comply with the probation department, it should have made that an express condition of the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">{\u00b6 21} Arde and the state, after negotiations, came to a meeting of the minds and agreed upon a three-year prison sentence as well as $348,953.82 in restitution. The trial court agreed to this plea, on the condition that Arde follow a few guidelines. Since Arde complied with all the conditions the trial court set, Arde should have received the agreed-upon prison term of three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">{\u00b6 22} Arde\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">{\u00b6 23} Arde\u2019s second assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cWhether it was error for the court, at sentencing, to order defendant to pay restitution in the amount of $350,953.82 instead of the $348,953.82 amount negotiated by the state and defendant that was ratified by the court at defendant\u2019s plea hearing and thereby compromised defendant\u2019s constitutional rights to due process under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I Section 10 of the Ohio State Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">{\u00b6 25} Arde argues that the amount of restitution is $2,000 greater than the agreed upon total and that her sentence needs to be revised to reflect the amount knowingly and voluntarily agreed to by all parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-12\">{\u00b6 26} However, the trial court had already issued an amended termination entry that corrected the order for restitution to the sum of $348,953.82.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-13\">{\u00b6 27} Arde\u2019s second assignment of error is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">{\u00b6 28} Arde\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained, and the judgment of the trial court is reversed. The nine-year sentence given by the trial court is vacated, and this cause is remanded to the trial court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b237-6\">Donovan, P.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b237-7\">Froelich, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b237-8\">Froelich, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A2n\">concurring in part and dissenting in part. {\u00b6 29} I concur in the reversal, but dissent as to the remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">{\u00b6 30} The appellant, as an explicit condition of the three-year plea agreement, was required to report to the probation department for a presentence investigation. Truthfulness is necessary for the PSI writer to do the job for which the appellant was ordered, and agreed, to report. It is not conceivable that anyone involved directly or even indirectly with this plea agreement \u2014 the judge, the prosecutor, the complainants, the defense attorney, the defendant or the probation officer \u2014 did not contemplate and assume that appellant would be truthful at her meeting with the probation officer. I would, therefore, hold that truthfulness was an implicit or implied condition of the terms of the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">{\u00b6 31} However, one party to an agreement or a contract cannot unilaterally decide that another party has breached its terms and that the agreement is void. I would reverse the nine-year sentence and remand for a hearing at which the state would have the burden of proving that the defendant breached her implied agreement to be truthful.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-12\">{\u00b6 32} The court, in explaining its decision to void the agreement, gave reasons in addition to the appellant\u2019s perceived lack of honesty; for example, the \u201cvery calculated, very scheming and very deliberate\u201d manner in which the money was taken and the \u201ccalculating and convincing\u201d lies the appellant told the victims, resulting in one family\u2019s going without Christmas gifts. The intentionality and callousness of a defendant\u2019s crime are legitimate considerations in imposing sentence. However, these factors were either known or should have been known at the time of the plea agreement, and, to this extent, I agree with the majority that they are not lawful reasons for voiding the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-13\">{\u00b6 33} The only issue at the hearing would be whether the appellant was truthful regarding the money she stole. If the state were to meet its burden, then the trial court could void the agreement and allow the appellant to withdraw her plea. If the state did not prove that the defendant violated the agreement by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>lying, then I would agree with the majority that the agreement is binding and the court must impose the three-year agreed-upon sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
