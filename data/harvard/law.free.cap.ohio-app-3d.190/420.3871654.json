The city of Akron later moved the trial court for a determination that the terms of a settlement agreement reached during mediation are not privileged under Ohio\u2019s Uniform Mediation Act, R.C. Chapter 2710. The landowner, Roger Carter, responded with a motion in limine to exclude all mediation communications under the privilege. The trial court determined that the terms of a settlement reached during a mediation conference are not privileged and granted the city leave to support its motion to enforce settlement with \u201cany evidence of a contract of settlement, the terms of any settlement agreement, and whether such terms were agreed upon.\u201d In a separate entry filed the same day, the trial court sua sponte disqualified Carter\u2019s lawyers from continuing to represent him in the matter because the city intended to call them as witnesses. Carter appealed both entries. The trial court\u2019s judgments are reversed because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>(1) the information the city sought is privileged and the trial court applied a statutory exception without making the requisite findings and (2) the trial court disqualified Carter\u2019s lawyers under Prof.Cond.R. 1.7 and 3.7 without considering whether their testimony would create a conflict of interest or whether they were necessary witnesses under Prof.Cond.R. 3.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">{\u00b6 2} The city of Akron sued Carter, seeking to appropriate two residential properties he owns near the University of Akron campus. The parties mediated the case on May 15, 2009. According to the mediator\u2019s report, filed shortly thereafter, the parties reached a \u201cmutually agreeable settlement\u201d at mediation and intended to enter an order to that effect within 30 days. In mid-August, the city notified the trial court that it intended to move the court to enforce a settlement agreement it said had been reached at mediation. In anticipation of that motion, the city moved the trial court to schedule an in camera hearing under R.C. 2710.05(B) in order to determine whether the terms of a settlement agreement allegedly reached at mediation are privileged communications under R.C. 2710.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">{\u00b6 3} Carter responded with a motion in limine to exclude all evidence of \u201cany * * * mediation settlement discussions\u201d on the basis of privilege under R.C. 2710.01 et seq. Carter requested that all such evidence be excluded from both the in camera hearing and trial. The city opposed Carter\u2019s motion on the basis of R.C. 2710.05(B)(2), arguing that it intended to offer evidence only of the terms of the settlement agreement reached at mediation rather than the mediation discussions leading up to the agreement. The trial court held the requested in camera hearing to determine whether the target evidence was privileged under the Uniform Mediation Act. The record does not reflect what happened at the in camera hearing. Following the hearing, the trial court issued two orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">{\u00b6 4} Although the trial court granted Carter\u2019s request to exclude evidence of all preliminary mediation discussions, it denied his request to exclude evidence of any oral settlement agreement. The trial court held that mediation communications regarding a contract arising out of a mediation are not covered by the privilege. R.C. 2710.05(B)(2). It ordered that the City of Akron may support [its] motion [to enforce settlement agreement] with any evidence of a contract of settlement, the terms of any settlement agreement, and whether such terms were agreed upon. On the same day, September 21, 2009, the trial court issued a separate entry sua sponte disqualifying Carter\u2019s two lawyers from further representing him in this matter because it found that they \u201cwill be called to testify at the [h]earing on the City of Akron\u2019s [m]otion to [e]nforce [settlement.\u201d Carter eventually appealed both entries, but not before the city issued subpoenas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>to Carter\u2019s lawyers, who both responded with affidavits containing the testimony Carter sought to exclude from the trial court\u2019s consideration. The city filed the lawyers\u2019 affidavits as evidence supporting its motion to enforce the settlement agreement the parties had allegedly reached during mediation.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">{\u00b6 5} Carter filed separate notices of appeal from each of the two journal entries the trial court issued on September 21, 2009, and this court consolidated the appeals. Before the parties filed merit briefs, we questioned our jurisdiction regarding the appeal from the ruling on the motion in limine and ordered the parties to brief the issue of whether that entry is a final, appealable order. Before addressing the merits of Carter\u2019s first assignment of error, we must determine whether we have jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">{\u00b6 6} Carter has argued that the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion in limine is a final, appealable order under R.C. 2505.02(B)(1) and (B)(2). The city has argued that the order is not final and appealable because it is merely a tentative, preliminary ruling about an evidentiary issue. Unlike most privilege situations, neither of the parties\u2019 motions involved discovery requests to compel or protect information from disclosure to the opposition, and the trial court\u2019s ruling did not order any such disclosure. The motions dealt entirely with the admissibility of potentially privileged evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">{\u00b6 7} This court has described a motion in limine as \u201ca precautionary request * * * to limit the examination of witnesses by opposing counsel in a specified area until its admissibility is determined by the court outside the presence of the jury.\u201d <em>State v. Echard, </em>9th Dist. No. 24643, 2009-Ohio-6616, 2009 WL 4830001, at \u00b6 3, quoting <em>State v. Grubb </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 199, 201, 28 OBR 285, 503 N.E.2d 142. Due to the preliminary nature of the ruling, in order to preserve the issue for appeal, one must object at the point during trial when the issue arises. Id. at \u00b6 4. In <em>Echar\u00e1, </em>this court pointed out that the Ohio Supreme Court has \u201cexplained that renewing a motion and/or objection in the context of when [the evidence] is offered at trial is important because \u2018the trial court is certainly at liberty * * * to consider the admissibility of the disputed evidence in its actual context.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 4, quoting <em>Grubb </em>at 202. This concept of preserving the issue for appeal applies, however, only if the motion in limine is of a type that requests a preliminary ruling prior to the issue being presented in context during trial. See, e.g., <em>Ford v. Gooden, </em>9th Dist. No. 23779, 2007-Ohio-7043, 2007 WL 4554444, at \u00b6 9, describing a motion in limine as a \u201cpreliminary ruling concerning an evidentiary issue that was anticipated but not yet presented in its full context,\u201d quoting <em>State v. Chandathany, </em>9th Dist. No. 02CA0081-M, 2003-Ohio-1593, 2003 WL 1689591, at \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>{\u00b6 8} Not all motions in limine are aimed at evidence that may later become relevant and admissible if and when a proper foundation has been laid at trial. Some evidence cannot ever become relevant and admissible. For instance, evidence that is subject to the mediation-communication privilege and is not covered by an exception is neither discoverable nor admissible at trial. R.C. 2710.03(A). R.C. 2710.05(B) provides that otherwise privileged mediation communications may be discoverable and admissible only if a trial court determines at an in camera hearing that the criteria set forth in that subsection apply. Whether evidence is privileged under the statute is not dependent on a foundation being laid at trial. Therefore, the ruling on this type of motion in limine is not preliminary. It is definitive.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">{\u00b6 9} In this case, the city moved the court to determine before trial whether the exception codified at R.C. 2710.05(B)(2) applies to the terms of an oral settlement agreement reached at mediation. The city sought to admit testimony from Carter\u2019s lawyers on that topic in support of its motion to enforce settlement. In response, Carter moved the court to exclude all mediation communications as privileged under R.C. 2710.03. The trial court\u2019s ruling on the parties\u2019 competing motions was not preliminary, awaiting a foundation that might be laid at trial. By way of its ruling, the trial court determined that R.C. 2710.05(B)(2) applies to the terms of the settlement agreement allegedly reached at mediation so that the city was permitted to introduce such evidence in support of its motion to enforce the settlement agreement. Therefore, the entry Carter appealed is a ruling on a definitive motion in limine, that is, a final pretrial determination with respect to inadmissibility of a particular matter. <em>State v. Echard, </em>9th Dist. No. 24643, 2009-Ohio-6616, 2009 WL 4830001, at \u00b6 20 (Dickinson, J., dissenting). As a ruling on a definitive motion in limine, the order appealed must be analyzed for finality under R.C. 2505.02 just like any other interlocutory order.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">{\u00b6 10} Under the Ohio Constitution, Ohio\u2019s courts of appeals \u201chave such jurisdiction as may be provided by law to review and affirm, modify, or reverse judgments or final orders of the courts of record inferior to the court of appeals within the district.\u201d Section 3(B)(2), Article IV, Ohio Constitution. Certain interlocutory orders are final and appealable under R.C. 2505.02. See <em>Chef Italiano Corp. v. Kent State Univ. </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 86, 541 N.E.2d 64, syllabus. Under R.C. 2505.02(B)(1), \u201c[a]n order is a final order that may be reviewed, affirmed, modified, or reversed, with or without retrial, when it is * * * [a]n order that affects a substantial right in an action that in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment.\u201d Under R.C. 2505.02(B)(2), an order is a final order that may be reviewed if it is an order in a \u201cspecial proceeding\u201d and it \u201caffects a substantial right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number> {\u00b6 11} An order in an appropriation proceeding instituted under R.C. Chapter 163 is an order in a special proceeding as defined by R.C. 2505.02. <em>Cincinnati Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Pope </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 12, 16, 8 O.O.3d 7, 374 N.E.2d 406. Therefore, to satisfy the statute, the trial court\u2019s order in this case needed to affect a substantial right. R.C. 2505.02(B)(2). The statute defines \u201c[substantial right\u201d as \u201ca right that the United States Constitution, the Ohio Constitution, a statute, the common law, or a rule of procedure entitles a person to enforce or protect.\u201d R.C. 2505.02(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">{\u00b6 12} Subject to certain limitations, R.C. 2710.03 confers a right of privilege on all parties, mediators, and nonparty participants in mediation to protect \u201cmediation communications\u201d from both discovery and admissibility. See R.C. 2710.02. Quoting R.C. 2710.05(B)(2), the trial court determined that no privilege applied \u201cto any communication regarding \u2018a contract arising out of a mediation.\u2019 \u201d The trial court\u2019s journal entry in this case affected Carter\u2019s statutory right to the privilege. Because the order appealed was issued in a special proceeding and affected Carter\u2019s substantial rights, it is a final, appealable order. See R.C. 2505.02(B)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">MEDIATION COMMUNICATIONS: A PRIVILEGE</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">{\u00b6 13} Carter\u2019s first assignment of error is that the trial court incorrectly denied the part of his motion in limine that sought to invoke the statutory privilege covering mediation communications. He has argued that all mediation communications, including those regarding terms of any alleged settlement agreement, are covered by the statute and not subject to any exception. The city has argued that the trial court correctly determined that no privilege attaches to any communications regarding a contract arising from mediation. The bulk of the city\u2019s argument focused on the question of whether an oral settlement agreement is enforceable. But that is not the question before this court. The relevant question is whether the information the city sought to use is privileged under Ohio\u2019s codification of the Uniform Mediation Act. \u201c[Wjhether * * * information sought is confidential and privileged from disclosure is a question of law that is reviewed de novo.\u201d <em>Med. Mut. of Ohio v. Schlotterer, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 181, 2009-Ohio-2496, 909 N.E.2d 1237, at \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">{\u00b6 14} R.C. 2710.03(A) provides that \u201ca mediation communication is privileged * * * and is not subject to discovery or admissible in evidence * * * unless [the privilege is] waived or precluded as provided in section 2710.04 of the Revised Code.\u201d A \u201c \u2018[m]ediation communication\u2019 [is] a statement, whether oral, in a record, verbal or nonverbal, that occurs during a mediation or is made for purposes of * * * participating in * * * a mediation * * R.C. 2710.01(B). The statute provides a privilege for mediation parties, nonparty participants, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>mediators. R.C. 2710.03(B). According to the statute, the privilege may be waived only \u201cif it is expressly waived by all mediation parties and by * * * [the] mediator [in regard to a mediation communication of the mediator] * * * [or] a nonparty participant [in regard to his mediation communication].\u201d R.C. 2710.04(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">{\u00b6 15} There is no dispute that the city sought to admit evidence of mediation communications in this case. See R.C. 2710.01(B). The parties disagree about whether the trial court was correct in determining that statements made during mediation that constitute a settlement agreement fall under an exception to the privilege against disclosure. Ohio\u2019s Uniform Mediation Act includes various exceptions to the general rule of nondisclosure. There is no privilege, for instance, for mediation communications that are \u201ccontained in a written agreement * * * signed by all parties.\u201d R.C. 2710.05(A)(1). There is also no privilege for mediation communications that are \u201csought or offered to prove or disprove a claim or complaint of professional misconduct or malpractice filed against the mediator,\u201d or communications sought in connection with felony criminal proceedings. R.C. 2710.05(A)(5), (9).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">{\u00b6 16} The parties did not sign a written agreement at or following the mediation conference in this matter. The city has not argued that any of the nine exceptions listed in R.C. 2710.05(A) apply. According to the city, an exception codified in subsection (B)(2) of R.C. 2710.05 allows disclosure and admissibility of the mediation communications it desires.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">{\u00b6 17} Application of the (B)(2) exception requires the trial court to make three determinations: (1) that the evidence is not otherwise available, (2) that the disclosure is necessary to prevent a manifest injustice, and (3) that the information is sought in \u201ca proceeding to prove a claim to rescind or reform or a defense to avoid liability on a contract arising out of the mediation.\u201d R.C. 2710.05(B)(2). There is no indication in the record that the trial court considered the first two requirements. In regard to the final requirement, Carter has correctly argued that the exception under (B)(2) does not apply because the city did not seek the mediation communications \u201cin a proceeding to prove a claim to rescind or reform\u201d a contract arising out of mediation nor did it seek them \u201cin a proceeding to prove * * * a defense to avoid liability on a contract arising out of the mediation.\u201d Id. The city sought the information in an effort to prove that an oral contract of settlement arose out of the mediation in order to persuade the trial court to enforce that claimed oral contract against Carter. Therefore, the trial court incorrectly applied R.C. 2710.05(B)(2). Because there is no dispute that the information sought is otherwise covered by R.C. 2710.03(A), the information is privileged and is neither discoverable nor admissible. Carter\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>LAWYER DISQUALIFICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">{\u00b6 18} Carter\u2019s second assignment of error is that the trial court incorrectly disqualified his lawyers under the Ohio Rules of Professional Conduct without conducting an evidentiary hearing and determining whether any of the exceptions to disqualification under Prof.Cond.R. 3.7 applied. An order disqualifying a party\u2019s chosen lawyer in a civil action is a final, appealable order under R.C. 2505.02. <em>Russell v. Mercy Hosp. </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 37, 15 OBR 136, 472 N.E.2d 695, syllabus. Therefore, this court has jurisdiction to consider the trial court\u2019s disqualification of Carter\u2019s lawyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">{\u00b6 19} The trial court sua sponte ordered both of Carter\u2019s lawyers disqualified under Prof.Cond.R. 1.7 and 3.7 because it found that the lawyers \u201cwill be called to testify at the [h]earing on the City of Akron\u2019s [mjotion to [e]nforce [settlement.\u201d If a lawyer may have to serve as both advocate and witness, a trial court may sua sponte raise the issue of disqualification under the ethical rules governing lawyers. <em>Puritas Metal Prods. Inc. v. Cole, </em>9th Dist. Nos. 07CA009255, 07CA009257, and 07CA009259, 2008-Ohio-4653, 2008 WL 4193934, at \u00b6 25. Disqualification of a party\u2019s chosen lawyer, however, is a \u201cdrastic measure [that] courts should hesitate to impose except when absolutely necessary.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 28, quoting <em>Kala v. Aluminum Smelting &amp; Refining Co. </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 1, 6, 688 N.E.2d 258. Disqualification is absolutely necessary only if \u201creal harm is likely to result from failing to [disqualify].\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">{\u00b6 20} Under Prof.Cond.R. 3.7, \u201c[a] lawyer shall not act as an advocate at a trial in which the lawyer is likely to be a necessary witness\u201d unless one of the exceptions stated in the rule applies. In order to determine whether a lawyer is likely to be a necessary witness, the trial court must first determine that the proposed testimony is material and relevant to the issues being litigated and that the evidence is unobtainable elsewhere. <em>Puritas Metal Prods, </em>at \u00b6 39. \u201cTestimony may be relevant and even highly useful but still not strictly necessary. A finding of necessity takes into account such factors as the significance of the matters, weight of the testimony and availability of other evidence. * * * A party\u2019s mere declaration of an intention to call opposing counsel as a witness is an insufficient basis for disqualification even if that counsel could give relevant testimony.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 34, quoting <em>Mettler v. Mettler </em>(2007), 50 Conn.Supp. 357, 928 A.2d 631, 633.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">{\u00b6 21} In this case, the trial court disqualified Carter\u2019s lawyers before they could be called by the city as witnesses at the hearing on the city\u2019s motion to enforce a settlement agreement. By its plain language, Prof.Cond.R. 3.7 forbids a lawyer from acting as an advocate \u201cat a trial\u201d in which he is likely to be a necessary witness. The rule does not address whether a lawyer may act as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>advocate at a motion hearing in which he is likely to be called as a necessary witness. In any event, there is no indication in the record that the trial court considered whether Carter\u2019s lawyers met the \u201cnecessary witness\u201d test. The trial court determined only that Carter\u2019s lawyers \u201cwill be called to testify.\u201d A party\u2019s stated intention to call his opponent\u2019s lawyer to testify is an insufficient basis for disqualification of a litigant\u2019s chosen lawyer under Prof.Cond.R. 3.7. <em>Puritas Metal Prods., </em>2008-Ohio-4653, 2008 WL 4193934, at \u00b6 34, quoting <em>Mettler v. Mettler, </em>928 A.2d at 633. Furthermore, there is no indication that the trial court determined that real harm was likely to result from the lawyers\u2019 continued representation of Carter in this matter. Id. at \u00b6 28. To the extent that it addressed his lawyers\u2019 disqualification under Prof.Cond.R. 3.7, Carter\u2019s second assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">{\u00b6 22} In disqualifying the lawyers, the trial court also relied on Prof.Cond.R. 1.7. Under the rule regulating conflicts of interest with current clients, a lawyer may be required to discontinue representing a client if \u201cthere is a <em>substantial </em>risk that the lawyer\u2019s ability to consider, recommend, or carry out an appropriate course of action for that client will be materially limited by * * * the lawyer\u2019s own personal interests.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Prof.Cond.R. 1.7(a)(2). Depending on the circumstances, a lawyer\u2019s personal interest in testifying truthfully when called to do so under oath could create a conflict of interest with his client. There is no indication that the trial court considered whether the lawyers testifying at the motion hearing in this matter would create \u201ca substantial risk\u201d of \u201cmaterially limit[ing]\u201d their ability to appropriately represent Carter\u2019s interests. Id. Therefore, to the extent that Carter\u2019s second assignment of error relates to his lawyers\u2019 disqualification under Prof.Cond.R. 1.7, it is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">{\u00b6 23} Carter\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained because the information the city sought is privileged under Ohio\u2019s Uniform Mediation Act and the trial court incorrectly held that the exception under R.C. 2710.05(B)(2) applied. The second assignment of error is also sustained. The trial court incorrectly disqualified Carter\u2019s lawyers without considering whether they satisfied the test for necessary witnesses under Prof.Cond.R. 3.7 or whether their testimony would create a conflict of interest under Prof.Cond.R. 1.7. The judgment of the Summit County Common Pleas Court, Probate Division, is reversed, and the cause is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b466-8\">Belfance, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b466-9\">Moore, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
