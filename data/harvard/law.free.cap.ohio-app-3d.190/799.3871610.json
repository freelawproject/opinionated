On that date, Carl went to the Alliance Community Hospital complaining of abdominal pain. An emergency appendectomy was performed. Although the surgery was successful, a series of post-operative complications arose, the result being that Carl suffered severe brain damage. Carl remained in a vegetative state in a nursing home until his death on October 17, 2008. Carl died intestate, leaving his mother, Mary Boone, as his only heir.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-11\">{\u00b6 3} While Carl was still alive, on February 14, 2008, Mary filed an application to appoint a guardian of the person and the estate for Carl based on Carl\u2019s incompetency. Appellee also filed an application to be appointed Carl\u2019s guardian. On April 15, the probate court appointed Mary as the guardian of the person and the estate of Carl.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-12\">{\u00b6 4} Prior to January 18, 2008, Carl was employed by Reliable Ready Mix. As Reliable Ready Mix\u2019s employee, Carl had term-life and accident insurance policies through American Family Life Insurance Company (\u201cAFLAC\u201d). Reliable Ready Mix paid the premiums on these policies through June 30, 2008. Appellee was the named beneficiary of the policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-13\">{\u00b6 5} On August 5, 2008, the guardian filed two applications. The first application asked (1) to pay the July, August, and future premiums of the life insurance policy and (2) to change the beneficiary from appellee to the estate of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>Carl Boone, \u201cso that the ward may derive some benefit from the policy death benefit.\u201d The second application made the same requests as to the accident insurance policy. The probate court approved both applications. The guardian subsequently paid the insurance premiums and changed the beneficiaries of the policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">{\u00b6 6} After Carl\u2019s death, on October 31, 2008, the probate court ordered that the guardianship be terminated and that Mary be relieved of her duties as guardian upon the approval of a guardian\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">{\u00b6 7} Mary filed a final account of the guardian. The probate court approved the account on January 20, 2009, and discharged the guardian. Appellee filed a motion to stay this judgment, which the probate court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">{\u00b6 8} Proceeding simultaneously with the termination of the guardianship, Mary filed an application for authority to administer Carl\u2019s estate. The court appointed Mary as administratrix of Carl\u2019s estate. Appellant subsequently collected the insurance proceeds from the policies totaling approximately $140,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">{\u00b6 9} Appellee filed a motion to surrender funds requesting that the insurance proceeds be turned over to her because she had been the named beneficiary of the policies before the guardian changed the beneficiary. Appellant filed a motion to dismiss and memorandum in opposition, asserting that the court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, appellee did not have standing, and appellee had failed to present any evidence to establish that the court exceeded its authority in issuing the authorization to change the beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">{\u00b6 10} The motions were heard before a magistrate, who recommended the following holdings: (1) the probate court had subject-matter jurisdiction, (2) appellee had standing because she was the one who suffered damages as a result of the court\u2019s authorization, and (3) the guardian acted reasonably and the court was empowered by statute to allow the guardian to act in changing the insurance beneficiaries. Thus, the magistrate recommended that appellee\u2019s motion to surrender funds be denied. Both parties filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">{\u00b6 11} On October 5, 2009, the probate court rejected the magistrate\u2019s decision and ordered that the death benefits of the insurance policies be distributed to appellee. The court determined that it had erred in approving the application for authority to change the beneficiary of the insurance policies because doing so created no benefit to the ward during his lifetime, but instead created only postmortem benefits for the ward\u2019s estate. It went on to reason that guardians do not have the authority to change the names of beneficiaries when such a change <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>does not relate to managing or preserving the ward\u2019s estate and when it is not in the best interest of the ward.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">{\u00b6 12} Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal on October 30, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">{\u00b6 13} Appellant raises five assignments of error, the first of which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cThe probate court erred when it denied plaintiff-appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss and held that movant-appellee Carbone, as a former potential beneficiary of the life insurance policy and accident policy had standing to challenge the probate court\u2019s order authorizing the guardian to change the beneficiary designation on the insurance policies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">{\u00b6 15} Appellant argues that appellee, as the former beneficiary of the insurance policies, lacked standing to pursue her motion to surrender funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cStanding\u201d means that the plaintiff has a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy, a concrete injury that will be resolved by the court, rather than a hypothetical or conjectural matter. <em>In re Estate of Goehring, </em>7th Dist. Nos. 05-CO-27, 05-CO-35, 2007-Ohio-1133, 2007 WL 754745, \u00b6 69. \u201cThe question of standing is whether a litigant is entitled to have a court determine the merits of the issues presented.\u201d <em>Ohio Contrs. Assn. v. Bicking </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 318, 320, 643 N.E.2d 1088.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">{\u00b6 17} Whether the established facts confer standing on the plaintiff to assert a claim is a matter of law. <em>Portage Cty. Bd. of Commrs. v. Akron, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 106, 2006-Ohio-954, 846 N.E.2d 478, at \u00b6 90. Appellate courts review questions of law under a de novo standard of review. <em>Skirvin v. Kidd, </em>174 Ohio App.3d 273, 2007-Ohio-7179, 881 N.E.2d 914, at \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">{\u00b6 18} Appellant asserts that appellee did not have a legally enforceable interest, because her interest was not vested at the time the probate court issued the authorization orders allowing the guardian to change the beneficiary. It contends that because Carl retained the right to change the beneficiary of his policies, appellee did not have a vested interest. And because she did not have a vested interest, appellant points out that appellee would not have had a right to sue the insurer under the policies. Appellant further argues that the guardian had all the rights of ownership of the policies as Carl had, including the right to change the beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-12\">{\u00b6 19} Appellant analogizes this case to that of <em>Ferguson v. Walsh, </em>10th Dist. No. 02AP-1231, 2003-Ohio-4504, 2003 WL 22006833. In <em>Ferguson, </em>Vera Peebles deposited two payable-on-death (\u201cPOD\u201d) certificates into the bank that designated the appellant\u2019s minor children as the beneficiaries. A year later, a guardian of the person and estate was' appointed for Peebles. The guardian subsequently liquidated the two certificates and used the money to pay for Peebles\u2019s care. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>When Peebles died, the appellant filed claims against Peebles\u2019s estate, arguing that the guardian had wrongfully liquidated the POD certificates, and against the bank, for failing to ascertain the status of the certificates. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the estate and the bank and dismissed the appellant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">{\u00b6 20} On appeal, the appellant argued that although the POD certificates were liquidated before Peebles\u2019s death, enforceable rights remained with her as a third-party beneficiary because the certificates were wrongly liquidated. The appellate court disagreed. Citing R.C. 2131.10, which deals in part with POD accounts, the court noted that the owner of any such account retains the right to withdraw the funds as though no beneficiary had been designated. Id. at \u00b6 15. The court explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cIt follows that the depositor-owner of funds in a P.O.D. account exercises full ownership over the funds during his or her lifetime and the interest of the beneficiary will not vest until the depositor-owner\u2019s death. The proceeds of a P.O.D. account are revocable at will during the lifetime of the depositor-owner. The interest retained by the depositor-owner is both legal and equitable. A court appointed guardian \u2018acting as a fiduciary, exercise[s] all rights of ownership which the ward could have exercised during her lifetime had she not been declared legally incompetent.\u2019 This power includes the rights to withdraw funds from a P.O.D. account and thereby delete the beneficiary if it is in the best interest of the ward. Indeed, the guardian of a person and an estate has a duty to provide for maintenance for the ward, as paid out of the ward\u2019s estate, which includes health care, debts and other affairs relating to the management of the estate. R.C. 2111.13 and 2111.14. Therefore, during the lifetime of the ward-owner, a guardian acts in the best interest of the ward when the withdrawal of proceeds from a P.O.D. certificate is related to the management of the ward\u2019s estate or maintenance of the ward.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id. at \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">{\u00b6 22} Thus, the court concluded that the appellant had no standing to challenge the liquidation of the POD account.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">{\u00b6 23} The appellant had also argued that her rights could not be eliminated if the POD certificate was wrongfully liquidated. The court found no merit in this argument for two reasons. First, it reasoned that the appellant had failed to cite any facts or law that showed that liquidation to provide for Peebles\u2019s care was not in her best interest. Id. at \u00b6 21. Second, it reasoned that the appellant had failed to set forth facts evidencing Peebles\u2019s purported intent to create an irrevocable testamentary instrument in favor of the former beneficiaries, as the appellant alleged. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">{\u00b624} Appellee, on the other hand, relies on <em>J.G. Wentworth L.L.C. v. Christian, </em>7th Dist. No. 07-MA-113, 2008-Ohio-3089, 2008 WL 2486552. <em>Chris</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number><em>tian </em>dealt with the assignment of annuity payments and, in part, whether the intended third-party beneficiaries had standing to bring a claim. This court concluded:</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cContrary to J.G. Wentworth\u2019s suggestions, an intended third party beneficiary of a contract can bring an action on that contract. See, e.g., <em>Grant Thornton v. Windsor House, Inc. </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 158, 161 [566 N.E.2d 1220]. Likewise, a beneficiary named on a non-probate asset is such an intended third party beneficiary of the contract governing that asset and thus has the concomitant power and standing to assert rights under the contract governing that asset. See <em>Visintine &amp; Co. v. New York &amp; St. L.R. Co. </em>(1959), 169 Ohio St. 505, 507 [9 O.O.2d 4, 160 N.E.2d 311] (noting that life insurance beneficiary has right to enforce contract as third party intended donee beneficiary). See, also, <em>Taylor v. First Natl. Bank of Cincinnati </em>(1986), 31 Ohio App.3d 49, 51 [31 OBR 88, 508 N.E.2d 1006] (beneficiary on decedent\u2019s payable on death savings account has standing to argue rights under deposit contract). Accordingly, we conclude that appellants have standing to raise defenses and arguments to support their claimed right to the annuity payments.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">{\u00b6 26} Appellee\u2019s reliance on <em>Christian, </em>2008-Ohio-3089, 2008 WL 2486552, is well placed. The facts bear many similarities to the case at bar. Additionally, <em>Christian </em>is the precedent for this court. And <em>Christian </em>relied in part on an Ohio Supreme Court case that specifically stated that an intended third-party beneficiary of a contract can bring an action on that contract. See <em>Grant Thornton, </em>57 Ohio St.3d at 161, 566 N.E.2d 1220.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">{\u00b6 27} On the other hand, <em>Ferguson, </em>2003-Ohio-4504, 2003 WL 22006833, is not precedent for this court. Moreover, <em>Ferguson </em>is distinguishable from this case. In <em>Ferguson, </em>the parties were dealing with POD certificates. The guardian liquidated the certificates during Peebles\u2019s lifetime. The guardian then used the money to pay for Peebles\u2019s care. Thus, the money was made available to Peebles during her lifetime and for her direct care. In this case, however, changing the beneficiary of the insurance policies provided no benefit to Carl during his lifetime. The money was not made available for his care, because it could not be collected until his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">{\u00b6 28} Based on the above, the trial court did not err in finding that appellee had standing to bring her motion to surrender funds. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">{\u00b6 29} Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error states:</p>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cThe probate court erred in failing to dismiss Dawn Carbone\u2019s motion to surrender for lack of jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>{\u00b6 31} Here, appellant first argues that the probate court did not have authority to modify the authorization orders in the guardianship case. It notes that 14 months had passed since the court issued the authorization orders, and ten months had passed since the guardianship had terminated. Appellant argues that what appellee actually sought was to have the court vacate its authorization orders. It contends that the only way to vacate such an order is to follow the procedure of a Civ.R. 60(B) motion for relief from judgment. It points out that appellee did not file such a motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">{\u00b6 32} Second, appellant argues that the probate court was divested of its authority to modify its prior order once the guardianship case was terminated. It contends that once Carl died, the court\u2019s only jurisdiction in the guardianship case was to settle the guardian\u2019s final accounting, which it did on January 20, 2009. And once the court terminated the guardianship, appellant argues, the guardianship ceased to exist, and the court was divested of subject-matter jurisdiction to go back into the guardianship for any reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">{\u00b6 33} Finally, appellant claims that there was no legal basis for appellee\u2019s motion to surrender funds. It notes that probate courts are courts of limited jurisdiction and may hear only those types of cases expressly authorized by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cThe existence of the court\u2019s own subject-matter jurisdiction in a particular case poses a question of law which the court has the authority and responsibility to determine.\u201d <em>Intenatl. Lottery, Inc. v. Kerouac </em>(1995), 102 Ohio App.3d 660, 670, 657 N.E.2d 820. As this issue presents a question of law, we review it de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">{\u00b6 35} Appellant is correct that generally the legal effect of a guardianship ends upon the death of the ward, and the executor of the estate takes immediate title to the assets. <em>State ex rel. Hards v. Klammer, </em>11th Dist. No.2004-L-189, 2005-Ohio-2655, 2005 WL 1272374, at \u00b6 14, citing <em>Simpson v. Holmes </em>(1922), 106 Ohio St. 437, 140 N.E. 395. Nonetheless, even though the legal effect of the guardian has terminated, both the guardian and the court still etain some residual authority over the estate assets. Id. at \u00b6 14-18, citing <em>State ex rel. Beedle v. Kiracofe </em>(1964), 176 Ohio St. 149, 27 O.O.2d 25, 198 N.E.2d 61, and <em>In re Schueneman </em>(1948) 36 O.O. 513, 78 N.E.2d 688. This authority is usually limited to wrapping up the guardianship and settling the final accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">{\u00b6 36} The probate court has exclusive jurisdiction \u201c[t]o direct and control the conduct and settle the accounts of executors and administrators and order the distribution of estates.\u201d R.C. 2101.24(A)(1)(c). The probate court is vested with full power to determine what property is lawfully included in an inventory as assets. <em>In re Estate of Taylor </em>(June 21, 1991), 4th Dist. No. 1957, 1991 WL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>110230, citing <em>Bolles v. Toledo Trust Co. </em>(1940), 136 Ohio St. 517, 17 O.O. 156, 27 N.E.2d 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cWhenever a probate court has a case before it, it also \u2018has plenary power at law and in equity to dispose fully of any matter that is properly before the court, unless the power is expressly otherwise limited or denied by a section of the Revised Code.\u2019 \u201d <em>Estate of Snell v. Kilburn, </em>165 Ohio App.3d 352, 2005-Ohio-7076, 846 N.E.2d 572, at \u00b641, quoting R.C. 2101.24(C). The legislative grant of plenary power to the probate court gives the court authority to take actions necessary to fully dispose of any matter properly before the court. Id., citing <em>Roll v. Edwards, </em>156 Ohio App.3d 227, 2004-Ohio-767, 805 N.E.2d 162, at \u00b6 20. This plenary power, however, is limited to matters \u201cproperly before the court.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Marsteller v. Maloney, </em>7th Dist. No. 04-MA-279, 2005-Ohio-1836, 2005 WL 911140, at \u00b6 37, quoting <em>State ex rel. Goldberg v. Mahoning Cty. Probate Court </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 160, 165, 753 N.E.2d 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cThe Probate Court has constitutional jurisdiction of probate and testamentary matters and the accounts of executors and administrators. Such constitutional jurisdiction necessarily comprehends jurisdiction of inventories of administrators and executors and exceptions thereto, as inventories are essential to the accounting of executors and administrators. Incident to the constitutional jurisdiction in the premises, the Probate Court has plenary power to dispose of any matter properly before it, including the power to adopt and apply remedies which are legal or equitable in their nature. The exercise of such jurisdiction by the Probate Court is mandatory and not discretionary.\u201d <em>In re Thrush\u2019s Estate </em>(1945), 76 Ohio App. 411, 423, 32 O.O. 147, 64 N.E.2d 839.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">{\u00b6 39} Pursuant to the court\u2019s plenary power and its jurisdiction over the inventories of estates, the probate court in this case had subject-matter jurisdiction over the insurance proceeds. The insurance proceeds were included as an asset of the estate. Therefore, the court had jurisdiction to determine whether the proceeds properly belonged to the estate. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">{\u00b6 40} Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error states:</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cThe probate court erred in failing to adopt the magistrate\u2019s findings of fact when the movant-appellee failed to file a transcript of the hearing with her objections in accordance with Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(b).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">{\u00b6 42} Appellant argues here that the probate court erred in rejecting the magistrate\u2019s decision \u201cin whole\u201d without the benefit of an evidentiary transcript of the proceedings before the magistrate. It points out that all objections to findings of fact must be supported by a transcript of the evidence. Civ.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>53(D)(3)(b)(iii). Because appellee failed to file a transcript, appellant argues, the court abused its discretion in failing to adopt the magistrate\u2019s findings of fact. Further, appellant asserts that because the court rejected the magistrate\u2019s decision in whole, it was left with no factual basis on which it could have determined what was in Carl\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">{\u00b6 43} Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(b)(iii) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cAn objection <em>to a factual finding, </em>whether or not specifically designated as a finding of fact under Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(a)(ii), shall be supported by a transcript of all the evidence submitted to the magistrate relevant to that finding or an affidavit of that evidence if a transcript is not available.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">{\u00b6 45} In this case, however, appellee did not object to any of the magistrate\u2019s findings of fact. Instead, she objected to the magistrate\u2019s conclusion of law, stating, \u201cThe Movant, respectfully submits that the Magistrate made an error of law when he concluded that this court was empowered to allow the Guardian to act in the changing of the life insurance beneficiaries for the subject policies of insurance.\u201d She continued to make various legal arguments against this allegedly erroneous conclusion of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">[12,133 {\u00b6 46} While a party cannot challenge a magistrate\u2019s factual findings on appeal unless the party submits a proper transcript or affidavit, the party can challenge conclusions of law without a transcript. <em>Dinu v. Dinu, </em>8th Dist. No. 89216, 2008-Ohio-223, 2008 WL 192475, at \u00b6 9. Only when the resolution of the objections necessitates a factual, evidentiary analysis is a transcript required. Id. In cases where the objecting party fails to provide a transcript or affidavit, the trial court is limited to examining the magistrate\u2019s conclusions of law and recommendations in light of the findings of fact unless the trial court elects to hold further hearings. <em>Boswell v. Wheeling Canvas Prods., </em>7th Dist. No. 06-JE-10, 2006-Ohio-7051, 2006 WL 3849908, at \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">{\u00b6 47} Because appellee did not challenge the magistrate\u2019s findings of fact, but instead challenged only the conclusions of law, she was not required to file a transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">{\u00b6 48} Furthermore, appellant conceded this point in the trial court. In the court\u2019s judgment entry, it noted: \u201cBoth counsel indicated that there was no objection to the factual findings of the Magistrate and therefore a transcript as referred to in Rule 53(D)(3)(b)(iii) of the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure was not required.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>{\u00b6 49} As an aside, we should note that appellant filed a transcript with this court after filing its notice of appeal. But because the transcript was not before the trial court, this court will not consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">{\u00b6 50} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">{\u00b6 51} Appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error states:</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">{\u00b6 52} \u201cThe probate court erred in rejecting the magistrate\u2019s decision of June 12, 2009, when it incorrectly interpreted the \u2018best interest of the ward\u2019 test under R.C. 2111.50.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">{\u00b6 53} Appellant contends that the probate court did not properly interpret the \u201cbest interest of the ward\u201d test as set out in R.C. 2111.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">{\u00b6 54} R.C. 2111.50(C) provides that \u201call powers of a guardian that relate to his ward or guardianship * * * shall be exercised in the best interest, as determined in the court\u2019s or guardian\u2019s judgment, of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b847-10\">{\u00b6 55} \u201c(1) The person whom the probate court has found to be an incompetent or a minor subject to guardianship;</p>\n<p id=\"b847-11\">{\u00b6 56} \u201c(2) The dependents of the person;</p>\n<p id=\"b847-12\">{\u00b6 57} \u201c(3) The members of the household of the person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b847-13\">{\u00b6 58} Appellant argues that the probate court improperly added the requirement to this section that the best interest of the ward must be \u201cduring the ward\u2019s lifetime.\u201d It analogizes this case to <em>Estate of Strang v. Strang, </em>5th Dist. No. 03-COA-071, 2004-Ohio-3677, 2004 WL 1549685. The portions of the <em>Strang </em>decision on which appellant relies, however, were findings of the trial court, which the appellate court in that case did not make.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-14\">{\u00b6 59} In <em>Strang, </em>the decedent had opened a certificate of deposit payable on death to the appellant. Two years later, a guardian was appointed for the decedent. The guardian deleted the POD clause. The funds of the certificate were not needed by the decedent during his lifetime and remained at the time of his death. The appellant was initially appointed as administrator of the estate (however, he was later removed for financial misconduct). In his final account, the certificate of deposit was listed as an estate asset. The appellant filed a motion to delete the certificate of deposit from the account. The court, treating the motion as a declaratory-judgment action, found the certificate of deposit to be an estate asset.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-15\">{\u00b6 60} The appellate court simply found the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Miller v. Peoples Fed. S. &amp; L. Assn. </em>(1981), 68 Ohio St.2d 175, 22 O.O.3d 406, 429 N.E.2d 439, to be controlling. Id. at \u00b6 18-19. In <em>Miller, </em>the court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b848-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>{\u00b6 61} \u201cThe depositor of a payable-on-death (P.O.D.) account retains her rights to ownership and full control of such account during her lifetime. Following a finding of incompetency by the Probate Court, the depositor\u2019s ownership rights pass to the legally appointed guardian of her estate, including the right to designate a change in the registration of such account.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>68 Ohio St.2d 175, 22 O.O.3d 406, 429 N.E.2d 439, at paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">{\u00b6 62} Finally, appellant argues that the benefit conferred on Carl was postmortem, as the proceeds of the insurance policy would be available to pay necessary bills and expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">{\u00b6 63} When determining whether a trial court correctly interpreted and applied a statute, an appellate court uses a de novo standard of review. <em>Akron v. Frazier </em>(2001), 142 Ohio App.3d 718, 721, 756 N.E.2d 1258.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">{\u00b6 64} A guardian\u2019s duty is to manage and preserve the ward\u2019s estate, to provide for the care and protection of the ward\u2019s person, and to act in the best interest of the ward. <em>Witt v. Ward </em>(1989), 60 Ohio App.3d 21, 573 N.E.2d 201, citing R.C. 2111.13 and 2111.14. \u201cA guardian is not the \u2018alter ego\u2019 of the ward and cannot perform all acts for the ward in the same manner as the ward would do, except for the adjudication of incompetence.\u201d Id. The probate court does not have the power to authorize a guardian to enter into contracts other than those made in the management of the ward\u2019s estate and protection of his person. Id., citing <em>Zuber v. Zuber </em>(1952), 93 Ohio App. 195, 50 O.O. 496, 112 N.E.2d 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">{\u00b6 65} \u201cAppellants, as guardians, have no authority to enter into a transaction which does not involve the management of the estate. Further, they have no authority to prohibit or interfere with a testamentary disposition of the ward\u2019s. This is particularly true in light of the fact that their changing of the account designation has not been shown to be in the best interest of the ward.\u201d Id. at 24, 573 N.E.2d 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">{\u00b6 66} Based on the above case law, the trial court did not err in determining that it should not have allowed appellant to change the beneficiaries on the insurance policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">{\u00b6 67} On her application for authority to change beneficiary, the guardian stated that the reason for seeking to change the beneficiary was \u201cso that the ward may derive some benefit from the policy death benefit.\u201d This was the only reason she gave. It is certain that Carl would not receive any benefit from his own death benefits. The only person who stood to benefit from changing the beneficiary from appellee to Carl\u2019s estate was Carl\u2019s next-of-kin, in this case, his mother. Thus, changing the beneficiary was not in Carl\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>{\u00b6 68} Furthermore, by changing the insurance beneficiary, the guardian was clearly interfering with Carl\u2019s testamentary intention. Carl did not have a will. His only testamentary intention was expressed through his designation of his life-insurance beneficiary. He chose to designate appellee as his beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">{\u00b6 69} Finally, changing the beneficiary on the insurance policies provided no benefit to Carl as to his care or protection. Many of the cases cited by appellant deal with bank accounts where changing the beneficiary resulted in freeing up money that could then be used to care for the ward during his/her lifetime. Such was not the case here. No money was available under the policies until after Carl\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">{\u00b6 70} For these reasons, appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">{\u00b6 71} Appellant\u2019s fifth assignment of error states:</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">{\u00b6 72} \u201cThe probate court erred in granting Carbone\u2019s motion to surrender and awarding the insurance proceeds to a third party in the estate proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">{\u00b6 73} Here appellant argues that the probate court erred in finding that a guardian could not change the beneficiary designation on insurance policies that provide postmortem benefits, because it was not in the best interest of the ward during the ward\u2019s lifetime. It reasons that assuming arguendo that the court was correct in holding that the beneficiary change was not in the ward\u2019s best interest, the court should have also reversed its order approving the payment of the insurance premiums by the guardian. Appellant also argues that the insurance policies could have provided a lifetime benefit to the ward by way of converting the policies into cash through a viatical settlement. Finally, appellant argues that appellee\u2019s only way to proceed here was through a declaratory-judgment action, which appellee did not file.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-10\">{\u00b6 74} First, the court\u2019s order approving payment of the insurance premiums by the guardian was separate from its order allowing the beneficiary change. Even though the court ultimately reversed its order allowing the beneficiary change, it was not under any duty to change the order approving payment of the insurance premiums. The court could have considered these payments necessary in order to preserve Carl\u2019s testamentary intentions and to keep this asset of his intact should he somehow have recovered from his coma.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">{\u00b6 75} Second, appellant\u2019s mention of turning the life-insurance policies into a viatical settlement appears for the first time here on appeal. Because appellant did not raise this issue in the trial court, we will not address it. Furthermore, there was no indication whatsoever that the policies had any cash <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>surrender value or that appellant attempted to enter into some type of settlement with the insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">{\u00b6 76} Third, appellant is correct that appellee did not file a declaratory-judgment action. However, she provides no support for her proposition that this was the only avenue appellee had to pursue her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">{\u00b6 77} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s fifth assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">{\u00b6 78} For the reasons stated above, the trial court\u2019s judgment is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b850-9\">Waite and DeGenaro, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
