Pursuant to the terms of the contract, the contract and security agreement were assigned to Atlantic Financial Services, Inc., on February 24, 2005. Appellee eventually defaulted on the terms of the contract, and the vehicle was repossessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">{\u00b6 3} Appellant asserts that it is the owner of the debt, claiming that it purchased the debt from Ameristar Financial Servicing Co., L.L.C., which acquired the debt from Atlantic Financial Services, Inc., after Atlantic sold it as part of a batch of bad debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">{\u00b6 4} At the time of sale of appellee\u2019s account, there was a balance due and owing of $5,428.24.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">{\u00b6 5} On February 27, 2008, appellant filed a complaint in the Mansfield Municipal Court, alleging that appellee had entered into an agreement with appellant\u2019s assignor and defaulted on that agreement. The complaint also alleged that as of the date of the complaint, the unpaid obligation included $5,428.24, plus accrued interest at the contract rate of 24.95 percent. A copy of the retail installment contract was attached to appellant\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">{\u00b6 6} Appellee was served via certified mail service on March 6, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">{\u00b6 7} Appellee did not initially file an answer to the complaint, and on April 17, 2008, a default judgment was granted in favor of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-12\">{\u00b6 8} On May 1, 2008, counsel for appellee filed a motion for relief from judgment, which was granted on July 10, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-13\">{\u00b6 9} Subsequently, appellee filed an answer to appellant\u2019s complaint and a counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-14\">{\u00b6 10} Appellant answered the counterclaim, and the parties participated in extensive discovery in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-15\">{\u00b6 11} On July 21, 2009, a trial before a magistrate commenced in this matter. At trial, the magistrate heard testimony from Todd Turner, Robert Bowman, William H. Dunn, and Elaine North. Appellant also submitted the following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>documentary evidence: the retail installment contract, the purchase agreement between Atlantic and Ameristar, the bills of sale/assignments and a redacted copy of the Schedule A referred to in the bills of sale/assignments. Schedule A purports to be an Excel spreadsheet identifying and detailing the included accounts, which was compiled and transmitted via e-mail as part of the sales transaction between Atlantic and Ameristar and then from Ameristar to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">{\u00b6 12} Todd Turner was the chief operating officer for Atlantic, and his duties included the review and examination of bad debts. He stated that he was personally involved in a transaction that occurred on December 19, 2007, wherein Atlantic entered into a contract with Ameristar to sell a batch of bad debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">{\u00b6 13} Robert Bowman testified that he signed the bill of sale and closed the deal between Atlantic and Ameristar.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">{\u00b6 14} William H. Dunn, an employee of Ameristar, testified that he was personally involved in the Atlantic-Ameristar sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">{\u00b6 15} Elaine North, the director of administration for appellant, testified that she is the keeper of the records from the sale of debt transactions entered into by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">{\u00b6 16} On August 13, 2009, a magistrate\u2019s report was filed dismissing both the complaint and the counterclaim without prejudice. In that decision, the magistrate found that the evidence presented by appellant was inadequate and failed to establish that it was the owner of the debt at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">{\u00b6 17} On December 30, 2009, after both parties objected to the magistrate\u2019s report, the magistrate\u2019s report was approved by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">{\u00b6 18} Appellant now appeals, raising the following assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"A9l\">ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cI. The trial court erred by determining that the evidence presented by appellant failed to meet the authenticity requirements of Ohio Rule of Evidence 901.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-13\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cII. The trial court erred by determining that the evidence presented by appellant failed to meet the business records exception of Ohio Rule of Evidence 803.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-14\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cHI. The trial court erred by determining that the evidence presented by appellant failed to meet the requirements of Ohio Rule of Evidence 1002.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-15\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cIV. The decision of the trial court determining that appellant did not prove its purchase of appellee\u2019s account was against the manifest weight of the evidence presented by appellant at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>I, II, and III</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">{\u00b6 23} In appellant\u2019s first three assignments of error, appellant challenges the trial court\u2019s decision not to admit evidence pursuant to Evid.R. 901, 803, and 1002.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">{\u00b6 24} The decision before the trial court in this case was whether Evid.R. 1002 required that the original documentation be presented in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cEvid. R 1002 Requirement of original</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cTo prove the content of a writing, recording, or photograph, the original writing, recording, or photograph is required, except as otherwise provided in these rules or by statute enacted by the General Assembly not in conflict with a rule of the Supreme Court of Ohio.\u201d (Boldface sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">{\u00b6 27} The Rules of Evidence go on to provide that \u201c[a] duplicate is admissible to the same extent as an original unless (1) a genuine question is raised as to the authenticity of the original or (2) in the circumstances it would be unfair to admit the duplicate in lieu of the original.\u201d Evid.R. 1003.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">{\u00b6 28} Generally, the admission or \u00e9xclusion of relevant evidence rests within the sound discretion of the trial court, and its decision to admit or exclude that evidence will not be disturbed absent an abuse of that discretion. <em>State v. Sage </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 173, 31 OBR 375, 510 N.E.2d 343, paragraph two of the syllabus; <em>State v. Reed </em>(1996), 110 Ohio App.3d 749, 752, 675 N.E.2d 77. However, while the trial court has discretion to admit or exclude relevant evidence, it has no discretion to admit hearsay. Evid.R. 802 requires the exclusion of hearsay unless an exception applies. Thus, we review de novo the trial court\u2019s decision regarding whether evidence is hearsay or nonhearsay under Evid.R. 801. <em>State v. Sorrels </em>(1991), 71 Ohio App.3d 162, 165, 593 N.E.2d 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">{\u00b6 29} Hearsay is generally inadmissible, unless it falls within the scope of an exception within the Rules of Evidence. Evid.R. 802; <em>State v. DeMarco </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 191, 195, 31 OBR 390, 509 N.E.2d 1256.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">{\u00b6 30} One such exception is the \u201crecords of regular conducted activity,\u201d more commonly known as the business-records exception. Evid.R. 803(6). The rationale behind Evid.R. 803(6) is that if information is sufficiently trustworthy that a business is willing to rely on it in making business decisions, the courts should be willing to as well. See staff note to Evid.R. 803(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-12\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cTo qualify for admission under Rule 803(6), a business record must manifest four essential elements: (i) the record must be one regularly recorded in a regularly conducted activity; (ii) it must have been entered by a person with knowledge of the act, event or condition; (iii) it must have been recorded at or near the time of the transaction; and (iv) a foundation must be laid by the \u2018custodian\u2019 of the record or by some \u2018other qualified witness.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number><em>Davis, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 404, 2008-Ohio-2, 880 N.E.2d 31, \u00b6 171, quoting Weissen-berger, Ohio Evidence Treatise (2007) 600, Section 803.73. See also <em>McCormick v. Mirrored Image, Inc. </em>(1982), 7 Ohio App.3d 232, 233, 7 OBR 294, 454 N.E.2d 1363.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">{\u00b6 32} The phrase \u201cother qualified witness\u201d should be broadly interpreted. See <em>State v. Patton </em>(Mar. 5, 1992), Allen App. No. 1-91-12, 1992 WL 42806, citing 1 Weissenberger\u2019s Ohio Evidence (1985) 75, Section 803.79. Further, it is not necessary that the witness have firsthand knowledge of the transaction giving rise to the record. <em>State v. Vrona </em>(1988), 47 Ohio App.3d 145, 547 N.E.2d 1189, paragraph two of the syllabus. \u201cRather, it must be demonstrated that the witness is sufficiently familiar with the operation of the business and with the circumstances of the record\u2019s preparation, maintenance and retrieval, that he can reasonably testify on the basis of this knowledge that the record is what it purports to be, and that it was made in the ordinary course of business consistent with the elements of Rule 803(6).\u201d <em>Patton </em>at *2, quoting Weissenberger at 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">{\u00b6 33} Even after the above elements are established, however, a business record may be excluded from evidence if \u201c \u2018the source of information or the method or circumstances of preparation indicate lack of trustworthiness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Davis </em>at \u00b6 171, quoting Evid.R. 803(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\"> {\u00b6 34} Before application of Evid.R. 803(6) and prior to admission of a business record, the record must also be properly identified or authenticated \u201cby evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.\u201d Evid.R. 901(A). See also <em>State v. Bell, </em>Clermont App. No. CA2008-05-044, 2009-Ohio-2335, 2009 WL 1395857, \u00b6 17; <em>State v. Hirtzinger </em>(1997), 124 Ohio App.3d 40, 49, 705 N.E.2d 395. \u201cThe provisions of Evid.R. 901(A) require only that a proponent of a document produce \u2018evidence <em>sufficient to support a finding </em>that the matter in question\u2019 is what the proponent claims it to be.\u201d <em>State v. Easter </em>(1991), 75 Ohio App.3d 22, 25, 598 N.E.2d 845. \u201cThis low threshold standard does not require <em>conclusive </em>proof of authenticity, but only sufficient foundational evidence for the trier of fact to conclude that the document is what its proponent claims it to be.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id., citing 1 Weissenberger, Ohio Evidence (1991) 4-5, Section 901.2; Giannelli, Ohio Evidence Manual (1990) 6, Section 901.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">{\u00b6 35} In order to properly authenticate business records, a witness must \u201ctestify as to the regularity and reliability of the business activity involved in the creation of the record.\u201d <em>Hirtzinger, </em>124 Ohio App.3d at 49, 705 N.E.2d 395. Firsthand knowledge of the transaction is not required by the witness providing the foundation; however, \u201c \u2018it must be demonstrated that the witness is sufficiently familiar with the operation of the business and with the circumstances of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>record\u2019s preparation, maintenance and retrieval, that he can reasonably testify <em>on </em>the basis of this knowledge that the record is what it purports to be, and that it was made in the ordinary course of business consistent with the elements of Rule 803(6).\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Vrona </em>(1988), 47 Ohio App.3d 145, 148, 547 N.E.2d 1189, quoting 1 Weissenberger\u2019s Ohio Evidence (1985) 75-76, Section 803.79.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">{\u00b6 36} At the trial, the magistrate permitted all of appellant\u2019s witnesses to testify as to the documents that they attempted to admit to show the chain of sale from Atlantic Financial to Ameristar and from Ameristar to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">{\u00b6 37} After having listened to that testimony, the trial court found that the witnesses did not offer any testimony \u201cas to how the records are compiled, what type of programing (sic) is utilized, how the information is entered, what safeguards are utilized.\u201d The trial court then summarized the witnesses\u2019 testimony, stating that in essence, the witnesses merely recited, \u201c[T]his looks like a copy of the records that I reviewed and that contain the Defendant\u2019s name, along with relevant personal information as to the amount owed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">{\u00b6 38} The trial court further found that no evidence was presented as to the witnesses\u2019 background, training, knowledge, or use of the computers, or as to the way the files are transmitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">{\u00b6 39} Based on the above lack of evidence, the trial court found that appellant failed to sufficiently establish either the authenticity requirement or the business-records exception, and the court therefore disallowed admission of those records as evidence of the debt at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">{\u00b6 40} Upon review of the record, we agree with the trial court in that we find that appellant failed to present sufficient evidence as to the authenticity of the Excel spreadsheet. None of the witnesses\u2019 testimony supports a finding that the witnesses were reasonably \u201cfamiliar with the operation of the business and with the circumstances of the record\u2019s preparation, maintenance and retrieval.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">{\u00b6 41} We likewise agree with the trial court as to its determination that the testimony presented was not sufficient to meet the business-records exception to the hearsay rule. At trial, no testimony was presented by appellant as to who prepared the Excel spreadsheet, what that person\u2019s job duties were, when the record was prepared, or how the information was collected and compiled.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">{\u00b6 42} As to the exclusion of the spreadsheet, we find that such a \u201credacted\u201d document does not constitute a \u201cduplicate\u201d as contemplated by the rule and was therefore properly excluded under Evid.R. 1002.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">{\u00b6 43} Appellant\u2019s first, second, and third assignments of error are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">{\u00b6 44} In appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court\u2019s decision was against the manifest weight of the evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">{\u00b6 45} A judgment supported by some competent, credible evidence will not be reversed by a reviewing court as against the manifest weight of the evidence. <em>C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 8 O.O.3d 261, 376 N.E.2d 578. A reviewing court must not substitute its judgment for that of the trial court when there exists some competent and credible evidence supporting the judgment rendered by the trial court. <em>Myers v. Garson </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 610, 614 N.E.2d 742.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">{\u00b6 46} Upon review of the trial transcript and our finding that the trial court did not err in excluding the above evidence, we find that the trial court\u2019s determination that appellant failed to prove it was the owner of the debt at issue in this case was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">{\u00b6 47} Appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">{\u00b6 48} For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Mansfield Municipal Court, Richland County, Ohio, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b189-10\">Edwards, P.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b189-11\">Hoffman, J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b189-12\">William B. Hoffman, Judge, dissenting.</judges>\n<p id=\"b189-13\">{\u00b6 49} I respectfully dissent from the majority decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-14\">{\u00b6 50} I find that the testimony of the witnesses identified in the majority opinion was sufficient to authenticate and establish that the exhibits offered by appellant qualified as ordinary business records. I find the spreadsheet admissible as a duplicate (albeit in redacted format) of Schedule A, which was attached to the bills of sale/assignments.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
