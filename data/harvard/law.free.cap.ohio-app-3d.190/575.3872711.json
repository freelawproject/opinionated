The charge stemmed from an incident on September 16, 2009, in which appellant failed to stop and left the scene of an accident without providing his name, address, and vehicle-registration number after his car came into contact with Loree Trammell\u2019s car. A bench trial revealed the following facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">{\u00b6 3} Appellant is Trammell\u2019s former boyfriend. Although their relationship ended in May 2009, they stayed in touch and on the night of September 16, 2009, were sending text messages to one another. Appellant was inquiring about Trammell\u2019s whereabouts and who was with her. Within seconds of informing him she was at a particular store, appellant\u2019s car \u201cwas right parallel to [her] car.\u201d After seeing a male passenger in Trammell\u2019s car, appellant became \u201cfrantic\u201d and started yelling at Trammell. Trammell tried to drive off but appellant drove parallel to her. At a stop sign, in an attempt to get out of the situation, Trammel tried several times to drive forward then put her car in reverse, but each time, appellant mimicked her driving. Eventually, appellant blocked her car. Appellant got out of his car, screamed at Trammell, returned to his car, and sped off. As he sped off, the front side of his car hit the front side of Trammell\u2019s car. Appellant did not stop and left the scene of the accident without providing his name, address, and registration information. Neither Trammell nor appellant was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">{\u00b6 4} Trammel drove to a police station to report the accident. There, a police officer observed scratches on the front side of Trammell\u2019s car. Trammell left the police station and sent a text message to appellant telling him he had hit her car and that he would pay for the damage. The next day, the officer met and talked with appellant. The officer observed scratches on appellant\u2019s car that matched the scratches on Trammell\u2019s car. The officer did not take pictures of either car.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">{\u00b6 5} Appellant denied being involved in the driving incident or being at the scene of the accident. Rather, appellant testified that he was smoking cigars at a fraternity house with a friend at the time of the incident. Appellant denied that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>his car had any damage. Photos he took of his car several days after the incident showed no damage to the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">{\u00b6 6} On March 4, 2010, the trial court found appellant guilty of leaving the scene of the accident in violation of R.C. 4549.02 and sentenced him accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">{\u00b6 7} Appellant appeals, raising one assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThe trial court erred in finding defendant guilty of leaving the scene of an accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">{\u00b6 9} Appellant challenges his conviction under R.C. 4549.02 on two grounds. First, appellant contends that the statute directs drivers to identify themselves. Because he and Trammell knew one another, appellant contends that the parties did not need to exchange information prior to his leaving the scene of the accident. Second, appellant challenges whether an accident or collision in fact occurred under R.C. 4549.02, as there was no damage to his car and the damage to Trammell\u2019s car was minimal.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">{\u00b6 10} R.C. 4549.02(A) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cIn case of accident to or collision with persons or property upon any of the public roads or highways, due to the driving or operation thereon of any motor vehicle, the person driving or operating the motor vehicle, having knowledge of the accident or collision, immediately shall stop the driver\u2019s or operator\u2019s motor vehicle at the scene of the accident or collision and shall remain at the scene of the accident or collision until the driver or operator has given the driver\u2019s or operator\u2019s name and address and, if the driver or operator is not the owner, the name and address of the owner of that motor vehicle, together with the registered number of that motor vehicle, to any person injured in the accident or collision or to the operator, occupant, owner, or attendant of any motor vehicle damaged in the accident or collision, or to any police officer at the scene of the accident or collision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">{\u00b6 12} Appellant first argues that the trial court erred in finding him guilty under R.C. 4549.02. Appellant asserts that because he and Trammel knew one another, they did not need to exchange information under the statute prior to his leaving the scene of the accident. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-11\">{\u00b6 13} One of the purposes of R.C. 4549.02 is to require individuals involved in traffic accidents to give sufficient information to allow law-enforcement officials to contact that individual if an investigation of the accident is conducted. See <em>State v. Bowman </em>(Dec. 6, 2001), Franklin App. No. 01AP-514, 2001 WL 1548796. R.C. 4549.02 is a statute aimed at preventing harm to society as a whole rather than to a particular victim, see <em>State v. Byrd, </em>Belmont App. No. 04 BE 40, 2005-Ohio-2720, 2005 WL 1301768, and seeks to hold offenders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>responsible for their ensuing actions. See <em>State v. McGraw, </em>Ross App. No. 08CA3009, 2008-Ohio-6134, 2008 WL 5046811.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">{\u00b6 14} The plain language of R.C. 4549.02 requires all drivers involved in an accident or collision to <em>remain at the scene of the accident or collision until </em>all necessary information, as set forth in the statute, is obtained either by the persons involved or by the police. R.C. 4549.02(A); <em>State v. Williams </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 1, 14, 679 N.E.2d 646 (R.C. 4549.02 requires a driver involved in a collision on a public street to stay at the scene until he or she has given his or her name, address, and registration number to the other driver, to any injured party, or to a police officer); <em>Kish v. Cent. Natl. Ins. Group </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 41, 42, 21 O.O.3d 26, 424 N.E.2d 288, fn. 1 (R.C. 4549.02 requires that motorists involved in a traffic accident must stop at the scene of the accident and exchange identities and vehicle-registration information).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">{\u00b6 15} Notwithstanding appellant\u2019s assertion and his reliance on <em>State v. Provino, </em>175 Ohio App.3d 283, 2007-Ohio-6974, 886 N.E.2d 888, we find that R.C. 4549.02 does not, implicitly or expressly, provide for the exception advocated by appellant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Were we to read the statute as construed by appellant, we would in effect be usurping the legislative function by amending R.C. 4549.02(A) to include \u201cunless the parties involved in the accident or collision know one another\u201d as an additional element. We refuse to do so. It is not the function of the courts to rewrite statutes so as to insert exceptions or additional elements that might have been intended to be included but were not in fact included. See <em>State v. Gray </em>(Feb. 1, 1993), Butler App. No. CA92-06-113, 1993 WL 19088. We find that the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Williams, </em>79 Ohio St.3d 1, 679 N.E.2d 646, although distinguishable, supports our decision (the <em>Williams </em>court held that despite the fact that appellant was being shot at when he fled, a police officer still had probable cause to arrest him for a violation of R.C. 4549.02). See also <em>Wilmington v. Cooper </em>(Feb. 3, 1992), Clinton App. No. CA91-02-002, 1992 WL 17797 (once defendant was aware that his wife was not seriously injured and the exigency no longer existed, he had a duty to report the accident).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>{\u00b6 16} In light of the foregoing, we find the fact that the parties knew one another at the time of the accident did not excuse appellant\u2019s failure to stop and his leaving the scene of the accident without providing all necessary information as set forth in R.C. 4549.02 to either Trammell or a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">{\u00b6 17} Appellant also challenges whether an accident or collision in fact occurred under R.C. 4549.02 as there was no damage to his car and the damage to Trammell\u2019s car was minimal.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">{\u00b6 18} In support of his argument, appellant relies on R.C. 4509.01(J), which defines \u201caccident\u201d or \u201cmotor vehicle accident\u201d as \u201cany accident involving a motor vehicle which results in bodily injury to or death of any person, or <em>damage to the property of any person in excess of four hundred </em>dollars.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Appellant also relies on the following comment under Section 749.02 of the Ohio Jury Instructions: \u201cThe Committee believes that the terms \u2018accident\u2019 and \u2018collision\u2019 are used synonymously in R.C. 4549.02.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">{\u00b6 19} Appellant\u2019s reliance on the definition of accident in R.C. 4509.01(J) is misplaced. <em>State v. Maioriello </em>(1992), 73 Ohio App.3d 350, 354, 597 N.E.2d 185. Given the unequivocal introductory language of R.C. 4509.01 (\u201cAs used in sections 4509.01 to 4509.78 of the Revised Code\u201d), the term \u201caccident\u201d as defined in R.C. 4509.01(J) applies neither to the case at bar nor to any scenario under R.C. 4549.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">{\u00b6 20} Nor do we feel bound by the Jury Instructions Committee\u2019s comment cited by appellant. See <em>State v. Singfield, </em>183 Ohio App.3d 625, 2009-Ohio-4172, 918 N.E.2d 187 (while helpful, Ohio Jury Instructions are not binding legal authority). \u201c \u2018Collision\u2019 is defined as \u2018[striking together of two objects, one of which may be stationary. Act or instance of colliding; state of having collided. The term implies an impact or sudden contact of a moving body with an obstruction in its line of motion, whether both bodies are in motion or one stationary and the other, no matter which, in motion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Maioriello </em>at 354, 597 N.E.2d 185, quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed.1979) 239-240.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">{\u00b6 21} The term \u201c \u2018[ajccident,\u2019 requiring operator of vehicle to stop immediately in case of accident, contemplates any situation occurring on the highway wherein driver so operates his automobile as to cause injury to the property or person of another using the same highway.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed.1990), 15. Neither definition requires damage to a property to be significant; neither definition includes a monetary value for damage to property.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">{\u00b6 22} In the case at bar, the parties\u2019 vehicles came into contact resulting in damage, albeit minimal, to Trammell\u2019s car. Thus, the facts in this case establish that an accident or a collision occurred resulting in damage to one of the cars. As a result, the trial court properly applied R.C. 4549.02(A) and did not err <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>in finding appellant guilty under the statute. See <em>Maioriello </em>(conviction under R.C. 4549.02 upheld following a collision between two cars resulting in one dollar\u2019s worth of damage to one of the cars); <em>State v. Platfoot, </em>188 Ohio App.3d 349, 2009-Ohio-3769, 916 N.E.2d 1147 (conviction under R.C. 4549.02 upheld when the driver\u2019s side of a car and the passenger side of another car collided as the vehicles traveled alongside one another); and <em>State v. Hill </em>(Jan. 21, 2000), Montgomery App. No. 17875, 2000 WL 43706 (conviction under R.C. 4549.02 upheld when a van rolled back and hit a car behind it resulting in a scratch on the car\u2019s front bumper).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">{\u00b6 23} The assignment of error is accordingly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">{\u00b6 24} The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b617-7\">Ringland and Hendrickson, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b615-7\">. In <em>Provino, </em>Frank Provino was driving the car of a friend with the friend\u2019s permission when he slid the car into a ditch. Provino left the car in the ditch and left the scene. On appeal, Provino challenged his conviction under R.C. 4549.02, following his no-contest plea to the charge, on the grounds that there was in fact no accident or collision with persons or property and there was nobody at the scene to whom he could have given the information. The Third Appellate District reversed Provino\u2019s conviction. The appellate court held that the explanation of circumstances given by the prosecutor at the no-contest plea hearing was not sufficient to prove a violation of R.C. 4549.02 as \"Provino was involved only in a one-car accident with no pedestrian being hit.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 11. Further, \"the only person who suffered any injury * * * was the owner of the vehicle because the left side of the Envoy was damaged. However, the owner already knew Provino\u2019s identity because he had allowed Provino to use the vehicle.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 12.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
