Boyle, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">{\u00b6 1} Plaintiff-appellant, Medical Protective Company of Fort Wayne, Indiana (\u201cMedical Protective\u201d), appeals the trial court\u2019s decision denying its motion for summary judgment and granting judgment in favor of the defendant-intervenor, Bonnie Randa. Finding merit to the appeal, we reverse the judgment and remand the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Procedural History and Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">{\u00b6 2} On October 28, 2008, Medical Protective commenced the underlying action, asserting two counts: (1) rescission of a medical-malpractice policy issued beginning on April 1, 2006, to defendant, Dr. Peter Fragatos, and (2) declaratory judgment as to its duty to defend or indemnify Fragatos in connection with claims of medical malpractice asserted against him in two separate actions \u2014 the first by Tommie and Ruth Polk and the second by Randa. Medical Protective alleged that Fragatos materially misrepresented the number of past claims asserted against him. Medical Protective further alleged that the policy of insurance covered Fragatos only in his practice as a neurologist and not as a neurosurgeon; therefore, it had no duty to defend or indemnify the lawsuits that arose out of his services that were not covered under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">{\u00b6 3} The Polks and Randa intervened in the action. The Polks filed a separate answer and counterclaim against Medical Protective, asserting their own claim for declaratory judgment and asking the court to declare that Medical Protective is required to provide coverage to Fragatos and is responsible for any judgment obtained by the Polks against Fragatos as a result of his purported malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">{\u00b6 4} Fragatos answered, pro se, denying Medical Protective\u2019s allegations that he \u201cknowingly misrepresented during the application or any renewal process that followed.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">{\u00b6 5} Medical Protective subsequently moved to amend its complaint as a result of a third medical-malpractice lawsuit filed by Thelma and Wilbert Roberts against Fragatos on December 5, 2008, and its learning of further misrepresentations made by Fragatos. The court granted Medical Protective\u2019s motion to file an amended complaint. In the amended complaint, Medical Protective included the Robertses\u2019 lawsuit in its second count and sought a declaration that it had no duty to indemnify or further defend this lawsuit as well as the other two pending actions. Medical Protective further alleged that it recently learned that Fragatos <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>had been sued for malpractice in 14 prior lawsuits and that Fragatos failed to disclose these lawsuits in his application for insurance despite specific questions concerning all prior claims, potential claims, or suits arising out of the rendering or failing to render professional services.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">{\u00b6 6} All the parties, except for Fragatos, moved for summary judgment. The gravamen of the defendants-intervenors\u2019 motions for summary judgment was that Medical Protective had waived its right to deny coverage under the policy because it failed to timely notify Fragatos of its intent to defend him under a reservation of rights. Conversely, Medical Protective moved for summary judgment on two grounds: (1) Fragatos\u2019s material misrepresentations rendered the policy void ab initio, thereby requiring a rescission of the policy, and (2) even if the policy is not rescinded, Medical Protective has no duty to further defend or indemnify in either the Polk or Randa actions because their injuries arose out of procedures not covered under the policy; specifically, the policy covers Fragatos only in his practice as a neurologist, not as a neurosurgeon.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">{\u00b6 7} The trial court ultimately denied Medical Protective\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granted the defendants-intervenors\u2019 motions, stating the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThis court finds as a matter of law, Medical Protective has waived its right to deny coverage based upon its failure to reserve its rights at the onset of litigation. See <em>Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. v. Trainor </em>(1973), 33 Ohio St.2d 41[, 62 O.O.2d 402, 294 N.E.2d 874]; <em>Collins v. Grange Mutual [Cas.] Ins. Co. </em>(1997), 124 Ohio App.3d 574, 706 N.E.2d 856. Therefore, Medical Protective is required as a matter of law to defend and indemnify Dr. Fragatos in the medical malpractice actions. The court finds in favor of defendants on both Medical Protective\u2019s claims and the defendants\u2019 counterclaims and enters declaratory judgment for defendants. In denying summary judgment for plaintiff Medical Protective, this court finds that as a matter of law, Medical Protective\u2019s arguments and defenses are irrelevant because it failed to assert a reservation of rights in a timely manner before undertaking Dr. Fragatos\u2019 defense. The ease is dismissed with prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">{\u00b6 9} From this decision, Medical Protective appeals, raising the following three assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c[I] The trial court erred in granting the Randa intervenors\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c[II] The trial court erred in denying Medical Protective\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>{\u00b6 12} \u201c[III] The trial court erred in dismissing, with prejudice, Medical Protective\u2019s claims concerning coverage for the lawsuit styled <em>Roberts v. Fraga-tos, </em>No. CV08674570 (Cuyahoga Ct. Comm. Pleas).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">{\u00b6 13} In reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment, this court applies the same standard a trial court is required to apply in the first instance, i.e., summary judgment is appropriate when there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Parenti v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>(1990), 66 Ohio App.3d 826, 829, 586 N. E.2d 1121. In applying this standard, evidence is construed in favor of the nonmoving party, and summary judgment is appropriate if reasonable minds could conclude only that judgment should be entered in favor of the movant. <em>Horton v. Harwick Chem. Corp. </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 679, 686-687, 653 N.E.2d 1196. Before the trial court may consider whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, however, it must determine whether there are genuine issues of material fact for trial. <em>Byrd v. Smith, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 24, 2006-Ohio-3455, 850 N.E.2d 47, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">{\u00b6 14} Under Civ.R. 56, the moving party \u201c \u2018bears the initial burden of informing the trial court of the basis for the motion, and identifying those portions of the record that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact on the essential element(s) of the nonmoving party\u2019s claims.\u2019 \u201d <em>Vahila v. Hall </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 421, 429, 674 N.E.2d 1164, quoting <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 293, 662 N.E.2d 264. The nonmoving party then has a reciprocal burden to set forth specific facts by affidavit or as otherwise provided by Civ.R. 56(E) that demonstrate that there is a genuine issue for trial. <em>Byrd </em>at 1110.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">Randa\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">{1\u00cd15} In its first assignment of error, Medical Protective argues that the trial court erred in granting Randa\u2019s motion for summary judgment and finding that it has a duty to defend and indemnify Fragatos in connection with the Randa lawsuit. It contends that the trial court erroneously concluded that it had waived any defenses that it may have under the policy because it failed to timely notify Fragatos that it was defending him .under a \u201creservation of rights\u201d in the Randa lawsuit. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">{\u00b6 16} Initially, we note that a reservation of rights consists of \u201cnotice given by the insurer that it will defend the suit, but reserving] all rights it has based on noncoverage under the policy.\u201d <em>Motorists, </em>33 Ohio St.2d at 45, 62 O. O.2d 402, 294 N.E.2d 874.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>{\u00b6 17} Generally, the doctrines of waiver and estoppel may not be used to expand an insurance\u2019s policy coverage. <em>GuideOne Mut Ins. Co. v. Reno </em>(Apr. 26, 2002), 2d Dist. No. 01-CA-68, 2002 WL 857682. Ohio courts, however, have recognized exceptions to that rule in certain circumstances. \u201cAn insurer should not be able to avoid liability under all circumstances in which it voluntarily relinquishes a known right or induces another into changing his position based upon reliance on the insurer\u2019s conduct when the insured is prejudiced by such reliance.\u201d <em>Turner Liquidating Co. v. St. Paul Surplus Lines Ins. Co. </em>(1994), 93 Ohio App.3d 292, 299, 638 N.E.2d 174. For example, when an insurer defends its insured without reserving its rights for a period sufficient to prejudice the insured\u2019s ability to conduct his own defense, i.e., shortly before trial, a court may find that the insurer has waived the reservation of rights and should be estopped from denying coverage. See <em>Dietz-Britton v. Smythe, Cramer Co. </em>(2000), 139 Ohio App.3d 337, 345, 743 N.E.2d 960.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">{\u00b6 18} In <em>Dietz-Britton, </em>this court listed the factors a court should consider when determining whether an insured has suffered actual prejudice from an insurer\u2019s failure to reserve rights as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c[T]he loss of a favorable settlement opportunity, inability to produce all testimony existing in support of a case, inability to produce favorable witnesses, loss of benefit of any defense in law or fact through reliance upon the insurer\u2019s promise to defend, or withdrawal so near the time of trial that the insured is hampered in the preparation of its defense.\u201d Id. at 348, 743 N.E.2d 960, citing 7C Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice (1979) 313-319, Section 4693.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">{\u00b6 20} The record reveals that Randa filed her lawsuit against Fragatos on June 30, 2008, and that Medical Protective tendered its reservation of rights letter approximately two months later, on September 4, 2008. Aside from a bald assertion that such delay constitutes prejudice, there is no evidence that the insured, Fragatos, suffered any actual prejudice as a result of the two-month period. To the extent that the trial court presumed prejudice and found waiver applicable due to any delay, no matter how short, we find that such reasoning is contrary to this court\u2019s precedent as well as that of the majority of Ohio courts. See, e.g., <em>Dietz-Britton, </em>139 Ohio App.3d 337, 743 N.E.2d 960; <em>Roark v. Medmarc Cas. Ins. Co., </em>9th Dist. No. 07CA009146, 2007-Ohio-7049, 2007 WL 4554279; <em>Fairfield Mach. Co., Inc. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>(Dec. 28, 2001), 7th Dist. No. 2000-00-14, 2001 WL 1665624; <em>GuideOne Mut. Ins. Co., </em>supra; <em>Davis &amp; Meyer Law, Ltd. v. ProNational Ins. Co., </em>10th Dist. No. 06AP-730, 2007-Ohio-3552, 2007 WL 2009666.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">{\u00b6 21} Accordingly, the first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Contract Void Ab Initio</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">{\u00b6 22} In its second assignment of error, Medical Protective argues that the trial court erred in denying its motion for summary judgment on its rescission and declaratory-judgment claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">{\u00b6 23} Initially, we note that Medical Protective moved for rescission on two separate grounds: (1) a common-law claim for rescission arising out of fraudulent misrepresentations and (2) a claim based on warranties contained in the policy. On appeal, Medical Protective abandons its common-law argument for rescission and focuses solely on its claim that the policy is void ab initio because Fragatos breached policy warranties.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We therefore limit our review solely to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">{\u00b6 24} Ohio law recognizes distinctions among material misrepresentations depending on whether they are mere representations or warranties: a false warranty will render an insurance policy void ab initio, while a misstatement, <em>which is fraudulently made and is material to the risk, </em>that does not rise to the level of a warranty will render the policy voidable. <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Davidson </em>(1993), 87 Ohio App.3d 101, 104, 621 N.E.2d 887. In <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Boggs </em>(1971), 27 Ohio St.2d 216, 219, 56 O.O.2d 130, 271 N.E.2d 855, the Ohio Supreme Court discussed the distinction, stating the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cIn the law of insurance, a representation is a statement made prior to the issuance of the policy which tends to cause the insurer to assume the risk. A warranty is a statement, description or undertaking by the insured of a material fact either appearing on the face of the policy or in another instrument specifically incorporated in the policy. <em>Hartford Protection Ins. Co. v. Harmer </em>(1853), 2 Ohio St. 452. See 30 Ohio Jurisprudence 2d 415, Section 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cThe insurer\u2019s decision to incorporate the statement in or to omit it from the policy generally controls whether the statement is a warranty or a representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cHowever, the mere fact that a statement of an insured is incorporated in a policy does not necessarily make such statement a warranty. Courts do not favor warranties, or forfeitures from the breach thereof, and a statement as to conditions does not constitute a warranty unless the language of the policy, construed strictly against the insurer, requires such an interpretation. The fundamental principle is that inasmuch as policies of insurance are in the language selected by the insurer they are to be construed strictly against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>insurer, and liberally in favor of the insured. <em>Butche v. Ohio Cas. Ins. Co. </em>(1962), 174 Ohio St. 144[, 21 O.O.2d 418], 187 N.E.2d 20. See 30 Ohio Jurisprudence 2d 225 and 227, Sections 215 and 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cIn other words, an insurer is bound by the provisions which he chooses to incorporate in his policy. If it is his purpose to provide that a misstatement by the insured shall render the policy void ab initio, such facts must appear clearly and unambiguously from the terms of the policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">{\u00b6 29} If the policy is merely voidable, then an insurer may be liable for any claims arising before the policy is voided. See <em>Davidson, </em>87 Ohio App.3d 101, 621 N.E.2d 887. In contrast, an insurer has no obligations under a policy that is declared void ab initio; the contract is considered to never have been executed. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">{\u00b6 30} The record establishes that Fragatos lied about the number of past claims filed against him when he applied for insurance. He admitted to only one claim in completing the 2006 application for insurance, despite the fact that at least 14 prior malpractice suits had been filed against him. He also failed to disclose that he had knowledge of a potential claim, i.e., the Polks\u2019 lawsuit, when he increased his limits of coverage under the renewal application. Fragatos also misrepresented the nature of the services that he would be performing in his practice. Medical Protective argues that the policy is void ab initio because Fragatos\u2019s false statements in his application were warranties as opposed to mere misrepresentations. To resolve this issue, we turn to the language of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">{\u00b6 31} Under the Representation Endorsement, the following statements are contained in the Medical Protective 2008-2009 policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-9\">By acceptance of this policy, the Insured agrees the statements in any application (new or renewal) submitted to the company are true and correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-10\">It is understood and agreed that, to the extent permitted by law, the Company reserves the right to rescind this policy, or any coverage provided herein, for any material misrepresentations made by the Insured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-11\">It is understood and agreed that the statements made in the insurance application are incorporated into, and shall form part of, this policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">{\u00b6 32} Medical Protective further points to the following clause contained in both Fragatos\u2019s 2003 application for insurance as part of the Collis Group and later his 2006 application for solo insurance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-13\">I understand that any material misrepresentation or omission made by me on this application may act to render any contract of insurance null and without effect or provide the company with the right to rescind it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>{\u00b6 33} Based on the Representation Endorsement, it is clear that Medical Protective expressly incorporated Fragatos\u2019s answers to his application as part of the policy, which would include the number of prior claims filed against him. We further find that the application\u2019s warning that any material misrepresentation would render the policy null and without effect is equivalent to warning that the policy is void ab initio. See, e.g., <em>Horton v. Safe Auto Ins. Co. </em>(June 14, 2001), 10th Dist. No. 00AP-1017, 2001 WL 664421; <em>Jaber v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. </em>(1996), 113 Ohio App.3d 507, 681 N.E.2d 478 (finding that similar language in the policy and application was sufficient to deem the statements warranties). Medical Protective therefore has satisfied both prongs of the <em>Boggs </em>test to establish that Fragatos\u2019s statement regarding the number of prior claims constitutes a warranty. His breach of this warranty therefore renders the policy void ab initio.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">{\u00b6 34} Having found that the policy is void ab initio, we need not address Medical Protective\u2019s alternative argument regarding the scope of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The Robertses\u2019 Action</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">{\u00b6 35} In its final assignment of error, Medical Protective argues that the trial court erred in dismissing its claim for declaratory judgment as to its duty to defend or indemnify Fragatos in the Robertses\u2019 lawsuit. We agree. The record reflects that the trial court dismissed Medical Protective\u2019s claim for declaratory judgment with respect to the Robertses\u2019 lawsuit despite the fact that no party, including Fragatos, moved for a dismissal or judgment on this claim. Having already found that the policy is void ab initio, we find that the trial court should have declared that Medical Protective has no duty to defend or indemnify in the Robertses\u2019 action. The third assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">{\u00b6 36} The judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b158-9\">Gallagher, A.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b158-10\">Dyke, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b152-11\">. It seems that after filing his answer and responding to some requests for admissions, Fragatos ceased participating in the action against him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b156-11\">. Although Medical Protective\u2019s amended complaint pleaded only the common-law claim for rescission of a contract procured by fraudulent misrepresentations, it separately sought declaratory judgment as to its rights and obligations under the policy. Based on its separate claim for declaratory judgment, the issue whether the policy is void ab initio was properly before the trial court and ripe for its determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
