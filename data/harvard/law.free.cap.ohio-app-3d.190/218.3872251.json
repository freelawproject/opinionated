(\u201cO\u2019Shea\u201d), made a written public-records request to respondent, Cuyahoga Metropolitan Housing Authority (\u201cCMHA\u201d), under R.C. 149.43. The request stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-9\">I hereby request the following information:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-10\">1. Copies of all liability insurance contracts which cover any and all premises liability issues for the last 20 years for any and all buildings owned or operated by CMHA;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-11\">2. Copies of all minutes of all meetings (for the last 10 years) wherein liability insurance and/or the process, methods and sources of paying legal claims for personal injury claims against CMHA are either discussed or decided; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-12\">3. Copies of all documents which document any and all instances of lead poisoning in the last 15 years in any dwelling owned or operated by CMHA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-13\">{\u00b6 2} In journal entries and opinions dated January 11, 2010, and May 25, 2010, this court considered the various arguments of the parties and determined the merits of O\u2019Shea\u2019s claim for relief in mandamus to compel release of the records. In the May 25 opinion, we also granted O\u2019Shea leave to file a motion for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-14\">{\u00b6 3} This journal entry and opinion repeats the analysis and holdings of the January 11 opinion and the May 25 opinion as well as holding that relator is entitled to all of the attorney fees requested. The court is releasing this composite journal entry and opinion now because the prior opinions were not final orders and were therefore not sent to the Supreme Court of Ohio and other electronic services. Also, this journal entry and opinion determines the sole, remaining claim in this action \u2014 O\u2019Shea\u2019s request for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-15\">{\u00b6 4} Initially, CMHA filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. In the January 11 opinion we did the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b257-16\">A. With respect to item 1, we sua sponte converted the motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment and granted the parties leave to supple<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>ment their filings with evidentiary material as required by Civ.R. 56. See also Civ.R. 12(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">B. We granted the motion to dismiss with respect to item 2 in O\u2019Shea\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">C. With respect to item 3, we denied the motion to dismiss, granted relator leave to file a dispositive motion and permitted respondent to file a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">\n<em>Item 1</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">{\u00b6 5} In item 1, relator requested insurance policies. In the complaint, relator avers: \u201cRespondent will not produce all of the insurance policies for the period 2006 through the present date as requested in item number 1 of the Request * * *_\u00bb Yet attached to the complaint is correspondence from respondent\u2019s counsel stating: \u201cI enclose a CD which contains a complete response to your request paragraphs 1 and 2.\u201d In its motion to dismiss, counsel for CMHA states: \u201cWith respect to the insurance policies requested from 2006 through the present, each and every single one of those documents was provided and therefore that request is moot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">{\u00b6 6} In its brief in opposition to the motion to dismiss, O\u2019Shea does not directly acknowledge or dispute CMHA\u2019s statement that it had provided all of the insurance policies to O\u2019Shea. O\u2019Shea does argue, however, that CMHA imper-missibly presented facts in its motion to dismiss that were not in the pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">\n<em>Item 2</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">{\u00b6 7} In the motion to dismiss, CMHA argues that in items 2 and 3 above, O\u2019Shea is requesting information rather than records. With respect to item 2 (meeting minutes), we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">{\u00b6 8} The express language of item 2 clearly requests records containing certain information- \u2014 -personal-injury claims. \u201cRelator has not cited any authority under which this court could \u2014 pursuant to R.C. 149.43 \u2014 compel a governmental unit to do research or to identify records containing selected information. That is, relator has not established that a governmental unit has the clear legal duty to seek out and retrieve those records which would contain the information of interest to the requester. Cf. <em>State ex rel Cartmell v. Dorrian </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 177, 179[, 11 OBR 491], 464 N.E.2d 556. Rather, it is the responsibility of the person who wishes to inspect and/or copy records to identify with reasonable clarity the records at issue.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Fant v. Tober </em>(May 20, 1993), Cuyahoga App. No. 63757, 1993 WL 173743, at *1, affirmed (1993), 68 Ohio St.3d 117, 623 N.E.2d 1202. See also <em>State ex rel. Bardivell v. Cleveland State Univ., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Cuyahoga App. No. 91077, 2008-Ohio-2819, 2008 WL 2350884, at \u00b6 12, citing <em>State ex rel. Thomas v. Ohio State Univ. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 1438, 638 N.E.2d 1041.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">{\u00b6 9} Respondent highlights the distinction between requesting records and requesting information: \u201cIndeed, if [relator] simply wants all of CMHA\u2019s Board Minutes for the last ten years, it may request same which would be provided.\u201d Respondent\u2019s Reply to Brief in Opposition to Motion to Dismiss. In item 2, O\u2019Shea has not merely requested records. He has attempted to place the responsibility for reviewing records for specific information on a public office.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">{\u00b6 10} In <em>State ex rel. Dillery v. Icsman </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 312, 750 N.E.2d 156, the relator requested that the Sandusky police chief \u201cprovide copies of \u2018any and all records generated, in the possession of your department, containing any reference whatsoever to Kelly Dillery.\u2019 \u201d The Supreme Court held that this request was overbroad. \u201cBecause Dillery did not specify in her first request that she wanted access only to offense and incident reports, she failed in her duty to identify the records she wanted with sufficient clarity.\u201d Id. at 314, 750 N.E.2d 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">{\u00b6 11} In light of the well-established authority prohibiting the use of a request for public records to require a public office or person responsible for public records \u201cto search for records containing selected information,\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>70 Ohio St.3d 1438, 638 N.E.2d 1041, as well as the authority that prohibits overbroad requests, we must hold that relief in mandamus is not appropriate with respect to item 2 of O\u2019Shea\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">\n<em>Item S</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">{\u00b6 12} In item 3, O\u2019Shea requested \u201cdocuments which document any and all instances of lead poisoning in the last 15 years in any dwelling owned or operated by CMHA.\u201d. CMHA argues that item 3 also is an impermissible request for information and not a request for records. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">{\u00b6 13} A request for records \u201cmust be considered in the context of the circumstances surrounding it.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Morgan v. New Lexington, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 33, 2006-Ohio-6365, 857 N.E.2d 1208, \u00b6 33. In <em>Morgan, </em>the relator sought \u201cto compel a city to provide access to certain records related to an employee\u2019s discharge from employment.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 1. The Supreme Court in <em>Morgan </em>extensively reviewed the circumstances and concluded that 'although Morgan\u2019s request \u201cmight be construed to broadly request that the records custodian for New Lexington search existing records to find records that meet certain criteria,\u201d id. at \u00b6 31, other considerations required the conclusion that Morgan\u2019s request was sufficiently specific to require relief in mandamus. See id. at \u00b6 28-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">{\u00b6 14} In this case, however, the only dispositive motion before this court is respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss. Although we hold that O\u2019Shea\u2019s request in item <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>3 is not on its face a request for information, the record in this action is not sufficiently developed for this court to determine whether to grant or deny relief with respect to item 3. As a consequence, we grant O\u2019Shea leave to file a dispositive motion with respect to item 3 only, and CMHA is granted leave to respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">\n<em>Judgment in the January 11 Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">{\u00b6 15} Initially, CMHA filed a motion to dismiss and O\u2019Shea did not file a dispositive motion. In the January 11 opinion, this court held, in light of the procedural posture of the case:</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c1. With respect to item 1 (liability insurance contracts), we sua sponte convert the motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment;</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cA. With respect to item 1, we grant the parties leave to supplement their filings with briefs and evidentiary material as required by Civ.R,. 56 (see also Civ.R. 12(B)) including: (i). Filing an inventory listing which (if any) insurance policies covering 2006 through March 26, 2009 (the date of O\u2019Shea\u2019s request) CMHA provided to O\u2019Shea; (ii). Filing an inventory listing which (if any) insurance policies covering 2006 through March 26, 2009 (the date of O\u2019Shea\u2019s request) CMHA <em>has not </em>provided to O\u2019Shea.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cB. With respect to item 1, CMHA\u2019s supplement to the converted motion for summary judgment is due ten days after the date of this entry. O\u2019Shea\u2019s supplement and response to CMHA\u2019s supplement is due ten days after the filing of CMHA\u2019s supplement.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c2. With respect to item 2 (meeting minutes), we grant the motion to dismiss; and</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c3. With respect to item 3 (documents pertaining to lead poisoning), we deny the motion to dismiss and we grant O\u2019Shea leave to file a dispositive motion with respect to item 3 only within twenty days of the date of this entry and CMHA is granted leave to respond within twenty days of the filing of O\u2019Shea\u2019s dispositive motion.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>State ex rel. O\u2019Shea &amp; Assoc. Co., L.P.A. v. Cuyahoga Metro. Hous. Auth. </em>(Jan. 11, 2010), Cuyahoga App. No. 93275, at 6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">{\u00b6 21} In the May 25 opinion, this court considered:</p>\n<p id=\"b260-12\">A. respondent\u2019s motion for summary judgment (as converted from the motion to dismiss and supplemented in accordance with the January 11 opinion); and</p>\n<p id=\"b260-13\">B. \u201cRelator\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment on the Issue of the Lack of Any Production of Lead Poisoning Documents\u201d (\u201cRelator\u2019s motion for summary judgment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-14\">{\u00b6 22} For the reasons stated below, we did the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>A. We denied respondent\u2019s motion for summary judgment and ordered CMHA to provide O\u2019Shea with copies of all liability insurance policies covering 2006 through March 26, 2009 (the date of O\u2019Shea\u2019s request).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">B. We granted relator\u2019s motion for summary judgment and ordered CMHA to provide to O\u2019Shea \u201c[cjopies of all documents which document any and all instances of lead poisoning in the last 15 years in any dwelling owned or operated by CMHA,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> including \u2014 but not limited to \u2014 copies of each \u201cCMHA EBL Resident Questionnaire\u201d (\u201cQuestionnaire\u201d) and \u201cCMHA Authorization for Release of Medical Information\u201d (\u201cRelease\u201d). CMHA shall, however, redact any social security numbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">\n<em>Item 1</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">{\u00b6 23} In item 1, relator requested insurance policies. In this court\u2019s January 11 opinion, we noted the discrepancy between O\u2019Shea\u2019s averments in the complaint that CMHA had not provided copies of the liability insurance policies covering 2006 through March 26, 2009 (the date of O\u2019Shea\u2019s request), and a letter from counsel for CMHA indicating that the records were provided. In order to resolve this discrepancy and place this action in a procedural posture for this court to make a determination on O\u2019Shea\u2019s request for liability insurance contracts, we (1) converted CMHA\u2019s motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment and (2) granted the parties leave to supplement their filings with briefs and evidentiary material as required by Civ.R. 56 (see also Civ.R. 12(B)), including an inventory of the insurance policies that had or had not been provided to O\u2019Shea.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">{\u00b6 24} In response, CMHA submitted an affidavit of counsel, Hilary S. Taylor, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">1. He had stated in a letter dated April 10, 2009, that the policies for 2006 through 2009 were available at the CMHA offices; and</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">2. He sent a letter dated April 24, 2009, \u201cindicating that everything had been provided to relator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">Affidavit of Hilary S. Taylor, at \u00b6 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-12\">{\u00b6 25} Counsel\u2019s affidavit does not, however, aver that CMHA actually provided O\u2019Shea with copies of all liability insurance policies covering 2006 through March 26, 2009 (the date of O\u2019Shea\u2019s request). As a consequence, CMHA has failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that it has made public records available upon request. Accordingly, we deny CMHA\u2019s converted motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>summary judgment and order CMHA to provide O\u2019Shea with copies of all liability insurance policies covering 2006 through March 26, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">\n<em>Item S</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">{\u00b6 26} In item 3, O\u2019Shea requested \u201cdocuments which document any and all instances of lead poisoning in the last 15 years in any dwelling owned or operated by CMHA.\u201d O\u2019Shea has filed a motion for summary judgment seeking release of all records requested in item 3. In its brief in opposition to O\u2019Shea\u2019s motion for summary judgment (\u201cCMHA brief in opposition\u201d), CMHA argues that item 3 is a request for information and, therefore, not a proper request for public records. We have already held that \u201cthe language of O\u2019Shea\u2019s request in item 3 is not on its face a request for information.\u201d January 11 opinion, at 5. We will not, therefore, revisit that issue, and we reject CMHA\u2019s argument that item 3 is a request for information.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">{\u00b6 27} CMHA also argues that documents reflecting \u201cincidents of lead paint involving children\u201d are not public records under R.C. 149.43. CMHA brief in opposition, at 6. CMHA relies on <em>State ex rel. McCleary v. Roberts </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 365, 725 N.E.2d 1144. In <em>McCleary, </em>the city of Columbus required parents of children who used recreational facilities of the Recreation and Parks Department to \u201cprovide the Department with the names, home addresses, family information, emergency contact information, and medical history information of participating children and, in return, each child is provided a photographic identification card to present when using pools and recreation centers.\u201d Id. at 365. The Supreme Court concluded that the information was not a \u201crecord\u201d as defined by R.C. 149.011(G) and, therefore, not a <em>public </em>record under R.C. 149.43(A)(1). Id. at 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">{\u00b6 28} In this case, CMHA has attached blank copies of the questionnaire and release. The questionnaire includes areas for stating the name, address, and telephone number of a resident as well as the names and dates of birth of children. The release also includes a parent\u2019s name and signature as well as social security number. Also listed on the release are the name and age of the child along with an address.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">{\u00b6 29} Of course, it is well established that social security numbers must be redacted from a record upon its release. See <em>State ex rel. Beacon Journal Publishing Co. v. Akron </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 605, 640 N.E.2d 164. We reject CMHA\u2019s argument, however, regarding the rest of the information on these forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">{\u00b6 30} Unlike <em>McCleary, </em>the questionnaire and release do not contain the comprehensive personal, family, and medical information described in the records <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>at issue in <em>McCleary. </em>Rather, the questionnaire and release merely identify persons suspected to have been exposed to lead.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">{\u00b6 31} As a consequence, the circumstances presented by this action more closely resemble those in <em>State ex rel. Cincinnati Enquirer v. Daniels, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 518, 2006-Ohio-1215, 844 N.E.2d 1181. In <em>Daniels, </em>the Cincinnati Health Department received a request to obtain copies of \u201clead-contamination notices issued to property owners of units reported to be the residences of children whose blood test indicated elevated lead levels.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 1. The Supreme Court rejected the respondents\u2019 argument that the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) prevented release of the records.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">{\u00b6 32} The Supreme Court observed that \u201cthe lead-citation notices issued by the health department reveal that they are intended to advise the owners of real estate about results of department investigations and to apprise them of violations relating to lead hazards; the report identifies existing and potential lead hazards on the exterior and interior of the property, details the tests performed on the property and the results of those tests, explains the abatement measures required, provides advice about options to correct the problem, and mandates reporting of abatement measures, including the name of the abatement contractor, the abatement method, and the date of expected abatement completion. Nothing contained in these reports identifies by name, age, birth date, social security number, telephone number, family information, photograph, or other identifier any specific individual or details any specific medical examination, assessment, diagnosis, or treatment of any medical condition. There is a mere nondescript reference to \u2018a\u2019 child with \u2018an\u2019 elevated lead level.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 16. The Supreme Court also expressly distinguished <em>McCleary </em>from <em>Daniels </em>and observed that \u201cnone of the specific identifiable information referred to in <em>McCleary </em>is part of the information contained in the lead-citation notices or risk-assessment reports prepared by the health department and requested by the Enquirer in this case.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">{\u00b6 33} We recognize that the information contained in a completed questionnaire or release falls somewhere in between the records that were the subject of <em>McCleary </em>and <em>Daniels. </em>Nevertheless, the bulk of the questionnaire is devoted to identifying where children routinely are and, therefore, possible sources of lead exposure. The questionnaire also provides the risk assessor the opportunity to identify future actions, e.g. \u201cTest soil,\u201d \u201cCouncil [sic] family to keep child away from bare soil areas thought to be at risk.\u201d Questionnaire at 3. The release merely authorizes the release of medical records of the \u201cCity of Cleveland, Department of Public Health Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program\u201d regarding a specific child. The record in this action does not provide a basis for distinguishing the records of Cleveland\u2019s Department of Public Health from those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>of the Cincinnati Health Department. We hold, therefore, that the more applicable, controlling authority in this action is <em>Daniels </em>and that <em>Daniels </em>requires that CMHA release all disputed records to O\u2019Shea.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">{\u00b6 34} CMHA also argues that \u201call tenant documents are exempt from disclosure under the Federal Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C \u00a7 552(a).\u201d Brief in Opposition at 8. We note, however, that Section 552(a), Title 5, U.S.Code, expressly applies to \u201ceach agency.\u201d Section 551(1), Title 5, U.S.Code, however, provides that \u201c\u2018agency\u2019 means each authority of the Government of the United States.\u201d CMHA has not provided this court with any controlling authority that it is an agency under Section 551(1), Title 5, U.S.Code. Cf. <em>State ex rel. Garnes v. Krabach </em>(Aug. 3, 1976), Franklin App. No. 76AP-225, 1976 WL 190105, at *2. Rather, R.C. 3735.27 et seq. authorize the creation of a metropolitan housing authority in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">{\u00b6 35} CMHA also argues that any documents that reflect instances of lead poisoning would be exempt from disclosure as trial-preparation records prepared for purposes of litigation and work product. Accompanying CMHA\u2019s motion for summary judgment is the affidavit of Audrey H. Davis, chief general counsel for CMHA\u2019s Office of Legal Affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">{\u00b6 36} The following is a summary of the material averments in her affidavit: The Office of Environmental Affairs is a division of the Office of Legal Affairs. Any report that a person \u2014 adult or child \u2014 has an elevated blood-lead level \u201cis immediately handled as a potential legal claim against CMHA.\u201d Completing the questionnaire and release is part of the investigation in defense of a potential claim. All information is maintained within the Office of Legal Affairs and kept confidential within the Office of Legal Affairs and counsel retained to represent CMHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">{\u00b6 37} Although Davis and CMHA\u2019s counsel represent that CMHA maintains records regarding lead poisoning to defend against lawsuits, the questionnaire states a different intent: \u201cThe purpose of this questionnaire is to determine the likely sources of lead exposure and to assist the Lead Risk Assessor in determining where environmental sampling should be conducted.\u201d Questionnaire at 1. That is, although Davis expresses one purpose for gathering information, the questionnaire states a separate, distinct purpose. \u201cFor the trial preparation exemption to apply, R.C. 149.43(A)(4) requires records to be \u2018specifically compiled in reasonable anticipation\u2019 of litigation. Investigations conducted for multiple purposes do not qualify. <em>State ex rel. Natl. Broadcasting Co. v. Cleveland </em>[1988], supra, 38 Ohio St.3d [79] at 84-85, 526 N.E.2d [786] at 790-792.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Zuern v. Leis </em>(1990), 56 Ohio St.3d 20, 21, 564 N.E.2d 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>{\u00b6 38} Clearly, the questionnaire states that its purpose was to assist in determining the likely sources of lead exposure and locations for environmental sampling. This purpose is separate and distinct from that set forth in the Davis affidavit. Because of the multiple purposes for the questionnaire, we hold that completed questionnaires are not exempt as trial-preparation records.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">{\u00b6 39} Similarly, the release is clearly part of a process of gaining information on the nature and scope of the environmental hazard. Neither the questionnaire nor the release suggests that its sole purpose is to prepare for litigation. The primary concern of the questionnaire and the release is a public-health issue. It is well established that Ohio law favors making public records available and that the burden of proving that a record is exempt from being made available is on the public office asserting the exemption. <em>Zuem, </em>supra. We hold, therefore, that CMHA has failed to meet its burden and that the completed questionnaires and completed releases are not exempt from disclosure as either trial-preparation records or as attorney work product. As a consequence, CMHA must provide O\u2019Shea with copies of these records as well as all records that document any instances of lead poisoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\n<em>Statutory Damages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">{\u00b6 40} Clearly, in light of the discussion above, CMHA failed to comply with O\u2019Shea\u2019s request as required by R.C. 149.43(B). As a consequence, O\u2019Shea is entitled to statutory damages under R.C. 149.43(C). Because the length of the delay in delivering the records exceeds ten days, we enter judgment for O\u2019Shea in the amount of $1,000 statutory damages, the maximum authorized under R.C. 149.43.(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">\n<em>Summary of Relief Granted in the May 25 Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AY-\">{\u00b6 41} In the May 25 opinion, we did the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-9\">A. We denied respondent\u2019s motion for summary judgment and ordered CMHA to provide O\u2019Shea with copies of all liability insurance policies covering 2006 through March 26, 2009 (the date of O\u2019Shea\u2019s request).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-10\">B. We granted relator\u2019s motion for summary judgment and ordered CMHA to provide to O\u2019Shea \u201c[c]opies of all documents which document any and all instances of lead poisoning in the last 15 years in any dwelling owned or operated by CMHA,\u201d including but not limited to copies of each \u201cCMHA EBL Resident Questionnaire\u201d and \u201cCMHA Authorization for Release of Medical Information.\u201d CMHA shall, however, redact any social security numbers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-11\">C. We entered judgment for O\u2019Shea in the amount of $1,000 statutory damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>D. We granted O\u2019Shea leave to file a motion for attorney fees and permitted CMHA to respond.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">\n<em>Attorney Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">{\u00b6 42} In the complaint, O\u2019Shea also requests attorney fees as authorized by R.C. 149.43(C). In the May 25 opinion, we authorized O\u2019Shea to file a motion for attorney fees as well as a brief in support and evidentiary material. We also granted CMHA an opportunity to file an opposing brief and evidentiary material.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">{\u00b6 43} O\u2019Shea provided this court with the time entry report of attorney Michael J. O\u2019Shea (\u201cMJO\u201d) reflecting that he devoted 33.5 hours to seeking the records and prosecuting this action. The time report reflects the date of his activity, a description of the activity, and the time devoted to each activity in tenths of an hour. Also accompanying the time report is MJO\u2019s e-mail to CMHA\u2019s counsel indicating that his billing rate is $225 per hour. The total fee request, therefore, is $7,537.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">{\u00b6 44} CMHA objects to O\u2019Shea\u2019s request for attorney fees, however, and argues that attorney fees may not be awarded to a party pro se. Yet this action is brought on behalf of \u201cO\u2019Shea &amp; Associates, Co., L.P.A.\u201d as an entity, not \u201cMichael J. O\u2019Shea\u201d as an individual. CMHA has not provided this court with any authority prohibiting an award of attorney fees under R.C. 149.43 for the services provided by a lawyer working in a law firm and prosecuting a claim for the release of public records on behalf of the law firm as the requestor. As a consequence, we reject CMHA\u2019s argument that O\u2019Shea is not entitled to attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cSubsection (C)(2)(b) of the Ohio Public Records Act permits reasonable attorney\u2019s fees if the court renders a judgment that orders compliance with the Act. The same section requires reasonable attorney\u2019s fees when the public office \u2018failed to respond affirmatively or negatively to the public records request in accordance with the time allowed\u2019 under R.C. 149.43(B), which provides that \u2018all public records responsive to the request shall be promptly prepared and made available for inspection to any person at all reasonable times during regular business hours,\u2019 and that copies shall be made available within a reasonable period of time. The court may reduce attorney\u2019s fees if the public office reasonably believed that its conduct did not constitute a failure to comply with the statute and that its conduct served underlying public policy.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Mun. Constr. Equip. Operators\u2019 Labor Council v. Cleveland, </em>8th Dist. No. 94226, 2010-Ohio-2108, 2010 WL 1919947, \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">{\u00b6 46} In this action, O\u2019Shea requested three categories of records: liability insurance policies, meeting minutes, and documents regarding instances of lead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>poisoning. Approximately one week after the request, respondent\u2019s counsel notified counsel for O\u2019Shea that they would be representing CMHA. One week later, CMHA made the vast majority of the liability insurance policies and meeting minutes available. At that time, CMHA\u2019s counsel also asserted several grounds for not releasing documents regarding instances of lead poisoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">{\u00b6 47} Given the scope of O\u2019Shea\u2019s requests, we cannot conclude that CMHA \u201cfailed to respond affirmatively or negatively to the public records request in accordance with the time allowed\u201d under R.C. 149.43(B). R.C. 149.43(C)(2)(b)(i). Likewise, the record does not demonstrate that CMHA promised to produce the records within a specified time and did not make them available to O\u2019Shea. R.C. 149.43(C)(2)(b)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">{\u00b6 48} Nevertheless, CMHA has failed to demonstrate that the amount of O\u2019Shea\u2019s request for attorney fees should be reduced. R.C.149.43(C)(2) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">{\u00b6 49} \u201c(c) Court costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees awarded under this section shall be construed as remedial and not punitive. Reasonable attorney\u2019s fees shall include reasonable fees incurred to produce proof of the reasonableness and amount of the fees and to otherwise litigate entitlement to the fees. The court may reduce an award of attorney\u2019s fees to the relator or not award attorney\u2019s fees to the relator if the court determines both of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">{\u00b6 50} \u201c(i) That, based on the ordinary application of statutory law and case law as it existed at the time of the conduct or threatened conduct of the public office or person responsible for the requested public records that allegedly constitutes a failure to comply with an obligation in accordance with division (B) of this section and that was the basis of the mandamus action, a well-informed public office or person responsible for the requested public records reasonably would believe that the conduct or threatened conduct of the public office or person responsible for the requested public records did not constitute a failure to comply with an obligation in accordance with division (B) of this section;</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">{\u00b6 51} \u201c(ii) That a well-informed public office or person responsible for the requested public records reasonably would believe that the conduct or threatened conduct of the public office or person responsible for the requested public records as described in division (C)(2)(c)(i) of this section would serve the public policy that underlies the authority that is asserted as permitting that conduct or threatened conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">{\u00b6 52} In support of its argument that the award of fees should be reduced, CMHA contends that this is a case of first impression. As the discussion above demonstrates, however, <em>Daniels </em>provides considerable guidance with respect to release of records that involve lead-risk assessment. Of course, the stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>purpose of the questionnaire is \u201cto determine the likely sources of lead exposure and to assist the <em>Lead Risk Assessor </em>in determining where environmental sampling should be conducted.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Questionnaire at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">{\u00b6 53} Similarly, CMHA\u2019s argument that it had a legal basis for withholding the records because of privacy concerns on behalf of its residents lacks merit. As discussed above, CMHA\u2019s contention that the federal privacy act is controlling is not supported by any controlling authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">{\u00b6 54} Likewise, CMHA has failed to demonstrate that withholding the records has served the underlying public policy. In <em>Daniels, </em>the Supreme Court ordered the release of lead-risk-assessment reports maintained by the Cincinnati Health Department and lead-citation notices issued to property owners of units. Obviously, the nature of the records involved in <em>Daniels </em>and this action reflects a significant public-health risk that involves children. In light of the clear policy expressed in <em>Daniels </em>that records relating to this public-health risk must be released, CMHA has not provided a basis for withholding the release of the records requested in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">{\u00b6 55} CMHA also contends that specific activities on O\u2019Shea\u2019s time report are inappropriate: e-mailing a coworker and receiving e-mails from LexisNexis. Yet CMHA does not provide any compelling argument or authority why consulting with a colleague or doing legal research should not be compensable as attorney fees under R.C. 149.43(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">{\u00b6 56} We also find that MJO\u2019s hourly rate of $225 is reasonable. Compare <em>Mun. Constr. Equip., </em>2010-Ohio-2108, 2010 WL 1919947, at \u00b6 7 (finding $265 per hour reasonable in a public-records action); <em>State ex rel. Braxton v. Nichols, </em>Cuyahoga App. Nos. 93653, 93654 and 93655, 2010-Ohio-3193, 2010 WL 2682336 (finding that $225 per hour is reasonable).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">{\u00b6 57} R.C.149.43(C)(2)(c) permits reducing a request for attorney fees \u201cif the public office reasonably believed that its conduct did not constitute a failure to comply with the statute and that its conduct served underlying public policy.\u201d <em>Mun. Constr. Equip. Operators\u2019 Labor Council </em>at \u00b6 5. That is, CMHA must meet both of these criteria to maintain its argument that this court should reduce O\u2019Shea\u2019s fees. CMHA having failed to meet either criterion, we deny CMHA\u2019s request to reduce O\u2019Shea\u2019s request for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">{\u00b6 58} Accordingly, O\u2019Shea\u2019s request for attorney fees is granted in the amount of $7,537.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">\n<em>Summary of Disposition of Relator\u2019s Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">Accordingly, the judgment in this action follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>1.
