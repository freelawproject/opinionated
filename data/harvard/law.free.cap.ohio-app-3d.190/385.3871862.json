Homesales had repeatedly ignored the orders of the city\u2019s director of buildings and inspections to remedy the numerous and serious defects in the property. The city ultimately filed a criminal complaint in Hamilton County Municipal Court alleging that Homesales\u2019s failure to comply with the director\u2019s lawful orders violated Cincinnati Municipal Code 1101-71 and that the violation was punishable as a misdemeanor of the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">{\u00b6 2} The city served a criminal complaint and summons on Homesales through its statutory agent. But Homesales did not appear in municipal court and did not voluntarily authorize the trial to proceed in its absence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following a hearing, the trial court found that the city could not proceed against Homesales in absentia. The court found that even if the city could properly initiate criminal proceedings against Homesales, it could not overcome the requirement that a criminal defendant must be physically present at the commencement of trial. Therefore, the trial court dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">{\u00b6 3} The gravamen of the city\u2019s argument on appeal, raised in its single assignment of error, is that the Cincinnati Municipal Code permits it to commence trials in absentia.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">{\u00b6 4} In its recent decision in <em>Cleveland v. Washington Mut. Bank,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Ohio Supreme Court held that a corporate defendant could not be tried in absentia, under R.C. 2941.47, when the defendant had not authorized the proceeding and had never appeared before the court. Cleveland municipal authorities, responding to \u201cthe spread of blighted neighborhoods caused by * * * absentee owners (corporate and individual) who permit properties to go into ruin and decay,\u201d had relied upon R.C. 2941.47 for authority to initiate criminal misdemeanor trials against corporate landowners in absentia.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But the Supreme Court noted that by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>its express terms, R.C. 2941.47 applied only to \u201cprosecutions instituted <em>by indictment or information </em>against corporations in the <em>court of common pleas </em>and directs the clerk of that court to enter a \u2018not guilty\u2019 plea on behalf of a corporation that has failed to appear.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Since Cleveland had initiated the misdemeanor prosecutions by complaint or affidavit in municipal court,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Supreme Court concluded that the trial court lacked the authority to conduct the trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">{\u00b6 5} Here, the city correctly notes that it is not constrained by the statutory impediment to the prosecutions in <em>Washington Mut. </em>Cincinnati Municipal Code 902-8, effective January 1, 1974, authorizes the initiation of legal proceedings, by affidavit filed in the Hamilton County Municipal Court, against \u201cany organization\u201d found in \u201cviolation of any ordinance of the City of Cincinnati.\u201d Under this ordinance, the city clearly had the authority to initiate the criminal complaint against Homesales in municipal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">{\u00b6 6} The city further contends that Cincinnati Municipal Code 902-8 provided the municipal court with authority to proceed with a trial in absentia against Homesales. The code provision states that if a defendant organization fails to appear and to answer a criminal complaint, the court \u201cshall enter a plea of not guilty, and upon such appearance being made or plea entered the organization shall be deemed thenceforth continuously present in said court until the case is finally disposed of.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">{\u00b6 7} But until Homesales elects to appear at trial, Crim.R. 43 and the federal and Ohio constitutions bar the city from proceeding with this criminal prosecution.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We note that a corporate defendant typically appears at trial through the presence of its counsel.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cOne of the most basic of the rights guaranteed by the Confrontation Clause [of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution] is the accused\u2019s right to be present in the courtroom at every stage of his trial.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The accused\u2019s presence guards against the principal evil that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>the clause was meant to remedy, the \u201cuse of ex parte examinations as evidence against the accused.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Ohio Constitution is more direct: \u201cIn any trial, in any court, the party accused shall be allowed to appear and defend in person and with counsel * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">{\u00b6 8} The Ohio Supreme Court has declared that these constitutional guarantees \u201cmandate the presence of the defendant, absent waiver of his rights * * * at every stage of his trial.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> These guarantees have been embodied in Crim.R.. 43(A).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The rule provides that \u201cthe defendant <em>must be physically present </em>at every stage of the criminal proceeding and trial, including the impaneling of the jury, the return of the verdict, and the imposition of sentence, except as otherwise provided by these rules. In all prosecutions, the defendant\u2019s voluntary absence after the trial has been commenced in the defendant\u2019s presence shall not prevent continuing the trial to and including the verdict. A corporation may appear by counsel for all purposes.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">{\u00b6 9} This court has long upheld this mandate. For example, in a criminal proceeding for the forfeiture of property under R.C. 2933.43, we concluded that the defendant had been denied due process of law when the court proceeded to hear and determine the merits of the state\u2019s forfeiture petition in the defendant\u2019s absence.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We held that \u201cCrim.R. 43(A) provides a defendant in a criminal prosecution with an absolute right, subject to the provisions of Crim.R. 43(B), to be present at every stage of the trial, including the imposition of sentence. That right is so fundamental that we are compelled to hold that it cannot be removed except by a voluntary, intelligent and express waiver.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">{\u00b6 10} A trial court\u2019s failure to ensure the accused\u2019s presence at trial before proceeding is an error of constitutional magnitude.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The city lacks the authority under the Home Rule Amendment to enforce ordinances that are \u201cin conflict with general laws.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> A municipal ordinance that authorizes a trial in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>absentia permits that which the Ohio Constitution and Crim.R. 43(A) expressly forbid. And that ordinance violates the Home Rule Amendment and is not enforceable.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">{\u00b6 11} Here, the city has properly initiated a criminal prosecution against Homesales for the criminal violation of city ordinances and the orders of the city\u2019s Director of Buildings and Inspections. But Homesales has not appeared in municipal court or voluntarily waived its presence. Thus, the trial court lacked authority to hear and determine the merits of the city\u2019s complaint. The trial court did not err in refusing to permit the trial to go forward. The assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">{\u00b6 12} Therefore, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b425-8\">Cunningham, P.J., and Hendon and Mallory, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b422-10\">.
