The work performed by All American included standard waterproofing installation of drain systems, as well as work on a garage door area that was causing leakage.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">{\u00b6 3} The Huffs paid $3,500 for this work. The contract signed by the parties provided that the work had a \u201ctransferable lifetime guarantee.\u201d The contract listed all the work performed under the contract, including installing a drain and grate box under the length of the garage door. No exclusions were listed on the contract from the lifetime guarantee. A \u201ccertificate\u201d was also separately provided to the Huffs, which stated that a lifetime guarantee was provided against leakage in the areas waterproofed by All American pursuant to the job plans. This certificate also attempted to list certain exclusions to the lifetime guarantee.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">{\u00b6 4} The Huffs\u2019 water problems were resolved for a couple of years, but thereafter, troubles resurfaced due to problems with the drain installed along the garage door. The grate and drainpipe failed, and once again, they began having mold problems and basement flooding. The cement work also cracked. When they contacted All American, they were advised that the work was not guaranteed because it was affected by outside elements. Eventually, All American did some work to try to remedy the problems, but it was unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">{\u00b6 5} On August 6, 2009, Appellees Jeffrey and Teri Huff filed a claim in Ashland Municipal Court, Small Claims Division, for $3,000 for \u201cdamages to the basement floor and walls.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-11\">{\u00b6 6} On October 21, 2009, the matter was heard by a magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-12\">{\u00b6 7} At trial, the Huffs testified that they had paid $3,500 for the entire waterproofing of the basement. They stated that they now have black mold on the walls, which was not there previously, cracked cement, and a failed drain, as well as continuous water problems. They testified that they received a verbal estimate for repair of the drain, but that it does not appear that they can be restored to the position they believed they were in, that being a lifetime-guaranteed waterproofing of their basement.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>{\u00b6 8} It was All American\u2019s position that the area that is now causing the Huffs\u2019 problems is not covered by the lifetime guarantee because this work was done as part of the \u201chome services\u201d and not the basement waterproofing and, therefore, is excluded from the lifetime guarantee. All American relies upon the certificate issued after the work was done to carve out this exclusion. All American further argued that the drain is the only portion arguably guaranteed by the contract and stated that the cost of the drain replacement was only $500 to $600.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">{\u00b6 9} On or about December 3, 2009, the magistrate issued her decision in favor of appellees and awarded them $3,000 in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">{\u00b6 10} Appellant timely filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">{\u00b6 11} On February 8, 2010, the trial judge adopted the decision of the magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">{\u00b6 12} Appellant now appeals, assigning the following errors for review:</p>\n<p id=\"AN0\">ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cI. The trial court erred as a matter of law in failing to limit the claims of the plaintiffs to the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cII. The trial court erred as a matter of law in using recision [sic] as the measure of damages instead of the cost of repair as required under Ohio law.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cHI. The trial court erred as a matter of law in finding that the plaintiffs met their burden of proof for a claim of breach of warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-11\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cIV. The trial court erred as a matter of law in finding that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were within the statute of limitations given the damage to property they claim occurred in 2001.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-12\">{\u00b6 17} For ease of review, we shall address some of appellant\u2019s assignments of error out of order.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b651-14\">{\u00b6 18} In its first assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in not limiting appellees\u2019 claims to their complaint. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-15\">{\u00b6 19} Appellant argues that appellees\u2019 complaint did not comply with the requirements set forth in R.C. 1925.04, which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b651-16\">{\u00b620} \u201c(A) An action is commenced in the small claims division when the plaintiff, or the plaintiffs attorney, states the amount and nature of the plaintiffs claim to the court as provided in this section * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-17\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>{\u00b6 22} \u201c(B) The plaintiff, or the plaintiffs attorney, shall state to the administrative assistant or other official designated by the court, the plaintiffs and the defendant\u2019s place of residence, the military status of the defendant, and the nature and amount of the plaintiffs claim. The claim shall be reduced to writing in concise, nontechnical form. Such writing shall be signed by the plaintiff, or the plaintiffs attorney, under oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c* * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">{\u00b6 24} Appellant argues that appellees\u2019 claims of \u201cdamages to basement floor and walls\u201d is akin to a claim for personal property, a tort, and not a claim for breach of warranty or breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">{\u00b6 25} Upon review, we find that the Small Claims Division of the Ashland Municipal Court provides a preprinted complaint form for plaintiffs to complete, which requires only the name, address, and phone number of the plaintiff and defendant, a statement of the claim, and the amount of the judgment requested. The complaint form provides three lines for the plaintiff to fill in and state the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">{\u00b6 26} In this case, appellees printed \u201cDamages to Basement Floor and Walls\u201d on the space provided and attached a copy of the contract thereto. Based on this document, we find that appellant was put on adequate notice that the claims being brought by appellees were based on the work provided under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">{\u00b6 27} Based on the foregoing, we find this assignment of error not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">{\u00b6 28} Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b652-12\">{\u00b629} In its third assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in finding that appellees had met their burden of proof on their breach-of-warranty claim. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-13\">{\u00b6 30} The magistrate in the instant case found that the transferable lifetime guarantee provided to appellees by appellant, included \u201call work performed on the Huffs [sic] home including the garage door and drain system which has failed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-14\">{\u00b6 31} We agree. As noted by the trial court, the contract signed by the parties contained a transferable, lifetime guarantee for \u201call work performed,\u201d and appellant\u2019s attempt to rely on a certificate unilaterally issued subsequent to the contract is of no consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-15\">{\u00b6 32} Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">{\u00b6 33} In its fourth and final assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in finding that appellees\u2019 claims were brought within the statute of limitations. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">{\u00b6 34} Appellant argues that appellees\u2019 claim for damage to personal property is barred by the two-year statute of limitations contained in R.C. 2305.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">{\u00b6 35} Upon review, we find that appellees\u2019 claim falls under R.C. 1302.98(A). R.C. 1302.98(A) applies to \u201caetion[s] for breach of any contract for sale.\u201d R.C. 1302.01 further defines the scope of \u201ccontracts for sale\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cAs used in [R.C. 1302.01 to R.C. 1302.98], unless the context otherwise requires: * * * \u2018Contract\u2019 and \u2018agreement\u2019 are limited to those relating to the present or future sale of goods.\u201d R.C. 1302.01(A)(11). See also R.C. 1302.02 (\u201cUnless the context otherwise requires, [R.C. 1302.01 to R.C. 1302.98, inclusive] apply to transactions in goods\u201d). \u201cGoods\u201d include \u201call things * * * which are moveable at the time of identification to the contract for sale * * * [and] must be both existing and identified before any interest in them can pass.\u201d R.C. 1302.01(A)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">{\u00b6 37} Appellant\u2019s obligation under the contract was to repair appellees\u2019 basement, and appellant further warranted for a \u201clifetime\u201d that the areas waterproofed would not leak. Consequently, the agreement between appellant and appellees was not a contract for the sale of goods within the definitions of R.C. Chapter 1302. Rather, the agreement was predominantly one for services, and any goods sold in connection with the agreement were incidental to the repair and waterproofing services. See <em>Allied Indus. Serv. Corp. v. Kasle Iron &amp; Metals, Inc. </em>(1977), 62 Ohio App.2d 144, 147, 16 O.O.3d 303, 405 N.E.2d 307 (\u201c[T]he test <em>for </em>the inclusion in or the exclusion from [R.C. Chapter 1302] sales provisions is whether the predominant factor and purpose of the contract is the rendition of services, with goods incidentally involved, or whether the contract is for the sale of goods, with labor incidentally involved\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">{\u00b6 38} Therefore, the two-year limitations provision applicable to actions based on injury to personal property does not operate to bar appellees\u2019 claims. Rather, appellees\u2019 claim against appellant for breach of its written warranty is governed by R.C. 2305.06, which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cExcept as provided in [R.C. 126.301 and R.C. 1302.98], an action upon a specialty or an agreement, contract, or promise in writing shall be brought within fifteen years after the cause thereof accrued.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Kocisko v. Charles Shutrump &amp; Sons Co. </em>(1986), 21 Ohio St.3d 98, 99, 21 OBR 392, 488 N.E.2d 171 (a claim alleging breach of contract to install a roof, when the roof had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>leaking since the date of its installation, was subject to the 15-year statute of limitations set forth at R.C. 2305.06).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">{\u00b6 40} Appellant\u2019s argument that the trial court erred in failing to apply the two-year limitations provision at R.C. 2305.10 is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">{\u00b6 41} Appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">{\u00b6 42} In its second assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court was without jurisdiction to grant rescission. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">{\u00b6 43} R.C. 1925.02 addresses the jurisdiction of the small claims division and provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cExcept as provided in division (A)(2) of this section, a small claims division established under section 1925.01 of the Revised Code has jurisdiction in civil actions for the recovery of taxes and money only, for amounts not exceeding three thousand dollars, exclusive of interest and costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-11\">{\u00b6 45} Based on R.C. 1925.01, we find that while the small claims division of the Ashland Municipal Court has the power to award monetary damages, it does not have jurisdiction over claims for equitable relief and therefore does not have the power to rescind or cancel a contract. <em>Anna v. Nickles </em>(Apr. 5, 1989), Wayne App. No. 2411, 1989 WL 32609, *2.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-12\">{\u00b6 46} Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-13\">{\u00b6 47} Based on the foregoing, we affirm the decision of the trial court in part and reverse it in part, and we remand this matter to the trial court for proceedings consistent with this opinion and with the jurisdiction of the small claims division.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-14\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b654-15\">Edwards, P.J., and Gwin, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
