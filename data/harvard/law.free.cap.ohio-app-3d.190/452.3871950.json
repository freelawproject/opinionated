Appellant alleges that the trial court abused its discretion in striking her answer as a sanction for her insurance carrier\u2019s alleged failure to comply with the pretrial notice requiring the presence of the \u201cassigned\u201d adjuster at the settlement pretrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">{\u00b6 2} We conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in striking appellant\u2019s answer. There is no evidence in the record that the adjuster present at the settlement pretrial did not satisfy the purpose underlying the trial court\u2019s requirement that the \u201cassigned\u201d adjuster be present. There was no evidence that the adjuster present did not have full settlement authority and was not sufficiently familiar with the case to permit the parties to move forward with settlement discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">{\u00b6 3} Additionally, absent a record to support the sanction, the trial court abused its discretion in imposing so harsh and severe a sanction as the one imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">{\u00b6 4} Accordingly, we reverse the judgment and remand the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b489-14\">{\u00b6 5} Appellees filed a complaint against appellant for injuries they sustained in an automobile accident in which appellant\u2019s vehicle struck appellees\u2019 vehicle. Appellant had a policy of insurance with Allstate Insurance Company (\u201cAllstate\u201d). Appellant timely filed her answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-15\">{\u00b6 6} An initial pretrial was held on April 24, 2009, during which a settlement pretrial was scheduled for November 6, 2009. The court\u2019s May 4, 2009 pretrial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>order provided: \u201cSettlement Pretrial with all Trial Counsel Present: 11/6/09 w/clients &amp; the insurance adjuster who is assigned to the case shall be present.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">{\u00b6 7} The parties agree that Jimilee L. Hoover had been the Allstate adjuster assigned to the case but that Claudia Winfrey, a retired Allstate adjuster, appeared on behalf of Allstate at the November 6, 2009 settlement pretrial. Hoover works at the Allstate branch office in Hudson, Ohio. Winfrey was previously employed at Allstate\u2019s former Toledo office. The trial court determined that Winfrey had no knowledge of the case and thus, meaningful settlement discussion could not take place. As a result of Allstate\u2019s failure to send the \u201cassigned\u201d adjuster to the settlement pretrial, the trial court held appellant in contempt of its May 4, 2009 order and ordered that appellant\u2019s answer be stricken, resulting in a default judgment, and scheduled the matter for a hearing on damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">{\u00b6 8} Appellant\u2019s motion for reconsideration included an affidavit from Winfrey, who claimed that she was \u201cdesignated\u201d by M\u00edstate as its representative in this case and that she had full authority to settle this matter. The trial court denied the motion for reconsideration, specifically noting that \u201cWinfrey is a former adjuster for M\u00edstate who appears at all final pretrials. She is neither the \u2018adjuster assigned to the case\u2019 or an employee of M\u00edstate. On former occasions, she is not knowledgeable about the case, the medicals or the status of negotiations. It was indicated that one, Jimilee L. Hoover, an M\u00edstate adjuster, had done everything regarding the case up to the final pretrial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">{\u00b6 9} The trial court further added, \u201cThis ploy by the insurance company is an attempt to thwart the purpose and intent of the language of the pretrial order and to avoid having the adjuster appear, in this case, from Hudson, Ohio.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">{\u00b6 10} A damages hearing was held and the trial court awarded appellees $21,292.50 in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">{\u00b6 11} Appellant appeals, raising five assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">II. PRETRIAL ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">{\u00b6 12} In her first assignment of error, appellant maintains:</p>\n<p id=\"b490-12\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cThe Trial Court erred when it held that Appellant-Defendant was in violation of the Court\u2019s Pretrial Order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-13\">{\u00b6 14} Appellant claims that she was not in violation of the trial court\u2019s May 4, 2009 order, which required that the \u201cassigned\u201d adjuster appear for the settlement pretrial, because there was no intent to circumvent the court\u2019s order and because Winfrey, who was acting on behalf of Allstate, was a qualified adjuster with full authority to settle this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>{\u00b6 15} We agree that appellant was not in violation of the trial court\u2019s order. There is no record in this case that Winfrey did not satisfy the underlying purpose of the trial court\u2019s order. The trial court\u2019s order did not define \u201cassigned\u201d in its pretrial order so strictly that Allstate would not be able to change the assignment of the adjusters.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">{\u00b6 16} The parties agree that Winfrey was an independent contractor representing Allstate in this matter. At issue is whether Winfrey\u2019s lack of involvement with the case prior to the settlement pretrial precludes her presence at pretrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">{\u00b6 17} Civ.R. 16 governs the adoption of rules concerning pretrial procedure and provides that a court may adopt rules concerning pretrial procedure to accomplish \u201c[t]he possibility of settlement of the action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">{\u00b6 18} Lucas County Common Pleas General Rule 5.06 is designed to facilitate settlement of the case and for preparation of the case if no settlement is reached. It reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cThe final pretrial conference shall consider <em>settlement of the case, </em>stipulations over admissibility of evidence, motions in limine and other matters which would eliminate unnecessary trial time.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">{\u00b6 20} The rule further provides, \u201cThe trial judge may issue a final pretrial order. * * * A judge may impose sanctions on attorneys, parties, or both, for failure to comply with any case management order. Sanctions may be monetary, nonmonetary, or both. No sanction shall be imposed without granting the offending party an opportunity to be heard, unless the conduct giving rise to the sanction amounts to a direct contempt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c[T]he purpose of the pretrial [is] to carry the negotiations forward by a discussion of the issues and the evidence in the hope of bringing about an agreeable settlement. * * * In this context it is not unreasonable to require that the parties be present who have full authority to negotiate and settle the claim[s].\u201d <em>Repp v. Horton </em>(1974), 44 Ohio App.2d 63, 65-66, 73 O.O.2d 57, 335 N.E.2d 722. See Civ.R. 83 and <em>Meyer v. Brinsky </em>(1935), 129 Ohio St. 371, 2 O.O. 373, 195 N.E. 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">{\u00b6 22} In this case, as in <em>Horton, </em>the purpose of the rule was to have present at the settlement pretrial the parties capable of negotiating and settling the matter. The pretrial order required not only those persons capable of negotiating and settling the matter, but also required that the insurance adjustor \u201cassigned\u201d to the case be present. The November 9, 2009 order striking appellant\u2019s answer makes clear the trial court\u2019s belief that productive settlement discussions could not be achieved without the presence of the insurance adjuster who had previously participated in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>{\u00b6 23} The court\u2019s order makes clear that it believed that Winfrey did not have sufficient knowledge of the case to enable meaningful settlement discussion. However, Winfrey\u2019s affidavit asserts that she had full authority from Allstate to negotiate and settle the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">{\u00b6 24} The trial court failed to create a record that would show that Winfrey lacked the requisite understanding of the case necessary to permit meaningful discussion. The trial court assumed that because Winfrey had been unprepared to move forward in other cases, she was similarly unprepared in this case. But the court\u2019s assumption is not evidence. The trial court should have created a record documenting Winfrey\u2019s participation in settlement discussions. A record might have disclosed facts supporting the trial judge\u2019s action; but in this case, there is no record.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">{\u00b6 25} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is well taken. There is no evidence that Allstate did not comply with the intent of the pretrial order requiring that the \u201cassigned\u201d adjuster be present during the settlement pretrial. We now turn to appellant\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">III. STRIKING THE ANSWER</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">{\u00b6 26} In her second assignment of error, appellant argues:</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cThe Trial Court erred when it ordered AppellanNDefendant\u2019s Answer to be stricken from the record and rendered a default judgment against Appellant-Defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">{\u00b6 28} We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">{\u00b6 29} It has been held, \u201cThere is no question that trial courts have authority to impose sanctions where the actions of a party operate to thwart the judicial process. But justice requires that where a range of sanctions is available, the most drastic sanctions must be reserved for flagrant cases.\u201d <em>Am. Hous. Corp. v. Rhoades </em>(1981), 1 Ohio App.3d 130, 131, 1 OBR 437, 439 N.E.2d 946. See <em>Ward v. Hester </em>(1973), 36 Ohio St.2d 38, 65 O.O.2d 181, 303 N.E.2d 861. <em>Continental Cas. Co. v. Ward </em>(1974), 415 U.S. 984, 94 S.Ct. 1577, 39 L.Ed.2d 881.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-12\">{\u00b6 30} An appellate court will not reverse a trial court\u2019s determination on this issue absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Nakoff v. Fairview Gen. Hosp. </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 254, 256, 662 N.E.2d 1. The term \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d connotes more than an error of law or of judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-13\">{\u00b6 31} The trial court\u2019s sanction of striking the answer resulted in a default judgment. It has been held that the granting of a default judgment is a harsh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>remedy that should be imposed only when \u201cthe actions of the faulting party create a presumption of willfulness or bad faith.\u201d <em>Russo v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>(1987), 36 Ohio App.3d 175, 179, 521 N.E.2d 1116.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">{\u00b6 32} Based on the absence of a record demonstrating that Winfrey lacked the requisite familiarity with the case or authority to permit productive settlement discussions, we hold that it was an abuse of discretion to strike appellant\u2019s answer. It cannot be presumed that appellant or Allstate acted willfully or in bad faith when Allstate designated Winfrey as its representative during the settlement pretrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">{\u00b6 33} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">IV. JURY TRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">{\u00b6 34} In her third assignment of error, appellant argues:</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cThe Trial Court erred when it denied Appellant-Defendant\u2019s right to jury trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">{\u00b6 36} Our disposition of appellant\u2019s second assignment of error renders this assignment of error moot. App.R. 12(A)(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">V. SANCTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b493-12\">{\u00b6 37} In her fourth assignment of error, appellant argues:</p>\n<p id=\"b493-13\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cThe Trial Court erred when it ordered Appellant-Defendant\u2019s Answer and entered a default judgment as other sanctions and penalties were more appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-14\">{\u00b6 39} Our disposition of appellant\u2019s second assignment of error renders this assignment of error moot. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-15\">VI. RECONSIDERATION</p>\n<p id=\"b493-16\">{\u00b6 40} In her fifth assignment of error, appellant argues:</p>\n<p id=\"b493-17\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cThe Trial Court erred when it denied Appellant-Defendant\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-18\">{\u00b6 42} Our disposition of appellant\u2019s second assignment of error renders this assignment of error moot. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-19\">VII. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b493-20\">{\u00b6 43} On consideration whereof, the court finds that substantial justice has not been done the party complaining. The judgment of the Lucas County Common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Pleas Court is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings. Appellees are ordered to pay the costs of this appeal pursuant to App.R. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b494-5\">Osowik, P.J., and Singer, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
