The complaint alleged that Carol had committed child abuse against her minor son, W.W. At issue is whether the court abused its discretion in dismissing the complaint due to improper venue. For the reasons that follow, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">{\u00b62} On August 27, 2009, the department filed a complaint alleging that Carol\u2019s son, W.W., then age 12, was an abused child pursuant to R.C. 2151.031. The complaint alleged two counts of child abuse against Carol and further alleged that the alleged abuse occurred in the city of Painesville, Lake County, Ohio. W.W.\u2019s father, Jeffrey Wilde, is not a named party in this appeal. The Wildes were divorced in 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-11\">{\u00b6 3} On September 2, 2009, the trial court appointed Caterina Cocca-Fulton as guardian ad litem for the minor child. Cocca-Fulton filed her report on October 23, 2009, in which she stated that W.W. was placed with Carol and that Jeffrey had visitation. She said that the problems between the parents had become burdens for the child, and she was concerned that the child was underachieving at school. She recommended that neither parent discuss the case with the child, that both parents review the child\u2019s school work and maintain contact with his teacher, and that the parents follow the rules of W.W.\u2019s counselor.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-12\">{\u00b6 4} An adjudicatory hearing was held on November 6, 2009. Dr. Boushra Ward, the child\u2019s pediatrician, testified that Jeffrey brought his son to see her due to injuries he sustained in July 2008. Dr. Ward stated that the child complained of a stiff neck and back and had bruising on his body, specifically on his face, back, and neck. Dr. Ward said that she sent the child for x-rays and that the results showed he had no broken bones.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>{\u00b6 5} Deputy Joseph Basco of the Lake County Sheriffs Office testified that Jeffrey brought W.W. to the station to file a report against Carol due to injuries she had allegedly inflicted on the child. Basco interviewed W.W. and his father and then interviewed Carol. She told the deputy that W.W. was \u201cgiving her attitude\u201d and that she disciplined him by grabbing his face to get his attention and by smacking him on the rear end. Carol acknowledged that she may have left some marks. Basco saw that W.W. had a bruise on his left cheek, marks consistent with hand marks on both sides of his neck that were the result of both bruises and scratches, and slight bruising on his back. Basco took photographs of W.W.\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">{\u00b6 6} Bridget McGuire, a social worker with the department, testified that after she was informed of the alleged abuse, she contacted the Lake County Sheriffs Office. At that time, W.W. and his father were at the station, and Basco invited her there to interview them. McGuire interviewed W.W. and his father separately at the station. She then spoke with Carol and her boyfriend, who were also there. According to McGuire, Carol initially denied hitting or spanking W.W. However, she later admitted that because W.W. was argumentative and disrespectful, she grabbed his neck, arm, and cheeks; hit him on the back a few times; and restrained him by grabbing his legs. McGuire testified that W.W.\u2019s injuries included a bruise on his left jaw, dark red bruises behind both ears, dark red bruises and scratch marks on both sides of his neck, a faint bruise on his upper back, a bruise on his lower back, and a bloody lower lip. McGuire said that a voluntary safety plan was implemented at the station that day. Carol agreed to initiate mental-health services as well as to follow any recommendations. McGuire testified that on the following day, she visited Carol\u2019s home, which, she said, is located in \u201cPainesville, Ohio, Lake County.\u201d She subsequently followed up with the family several times.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">{\u00b6 7} Patrick McCafferty, a mental-health consultant, testified that he was contacted by Jeffrey, who was concerned about W.W.\u2019s adjustment with respect to the situation involving his mother. McCafferty met with W.W. eight times before the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">{\u00b6 8} W.W. testified that he lives at 89 Bryn Mawr Drive in Painesville. He stated that he got in a fight with his mother because he did not go to bed when she told him to. W.W. said that his mother slapped him once or twice with an open hand, causing him to fall off his bed and hit the radiator. When he got up, he swore at her, and she smacked him again. According to the child, he had a bruise on his cheek, bruises and scratches on his neck, bruises on his back, and a cut on his inner lip.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">{\u00b6 9} After the department rested its case, Carol moved for a dismissal of the complaint, arguing improper venue. The court stated from the bench:</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>{\u00b6 10} \u201cThe complaint alleges and the [department] is required to prove the allegations contained in this complaint, and the [department] is required to prove * * * that the alleged abuse happened * * * in the City of Painesville, Lake County, State of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cIn Count Number <em>2 </em>it is alleged that * * * in the City of Painesville, Lake County, State of Ohio, * * * the abuse occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe Court hereby finds that the [department] failed in its burden to prove that this happened in the City of Painesville. As a matter of fact, the Court is painfully aware that this happened in the Township of Painesville.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, however, that the Court is required by law to therefore find that the State has failed to meet its burden and the underlying complaint is hereby dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">{\u00b6 14} In the trial court\u2019s November 9, 2009 judgment entry, the court granted Carol\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint. The trial court stated in its entry that \u201c[b]ased on the evidence and testimony presented by the Department, the Court finds that the Department has failed to meet its burden as it pertains to venue, and therefore the Court cannot find that the Court has jurisdiction to proceed with this matter.\u201d It is from this judgment that the department filed the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">{\u00b6 15} While this appeal was pending, on December 29, 2009, this court sua sponte ordered the department to show cause why this appeal should not be dismissed for lack of a final, appealable order. On January 13, 2010, the department filed a response to this court\u2019s order to show cause, as well as a joint stipulation of facts pursuant to App.R. 9(E), since a portion of the transcript was inadvertently omitted from the record. On January 29, 2010, the department filed an application for approval of the joint stipulation of facts, which was approved by the trial court on February 1, 2010. On February 8, 2010, this court indicated that this appeal would proceed on the merits. This court determined that after reviewing the limited materials presented and the department\u2019s response to the show-cause order, a more thorough review of the record and the briefs would be necessary in order to make a proper final, appealable order determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-10\">{\u00b6 16} The department asserts the following as its sole assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b693-11\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cThe trial court erred by granting appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of venue because the venue of the Lake County Juvenile Court is the entire county.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-12\">{\u00b6 18} Before addressing the merits of the case, we first consider whether the trial court\u2019s November 9, 2009 judgment was a final, appealable order. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>court has held that \u201c[a]ppellate courts have jurisdiction to review only final orders or judgments of the inferior courts in their district.\u201d <em>Alkenbrack v. Green Tree, </em>11th Dist. No. 2009-G-2889, 2009-Ohio-6512, 2009 WL 4756349, at \u00b6 11, citing Section 3(B)(2), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution; R.C. 2505.02. If an order is not final and appealable, we have no jurisdiction to review the matter and must dismiss it. <em>Green Tree; Gen. Accident Ins. Co. v. Ins. Co. of N. Am. </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 17, 20, 540 N.E.2d 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">{\u00b6 19} As a general proposition, \u201ca judgment dismissing a case for improper venue is not a final appealable order.\u201d <em>Falls Elec. Contr., Inc. v. TriState Constr., </em>11th Dist. No. 2004-T-0104, 2004-Ohio-6952, 2004 WL 2940950, at \u00b6 2, citing <em>State ex rel. Allied Chem. Co. v. Aurelius </em>(1984), 16 Ohio App.3d 69, 16 OBR 73, 474 N.E.2d 618; <em>Snell v. Cincinnati St. Ry. Co. </em>(1899), 60 Ohio St. 256, 54 N.E. 270. This is because the appealing party still has an effective remedy by way of appeal from the final judgment entered by the new court. <em>Molzon v. Molzon, </em>11th Dist. No. 2003-G-2510, 2003-Ohio-5424, 2003 WL 22327313, at \u00b6 3. However, \u201c[t]he granting of a motion to dismiss is a final appealable order \u2018when all the claims of all the parties have been decided.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lexford Properties, Inc. v. Schiltz, </em>5th Dist. No. 2003CA00025, 2003-Ohio-4897, 2003 WL 22128788, at \u00b6 17, quoting <em>Alexander v. Buckeye Pipe Line Co. </em>(1977), 49 Ohio St.2d 158, 3 O.O.3d 174, 359 N.E .2d 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">{\u00b6 20} An order is a final, appealable order if it \u201caffects a substantial right in an action that in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment.\u201d R.C. 2505.02(B)(1). A \u201csubstantial right\u201d is defined as \u201ca right that the United States Constitution, the Ohio Constitution, a statute, the common law, or a rule of procedure entitles a person to enforce or protect.\u201d R.C. 2505.02(A)(1). In other words, \u201c[a] court order which deprives a person of a remedy which he would otherwise possess deprives that person of a substantial right.\u201d <em>Chef Italiano Corp. v. Kent State Univ. </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 86, 88, 541 N.E .2d 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">{\u00b6 21} In juvenile matters, the issue of improper venue is governed by Juv.R. 11. Juv.R. 11(A) provides that if a child resides in a county of this state and the proceeding is commenced in a court of another county, that court, on its own motion or a motion of a party, may transfer the proceeding to the county of the child\u2019s residence. The rule does not provide for the <em>dismissal </em>of a case for improper venue. However, in the case sub judice, after the court found that the department had failed to prove venue, the court found that it therefore lacked jurisdiction and dismissed the case. The court\u2019s ruling thus determined the action and prevented a judgment. It also deprived the department of a remedy it otherwise would have had. We therefore hold that it is a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>{\u00b6 22} The dissent maintains that the trial court\u2019s judgment dismissing the action due to improper venue is not a final, appealable order because there may be another remedy \u201cdue to the continuing jurisdiction of the juvenile court.\u201d The dissent ignores, however, that the court also ruled that it does not have jurisdiction to proceed with the matter. As a result of the court\u2019s ruling, contrary to the dissent, the court does not have continuing jurisdiction over the case; the department has been deprived of its right to prosecute abuse proceedings on behalf of W.W.; and the department does not have the ability to refile the complaint. In these circumstances, the trial court\u2019s dismissal is a final, appeal-able order because the case has been disposed of and there is nothing left for the court to decide. <em>Natl. City Commercial Capital Corp. v. AAAA at Your Serv., Inc., </em>114 Ohio St.3d 82, 2007-Ohio-2942, 868 N.E.2d 663, \u00b6 8. In that case, the Supreme Court of Ohio held: \u201cParties that believe an Ohio court has wrongly asserted jurisdiction over them have a right of appeal. * * * It is not logical to allow a party that believes a court wrongly asserted jurisdiction to appeal but to prevent a party that believes a court wrongly did not assert jurisdiction from appealing.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 10. If we were to adopt the reasoning of the dissent, the department would not only be deprived of its remedy, it would be prevented from appealing the court\u2019s decision to dismiss its case. Id. at \u00b6 9. \u201cThe injustice of this result is manifest.\u201d Id. The case mentioned by the dissent, <em>In re Cross, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 328, 2002-Ohio-4183, 774 N.E.2d 258, is inapposite. In that case, the Supreme Court stated that the juvenile court retains jurisdiction over any abused, neglected, or dependent child for whom the court has issued a dispositional order until the child attains the age of 18. Id. at \u00b6 10. Not only has no such dispositional order been made here, the trial court actually dismissed the action for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\"> {\u00b6 23} Turning now to the merits of the case, we note that the standard of appellate review of a trial court\u2019s judgment addressing a defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss on the ground of improper venue is abuse of discretion. <em>Broadview Hts. v. Figler </em>(Mar. 17, 1994), 8th Dist. No. 65026, 1994 WL 86201, *2. \u201cDecisions regarding venue are left to the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Paparodis v. Snively, </em>7th Dist. No. 06-CO-5, 2007-Ohio-6910, 2007 WL 4465386, at \u00b6 52. This court has recently stated that the term \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d is one of art, connoting judgment exercised by a court that does not comport with reason or the record. <em>State v. Underwood, </em>11th Dist. No. 2008-L-113, 2009-Ohio-2089, 2009 WL 1177050, at \u00b6 30, citing <em>State v. Ferranto </em>(1925), 112 Ohio St. 667, 676-678,148 N.E. 362. The Second Appellate District recently adopted this definition of the abuse-of-discretion standard in <em>State v. Beechler, </em>2d Dist. No. 09-CA-54, 2010-Ohio-1900, 2010 WL 1731784, at \u00b6 65, citing Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (4th Ed.Rev. 1968) 25 (\u201cA discretion exercised to an end or purpose not justified by and clearly against reason and evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>{\u00b6 24} The department argues that the trial court abused its discretion by granting Carol\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of venue. We agree for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">{\u00b6 25} First, the trial court erred in finding that the department failed to prove that venue was proper in Lake County. \u201cVenue is the legal term for the proper place for a trial to occur. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7 Ed. 1999) 1553. Venue should not be confused with jurisdiction as they are distinct legal concepts. <em>Craig v. Consolidated Rail Corp. </em>(April 6, 1988), 9th Dist. No. 13332, [1988 WL 37626, *2], Venue embodies \u2018the geographic division where a cause can be tried[.]\u2019 <em>Morrison v. Steiner </em>(1972), 32 Ohio St.2d 86, 88 [61 O.O.2d 335], 290 N.E.2d 841. \u2018Jurisdiction, on the other hand, relates to the court\u2019s power to hear and determine a case on its merits.\u2019 <em>Craig </em>at *4.\u201d <em>State v. Sunday, </em>9th Dist. No. 22917, 2006-Ohio-2984, 2006 WL 1627375, at \u00b6 9. Venue signifies the geographic division by county where a case should be tried. <em>Wilson v. Brawn, </em>7th Dist. No. 01-BA-35, 2002-Ohio-2410, 2002 WL 1065973, at \u00b6 14; <em>Morrison </em>at 87. Venue is a procedural matter concerned with choosing a convenient forum and raises no jurisdictional implications. <em>Wilson. </em>Venue need not be proved in express terms so long as it is established by all the facts and circumstances in the case. <em>State v. Brothers </em>(Dec. 14, 2001), 11th Dist. No. 2000-T-0085, 2001 WL 1602692, *5; <em>State v. Headley </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 475, 477, 6 OBR 526, 453 N.E.2d 716.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">{\u00b6 26} The rule for venue in abuse cases filed in juvenile court is set forth at Juv.R. 10, as follows: \u201cAny person having knowledge of a child who appears to be * * * abused may file a complaint with respect to the child in the juvenile court of the county in which the child has a residence * * * or in which the * * * abuse occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">{\u00b6 27} Thus, the proper venue for an abuse case such as this is the county where the child resides or the county where the alleged abuse occurred. Here, the record establishes that Lake County is both the county of the child\u2019s residence and the county where the alleged abuse occurred. W.W. testified that he resides in Painesville, and McGuire testified that Carol\u2019s home, where W.W. resides, is located in Painesville in Lake County. The trial court erroneously limited its inquiry concerning venue to the municipality alleged in the complaint, finding that because the department alleged that the abuse occurred in the city of Painesville, the department was required to prove that it occurred there. However, because Painesville Township, where W.W. resides and the alleged abuse occurred, is also located in Lake County and venue is determined by county, we hold that the department met its burden to prove that the case was properly venued in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">{\u00b6 28} Second, the trial court erred in finding that because the department had failed to prove venue, the court did not have jurisdiction over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>matter. In making this finding, the trial court obviously confused venue and jurisdiction. As noted above, these terms denote two distinct legal concepts. The fact that a case may not have been filed in the correct county does not mean that the court lacks jurisdiction to hear the case. Thus, even if venue was not proper in Lake County, that does not mean that the trial court did not have jurisdiction over the matter. Pursuant to R.C. 2151.23(A)(1) and Juv.R. 11, the juvenile court has jurisdiction over any child who resides in Ohio and who is alleged to be abused. This case involved an allegation that W.W., a resident of Lake County, Ohio, was an abused child. As a result, the trial court had jurisdiction over this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">{\u00b6 29} We therefore hold that the trial court abused its discretion by dismissing the complaint for lack of venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">{\u00b6 30} For the reasons stated in the opinion of this court, it is the judgment and order of this court that the judgment of the Lake County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b697-8\">Grendell, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b697-9\">O\u2019Toole, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b697-10\">Colleen Mary O\u2019Toole, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A4y\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-11\">{\u00b6 31} I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-12\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cIt is well established that a judgment dismissing a case for improper venue is not a final appealable order.\u201d <em>Falls Elec. Contr., Inc., </em>2004-Ohio-6952, 2004 WL 2940950, at \u00b6 2, citing <em>State ex rel. Allied Chem. Co. v. Aurelius </em>(1984), 16 Ohio App.3d 69, 16 OBR 73, 474 N.E.2d 618; <em>Snell v. Cincinnati St. Ry. Co. </em>(1899), 60 Ohio St. 256, 54 N.E. 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-13\">{\u00b6 33} The instant case is governed by the juvenile rules rather than the Rules of Civil Procedure. When a juvenile court deals with the protection of a child from an abusive or dangerous situation not of the child\u2019s own making, it has continuing jurisdiction in order to allow for further dispositional orders in order to protect the child. <em>In re Cross, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 328, 2002-Ohio-4183, 774 N.E.2d 258, at \u00b6 16-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-14\">{\u00b6 34} Upon a thorough review of the record and the briefs, I believe that the trial court\u2019s November 9, 2009 judgment entry, granting the motion to dismiss Carol\u2019s complaint for lack of venue, is not a final, appealable order. The agency can merely refile the complaint with the correct information contained within so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>there is no discrepancy as to the complaint and the testimony due to the continuing jurisdiction of the juvenile court. Thus, the agency has the ability to refile the complaint, and the dismissal for venue is without prejudice and not a final, appealable order. Therefore, I believe that the appeal should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">{\u00b6 35} For the foregoing reasons, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
