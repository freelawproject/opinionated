On July 27, 2010, the magistrate issued a decision, a copy of which is attached to this decision as an appendix, recommending that we grant a writ directing the commission to vacate its order finding that relator is the correct employer and to enter a new order after conducting the proper analysis of all factors to be considered when determining the proper employer. The commission and Kokosing each filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">{\u00b6 3} On May 23, 2008, claimant, an Oakwood police officer, was injured while conducting traffic control at a construction site operated by Kokosing. Claimant was sitting in an Oakwood police cruiser when it was rear-ended by another vehicle. In the initial injury report, claimant named relator as his employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">{\u00b6 4} On June 2, 2008, the Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation (\u201cBWC\u201d) issued an order allowing the claim, naming relator, a state-fund employer, as the employer for purposes of the claim. On June 5, 2008, BWC issued another order stating that it had determined that relator was not the proper employer and that the claim would be placed instead against Kokosing, a self-insured employer. On June 6, 2008, BWC issued a third order stating that because Kokosing is a self-insured employer, BWC had no jurisdiction to make any determination regarding the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">{\u00b6 5} Kokosing refused to certify the claim, and the matter was referred to the commission for adjudication. After an October 1, 2008 hearing, a district hearing officer (\u201cDHO\u201d) issued an order allowing the claim and naming Kokosing as the employer. After a December 8, 2008 hearing, a staff hearing officer (\u201cSHO\u201d) issued an order vacating the DHO\u2019s order, finding that relator was the correct employer. The SHO cited evidence that relator had directed Kokosing to use relator\u2019s police officers for traffic control at the construction site, instead of Kokosing\u2019s following its usual practice of using Ohio State Highway Patrol officers for traffic control; Oakwood Police Sergeant Biggam identified claimant as an appropriate officer to perform the traffic-control duties and arranged for claimant\u2019s use of an Oakwood police cruiser while performing those duties; and claimant wore his police uniform while performing the duties. The SHO concluded that if claimant had not been an Oakwood police officer, he would not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>been present at the time of the injury giving rise to his claim, thus making relator the proper employer for purposes of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">{\u00b6 6} In the first part of his decision, the magistrate discusses at some length the issue of whether identification of the proper employer for a claim is properly the subject of a mandamus action or whether mandamus is not a proper remedy in such cases because a de novo appeal filed under R.C. 4123.512 provides a plain and adequate remedy. The magistrate concluded that the mandamus action here is not barred by the existence of a plain and adequate remedy under R.C. 4123.512 and proceeded to consider the merits of the mandamus claim. None of the parties has taken issue with that portion of the magistrate\u2019s decision, and, finding no error, we adopt that portion of the magistrate\u2019s decision as our own.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">{\u00b6 7} Regarding the merits of the claim, the magistrate considered the decision rendered by the Second District Court of Appeals in <em>Cooper v. Dayton </em>(1997), 120 Ohio App.3d 34, 696 N.E.2d 640. That case involved a dispute regarding the proper employer for workers\u2019 compensation purposes for a police officer injured while serving as a special duty officer at a grocery store. In determining what entity was the proper employer, the court set forth a \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test that included three specific circumstances: \u201c \u2018(1) the proximity of the scene of the accident to the place of employment, (2) the degree of control the employer had over the scene of the accident, and (3) the benefit the employer received from the injured employee\u2019s presence at the scene of the accident.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 41, quoting <em>Lord v. Daugherty </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 441, 444, 20 O.O.3d 376, 423 N.E.2d 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">(\u00b6 8} The magistrate concluded that while it included some analysis relevant to the issue, the SHO\u2019s order neither mentioned the totality-of-the-circumstances test nor addressed any of the three factors identified in <em>Cooper </em>and <em>Lord. </em>Thus, the magistrate concluded that a writ of mandamus should be issued directing it to <em>vacate </em>its order determining relator to be the proper employer and to then issue an amended order specifically addressing the three <em>Cooper-Lord </em>factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">{\u00b6 9} The commission and Kokosing each filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision. Both parties argue that the SHO\u2019s order did consider the totality of the circumstances in determining that relator was the proper employer and that the commission was not required to address each of the specific factors in reaching its decision. Additionally, both parties argue that because the SHO order cited some evidence in support of its conclusion and explained the reasoning for finding relator to be the proper employer for purposes of the industrial claim at issue here, the commission cannot be said to have abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">{\u00b6 10} We agree with the objections made by the parties. There is no exhaustive list of factors to be used when determining whether an injury was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>incurred in the course of, and arose from, a claimant\u2019s employment and thus is compensable under the workers\u2019 compensation system. <em>Fisher v. Mayfield </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 275, 551 N.E.2d 1271. We believe that this principle applies in cases such as this one, in which the issue is the identification of the proper employer. The three factors identified in <em>Lord </em>and <em>Cooper, </em>while helpful to making this determination, are not exhaustive, and we do not believe that the commission must be required to apply the factors in every case in which the identity of the correct employer is uncertain.</p>\n<p id=\"AAJ\">{\u00b6 11} In this case, the SHO did not specifically refer to the totality-of-the-circumstances test. However, a reading of the SHO\u2019s order shows that consideration was given to the circumstances regarding claimant\u2019s performance of traffic control. Specifically, the SHO cited the facts that claimant was selected for the traffic-control duty by virtue of his employment with the Oakwood Police Department, that claimant was provided an Oakwood police cruiser to sit in while performing this duty, and that claimant wore his Oakwood police uniform while performing traffic control. The SHO concluded that these facts were sufficient to establish that but for claimant\u2019s employment by the Oakwood Police Department, he would not have been present at the scene of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">{\u00b6 12} The facts cited by the SHO constituted some evidence to support the conclusion that relator was the proper employer for purposes of claimant\u2019s industrial claim. Thus, the commission did not abuse its discretion when it issued its order making that finding. Consequently, relator has not shown that it is entitled to the requested writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">{\u00b6 13} Accordingly, we adopt that part of the magistrate\u2019s decision concluding that an action seeking a writ of mandamus was not barred by the existence of a plain and adequate remedy at law, but reject that part of the magistrate\u2019s decision recommending that we issue a writ of mandamus directing the commission to vacate its order and to issue a new order after making additional findings. Accordingly, the objections filed by the commission and Kokosing are sustained, and relator\u2019s request for a writ of mandamus is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">Objections sustained; and writ of mandamus denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b729-10\">McGrath and Connor, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b729-11\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b729-12\">IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF OHIO</p>\n<p id=\"b729-13\">TENTH APPELLATE DISTRICT</p>\n<p id=\"AHY\">State ex rel.

On May 23, 2008, claimant-respondent Craig Ali, an Oakwood police officer, was injured while performing traffic control at a highway construction site operated by Kokosing. On that date, an Oakwood police cruiser in which claimant was sitting was rear-ended by another vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-16\">{\u00b6 16} 2. On the \u201cFirst Report of an Injury, Occupational Disease or Death\u201d form, claimant named the Oakwood Police Department as his employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-17\">{\u00b6 17} 3. On June 2, 2008, the Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation mailed a letter or order to claimant informing him that the claim was allowed. The letter/order listed \u201cOakwood Village\u201d as the employer. Oakwood is a state-fund employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-18\">{\u00b6 18} 4. On June 5, 2008, the bureau mailed another letter/order to claimant and Oakwood, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-19\">We have established that charges for the above claim number were applied to your risk account in error Oakwood Village risk 31815803-0. These charges were removed from your policy number and placed against the correct employer Kokosing Construction Co.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>{\u00b6 19} 5. On June 6, 2008, the bureau mailed yet another letter/order. This letter/order was apparently mailed to claimant and Kokosing, which is a self-insured employer. The letter/order states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-5\">The previous BWC order dated 06/03/2008 [sic], is being vacated due to the claim above being assigned to the incorrect employer\u2019s BWC risk policy in error. The correct employer is Self Insured, meaning the employer is responsible for the management of their Workers\u2019] Compensation claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-6\">Therefore!,] BWC does not have the jurisdiction to make determination regarding your claim. Please contact your employer with any questions pertaining to your claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">This decision is based on:</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">BWC guidelines for Self Insured employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">{\u00b6 20} 6. On June 16, 2008, Kokosing refused to certify the industrial claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">{\u00b6 21} 7. On June 30, 2008, the bureau mailed notice to claimant and Kokosing that the industrial claim was being referred to the commission for adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-11\">{\u00b6 22} 8. Following an October 1, 2008 hearing, a DHO issued an order allowing the claim and naming Kokosing as the employer. The DHO\u2019s order explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-12\">[T]he Injured Worker sustained an injury in the course of and arising out of employment described as follows: Injured Worker was working traffic control when his vehicle was struck by a second motor vehicle. Injured Worker is specifically found to have been an employee of Kokosing Construction Company, Inc. at the time of the incident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-13\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-14\">Injured Worker described being paid by Kokosing Construction via cheek with their name on it, assigned to his work by them, and directed as to his duties by them. Although Injured Worker wore his Oakwood Village police officer uniform and sat in the Village cruiser, the Oakwood Village Lav/ Director testified that Kokosing leased the vehicle for the duration of the Injured Worker\u2019s need of it. Examining the totality of the circumstances persuades the Hearing Officer that Kokosing Construction Company, Inc. was the Injured Worker\u2019s employer on the date of injury in this claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-15\">{\u00b6 23} 9. Kokosing administratively appealed the DHO\u2019s order of October 1, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-16\">{\u00b6 24} 10. Following a December 8, 2008 hearing, an SHO issued an order that vacates the DHO\u2019s order of October 1, 2008. The SHO\u2019s order finds that the correct employer is Oakwood, rather than Kokosing. The SHO\u2019s order explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>The Staff Hearing Officer finds that claimant was injured while working traffic control on 05/23/2008 when his police cruiser was struck by another vehicle. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-5\">The Staff Hearing Officer finds that the correct employer herein is Oakwood Village and not Kokosing Construction. Per the unrefuted testimony of Kokosing supervisor Mr. Schloss, Kokosing Construction was directed by Sergeant Biggam of the Oakwood Village Police Department to utilize Oak-wood Village police officers for traffic control duties within the geographic boundaries of Oakwood Village and to not follow Kokosing\u2019s usual practice of using Ohio State Highway Patrol officers for such duties. Sergeant Biggam identified claimant as an officer appropriate for such duty and arranged for claimant\u2019s use of an Oakwood village police cruiser during his activities relative to traffic control at the Kokosing Construction job site. Claimant wore his Oakwood Village police uniform and was at the site of the accident for purposes of maintaining traffic control, an activity not performed by Kokosing Construction. Claimant would not have been engaged in traffic control functions on 05/23/2008 were he not an Oakwood Village police officer, in uniform and in a police cruiser, having been specifically authorized to engage in such activity by his usual employer, Sergeant Biggam/Oakwood Village.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-6\">{\u00b6 25} 11. On January 29, 2009, another SHO mailed an order refusing relator\u2019s administrative appeal from the SHO\u2019s order of December 8, 2008.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">{\u00b6 26} 12. On October 26, 2009, Oakwood filed this mandamus action. Conclusions of Law:</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">{\u00b6 27} It is the magistrate\u2019s decision that this court issue a writ of mandamus, as more fully explained below.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">{\u00b6 28} At the outset, the magistrate notes that respondents have not taken issue with the following legal proposition set forth by relator in its brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-10\">An issue regarding who the proper employer should be is an issue to be decided in a mandamus proceeding, not an appeal de novo under R.C. 4123.512. <em>State, ex rel. Ross, v. Industrial Commission </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 364[, 703 N.E.2d 1276].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-11\">{\u00b6 29} Mandamus will not issue where the relator has a plain and adequate remedy at law. <em>State ex rel. Berger v. McMonagle </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 28[, 6 O.B.R. 50, 451 N.E.2d 225]. Accordingly, the availability of an appeal to a court of common pleas pursuant to R.C. 4123.512 can bar a mandamus action.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-12\">{\u00b6 30} In <em>State ex rel. Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. v. Indus. Comm., </em>10th Dist. No. 06AP-175, 2007-Ohio-2728[, 2007 WL 1600511], this court had occasion to succinctly summarize current law regarding the availability of an appeal pursuant to R.C. 4123.512:</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>The Supreme Court of Ohio has narrowly construed R.C. 4123.512 to permit appeal to a common pleas court of only those decisions involving the right of claimant to participate or continue to participate in the workers\u2019 compensation system. Indeed, in <em>Afrates v. Lorain </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 22[, 584 N.E.2d 1175], the court held that \u201c[o]nly those decisions reviewable pursuant to R.C. 4123.519 [now 4123.512(A)] are those decisions involving a claimant\u2019s right to participate or to continue to participate in the fund.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The court reiterated the rationale of <em>Afrates </em>in <em>Felty v. AT &amp; T Tech., Inc. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 234[, 602 N.E.2d 1141], stating, \u201c[a] decision by the commission determines the employee\u2019s right to participate if it finalizes the allowance or disallowance of an employee\u2019s \u2018claim.\u2019 The only action by the commission that is appealable under R.C. 4123.519 [now R.C. 4123.512] is this essential decision to grant, to deny, or to terminate the employee\u2019s participation or continued participation in the system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 239[, 602 N.E.2d 1141],</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">In <em>State ex rel. Liposchak v. Indus. Comm. </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 276[, 737 N.E.2d 519], the court clearly delineated the issues that are appealable under R.C. 4123.52, stating, \u201c[t]he only right-to-participate question that is appealable is whether an employee\u2019s injury, disease, or death occurred in the course of and arising out of his or her employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 279[, 737 N.E.2d 519]. The court further stated: \u201cThus, under our most recent precedent, any issue other than whether the injury, disease, or death resulted from employment does not constitute a right-to-participate issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 280[, 737 N.E.2d 519]. The court concluded, \u201cwe refuse to obscure the rule that R.C. 4123.512 permits only those appeals that concern whether the employee\u2019s injury, disease, or death occurred in the course of and arising out of his or her employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 281[, 737 N.E.2d 519],</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Id. at \u00b6 15-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">{\u00b6 31} In <em>State ex rel. Abex Corp./Electro Alloys Div. v. Indus. Comm., </em>10th Dist. No. 04AP-1097, 2005-Ohio-6960[, 2005 WL 3550996], this court had occasion to set forth law pertinent to the legal proposition set forth by relator in his brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-9\">The only question properly on appeal under 4123.512 is whether claimant has the right to participate, or continue to participate, in the fund. R.C. 4123.512(D). As relator points out in its first objection, Ohio courts have held that, where one or more of multiple employers may be liable, the question of which employer is to be charged is not subject to appeal. As the Ohio Supreme Court stated in <em>State ex rel. Burnett v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 266, 267[, 6 O.B.R. 332], 452 N.E.2d 1341, \u201c[t]he right at issue in the appeal is the right to participate in the state fund and not a claim directed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>against a particular employer.\u201d Thus, a court of common pleas has no jurisdiction to determine liability among or between employers. See also <em>Karlowicz v. Die-Matic Corp. </em>(Oct. 12, 1995), Cuyahoga App. No. 68563[, 1995 WL 601071] (\u201c[t]he decision that one employer rather than another employer is the employer for worker\u2019s compensation purposes does not involve the claimant\u2019s right to participate in the fund\u201d); <em>Dunbar Mechanical, Inc. v. Bradford </em>(Dec. 17, 1993), Lucas App. No. L-93-002[, 1993 WL 553605] (\u201ca common pleas court has <em>no </em>jurisdiction on appeal to review questions regarding allocation of liability among a worker\u2019s former employers for workers\u2019 compensation benefits paid to the employee\u201d), citing <em>Moore v. National Castings, Inc. </em>(Sept. 3, 1993), Lucas App. No. L-92-331[, 1993 WL 332332]; <em>Bogin v. IRC Fibers Co. </em>[(1991)], 72 Ohio App.3d 1, 6, 593 N.E.2d 405 (\u201cthe question as to which employer is to be charged is not a question appropriate for an appeal\u201d); <em>City of Youngstown v. DeSalle </em>(June 23, 1987), Mahoning App. No. 86 C.A. 177[, 1987 WL 13259] (affirming trial court\u2019s dismissal of appeal, finding that question as to the employer to be charged was not an appropriate question for appeal). In <em>State ex rel. Ross v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 364, 368, 703 N.E.2d 1276, the court explained that \u201c[t]he decision in <em>Burnett </em>was indeed about decedent\u2019s right to participate. He had not proved causation as to any particular employer, according to the commission.\u201d Therefore, an appeal was appropriate in <em>Burnett. </em>In contrast, the question in <em>Ross </em>was one of successor liability as between two companies. Therefore, mandamus was the appropriate remedy. See, also, <em>State ex rel. Liposchak v. Indus. Comm. </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 276, 280, 737 N.E.2d 519 (\u201c[a]ccording to <em>Ross II, </em>the identity of the responsible employer\u2019s identity can only be challenged in mandamus\u201d). * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"asd-dedup-0\">Id. at \u00b6 15-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">{\u00b6 32} Given the above authorities, the magistrate shall proceed with this mandamus action under the proposition relator asserts \u2014 -that this action is not barred by a plain and adequate remedy under R.C. 4123.512.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">{\u00b6 33} Given the above analysis, the issue here is whether the commission abused its discretion in determining that Oakwood is the correct employer rather than Kokosing.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">{\u00b6 34} <em>Cooper v. Dayton </em>(1997), 120 Ohio App.3d 34[, 696 N.E.2d 640], a case cited by respondents, is instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">{\u00b6 35} In <em>Cooper, </em>the city of Dayton appealed from an October 1996 decision of the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas that had granted summary judgment in favor of Kevin B. Cooper, a Dayton police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">{\u00b6 36} The appeal in <em>Cooper </em>stemmed from an injury Cooper sustained on December 2, 1994, while attempting to stop a shoplifter outside a Groceryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>Store. Cooper was out of uniform and off duty, working as a loss-prevention specialist at the store. He had obtained the part-time security work from a fellow police officer, John D. Pawelski, who acted as an independent contractor supplying the grocery store with off-duty officers to prevent shoplifting. Pawel-ski\u2019s work for Groceryland was conducted on his own time and was unrelated to his work as a police officer. The work consisted primarily of scheduling off-duty officers for morning or afternoon shifts at the store, recording the officers\u2019 hours worked, and billing Groceryland for the security work.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">{\u00b6 37} While working as a security specialist on December 2, 1994, Cooper observed a shopper stealing meat. Cooper followed the shopper outside into the parking lot, and the shopper entered a vehicle driven by a second person. The two suspects then attempted to leave. In response, Cooper drew his service revolver, identified himself as a police officer, displayed his badge, and ordered the suspects to place their hands in the air. Rather than complying, the two suspects sped toward Cooper, who jumped onto the car\u2019s hood. The driver then braked hard in front of the store at Troy and Stanley streets, causing Cooper to be thrown to the pavement. As a result of the incident, Cooper suffered lacerations, abrasions, a contusion to the knee, and a tibial fracture.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">{\u00b6 38} Following his injury, Cooper filed an application for workers\u2019 compensation benefits with the bureau, identifying the city of Dayton as his employer and listing his occupation as \u201cpolice officer.\u201d The bureau then allowed the claim against the city. A DHO and SHO denied appeals, and the commission refused to hear the city\u2019s appeal from the SHO\u2019s order. Subsequently, the city filed an appeal in the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">{\u00b6 39} In <em>Cooper, </em>the Court of Appeals applied a \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test, which the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-8\">We begin our resolution of the city\u2019s argument with a brief review of the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Lord v. Daugherty </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 441[, 20 O.O.3d 376], 423 N.E.2d 96] and <em>Fisher </em>[v. <em>Mayfield </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 275, 551 N.E.2d 1271] opinions. In those two cases, the court attempted to clarify R.C. 4123.01(C), which authorizes workers\u2019 compensation coverage for any injury \u201creceived in the course of, and arising out of, the injured employee\u2019s employment.\u201d In <em>Fisher, </em>the court first recognized the historical significance of the phrases \u201cin the course of\u2019 and \u201carising out of,\u201d stating:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-9\">\u201cOhio\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation statute, as do those of the vast majority of states, contains the basic coverage formula: \u2018in the course of, and arising out of,\u2019 employment. A leading scholar in this area of the law, Professor Larson, has noted that \u2018[t]he heart of every compensation act, and the source of most litigation in the compensation field, is the coverage formula. * * * New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>groups of statutory words in the history of law have had to bear the weight of such a mountain of interpretation as has been heaped upon this slender foundation. * * *\u2019 1 Larson, The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation (1984) 3-1 to 3-3, Section 6.10.\u201d <em>Fisher, supra, </em>49 Ohio St.3d at 276, 551 N.E.2d at 1273.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-5\">The significance of the two phrases stems from the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s long-standing recognition that \u201c[a]n injury sustained by an employee is compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act only if it was \u2018received in the course of, and arising out of, the injured employee\u2019s employment.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 276, 551 N.E.2d at 1273; <em>Bralley v. Daugherty </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 302, 303, 15 O.O.3d 359, 360, 401 N.E.2d 448, 449.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-6\">In <em>Lord v. Daugherty, supra, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court addressed the \u201carising out of\u2019 element, finding that the phrase imposed a causal-connection requirement. The court then applied a \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test to determine the existence of a causal connection between an employee\u2019s injury and his employment:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-7\">\u201c[W]hether there is a sufficient \u2018causal connection\u2019 to justify the injured party\u2019s right to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund depends upon the \u2018totality of the facts and circumstances\u2019 regarding the accident. Such circumstances include: (1) the proximity of the scene of the accident to the place of employment, (2) the degree of control the employer had over the scene of the accident, and (3) the benefit the employer received from the injured employee\u2019s presence at the scene of the accident.\u201d <em>Lord, supra, </em>66 Ohio St.2d at 444, 20 O.O.3d at 378, 423 N.E.2d at 98.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-8\">The <em>Fisher </em>court explained, however, that the foregoing factors are \u201cillustrative\u201d rather than \u201cexhaustive.\u201d <em>Fisher, supra, </em>49 Ohio St.3d at 279, 551 N.E.2d at 1275, fn. 2. Concerning the \u201cin the course of\u2019 element, the <em>Fisher </em>court interpreted the phrase as relating to the time, place, and circumstances of the injury. Id. at 277, 551 N.E.2d at 1274. The court also recognized the \u201cconjunctive nature of the coverage formula \u2018in the course of and arising out of the employment.\u201d Id.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-9\"><em>Cooper, </em>120 Ohio App.3d at 40-41[, 696 N.E.2d 640],</p>\n<p id=\"b736-10\">{\u00b6 40} <em>Cooper </em>then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-11\">After reviewing the record and the foregoing criteria, we conclude that Cooper acted \u201cin the course of\u2019 his city employment and that the injury \u201carose out of\u2019 that employment. In reaching this conclusion, we first acknowledge that the <em>Lord-Fisher </em>analysis works best when an employee holds only one job and the sole issue is whether the employee\u2019s injury stemmed from his employment. In the present case, however, Cooper worked full-time as a police officer and moonlighted as a loss-prevention specialist. The two jobs admittedly share some similar characteristics. Nevertheless, after applying the appro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>priate factors and considering the totality of the circumstances, we find Cooper\u2019s injury more closely related to his city employment than his Grocery-land work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Id. at 44, 696 N.E.2d 640.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">{\u00b6 41} Examining the SHO\u2019s order of December 8, 2008, we do not see that the SHO applied the three factors of the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test. The SHO\u2019s order does not mention the totality-of-the-circumstances test, nor does the order identify any of the three factors of the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">{\u00b6 42} In reaching his conclusion that Oakwood, rather than Kokosing, is the employer, the SHO points to the unrecorded testimony of a Mr. Schloss, a Kokosing supervisor, that Kokosing was directed by a Sergeant Biggam of the Oakwood Police Department to use Oakwood police officers for traffic control rather than Ohio State Highway Patrol officers. Sergeant Biggam identified claimant as an officer appropriate for the duty and arranged for claimant\u2019s use of an Oakwood cruiser. Claimant was wearing his Oakwood uniform while maintaining traffic control at the Kokosing construction site. The SHO further points out that claimant would not have been present at the accident had he not been an Oakwood officer in uniform with an Oakwood cruiser.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-10\">{\u00b6 43} While the SHO\u2019s order provides some relevant analysis, it is clear that the order fails to analyze all the factors of the totality of the circumstances test. It is clear that the SHO\u2019s order fails to analyze the benefits that either Oakwood and/or Kokosing may have received from claimant\u2019s presence at the injury scene. The order also seems to ignore the degree of control that Oakwood and Kokosing may have had at the construction site. The proximity factor is likewise ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-11\">{\u00b6 44} Given the apparent failure of the commission, through its SHO, to perform an analysis under the totality-of-the circumstances test, the magistrate decides that this court should issue a writ of mandamus ordering the commission to vacate that portion of its SHO\u2019s order of December 8, 2008 that determines relator to be the correct employer, and in a manner consistent with this magistrate\u2019s decision, enter an amended order that sets forth an analysis under the totality-of-the circumstances test.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-12\"><em>/S/ Kenneth W.
