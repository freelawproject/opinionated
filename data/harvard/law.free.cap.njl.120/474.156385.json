Grosman.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b520-11\">For the defendant, <em>Franklin J. Marryott.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b520-12\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b520-13\">Heher, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0v\">The present controversy relates to the <em>quantum </em>of permanent disability consequent upon prosecutor\u2019s conceded disfigurement as such, suffered by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment. <em>Pamph. L. </em>1911, <em>pp. </em>134, 763; <em>Rev. Stat. </em>1937, 34:15-1, <em>et seq. </em>The cause has been remanded for determination of the question by this court in the exercise of its fact-finding authority. 119 <em>N. J. L. </em>108.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-14\">The compensation bureau appraised this particular incapacity at thirty per cent, of total. Deputy Commissioner Stahl found it to be \u201ca very serious disfigurement,\u201d and that prosecutor\u2019s \u201cemployment in general is seriously affected and reduced at least * * * from thirty to fifty per cent.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>The Essex Common Tleas estimated the ensuing disability at ten per cent, of total. 14 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>270. The judge found the scars \u201cto be lengthy, lumpy and repellan!but he concluded that, inasmuch as \u201ca separate award\u201d had \u201calready been made for the functional effect of such disfigurement, and that the highest award previously made by the courts of this state, for disfigurement <em>per se\u201d </em>had been fifteen per cent., the allowance in the instant case should be reduced to ten per cent, of total. And counsel for the defendant employer argues that \u201can award of ten per cent, is not only supported by various adjudications (in other jurisdictions), but will fix a reasonable and logical standard, even though that standard is arbitrarily arrived at, for other courts to follow.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">But to permit awards in other cases to serve as the basis for an arbitrary maximum would plainly frustrate the spirit and policy of the compensation statute. That would constitute a judicial usurpation of the legislative function. It is a mere truism to say that the courts are under a duty to apply the standard laid down in the statute, <em>i. e., </em>the actual disability ensuing from the particular compensable injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Turning now to the proofs, the physicians, as is so often the case, differed sharply in gauging the incapacity flowing from this conceded permanent injury. One of prosecutor\u2019s medical witnesses, inquiring \u201cwho is going to hire him?\u201d fixed his disability at seventy-five per cent. Another physician called by him termed his appearance \u201chideous.\u201d He said that the facial keloids \u201care so monstrous\u201d as to render it \u201cvery difficult\u201d for him to find employment. He continued: \u201cIt is more than the ordinary scarring that you see, and the impression that a layman would get from such a condition would be, he probably would have some terrible skin disease or something of that sort, and I say the nearest thing I have seen that looks like it from that standpoint is a healed leprosy. * * * I think it is great enough and hideous enough and deforming enough to hinder his chances of getting employment such as he may have been able to get before he got this disfigurement.\u201d The employer\u2019s medical witnesses estimated the disability at ten per cent, of total. Yet it is conceded that the disfigurement is of such a degree as to permanently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>incapacitate him from the pursuit of emplojunents requiring \u201ccontact with the general public.\u201d It was so stipulated in the bureau.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">Disability in the statutory sense is rarely, if ever, susceptible of precise admeasurement. Of course, the medical testimony is not conclusive. In a case such as this, the question is one peculiarly for the experienced judgment of the determinator of the facts, who is of necessity guided largely by his own observation of the disfigured employe. Under all the circumstances, we feel constrained to adopt the estimate made by the deputy commissioner as one calculated to sub-serve the essential statutory policy as expounded by our court of last resort in the case under review. 119 <em>N. J. L. </em>108. Disfigurement that unfits the victim for \u201ccontact with the general public\u201d is grievous indeed. Considering the policy of the statute to compensate for the loss ensuing \u201cfrom personal injury which detracts from the \u2018former efficiency\u2019 of the workman\u2019s \u2018body or its members in the ordinary pursuits of life,\u2019 \u201d in relation to the field of service to which prosecutor is suited, we regard the judgment of the bureau as unassailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">The judgment of the Essex Common Pleas is accordingly reversed, and the judgment of the compensation bureau affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
