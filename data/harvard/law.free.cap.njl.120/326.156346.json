J. L. </em>272. But instead of so doing, after a colloquy between the court and counsel, the court said, \u201cwell, I do not think in view of the fact that the jury will have the indictment before them in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>jury room, and I have instructed them, that they will be misled by that proposition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">It seems to us that that was not an adequate answer to the request. The mere fact that the jury had the indictment before them in the jury room was an insufficient basis upon which to assert that the jurymen would know to what extent their consideration of the facts testified to would be limited by the indictment, for that was a matter of law, and we think that the failure so to charge was harmful error.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Secondly: Defendant complains that the trial court erred in refusing to charge defendant\u2019s request as follows: \u201cYou are instructed that the mere failure of Gregory to pay over to his client, Wilson, the money in his, Gregory\u2019s hands, at a certain time, did not of itself constitute the offense of embezzlement,\u201d and complains also as to what the court said in response to that request.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Now we think that there was harmful error. We think .that request was proper and should have been charged. <em>State </em>v. <em>Temple, </em>63 <em>N. J. L. </em>375. Instead of charging it the court denied the request and in its place charged the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-7\">\u201cSo the question presented itself to him [defendant] \u2018whose part of this money is going to be collected first, my client\u2019s part or my part.\u2019 In other words, his interest did not coincide with his client\u2019s. Now, to whom did he give preference? When a lawyer finds out that his interests do not coincide with his client, what is his duty? Is it his duty to go to his client and say to his client, these are the facts: I have put this check in Mr. Smith\u2019s hands and I cannot get the money; your money and my money is in there; I want my money and you want your money. If he is going out to get his money first, should he or should he not say to his client, you better try to get another lawyer to try to get your money, because I am going after mine? Did he do anything like that? 1 asked him questions on that subject and you probably remember it. He was collecting money. His part, we will say, or what we consider his part, and he took it all. He never went near Ms client. He did not go near his client and say \u2018I am collecting this money. We are in the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>boat. I have collected X dollars. Here is a part that comes to you and a part that comes to me.\u2019 He did not do anything. He took it all himself. Now, I call your attention to that because it has a bearing upon the question of whether or not Mr. Gregory was acting in good faith in the way he handled this transaction, as he claimed he was. Was he playing the part, gentlemen, of a lawyer performing his duty by his client? You may consider whether he was or not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">The evidence tended to show that, as a matter of fact, the defendant did \u201cgo near his client\u201d several times, and did explain the delay, and offered $300 which was refused and he was told not to return, although defendant explained he would, within a \u201ccouple of days\u201d return and make full settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Moreover the language of the instruction was not a legal substitute for the language of the request, since it conveyed to the jury just the opposite conclusion to that intended by the request. Certainly mere delay on Smith\u2019s part, or the mere neglect and failure to pay, could not under the statute create criminal responsibility on the part of the defendant. The instruction seems to ignore defendant\u2019s contention that he had a lien upon the money for his services and was not obliged to split each payment into parts, reserving to himself one part and giving the other part to his client, and yet, from the judge\u2019s remarks, it would seem that the defendant was held to a legal accountability which was unwarranted, for until the point was reached that the defendant intentionally converted money to which he was not entitled, he could not have been held to have committed embezzlement. It also seems that under the judge\u2019s instructions he left it open to the jury to find the defendant guilty, if they concluded that as a lawyer he had not performed his duty by his client. The real question in the case was whether he fraudulently converted to his own use moneys of his client, and that of course depended on the intent of the defendant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Temple, </em>63 <em>N. J. L. </em>375.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">We therefore conclude that there must be a reversal and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded, and it is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
