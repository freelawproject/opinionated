L., p. </em>169. The first point raised is that the Court of Common Pleas was without jurisdiction because the respondent was not removed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>from office or employment. The argument is that one is removed from office only when he is deprived of any office or employment, and that reduction in rank or demotion is not a removal from office.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">But the decisions of this court seem to leave no doubt that a transfer, without the consent of the incumbent, from one position to one of less dignity, at a lower rate of compensation, is a removal from office. <em>Michaelis </em>v. <em>Board of Fire </em>Commissioners, 49 <em>N. J. L. </em>154; <em>Leary </em>v. <em>Mayor of </em>Orange, 59 <em>Id. </em>350; <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Van </em>Winkle, 76 <em>Id. </em>443; <em>Harrington </em>v. Carteret, 1 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>167.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">So that it seems clear that the act relied upon conferred jurisdiction on the Court of Common Pleas to hear the case <em>de novo </em>and make such order as the court concluded was proper and just in the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">A trial was had in the Common Pleas and the trial judge concluded that there was not sufficient evidence to justify a finding that respondent was guilty of willfully and intentionally leaving the scene of the accident in violation of his duty under the law, and further concluded that respondent was removed from his automobile in a state of shock and put in another car to be taken to a hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">A review of the evidence persuades us that the finding of the trial judge was amply justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">The writ is dismissed, but without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
