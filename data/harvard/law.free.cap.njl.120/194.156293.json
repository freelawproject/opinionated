The matter was then presented to the board of adjustment, created by the municipal zoning ordinance, who, after public hearing had on notice to the parties in interest, \u201crecommended\u201d the issuance of the permit to the township committee. That body, by resolution adopted at a regular meeting held on March 5th, 1937, \u201capproved\u201d the \u201capplication,\u201d and directed the building inspector to issue a permit in accordance therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Pursuant to the power conferred by chapter 274 of the laws of 1928 <em>(Pamph. L. </em>1928, <em>p. </em>696; <em>Rev. Stat. </em>1937, 40:55-30 <em>et seq.), </em>the municipal governing body, on June 6th, 1930, adopted the zoning ordinance; and it was therein provided [section 5, subdivisions (1) and (m)] that, since \u201cgasoline or oil stations, automobile filling and cleaning stations and public garages,\u201d while necessary, \u201cmay be inimical to the public safety and general welfare if located without due consideration of conditions and surroundings,\u201d no permit therefor shall be issued \u201cexcept upon application first made to the board of adjustment,\u201d who is directed to hear the same \u201cin the same manner and under the same procedure as the board of adjustment is empowered by law and ordinance to hear cases and make exceptions to the provisions of a zoning ordinance,\u201d and empowered to \u201crecommend in writing to the township committee that a permit\u201d for such use be granted, if, in its judgment, it \u201cwill not be detrimental to the health, safety and general welfare of the community, and is reasonably necessary for the convenience of the community;\u201d pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>vided that no permit for \u201cconstruction or use as a gasoline or oil station, automobile filling or cleaning station or public garage shall be given in a residential zone or district.\u201d The premises in question are located in a district zoned for business.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">The primary question for decision is whether the provisions of subdivisions (1) and (m) of section 5 of the ordinance, in so far as they specially classify automobile service stations and public garages, constitute a valid exercise of municipal power.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Of necessity, the factor of safety in several of its aspects, as well as the public convenience, enters largely into the determination of the location and the physical characteristics of these service stations. Reasonable regulation as respects such land uses, guided by these considerations, is therefore embraced within the police power. See <em>Hirschorn </em>v. <em>Castles, </em>113 <em>N. J. L. </em>277; <em>Bashlow </em>v. <em>City Council of Clifton, </em>118 <em>Id. </em>390; <em>Meslar </em>v. <em>Township Committee of Denville, </em>14 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>497. As pointed out in <em>Phillips Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Municipal Council of Clifton, </em>120 <em>N. J. L. </em>13, section 5 of the Zoning act, <em>supra, </em>directs that zoning regulations shall be designed, <em>inter alia, </em>to obviate unnecessary traffic hazards; to \u201csecure safety from fire, panic and other dangers;\u201d and to subserve the \u201cgeneral welfare.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">It is not contended that there has been no sufficient delegation of this regulatory power to the township. The insistence is that these particular provisions \u201cdo not conform to the Zoning Act,\u201d in that the statutory delegation of power to the board of adjustment (section 9 of the Zoning Act, <em>supra) </em>does not, in terms, include the authority so exercised, and, on the principle that section 9 is to be strictly construed, they are <em>ultra vires </em>the municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">We do not yield the argument so made. Eairly construed, subdivision (4) of section 9 of the Zoning Act, <em>supra, </em>embraces the authority in question. We do not read it as confined to \u201cappeals\u201d in the strict technical sense. Certainly, the legislature did not contemplate the futile proceeding of an application to the building inspector or like authority for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>a permit to do a tiling prohibited by the zoning ordinance, and a denial, as prerequisites to the exercise by the board of adjustment of the jurisdiction so bestowed. If this subdivison be construed as limiting the jurisdiction of the board of adjustment to appeals in cases where the administrative officer has a duty to perform, it will have little or no practical significance. And, in the instant case, an application was in fact made to the building inspector; and his nonaction under the circumstances may reasonably be considered as the equivalent of a denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">Moreover, granting the power of the municipality, in the exercise of the zoning authority, to make such use the subject of special regulation \u2014 this is not questioned here \u2014 we perceive no objection to a procedural scheme that calls for the advisory opinion of the board of adjustment, based upon its experienced judgment, as a prerequisite to action by the governing body.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">But it is the prosecutor\u2019s further insistence that the board of adjustment, in exercising this function, was bound by all the procedural requirements of the Zoning Act, and that the instant proceeding is fatally deficient in the following particulars: (1) There was a failure of compliance with the statutory provision for notice of the hearing before the board, in that it was given to some of the affected resident landowners by registered mail, rather than by personaL service or \u201cby leaving a copy thereof at the usual place of abode\u201d of such party; (2) a \u201cproper majority\u201d of the board of adjustment \u201cdid not approve and recommend the application to the township committee,\u201d the point being that only two of the three members present at the hearing recommended that the application be granted, and that two members of the board so voting did not participate in the hearing; (3) that the board \u201cswore no witnesses and took no testimony,\u201d and made no \u201cfindings of fact on which to base its recommendation;\u201d and (4) that the board, in the conduct of the hearing and in the rendition of its judgment, acted in an arbitrary fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>As stated, the ordinance enjoins the board to \u201chear the application in the same manner and under the same procedure as\u201d it \u201cis empowered by law and ordinance to hear cases and make exceptions to the provisions of a zoning ordinance.\u201d And it is the established rule that such an inquiry, involving as it does the exercise of the police power, is judicial in nature; and the action of the board, in making or recommending a special exception, must therefore be made to rest upon legal evidence tending to establish facts justifying the action. <em>Somers </em>v. <em>Bradley Beach, </em>115 <em>N. J. L. </em>135; <em>Hendey </em>v. <em>Ackerman, </em>103 <em>Id. </em>305; <em>Fonda </em>v. <em>O\u2019Donohue, </em>109 <em>Id. </em>584; <em>Linden Methodist Episcopal Church </em>v. <em>Linden, </em>113 <em>Id. </em>188; <em>St. Mary\u2019s, &amp;c., Church </em>v. <em>Board of Adjustment of New Brunswick, </em>14 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>288; <em>Marvin </em>v. <em>Board of Adjustment of Westfield, </em>5 <em>Id. 668. </em>It was encumbent upon the board, in the performance of the duty delegated by the ordinance, to determine whether the proposed use would, in the circumstances, be \u201cinimical to the public safety and general welfare.\u201d That was the fundamental fact to be determined; and the ordinance charged the board with the duty of making the determination upon legal evidence in accordance with the requirement of section 9 of the Zoning Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">The ordinance was adopted some three years after the adjudication of the case of <em>Hendey </em>v. <em>Ackerman, supra; </em>and it is an entirely reasonable presumption that the governing body, by the provision referred to, designed that the board\u2019s function should be judicial rather than administrative, pursuant to the command of the zoning statute as construed in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">It is stipulated that the witnesses were not sworn; and the return discloses that the action under review was preceded by a discussion of \u201cthe testimony of property owners appearing at the public hearing\u201d held in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The case of <em>Amon </em>v. <em>Rahway, </em>117 <em>N. J. L. </em>589, is distinguishable from the line of cases last cited. There the action was not based upon the testimony of unsworn witnesses. The board \u201ctook the practical and .sensible method of examining the physical conditions on the ground;\u201d and it was observed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>that \u201cthe statute does not require that the sworn testimony of witnesses be taken.\u201d And it is to be borne in mind that the ordinance here lays down a specific standard for the guidance of the board of adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">Thus it is that the proceedings before the board of adjustment have no validity. Nor can the approving action of the governing body be made effective as an original exercise of an inherent power. The ordinance [section 5 (m)] explicitly provides that no permit for such use \u201cshall be issued except upon application first made to the board of adjustment and upon hearing as herein provided.\u201d See <em>Hirschorn </em>v. <em>Castles, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">It is therefore unnecessary to pass upon the other questions raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The proceedings are accordingly vacated, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
