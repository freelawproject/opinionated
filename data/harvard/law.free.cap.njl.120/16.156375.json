Stat. </em>1910, <em>p. </em>4873; <em>Pamph. L. </em>1929, <em>p. </em>57. He seeks a writ of <em>mandamus </em>commanding Ms reinstatement and the payment of salary for the intervening period.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">Concededly, he did not hold an office. His claim is that he was the holder of a \u201cposition\u201d within the intendment of the statute invoked. The question is not free of doubt. He entered the service of the prosecutor of the pleas on March 1st, 1925, as a \u201cspecial investigator;\u201d and it seems to be agreed that this was a mere temporary employment. But he maintains that on August 28th, 1933, he was \u201ctransferred or assigned to the duties of \u2018docket and indictment clerk\u2019 \u201d by an assistant attorney-general then in charge of the prosecutor\u2019s office \u2014 a status that continued until his dismissal \u2014 and that thereby his temporary employment was converted into a \u201cposition\u201d in the statutory sense. The fact is, however, that his classification as an \u201cinvestigator\u201d on the county\u2019s records continued without change. And we are not persuaded that the assignment of the new duties \u2014 not necessarily exclusive\u2014 served to create a new position and to change relator\u2019s status accordingly. Even though the prosecutor of the pleas so proceeded, his authority in the premises would be open to serious question. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Board of Chosen Freeholders, </em>110 <em>N. J. L. </em>9; <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Jersey City, </em>51 <em>Id. </em>240; <em>McLagh</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number><em>lin </em>v. <em>Jersey City, </em>51 <em>Id. </em>240; <em>State </em>v. <em>Weiler, </em>6 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>465. But we find it unnecessary to pursue the inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Relator is, it seems to us, indisputably guilty of laches. He instituted no proceeding for the enforcement of his asserted right until the filing of the petition herein on July 22d, 1937. While laches, in its legal signification, ordinarily connotes delay that works detriment to another, the public interest requires that the protection accorded by statutes of this class be invoked with reasonable promptitude. Inexcusable delay operates as an estoppel against the assertion of the right. It justifies the conclusion of acquiescence in the challenged action. This court has consistently frowned upon delays less glaring. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Bayonne, </em>57 <em>N. J. L. </em>376; <em>Glori </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>72 <em>Id. </em>131; <em>Drill </em>v. <em>Bowden, </em>4 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>326; <em>Oliver </em>v. <em>New Jersey State Highway Commission, </em>9 <em>Id. </em>186; <em>McMichael </em>v. <em>South Amboy, </em>14 <em>Id. </em>183.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">The claimed non-action of attorneys retained before relator\u2019s present attorney (who moved promptly) does not reasonably excuse the failure to proceed for nearly two years. In this connection, it is to be observed that relator did not consult counsel until January, 1936.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Moreover, the long delay was clearly disadvantageous to the municipality, in that reinstatement would entail liability for double compensation, to say nothing of the detriment that frequently flows from the uncertainty respecting the incumbent\u2019s status.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">We express no opinion on the propriety of <em>mandamus </em>as a remedy in the circumstances here presented. The question has not been mooted.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">The rule to show cause is accordingly discharged, but without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
