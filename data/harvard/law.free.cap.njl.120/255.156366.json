It appears that when the contract of letting was entered into, a pane of glass in one of the windows was split and that the defendants agreed to replace it, but failed to do so. That thereafter when the infant plaintiff who resided with his father was shutting the window the said pane of glass became shattered and cut his wrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">The plaintiffs below received a verdict, and from the judgment thereon the defendants below appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">It appears that upon application of the defendant a rule to show cause was granted why the judgment \u201cshould not be opened, vacated, set aside and discharged as having been improvidently entered, without jurisdiction <em>and without good and sufficient cause.\u201d </em>The rule further provided that the granting of the rule \u201cshall not be deemed or considered a waiver of any grounds for appeal existing in favor of the defendants or either of them.\u201d The rule was argued and duly discharged. The reasons now urged on appeal having been presented and considered below precludes this court from reviewing the questions under the doctrine of <em>res adjud\u00edcala </em>notwithstanding reservations of exceptions in the rule. <em>Cleary </em>v. <em>Camden, </em>119 <em>N.
