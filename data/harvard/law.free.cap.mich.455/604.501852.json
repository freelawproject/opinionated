MCL 15.361 <em>et </em>seq.; MSA 17.428(1) <em>et seq. </em>We find no abuse of discretion and affirm the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Defendant Catholic Social Services of Wayne County (css) is a nonprofit social service agency that provides a wide range of services.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff Shallal worked for css as an adoption department supervisor under a termination \u201cfor cause\u201d employment contract. This suit arises out of her claim against CSS for retaliatory discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">In late 1986, the css Board of Directors appointed defendant Thomas D. Quinn to the position of css president. Quinn\u2019s alleged lack of expertise prompted some members of the staff to write a letter to the board opposing the appointment. Despite the opposition, Quinn began his presidency in January 1987.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">Approximately one year into Quinn\u2019s tenure, allegations arose that Quinn was drinking on the job and misusing agency funds in violation of agency rules.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Shallal discussed the need to report to her supervisor and other staff members. She also discussed her concerns about Quinn\u2019s violations with an honorary CSS-Board Member, Mr. Ryan. Ryan suggested that Shallal report Quinn\u2019s violations to the board and to accrediting bodies, presumably in the dss. Shallal never took <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>action, however, because she feared that her job would be jeopardized.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">Before her employment with CSS was terminated, Shallal supervised the adoption of a baby, Ray Glover. Soon after the placement, Shallal learned that Ray\u2019s former foster mother had visited Ray and reported seeing bruises on his face, neck, and hands. In retrospect, it appears that Shallal should have reported the allegation to the dss. A case worker did check on Ray within thirty days of the allegation; however, no official action was taken, there being only minor scratches visible on Ray. Several weeks later, however, Ray was rushed to the hospital, nearly dead from \u201cshaken baby syndrome.\u201d Today, he remains in a chronic vegetative state with severe, permanent brain damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">When Shallal notified the DSS about Ray\u2019s injuries, it investigated and cited CSS with violations of several agency rules and regulations. It criticized Shallal for her inadequate response to the first report of abuse, her approval of an inadequate adoption home evaluation, and her failure to coordinate house visits. The DSS faulted Shallal for placing improper emphasis on race in the placement process. The report was equally critical of CSS, listing several institutional failures.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">As is their practice, DSS officials met with defendant Quinn before issuing a formal written report on April 19, 1991. They did not specifically recommend Shallai\u2019s dismissal. Shallal alleges that, in the past, comparable employee errors did not result in discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">After the meeting with DSS officials, Quinn called Shallal into his office. The ensuing discussion became heated. Shallal stated her intention to report Quinn\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>abuses of alcohol and agency funds if he failed to, in her words, \u201cstraighten up.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Quinn decided to discharge Shallal, citing the DSS report as support. He ordered Timothy Kluka, plaintiff\u2019s direct supervisor, to fire her. Kluka refused, feeling he had insufficient information to give as a reason to dismiss. He also believed Shallal\u2019s termination would have negative implications for the staff and the agency. Instead, Kluka resigned from his position that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">On April 24, 1991, Patrick Heron dismissed plaintiff for gross misconduct and negligence in supervising the adoption of Baby Ray. Quinn has since resigned from his position as president.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">Plaintiff filed this suit on July 22, 1991, alleging a breach of her employment contract and violation of the Whistleblowers\u2019 Protection Act. With respect to the latter claim, the trial court found that any threats plaintiff made to report Quinn were contingent on his continued violation. It also found no evidence plaintiff was \u201cabout to\u201d report a violation. It then granted summary disposition for defendants under MCR 2.116(C)(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">The Court of Appeals affirmed in a two-to-one decision.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It reasoned that the Whistleblowers\u2019 Protection Act requires a plaintiff to be \u201cnear to an action, near to the performance, or in readiness to report the alleged misconduct of defendant Quinn.\u201d Unpublished opinion per curiam, issued February 28, 1995 (Docket No. 155006), slip op at 1. The Court of Appeals found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>that plaintiff failed to satisfy the immediacy requirement, because her threat was contingent on the perpetuation of Quinn\u2019s alleged misconduct. The Court concluded as a matter of law that no reasonable person could have believed that plaintiff was about to report a violation for purposes of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-3\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">The party bringing a motion for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(10) bears the initial burden of supporting its position with affidavits, depositions, admissions, or other documentary evidence. <em>Quinto v Cross &amp; Peters Co, </em>451 Mich 358, 362; 547 NW2d 314 (1996). The burden then shifts to the nonmoving party to go beyond the pleadings to show the existence of a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">The trial court views affidavits and other documentary evidence supporting a (C)(10) motion in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Quinto </em>at 362. A party is entitled to summary disposition if the evidence shows that there is no genuine issue of material fact to resolve at trial. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-6\">To determine if a genuine issue of material fact exists, the test is \u201cwhether the kind of record which might be developed, giving the benefit of reasonable doubt to the opposing party, would leave open an issue upon which reasonable minds might differ.\u201d <em>[Skinner v Square D Co, </em>445 Mich 153, 162; 516 NW2d 475 (1994), quoting <em>Farm Bureau Mutual Ins Co v Stark, </em>437 Mich 175, 184-185; 468 NW2d 498 (1991).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">Defendants offered deposition testimony to support their motion for summary disposition. Consequently, in order to survive the motion, Shallal had to provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>documentary evidence establishing the existence of a genuine issue of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Section 2 of the Whistleblowers\u2019 Protection Act provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-6\">An employer shall not discharge, threaten, or otherwise discriminate against an employee regarding the employee\u2019s compensation, terms, conditions, location, or privileges of employment because the employee, or a person acting on behalf of the employee, reports <em>or is about to </em>report, verbally or in writing, a violation or a suspected violation of a law or regulation .... [MCL 15.362; MSA 17.428(2) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">To establish a prima facie case, it must be shown that (1) the plaintiff was engaged in protected activity as defined by the Whistleblowers\u2019 Protection Act, (2) the plaintiff was discharged, and (3) a causal connection existed between the protected activity and the discharge. <em>Terzano v Wayne Co, </em>216 Mich App 522, 526; 549 NW2d 606 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">It is undisputed that Shallal was discharged on April 24, 1991. Therefore, to meet her prima facie burden at the hearing, she needed only to provide facts from which one could reasonably conclude that (1) she had been engaged in protected activity and (2) the activity was causally connected to her discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">An employee is engaged in protected activity under the Whistleblowers\u2019 Protection Act who has reported, or is about to report, a suspected violation of law to a public body. It is undisputed that Shallal did not report a suspected violation of law to a public body <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>before her discharge.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Hence, Shallal had the burden of establishing that a question of fact existed regarding whether she was \u201cabout to\u201d report Quinn\u2019s violations to a public body. Our task is to determine if plaintiff met her burden. To accomplish that, we examine the Whistleblowers\u2019 Protection Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">The cardinal rule of all statutory construction is to identify and give effect to the intent of the Legislature. <em>Turner v Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n, </em>448 Mich 22, 27; 528 NW2d 681 (1995). The first step in discerning intent is to examine the language of the statute in question. <em>Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n v Hill, </em>431 Mich 449; 430 NW2d 636 (1988). We read the language according to its ordinary and generally accepted meaning. Judicial construction is authorized only where it lends itself to more than one interpretation. <em>Frame v Nehls, </em>452 Mich 171; 550 NW2d 739 (1996). We also consider that remedial statutes, such as the Whistleblowers\u2019 Protection Act, are to be liberally construed, favoring the persons the Legislature intended to benefit. <em>Dudewicz v Norris Schmid, Inc, </em>443 Mich 68, 77; 503 NW2d 645 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">A plain meaning reading of the act shows that an employee \u201cabout to\u201d report receives the same level of protection as one who has reported to a public body. The plain language also restricts recovery under the act by requiring a nonreporting employee to establish being \u201cabout to\u201d report by offering clear and convincing evidence. MCL 15.363(4); MSA 17.428(3)(4). The face of the statute, however, does not explain what constitutes \u201cabout to\u201d report, thereby lending itself to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>more than one interpretation. Consequently, we examine the purpose of the act for guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">This Court has noted that the Whistleblowers\u2019 Protection Act\u2019s main purpose is to alleviate \u201cthe inability to combat corruption or criminally irresponsible behavior in the conduct of government or large businesses.\u201d <em>Dudewicz </em>at 75. While employees are often in the best position to report violations of law, they are too frequently reluctant to do so for fear of retribution. <em>Id. </em>The act prohibits future employer reprisals against whistleblowing employees for the purpose of encouraging employees to report violations. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Legislative analysis indicates that the \u201cabout to\u201d report language was added to the bill to protect conscientious employees who intended to, but were discharged in retaliation before they could, report. House Legislative Analysis, HB 5088, 5089, February 5, 1981. <em>Webster\u2019s </em>defines \u201cabout\u201d as \u201con the verge of\u201d when followed by an infinitive, such as \u201cto leave,\u201d or in this case, \u201cto report.\u201d <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary, </em>1995, p 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">The analysis also evidences a legislative recognition that the \u201cabout to\u201d report language was a potential source of controversy. <em>Id. </em>In fact, legislative opposition to the bill questioned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-8\">How does one establish that a person was \u201cabout to\u201d do something? This language is an open invitation for disgruntled employees or former employees to claim that their treatment by an employer has been illegal. It could become difficult or impossible to fire or discipline employees. [House Legislative Analysis, HB 5088, 5089, February 5, 1981, p 2.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">In response, the bill\u2019s proponents noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>There is never any foolproof way of guarding against false claims of discrimination, but it would be unreasonable to deny protection to the conscientious because that shelter might be used by the unscrupulous. House Bill 5089 does contain significant safeguards against employee abuse of its provisions by requiring that an action be commenced within 90 days of the occurrence of the alleged violation and by specifying that an employee who claims to have been about to report a violation must give clear and convincing evidence to this intention. <em>[Id. ]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">Thus, the implication is that the language of the Whistleblowers\u2019 Protection Act intentionally reduces employee protection the more removed the employee is from reporting to a public body.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Plaintiff Shallal alleges that she was engaged in protected activity under the Whistleblowers\u2019 Protection Act because she was \u201cabout to\u201d report Quinn\u2019s abuse of alcohol and agency funds to the dss. She asserts that Quinn\u2019s activities violated DSS agency rules. She supports her claim with deposition testimony that describes her confronting Quinn with his violations. She also provides entries from her personal calendar that identify by date the people she spoke with about her desire to report Quinn.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Shallal alleges that Quinn called her to his office on April 17, 1991, following his meeting with dss officials. When the discussion became heated, she told Quinn:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-8\">[l]t\u2019s all your fault This agency is going down the drain because you\u2019re the one that has no interest, has no commit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>ment. You\u2019re so busy drinking and misusing money that you don\u2019t care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-4\">And if you don\u2019t straighten up ... I will report [you] to the department, to the board, anybody, everybody.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">After her termination, Shallal stated that she tried to retrieve what \u201cactually happened\u201d from her memory. She also said that she had \u201cmade some mental notes of conversations and dates . . . that [stuck] out in [her] mind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Shallal supported her mental notes with calendar entries, which she read at her deposition.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-7\">On January 25, I went to lunch with Ted Goldberg and my dictation says, \u201ctalked about reporting and confronting Tom.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-8\">On February 21, it says, \u201ctalked to Charlie G. about reporting Tom. We\u2019re all enablers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-9\">On March 22,1 have \u201cscheduled lunch with Mary Therese Lamanek.\u201d That was the lunch she and I discussed \u2014 I did not have any notation .... Basically [we talked] about problems in the agency, reporting Tom; we can\u2019t let this thing go on and on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-11\">On April 10, when Tim and I were coming back from meeting in Lansing, the federation meeting, I have notated, \u201ctalked to T.K. about Tom wanting to fire me. We need to report him.\u201d And I had slash (/) \u201cdss.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-12\">In its decision, the Court of Appeals reasoned that the trial court properly dismissed Shallal\u2019s retaliatory discharge as a matter of law.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>[N]o reasonable person could conclude that plaintiff was near to an action, near to the performance, or in readiness to report the alleged misconduct of defendant Quinn. . . . Plaintiff\u2019s words, \u201cif you don\u2019t straighten up ... I will report [you],\u201d belie any sense of immediacy. [Slip op at 1.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">The Court further noted that Shallal\u2019s deposition testimony indicated that \u201cshe threatened to report him <em>if </em>he did not shape up, thereby giving him an opportunity to change and avoid being reported.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">The employee bears the burden of establishing that being about to act on a belief that a report to a public body was warranted. The employee\u2019s proof, however, need not consist of a concrete action to satisfy the \u201cabout to\u201d report element. See <em>Chandler v Dowell Schlumberger, Inc, </em>214 Mich App 111, 120; 542 NW2d 310 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">We hold that the plaintiff has failed to make out a prima facie case under the Whistleblowers\u2019 Protection Act. However, we disagree with the Court of Appeals that plaintiff\u2019s statement, \u201cif you don\u2019t straighten up ... I will report [you],\u201d coupled with her other actions, does not satisfy the \u201cabout to report\u201d language under the act. Rather, we hold that plaintiff failed to establish a causal connection between the protected activity and her firing because she knew that she was going to be fired before she confronted her supervisor; thus, she used the information she had about the defendant\u2019s illegal activities as a guise to force the defendant to allow her to keep her job.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">Unlike whistleblower statutes in other jurisdictions, Michigan provides unique protection to its citizens because it does not require the plaintiff to have actu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>ally reported the suspected violation. For example, \u201cthe federal whistleblower statute requires that a plaintiff pursue administrative remedies, including filing a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel. This step is mandatory. 5 USC 1214(a)(3).\u201d <em>Williams v West, </em>unpublished opinion of the northern district of California, decided July 23, 1996 (Docket No. C-95-1516 SI), 1996 US Dist LEXIS 10654 *14 (ND Cal, 1996). Other jurisdictions only protect public employees. See, e.g., <em>Clark v Modern Group Ltd, </em>9 F3d 321 (CA 3, 1993) (the whistleblower protection statute only applies to public employees in Pennsylvania). However, as we have previously noted, the plain meaning of Michigan\u2019s Whistleblowers\u2019 Protection Act shows that an employee \u201cabout to report\u201d receives the same level of protection as one who has actually reported to a public body.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">The dissent states that \u201cno reasonable jury could conclude from the fact that plaintiff discussed reporting Quinn and threatened him, that she had decided actually to do it and do it in the near future.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 627. We disagree. Plaintiff\u2019s conditional threat to her employer was credible evidence that she had finally decided that she was going to report him. Giving her employer the opportunity to correct his behavior does not in any way affect whether she had formed the requisite intent to report her supervisor. In fact, her threat furthered the public policy goal of the statute, which is to combat the corruption or criminally irresponsible behavior of employers. A plaintiff should not be required to say \u201cmagic words\u201d in order to reap the protections of the statute. It should be sufficient that plaintiff actually threatened to report her employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>\u201c[W]histleblower statute[s] [are] analogous to antiretaliation provisions of other employment discrimination statutes and therefore should receive treatment under the standards of proof of those analogous statutes. [Courts] agreef] that the policies underlying these similar statutes warrant parallel treatment here, and other courts faced with like issues have similarly responded.\u201d <em>Rouse v Farmers State Bank of Jewell, Iowa, </em>866 F Supp 1191, 1204 (ND Iowa, 1994). By analogy, the public policy concerns of whistleblower statutes have been echoed in the similar area of federal law under the False Claims Act, 31 USC 3730. This section of the act \u201cmight properly be characterized as the \u2018whistleblower\u2019 provisions of the false claims statute.\u201d <em>Southern California Rapid Transit Dist v Los Angeles Co Superior Court, </em>30 Cal App 4th 713, 724; 36 Cal Rptr 2d 665 (1994). The False Claims Act (or \u201cqui tam\u201d violations)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> have existed in various forms since 1863. They empower private citizens to bring suits on behalf of the government against persons who knowingly present false or fraudulent claims to the government for approval or payment. The act is \u201cdesigned to encourage citizens to ferret out fraud on the federal government . . . .\u201d <em>Mikes v Strauss, </em>889 F Supp 746, 751 (SD NY, 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>To sustain an action under the False Claims Act, the plaintiff must prove \u201c1) that she engaged in conduct protected under the statute, 2) that defendants were aware of her conduct, and 3) that she was terminated in retaliation for her conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 752. Under the first element, \u201cplaintiff need not have actually filed suit under the fca to receive the protection accorded by [the statute].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Observing the defendant\u2019s illegal action \u201cand confronting defendants with her observations\u201d is sufficient to demonstrate that the plaintiff was engaged in a protected activity. <em>Id. </em>The same should be true of this case. Plaintiff observed the illegal action and confronted defendant with her observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Even under the second element, the plaintiff in this case would have satisfied the requirements for sustaining a qui tarn suit. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has adopted a strict approach which requires that \u201cbefore termination the employee must expressly accuse the employer of defrauding the government or threaten a qui tarn action based thereon . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 753. Other courts have not required the plaintiff to meet such strict standards. For example the <em>Mikes </em>court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-6\">[A]n employee must supply sufficient facts from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the employee was discharged because of activities which gave the employer reason to believe that the employee was contemplating a qui tarn action against it. To insist upon an express or even an implied threat of such action would impose a requirement which is wholly unrealistic in an employment context. Despite the protection afforded by [the statute] \u2014 of which most employees are doubtless unaware \u2014 those who tell their employers they are preparing to sue them on behalf of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>a defrauded government can scarcely expect a long and happy tenure. <em>[Id.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">However, under either approach, plaintiff in ornease would have met the requirements for a qui tarn action under the whistleblower provision of the False Claims Act. Plaintiff made an <em>express </em>threat to her employer that she would report him if he did not shape up. This clearly evidences an intent to report, and thus satisfies the \u201cabout to report\u201d language of the Whistleblowers\u2019 Protection Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">The dissent states that the express threat to her employer was insufficient in part because she did not take her supervisor\u2019s advice and actually report because \u201cshe feared for her job,\u201d she \u201cdid not call her state representative,\u201d she did not \u201creport after her termination,\u201d nor did she specifically state that she had \u201cdecided to report Quinn.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 625. Not one of these things is required by the statute. Confronting a supervisor with a threat of a report serves to promote the public policy of whistleblower statutes. Certainly such a threat should demonstrate that the employee has an actual intent to report the violation. As stated by the Supreme Court of Texas:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-6\">Dissenters and whistleblowers rarely win popularity contests or Dale Carnegie awards. They are frequently irritating and unsettling. These qualities, however, do not necessarily make their views wrong or unhelpful. . . . [T]he employee\u2019s report should not be limited to some outside official .... [I]ntemal reporting of wrongdoing should be encouraged, so that an employer may have an opportunity to investigate and remedy problems before involving outside authorities. . . . The underlying policy goals to avert harm to the public may be just as effectively served by communication within an organization .... <em>[Winters v Houston Chronicle </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number><em>Publishing Co, </em>795 SW2d 723, 733 (Tex, 1990) (Doggett, J., concurring).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">We recognize that if an employee chooses to proceed with an action she must report the violation to a public body. However, the statute is very clear that conduct short of actually reporting is also protected if it can be demonstrated that the employee was \u201cabout to\u201d report. The dissent would punish the plaintiff for not actually reporting the violation, even though the Michigan statute does not require such action. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit has held that in order to prove a prima facie case of retaliation under a whistleblower statute, the plaintiff must \u201cspecifically . . . show [] that the employer had knowledge of the employee\u2019s protected activity . . . .\u201d Rouse, <em>supra </em>at 1206. Under this strict standard, plaintiff\u2019s threat would be considered protected activity.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>Therefore, on the basis of these facts, we hold that plaintiffs express threat to the wrongdoer that she would report him if he did not straighten up, especially coupled with her other actions, was more than ample to conclude that reasonable minds could find that she was \u201cabout to report\u201d a suspected violation of the law to the DSS.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">However, proving plaintiff was engaged in protected activity does not end the inquiry. We hold that plaintiff failed to establish a causal connection between her actions and her firing. Many courts have held that a plaintiff is precluded from recovering under a whistleblower statute when the employee acts in bad faith. See, e.g., <em>Melchi v Burns Int\u2019l Security Services, Inc, </em>597 F Supp 575 (ED Mich, 1984), <em>Wolcott v Champion Int\u2019l Corp, </em>691 F Supp 1052 (WD Mich, 1987). The primary motivation of an employee pursuing a whistleblower claim \u201cmust be a desire to inform the public on matters of public concern, and not personal vindictiveness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1065.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-6\">Where, however, an employee . . . keeps the matter quiet for more than a year, eventually revealing it not to the appropriate authorities or even to others for the purpose of preventing public injury, but rather for some other limited and private purpose, however laudable that purpose may appear to the employee, no such protection is afforded. [Otherwise] we would be discouraging disclosure and correction of unlawful or improper acts by encouraging employees to \u201cgo along\u201d and then keep quiet reserving comment or disclosure until a time best suited to the advancement of their own interests. <em>[Id. </em>at 1065-1066.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>Like <em>Wolcott, </em>it is clear that plaintiff used her own situation to extort defendant not to fire her. While not all circumstances potentially giving rise to an extorsive motive will preclude summary disposition, see <em>LaFond v General Physics Services Corp, </em>50 F3d 165 (CA 2, 1995), in this case, no reasonable juror could conclude that plaintiff threatened to report Quinn out of an altruistic motive of protecting the public. Furthermore, it is clear that the decision to fire plaintiff was made before her threat to Quinn <em>and </em>that plaintiff knew of this decision as evidenced by her calendar entry, which stated, \u201ctalked to T.K. about Tom wanting to fire me. We need to report him.\u201d Plaintiff cannot use the whistleblowers\u2019 act as a shield against being fired where she knew she was going to be fired before threatening to report her supervisor. To hold otherwise \u201cwould encourage other employees to hold off blowing the whistle until it becomes most advantageous for them to do so. Plaintiff has offered no evidence which suggests that the Michigan Legislature intended the Whistleblowers Act to be used as an offensive weapon by disgruntled employees.\u201d <em>Wolcott, supra </em>at 1066.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">vn</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">For these reasons, we hold that plaintiff presented sufficient facts upon which reasonable minds could conclude that she was \u201cabout to report\u201d a suspected violation. However, because she used the threat of reporting defendant to force him to allow her to keep her job, no reasonable juror could conclude there was a causal connection between her firing and the protected activity. Therefore, the decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b709-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>Boyle, Riley, and Weaver, JJ., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b692-8\"> For example, the State of Michigan, through the Department of Social Services, licenses CSS to receive children for placement in private family homes for foster care or adoption.

The dissent states that \u201cthe actions [to which] I refer . . . , significant by their absence, represent the state of the plaintiff\u2019s mind. If she had taken any of them, it would serve to convince a jury that she was about to report.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 625.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">In this case, there were many things \u201cin addition\u201d to her express threat to report that demonstrate that there is a triable question of fact regarding whether she intended to report Quinn. While it is true that plaintiff had thought about reporting him for years, a reasonable jury could conclude that her mere thoughts changed to actual intent to report just before her confronting Quinn: (1) she discussed the violations with her supervisor and honorary board member, (2) she discussed reporting her supervisor with her co-workers, as evidenced by her diary entries, and (3) she wrote in her calendar, \u201cWe need to report him . . . /DSS.\u201d What more could plaintiff have done to make it clear that she was about to report? Contrary to the implications of the dissent, the law does not require her to \u201cactually report.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 624.

However, I disagree that the evidence advanced to convince the factfinder that plaintiff was about to report suffices to establish a jury question.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Plaintiff Shallal alleges that she was engaged in protected activity under the act because she was \u201cabout to\u201d report defendant Quinn\u2019s abuse of alcohol and agency funds to the Department of Social Services. She asserts that Quinn\u2019s activities violated DSS agency rules. She supports her claim with deposition testimony that describes her confronting Quinn with his violations. She also provides entries from her personal calendar that identify by date the people she spoke with about her desire to report Quinn.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">I would hold that Shallal failed to present evidence that she had formed a definite intent to report to a public body in the near future. Without that intent, she could hardly be found to have been \u201cabout to\u201d report, unless she was \u201cabout to\u201d do it without knowing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">Shallal established that she learned of Quinn\u2019s abuses and recognized the need to correct the problem. However, recognizing that something must be done, and deciding without contingencies to do it, are distinct steps. What constitutes \u201cabout to\u201d report is a function of the facts and circumstances of each case. Normally, the determination will involve a plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>state of mind and will be a question for the jury. However, as the Court of Appeals noted, there are cases in which the plaintiffs proofs are so lacking on this element that no reasonable juror could conclude that plaintiff was about to report. Unpublished opinion per curiam, issued February 28, 1995 (Docket No. 155006), slip op at 1. I see this as one of those cases. Like well-intentioned New Year\u2019s resolutions never acted upon, Shallal\u2019s showing that she recognized the offenses, and desired to report them if they did not end, are not evidence that she was \u201cabout to\u201d report.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">I am unpersuaded by plaintiff\u2019s reliance on <em>Lynd v Adapt, Inc, </em>200 Mich App 305; 503 NW2d 766 (1993). Rather, I believe that Shallal\u2019s actions are distinguishable from those of the employee in <em>Lynd. </em>Betty Lynd presented evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that she had definitely decided to report employer misdeeds in the near future. The Court of Appeals reasoned that she</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-5\">made several attempts to remedy what she believed to be improper practices by reporting the alleged abuse to her supervisors and the organization\u2019s board of directors. She also contacted her state representative to leam whom she should contact to report the suspected abuse. <em>[Id. </em>at 306.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The Court considered the fact that she reported the employer misdeeds after her termination. However, it correctly noted that an employee need not actually report after termination to be covered under the act\u2019s \u201cabout to\u201d report language. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">Whereas Betty Lynd reported to her supervisor and her employer\u2019s board of directors, Janette Shallal merely discussed what could be done about Quinn with her supervisor and an honorary board member. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>She did not take the latter\u2019s advice to report Quinn because she feared for her job. Perhaps she was not \u201cabout to\u201d report, for the same reason. Unlike Lynd, Shallal did not call her state representative to learn where to report the abuse. Although it is not dispositive, Shallal did not report after her termination, either, as did Lynd. Finally, she never stated that she had decided to report Quinn in the near future.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The majority disagrees with my finding insufficient evidence because plaintiff failed to report before or after termination, to get information on how to report or even decide to report soon. <em>Ante </em>at 619-620. The majority points out that the statute does not require any of these actions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Certainly, the statute requires no specific action. However, the actions I refer to, significant by their absence, represent the state of the plaintiff\u2019s mind. If she had taken any of them, it would serve to convince a jury that she was about to report. Any of them would have been evidence that Shallal had formed the intention to report to a public body with immediacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>As the majority notes, the common meaning of \u201cabout to\u201d suggests a sense of immediacy. <em>Ante </em>at 612. <em>(\u2018'Webster\u2019s </em>defines \u2018about\u2019 as \u2018on the verge of\u2019 when followed by an infinitive . . . .\u201d) None of the actions Shallal did take indicates an intention to report soon to a public body. Thus, I respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s inference that my position reads into the statute something that is not there.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">I find the majority\u2019s analogy to the False Claims Act unpersuasive. As the majority notes, what constitutes protected activity under that act differs from what constitutes protected activity under the Whistle-blowers\u2019 Protection Act. <em>Ante </em>at 618. Under the fca, evidence that an employee observed and confronted a defendant with her observations suffices to get the case to a jury. <em>Id. </em>Under the whistleblowers\u2019 act, however, there must be evidence that the employee reported or was about to report.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Since the actions required of employees under the fca are clearly less stringent than those required under the Whistleblowers\u2019 Protection Act, the majority\u2019s analogy loses force. If the Michigan Legislature intended to protect an employee who confronts an employee, as the FCA does, it could have done so. The New York Legislature wrote a stronger whistle-blowers\u2019 law than ours.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But the Michigan Legislature has seen fit to require either actual reporting or proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>by clear and convincing evidence that an employee was \u201cabout to report.\u201d It has refused to bring within the protection of the act an employee who discusses reporting and who approaches the employer and threatens to report, but takes no further action. Perhaps this is regrettable and should be remedied. However, the lawmaking that is appropriate is legislative, not judicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">In conclusion, no reasonable jury could conclude from the fact that plaintiff discussed reporting Quinn and threatened him, that she had decided actually to do it and do it in the near future. Without some evidence of that decision, plaintiff could not have been \u201cabout to\u201d report. Therefore, I conclude that the trial judge properly granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">I would not reach the issue whether a causal relationship existed between the discharge and the protected activity. Rather, I would dismiss plaintiff\u2019s claim because she failed to present evidence sufficient for a jury to find that she was about to report.</p>\n<judges id=\"b713-7\">Mallett, C.J., and Brickley, J., concurred with Kelly, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b711-7\"> In her deposition, Shallal was asked if her testimony was that she had been \u201cabout to\u201d report to a public body for a period of time, two or three years.
