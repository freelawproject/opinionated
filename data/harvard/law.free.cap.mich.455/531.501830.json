We granted leave in this case to determine whether Western Michigan University\u2019s student recreational facility project is subject to the act. The trial court and Court of Appeals determined that because state appropriations did not directly finance or guaranty financing for the project, the project was not \u201csponsored or financed in whole or in part by the state\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> within the meaning of the act and that, consequently, the project was not subject to it. We disagree. Because Western Michigan University is essentially an arm of state government, its project was sponsored and financed by the state within the plain meaning of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Western Michigan University began planning renovation of its student recreational facilities in the mid-1980s. It entered into various contracts for the planning and work on the project during the 1980s and early 1990s. Before the Board of Control of the university finalized the financing of the project, bills relating to the various contracts were paid out of the university\u2019s general fund, which contained commingled state appropriations. In the spring of 1991, the board adopted an enrollment fee increase to fund the project. In December of 1992, after realizing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>funds generated from the enrollment fee would not completely cover the cost, the university issued approximately $60 million in revenue bonds. The bonds were to be primarily repaid with revenues from student activity fees. The university additionally pledged certain general fund revenues. These revenues included tuition fees, deposits, charges and receipts, income from students, gross revenues from housing, dining and auxiliary facilities, and grants, gifts, donations, and pledges, as well as investment income.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The university sent an inquiry to the Department of Labor regarding whether it must pay construction workers on the project at the prevailing wage act rate. The parties dispute whether the department informed the university that the act did not apply. The university claims that the department indicated that the act did not apply to the project because it was not funded by direct state appropriations. The state claims that correspondence from the department related to other projects, and not to the recreational facility project at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">In light of controversy surrounding the applicability of the prevailing wage act to the project, state representative Mary Brown requested a formal opinion from the Attorney General on the issue. The Attorney General determined that the act does apply generally to construction projects undertaken by state universities, and specifically applies to the student recreational facilities projects. OAG, 1991-1992, No 6,723, pp 156-160 (June 23, 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Immediately following release of the Attorney General opinion, the university commenced this declaratory judgment action. The trial court granted sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>mary disposition for the university and the intervenor plaintiff, Associated Builders &amp; Contractors, Inc., holding that because the project had not been \u201csponsored or financed\u201d by the state, it was not subject to the act. The state, and the intervenor defendant Michigan State Building Trades and Construction Council, AFL-CIO, appealed. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 212 Mich App 22; 536 NW2d 609 (1995). The defendant and the intervenor defendant sought leave to appeal in this Court and now we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">prevailing wage act</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Michigan\u2019s prevailing wage act is generally patterned after the federal prevailing wage act, also known as the Davis-Bacon Act. 40 USC 276a <em>et seq. </em>Both the federal and Michigan acts serve to protect employees of government contractors from substandard wages. Federal courts have explained the public policy underlying the federal act as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-7\">\u201cprotect[ing] local wage standards by preventing contractors from basing their bids on wages lower than those prevailing in the area\u201d . . . [and] \u201cgiv[ing] local labor and the local contractor a fair opportunity to participate in this building program.\u201d <em>[Universities Research Ass\u2019n, Inc v Coutu, </em>450 US 754, 773-774; 101 S Ct 1451; 67 L Ed 2d 662 (1981).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-8\">The purposes of the Davis-Bacon Act are to protect the employees of Government contractors from substandard wages and to promote the hiring of local labor rather than cheap labor from distant sources. <em>[North Georgia Bldg &amp; Construction Trades Council v Goldschmidt, </em>621 F2d 697, 702 (CA 5, 1980).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>The Michigan prevailing wage act reflects these same public policy concerns. Through its exercise of the sovereign police power to regulate the terms and conditions of employment for the welfare of Michigan workers,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Michigan Legislature has required that certain contracts for state projects must contain a provision requiring the contractor to pay the prevailing wages and fringe benefits to workers on qualifying projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Whether a particular project comes within the ambit of the act is governed by the language of the act itself. In this regard, the act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">Every contract executed between a <em>contracting agent </em>and a successful bidder as contractor and entered into pursuant to <em>advertisement and invitation to bid </em>for a <em>state project </em>which requires or involves the employment of <em>construction mechanics, </em>other than those subject to the jurisdiction of the state civil service commission, and which is <em>sponsored or financed in whole or in part by the state </em>shall contain an express term that the rates of wages and fringe benefits to be paid to each class of mechanics by the bidder and all of his subcontractors, shall be not less than the wage and fringe benefit rates prevailing in the locality in which the work is to be performed. [MCL 408.552; MSA 17.256(2) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">In summary, to come within the act, a project must: (1) be with a \u201ccontracting agent,\u201d a term expressly defined in the act; (2) be entered into after advertisement or invitation to bid; (3) be a state project, a term also defined in the act; (4) require the employment of construction mechanics; and (5) be sponsored or financed in whole or in part by the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>The parties do not dispute that the contracts at issue were entered into pursuant to an invitation to bid or that the project required the employment of construction mechanics. Consequently, we will not further discuss these two threshold requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">The requirement that the project be with a \u201ccontracting agent\u201d is explained in the act\u2019s definition of the term \u201ccontracting agent\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-5\">\u201cContracting agent\u201d means any officer, school board, board or commission of the state, or a state institution supported in whole or in part by state funds, authorized to enter into a contract for a state project or to perform a state project by the direct employment of labor. [MCL 408.551(c); MSA 17.256(l)(c).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">The university is clearly a contracting agent within the plain meaning of the act. The constitutional provisions relating to state universities deems the university an \u201cinstitution\u201d and establishes state support:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-7\">The legislature shall appropriate moneys to maintain . . . Western Michigan University ... by whatever names such institutions may hereafter be known, and other institutions of higher education established by law. [Const 1963, art 8, \u00a74.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">Further, the regional universities act, MCL 390.551; MSA 15.1120(1), refers to the university as a \u201cstate institution\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-9\">The established state institutions known as Central Michigan university, Eastern Michigan university, Northern Michigan university and Western Michigan university are continued under these names. Each institution shall be governed by a separate 8-member board of control.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>Having determined that the university is a \u201ccontracting agent,\u201d we next turn to whether the student recreational facilities project it undertook is a \u201cstate project.\u201d The act also expressly defines this term:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-4\">\u201cState project\u201d means new construction, alteration, repair, installation, painting, decorating, completion, demolition, conditioning, reconditioning, or improvement of public buildings, schools, works, bridges, highways, or roads authorized by a contracting agent. [MCL 408.551(b); MSA 17.256(l)(b).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The parties do not dispute that the project undertaken by the contracting agent, Western Michigan University, involved renovations and an addition to the existing student recreation center. Consequently, it clearly is a \u201cstate project\u201d within the plain meaning of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The critical issue in this appeal is whether the project satisfies the final threshold requirement. To come within the act, the project must be \u201csponsored or financed in whole or in part by the state.\u201d This phrase is not defined in the act. The Attorney General concluded that the project met this final criterion, while the trial court and the Court of Appeals determined that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">SPONSORED OR FINANCED BY THE STATE</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">In construing the terms of a statute, this Court has often stated that we must give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent. When statutory language is clear and unambiguous, we must honor the legislative intent as clearly indicated in that language. No further construction is required or permitted. <em>Tryc v Michigan </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number><em>Veterans\u2019 Facility, </em>451 Mich 129, 135; 545 NW2d 642 (1996). Further, where a statute does not define a term, we will ascribe its plain and ordinary meaning. <em>Id. </em>at 135-136; <em>Shelby Twp v Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>143 Mich App 294, 300; 372 NW2d 533 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">We find no ambiguity in the prevailing wage act\u2019s threshold requirement that a project must be \u201csponsored or financed in whole or in part by the state.\u201d No construction of these terms is required. If the \u201cstate,\u201d including any part of state government, helps to finance a project, or undertakes some responsibility for a project, this criterion is met. Because we agree with the analysis of the Attorney General regarding whether the state has sponsored or financed a project in whole or in part, specifically regarding the university\u2019s project at issue in this case, we will set forth that analysis here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-5\">Direct legislative appropriation of funds is not . . . the only means by which a project can be sponsored or financed by the state. In <em>West Ottawa Public Schools v Director, Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>107 Mich App 237; 309 NW2d 220 (1981), lv den 413 Mich 917 (1982), for example, the state did not directly appropriate any funds for the project in question but did act as a surety for the payment of bonds issued to finance the project. The Court held that this was sufficient to constitute \u201csponsorship\u201d within the meaning of the prevailing wage act. In reaching this conclusion, the Court defined \u201csponsor\u201d as \u201cone who assumes responsibility for some other person or thing.\u201d 107 Mich App 247-248.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-6\">The board of control of a state university assumes responsibility for any construction project undertaken by the university and the university, thus, is the \u201csponsor\u201d of the project. State universities are clearly a part of state government in Michigan. <em>Regents of the University of Michigan v Employment Relations Comm, </em>389 Mich 96, 108; 204 NW2d 218 (1973); <em>Branum v Bd of Regents of University </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number><em>of Michigan, </em>5 Mich App 134, 138-139; 145 NW2d 860 (1966).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">[OAG, <em>supra </em>at 158.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">We fully agree with this analysis. Western Michigan University is \u201cthe state\u201d within the meaning of the prevailing wage act. This Court has fully and consistently articulated the nature of state institutions of higher learning, such as the University of Michigan and Western Michigan University. In <em>Auditor General v Regents of Univ of Michigan, </em>83 Mich 467; 47 NW 440 (1890), this Court found that the state universities are organically part of the state government and found that all university property is state property held in trust for the public purpose of the university.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">While we recognize that state universities must exercise a fair amount of independence and control over their day-to-day operations and the use of state university funds in furtherance of their educational purposes, this does not diminish their essential character as a part of the state. As explained by the Court of Appeals, in a case involving the application of governmental immunity to the University of Michigan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-8\">In spite of its independence, the board of regents remains a part of the government of the State of Michigan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>It is the opinion of this Court that the legislature can validly exercise its police power for the welfare of the people of this State, and a constitutional corporation such as the board of regents of the University of Michigan can lawfully be affected thereby. The University of Michigan is an independent branch of the government of the State of Michigan, but it is not an island. Within the confines of the operation and allocation of funds of the University, it is supreme. Without these confines, however, there is no reason to allow the regents to use their independence to thwart the clearly established public policy of the people of Michigan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-4\"><em>[Branum v Bd of Regents of Univ of Michigan, supra </em>at 138-139.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">In summary, we hold that because Western Michigan University is a part of state government and its funds are state funds, the student recreational facility project is sponsored and financed by the state within the plain meaning of the prevailing wage act. Further, because the project meets all the other threshold criteria for the act\u2019s application, the university must comply with the act\u2019s wage and benefit requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">We are mindful that our determination regarding whether the project was sponsored or financed by the state contravenes the trial court and the Court of Appeals conclusions and does not comport with the Department of Labor\u2019s longstanding policy in construing the act. Our position is somewhat reminiscent of the boy who pointed out that the emperor has no clothes. Consequently, we feel compelled to explore and explain why the arguments relied on by the lower courts are in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">The primary, and most alluring, of these arguments has a certain technical appeal. This argument is set forth in the following excerpt from the Court of Appeals opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>[Acceptance of the [state\u2019s] interpretation would render meaningless the statutory requirement that the state project be \u201csponsored or financed in whole or in part by the state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\">. . . When construing a statute, the court should presume that every word has some meaning and should avoid any construction that would render the statute, or any part of it, surplusage or nugatory. <em>Altman v Meridian Twp, </em>439 Mich 623, 635; 487 NW2d 155 (1992). If possible, effect should be given to each provision. <em>Gebhardt v O\u2019Rourke, </em>444 Mich 535, 542; 510 NW2d 900 (1994). The Attorney General would deem all state projects to be sponsored by the state. This would render surplusage the requirement that a project be \u201csponsored or financed in whole or in part by the state.\u201d Because we find this issue to be dispositive, we need not address whether wmu is a \u201ccontracting agent\u201d or whether this is a \u201cstate project\u201d as defined by the act. [212 Mich App 26-27 (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">We first note that the rule of construction that statutes should be interpreted to give effect to every term is not needed here, where the statutory language is clear. Even so, the rule is misapplied. Holding that a project undertaken and financed by the university, an arm of state government, is necessarily \u201csponsored and financed in whole or in part by the state\u201d does not equate with finding that every state project comes within the act. Neither does such a holding render the \u201csponsored and financed\u201d criterion surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">There are \u201ccontracting agents\u201d that are not a part of state government, in contrast to the university here, whose projects may or may not be \u201csponsored or financed in whole or in part by the state.\u201d If a \u201ccontracting agent\u201d is a part of state government, for example a state agency or department, or a state institution like Western Michigan University, all its projects will necessarily be sponsored or financed by the state. If those projects meet the other threshold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>criteria discussed earlier in part n, they will come within the act. In contrast, for projects undertaken by contracting agents that are not part of state government, for example, a local school board, the \u201csponsored or financed ... by the state\u201d criterion will require closer examination and must be determined case by case. The existence of these nonstate contracting agents ensures that the \u201csponsored or financed\u201d language is not mere surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">Because the act does not limit how a contracting agent may satisfy the \u201csponsored or financed ... by the state\u201d criterion, we also refuse to do so. Contracting agents that are an integral part of state government satisfy the requirement by their very nature. Contracting agents that are outside state government can satisfy the requirement in a number of ways, including, but not necessarily limited to, direct legislative appropriation of funds and having the state act as surety for payment of bonds issued to finance the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Other arguments that the trial court relied on also stem from an erroneous application of rules of statutory construction. The first is the rule that we must give deference to an agency\u2019s construction of the act that it is charged to administer. <em>Davis v River Rouge Bd of Ed, </em>406 Mich 486, 490; 280 NW2d 453 (1979). The trial court, following this rule, cited the Department of Labor\u2019s Policy and Procedure Manual definitions of \u201cfinanced\u201d and \u201csponsored\u201d and then accepted these definitions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Apparently reluctant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>contravene the department\u2019s longstanding policy, the trial court found that because the university did not seek direct appropriations and because the state did not act as surety for repayment of the bonds, the project was outside the act\u2019s scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">As we have already noted, no construction is needed where the language of the statute is clear and can be given its plain and ordinary meaning. Consequently, we would not reach this rule of construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Further, while an agency\u2019s construction generally deserves deference, it is not controlling and cannot be used to overcome the statute\u2019s plain meaning. Id; <em>Ludington Service Corp v Acting Ins Comm\u2019r, </em>444 Mich 481, 505; 511 NW2d 661 (1994). The extremely limited and artificial definition that the department places on the \u201csponsored or financed\u201d language simply has no basis in the act. The act does not require direct legislative appropriations of state monies as a threshold criterion. Nor does it limit its definition of \u201csponsorship\u201d to instances where the state acts as surety. We refuse to so artificially limit the clear terms of the act and instead ascribe the commonly understood definitions of these terms, as explained earlier in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">The other rule of construction that the trial court erroneously applied is the rule of strict construction. Because the prevailing wage act is in derogation of the common law, and because it contains a misdemeanor criminal penalty provision, the trial court, following previous Court of Appeals opinions, found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>that its terms must be strictly construed against its application.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The rule of strict construction should not apply to application of the prevailing wage act in this context. As noted by the Court of Appeals in determining whether another act, the Pesticide Control Act, MCL 286.551; MSA 12.340(1), should be strictly construed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-4\">The general rule that criminal statutes are to be strictly construed is inapplicable when the general purpose of the Legislature is manifest and is subserved by giving the words used in the statute their ordinary meaning. <em>United States v P Koenig Coal Co, </em>270 US 512, 520; 46 S Ct 392, 394; 70 L Ed 709, 713 (1926). <em>[People v Jackson, </em>176 Mich App 620, 628; 440 NW2d 39 (1989).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">As previously noted, the Michigan act, like the federal Davis-Bacon Act, implements public policy beneficial to businesses and their workers on government construction projects by providing for a certain minimum wage rate and benefit level. The primary purpose of the act is remedial, rather than criminal, in nature. \u201cA remedial statute is designed to correct an existing law, redress an existing grievance, or introduce regulations conducive to the public good.\u201d <em>In re School Dist No 6, Paris &amp; Wyoming Twps, </em>284 Mich 132, 144; 278 NW 792 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">The mere inclusion of a misdemeanor penalty provision does not render the act a criminal statute that must be strictly construed. Similar to the prevailing wage act, the Minimum Wage Law, MCL 408.381 <em>et seq:, </em>MSA 17.255(1) <em>et seq., </em>and the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act, MCL 418.101 <em>et seq:, </em>MSA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>17.237(101) <em>et seq., </em>also regulate the terms and conditions of employment. These acts also are in derogation of the common law and contain misdemeanor penalty provisions. MCL 408.396; MSA 17.225(16), MCL 418.125; MSA 17.237(125). However, neither of these acts has been construed as a criminal statute, nor has its terms generally been strictly construed. See <em>Gross v Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co, </em>87 Mich App 448; 274 NW2d 817 (1978); <em>Rice v Michigan Sugar Co, </em>83 Mich App 508; 269 NW2d 202 (1978). Further, even if we were to find that the prevailing wage act was generally a criminal statute, we would construe its remedial provisions, including the threshold criteria for its applicability, liberally.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-5\">Remedial statutes, and the remedial portions of penal statutes, are to be liberally construed. See, e.g., <em>Robinson v Harmon, </em>157 Mich 272, 278; 122 NW 106 (1909); <em>Rancour v The Detroit Edison Co, </em>150 Mich App 276, 285; 388 NW2d 336 (1986), lv den 428 Mich 860 (1987); <em>Pi-Con, Inc v A J Anderson Construction Co, </em>169 Mich App 389, 395; 425 NW2d 563 (1988). <em>[Jackson, supra </em>at 628, n 3.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">To the extent that previous decisions of the Court of Appeals have indicated that the rule of strict construction should apply when determining the applicability of the prevailing wage act, those portions of those decisions are overruled.

Because I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that Western Michigan University\u2019s project to build a recreational facility is subject to the prevailing wage act, I respectfully dissent. I believe that the majority has given a strained interpretation of the meaning of \u201csponsored or financed in whole or in part by the state\u201d in the act that is not supported by the plain meaning of the statute, is contradicted by the statute itself, and renders nugatory part of the provisions where the building agent is a state institution. I would adopt the long-held interpretation of the agency responsible for administering this act, the Department of Labor, and hold that a project is sponsored or financed by the state when it was either (1) financed by the state, i.e., where the state made money available for a capital outlay or debt service, or (2) sponsored by the state, i.e., where the state became a surety for the project. In the instant case, the State of Michigan did not finance or sponsor the university\u2019s project to expand the student recreational facility because the university did not use state funds for the project and the state did not act as a surety to indemnify the debt the university incurred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>on the project. Consequently, I would conclude that the prevailing wage act does not apply. The trial court properly entered judgment on behalf of the university by ruling that the act did not apply. I would affirm the Court of Appeals decision upholding the trial court\u2019s grant of summary disposition in favor of the university.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">I. PREVAILING WAGE ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">The prevailing wage act, MCL 408.551 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 17.256(1) <em>et seq., </em>requires that certain contracts for state projects must contain a provision that requires the contractor to pay wages and fringe benefits to construction employees at the prevailing wage in the locality where the construction is to occur. Section 2 of the prevailing wage act contains the primary mandate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-8\">Every contract executed between a <em>contracting agent </em>and a successful bidder as contractor and entered into pursuant to advertisement and invitation to bid for a <em>state project </em>which requires or involves the employment of construction mechanics, other than those subject to the jurisdiction of the state civil service commission, <em>and which is sponsored or financed in whole or in part by the state </em>shall contain an express term that the rates of wages and fringe benefits to be paid to each class of mechanics by the bidder and all of his subcontractors, shall be not less than the wage and fringe benefit rates prevailing in the locality in which the work is to be performed. [MCL 408.552; MSA 17.256(2) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">I agree with the majority that this provision thereby requires a governmental employer to pay the prevailing wage if a project meets the following five condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>tions: the project must (1) be with a \u201ccontracting agent\u201d as defined by the act, (2) be entered into pursuant to an advertisement and invitation to bid, (3) be a \u201cstate project\u201d as defined by the act, (4) involve the employment of construction mechanics, and (5) be \u201csponsored or financed in whole or part by the state.\u201d See <em>ante, </em>p 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">n. MAJORITY\u2019S INTERPRETATION OF THE ACT AND THE PROPER INTERPRETATION</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The only issue on appeal is whether the project to build a recreational facility initiated by Western Michigan University was \u201csponsored or financed in whole or in part by the state.\u201d The majority asserts that the statute unambiguously provides that this project was sponsored and financed by the state because \u201cWestern Michigan University is \u2018the state\u2019 \u201d for purposes of the act. See <em>ante, </em>p 540.1 do not believe that this conclusion is required by the plain meaning of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">In fact, the majority\u2019s interpretation of the word \u201cstate\u201d in the phrase \u201csponsored or financed in whole or in part by the state\u201d is contradicted by the statute\u2019s usage of the word \u201cstate\u201d in the very same statute in its third element. The majority concludes that the term \u201cstate\u201d in this phrase unambiguously includes state universities like Western Michigan, but also unambiguously excludes local school boards. See <em>id., </em>pp 542-543.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In contrast, in requiring that a project subject to the prevailing wage act be a \u201cstate project,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>the statute clearly provides that an improvement by a local school board is a <em>\u201cstate </em>project.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">A \u201cstate project\u201d is defined by the act as a \u201cnew construction, alteration, repair, installation, painting, decorating, completion, demolition, conditioning, reconditioning, or improvement of public buildings, schools, works, bridges, highways, or roads authorized <em>by a contracting agent\u201d </em>MCL 408.551(b); MSA 17.256(l)(b) (emphasis added). The statute defines a \u201ccontracting agent\u201d as \u201cany officer, <em>school board, </em>board or commission of the state, or a state institution supported in whole or in part by state funds, authorized to enter into a contract for a state project or to perform a state project by the direct employment of labor.\u201d MCL 408.551(c); MSA 17.256(l)(c) (emphasis added). Thus, there can be no dispute that, according to the statute, a local school board may begin a \u201cstate project.\u201d The majority\u2019s interpretation, however, creates an inconsistency in the statute: a project by a local school board may be a <em>\u201cstate </em>project\u201d under the statute\u2019s third element, but, at the same time, a local school board is not part of the \u201cstate\u201d for the purposes of the fifth element. See <em>ante, </em>pp 541-543. This contradiction manifests the fallacy of the majority\u2019s claim that it is expounding on the unambiguous, plain meaning of the word \u201cstate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The analysis is flawed for a second reason. The majority\u2019s novel interpretation of the statute renders superfluous the first of the five elements, i.e., that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>project be with a \u201ccontracting agent,\u201d where the contracting agent is a state institution. The statute provides that a state institution that is supported by state funds like Western Michigan University is a \u201ccontracting agent\u201d under the act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The university concedes on appeal the point that Western Michigan University is a contracting agent. Where an employer like Western Michigan University meets the statute\u2019s first element of the test (involve a \u201ccontracting agent\u201d) because it is a state institution, it will then, according to the majority\u2019s interpretation, always meet the fifth element that the project be \u201csponsored or financed ... by the state\u201d because Western Michigan University is the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">The majority attempts to address this claim that its interpretation renders part of the statute to be mere \u201csurplusage\u201d as the Court of Appeals concluded, see 212 Mich App 22, 26; 536 NW2d 609 (1995), by noting that there are other entities defined by the act as \u201ccontracting agent[s]\u201d that are not part of the state for whom the fifth element would be relevant. See <em>ante, </em>pp 542-543. Nevertheless, the statute\u2019s fifth requirement would still be redundant for \u201cstate\u201d contracting agents (as interpreted by the majority). The rules of statutory construction require that this Court read separate provisions of a statute consistently as a whole to ensure that each provision is given effect. <em>Gebhardt v O\u2019Rourke, </em>444 Mich 535, 542; 510 NW2d 900 (1994). By analogy, this Court should interpret a statute to ensure that an interpretation of one provision does not render another superfluous in a sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>stantial number of cases. The Legislature likely did not intend to create such a cumbersome, awkward statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">The majority\u2019s error is rooted in its mistaken belief that the word \u201cstate\u201d is unambiguous in the phrase \u201csponsored or financed in whole or in part by the state.\u201d In my opinion, the word \u201cstate\u201d may be construed narrowly to include only the three branches of state government (executive, legislative, and judiciary) and the agencies they operate. Or, the \u201cstate\u201d may be construed broadly to include the three branches of state government and their agencies as well as all municipalities and institutions that are created by the state. Traditionally, cities, like state universities and colleges, are considered municipal corporations and creatures of the state. <em>Sinas v City of Lansing, </em>382 Mich 407, 411; 170 NW2d 23 (1969). The word \u201cstate\u201d in the fifth element may also plausibly be interpreted, as advanced by the majority, to include all state governmental agencies, and state institutions, like state universities and state mental health facilities, but not smaller units of government created by the state. This Court should examine the purpose of this fifth element and examine it in the context of the earlier provisions to discern its meaning here.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">The focus of the fifth element is on whether the project is <em>11 sponsored </em>or <em>financed\u201d </em>by the state government, not on whether the agency or institution initiating the project is a governmental entity. The statute ensures the latter point in its first element, by guaranteeing that the project is with a \u201ccontracting agent.\u201d Every entity listed in the definition of contracting agent could be loosely described as a state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>actor. In focusing on whether the project is financed or sponsored by the state, the statute\u2019s fifth element appears to ensure that either the Legislature has authorized funds for the project or there has been a state action by one of the three branches of government to sponsor the project. The act, however, provides no definition of the terms \u201csponsor\u201d or \u201cfinance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-3\">The Department of Labor has defined these terms for its administrative use in its policy and procedural manual from 1992 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-4\">Financed in whole or in part by the state \u2014 means providing or making state monies available for capital outlay or debt service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-5\">Sponsored by the state \u2014 means that the state acts as a surety by assuming the financial responsibilities for an authorized contracting agent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The Department of Labor apparently applied this interpretation to at least six state university or college projects from 1987 through 1991, where it concluded that the prevailing wage act did not apply to the school projects because the state universities and colleges used bond issues to fund the projects and did not use state funds.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This Court generally grants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>deference to a longstanding agency interpretation of a statute that the agency administers. See <em>Wayne Co Prosecutor v Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>451 Mich 569, 580; 548 NW2d 900 (1996). Because the agency\u2019s interpretation is a plausible one and fits the purposes of the statute and its fifth requirement examined in context, I would defer to this administrative agency and conclude that, in order for a project to come under the prevailing wage act, the state must either finance the project by providing state monies or sponsor the project by assuming financial responsibility for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">HI. APPLICATION OF THE PROPER INTERPRETATION</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Under this interpretation, the trial court properly concluded that the project was not financed or sponsored by the State of Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">In April 1992, the university began construction on the project. In December 1992, the university issued $59,495,000 in tax-exempt bonds to pay for the project. Between the start of the project and the sale of the bonds, the university internally borrowed with interest from its general fund to cover the cost of the project\u2019s progress. The university did not receive capital appropriations from the state for the project. During the time the university drew from its general fund, the cash reserves in the general fund ranged from approximately $22,000,000 to $38,000,000, and the amount the university drew from the general fund as a temporary cash flow on a monthly basis ranged from $95,000 to $7,100,000. After the bonds were sold, the general fund was reimbursed with interest from the bond proceeds. The university intends to repay the revenue bonds with money raised through student activity fees and from its nonstate general fund that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>includes tuition, other fees, grants, and gifts. The Legislature approved the project with the understanding that it would not involve state funds.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The state was not a party to any of the contracts for the project, is not obligated to pay on the revenue bonds, and is not acting as surety on the bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"ARA\">According to the undisputed facts, the State of Michigan did not specifically appropriate funds for the project. Where the university drew from its general fund for the project, it reimbursed the funds it obtained, and this fund, at all times, contained sufficient cash reserves from nonstate sources to cover the costs of the project. The trial court persuasively addressed the point regarding whether the university actually used state or nonstate funds for the project when it drew from its general fund:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-5\">[I]t would be unrealistic to require wmu to chase dollars through its general account to determine whether they were state or non-state funds, for this would be an impossible task. Thus, the court finds that so long as there were sufficient non-state funds in the general account to cover the dollars paid out for the Project, there was no state financing or sponsorship.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Moreover, the State of Michigan did not become a surety on the project and was not financially responsible for the debt the university incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>Because the Court of Appeals properly affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision to grant summary disposition in favor of Western Michigan University, I would affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b642-5\">Weaver, J., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b635-7\"> The majority reasons as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-8\">[W]e hold that because Western Michigan University is a part of state government and its funds are state funds, the student recreational facility project is sponsored and financed by the state within the plain meaning of the prevailing wage act. <em>[Ante, </em>p 541.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number><em>[F\\or projects undertaken by contracting agents that are not part of state government, for example, a local school board, </em>the \u201csponsored or financed ... by the state\u201d criterion will require closer examination and must be determined case by case. <em>[Id., </em>p 543 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b637-5\"> The fact that Western Michigan University is a \u201cstate institution\u201d is, in my opinion, a good example of a point that is unambiguous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b639-7\"> For example, in July 1987, the Department of Labor sent the following letter with regard to a project by Ferris State College:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-8\">\u201cThis project for which you have claimed an underpayment of the prevailing wage act is not a state prevailing wage project.
