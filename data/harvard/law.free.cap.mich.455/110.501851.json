We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and hold that the judge\u2019s inchoate observations did not ripen into a directed verdict of acquittal and did not become a final judgment. There was neither a written or signed order nor an oral or written ruling on the record sufficiently detailing the reasons for granting or denying the motion. Consequently, the defendant\u2019s constitutional right not to be placed twice in jeopardy was not violated by the submission of the issue to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">The defendant and his two codefendants were charged with open murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, arising from the shooting death of Markeis Jones. Jones was shot during a confrontation between two groups of youths at Hamady High School in Flint. The defendant and his friends did not attend Hamady, but were waiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>for friends who were attending a dance at the high school. In the school driveway the two groups of youths began arguing. There was some pushing and shoving and some verbal threats. Ultimately several shots were fired out of the back of a Mustang hatchback. Testimony indicated that defendant and codefendant Dameon Perkins fired shots from the back of the car. Codefendant Marcus Hopkins drove the car away as the shots were fired. There is some evidence in the record indicating that the shots missed their intended mark and inadvertently hit Markeis Jones, a friend of the defendants. There is also evidence in the record that the confrontation was gang related, involving rival groups known as \u201cFolks Up\u201d and \u201cFolks Down.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">All three young men were charged with open murder and felony firearm and were tried before two separate juries during one trial. Defendant Vincent and codefendant Hopkins were tried by one jury, while codefendant Perkins was tried by a second. At the close of the prosecution\u2019s case in chief, counsel for all three defendants moved for directed verdicts of acquittal on the charges of first-degree murder, arguing that there was insufficient evidence of premeditation and deliberation and that the shooting was unplanned and spontaneous. The prosecution opposed the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">When defense counsel had completed their arguments on the motion, the trial court judge responded with the following comment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-7\">Well my impression at this time is that there\u2019s not been shown premeditation or planning in the, in the alleged slaying. That what we have at the very best is Second Degree Murder. I don\u2019t see that the participation of any of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>defendants is any different then [sic] anyone else as I hear the comment made by Mr. Doll [counsel for Perkins] about the short time in which his client was in the vehicle. But I think looking at it in a broad scope as to what part each and every one of them played, if at all, in the event that it\u2019s not our premeditation planning episode. It may very well be the circumstance for bad judgement was used in having weapons but the weapons themselves may relate to a type of intent, but don\u2019t necessarily have to show the planning of premeditation. I have to consider all the factors. I think that the second Count should remain as it is, felony firearm. And I think that Second Degree Murder is an appropriate charge as to the defendants. Okay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">This discussion took place outside the hearing of the jury. Before adjourning the proceedings, the prosecutor requested time the next day to \u201cmake a brief restatement in terms of the First Degree Murder . . . The judge replied that he would \u201cbe glad to hear it . . . [and that he was] always glad to hear [the] people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The next day, the prosecution presented an argument regarding the quantum or threshold of evidence sufficient to survive a motion for a directed verdict on the charges of first-degree murder. After hearing both sides, and over the objections of defense counsel, the judge decided to reserve his ruling on the motion until he heard and thought more about the issues. Defense counsel maintained that the judge had directed a verdict resulting in a final judgment of acquittal regarding the first-degree murder charges, and that double jeopardy concerns were implicated.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>The judge, reconsidering his earlier remarks, noted that the jury had not been informed of any of the discussion, and, therefore, the defendant had not been prejudiced. The judge was adamant that he had not directed a verdict, \u201cI haven\u2019t directed a verdict to anybody. . . . Oh, I granted a motion but I have not directed a verdict.\u201d All three defendants were convicted: Vincent of first-degree murder, Hopkins of involuntary manslaughter, and Perkins of second-degree murder. All three appealed in the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Codefendant Hopkins, who had been convicted of involuntary manslaughter, raised the double jeopardy issue on appeal. In an unpublished opinion, the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>of Appeals held that the judge\u2019s ruling was not a final judgment or ruling, but the mere expression of an opinion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">While the court expressed an opinion that ultimately would have ripened into a final ruling had nothing intervened and the court taken the issue from the jury, the court, before acting on its expressed opinion, agreed to hear further argument from the prosecutor regarding the issue. When the court recessed for the day, everyone was aware that the prosecutor was going to present further argument on the issue of first-degree murder the next morning, before defendants would proceed with their cases. The matter was addressed the next morning, and the court reconsidered its opinion earlier expressed, concluding that it would reserve ruling. Thus, the record indicates that the court expressed an opinion, and then before finalizing that opinion, agreed to entertain further argument. The court did not make a final ruling until it denied defendant\u2019s motion for directed verdict and submitted the case to the jury. We conclude the court was not barred from further consideration of the matter. [Unpublished opinion per curiam, issued October 20, 1995 (Docket No. 158133), slip op at 2.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">The Court also concluded that MCR 6.419, which bars the judge from reserving his ruling on the motion was not violated because in this case Hopkins did not present any proofs and the judge made clear that he wanted the jury to decide between the different degrees of murder. <em>Id. </em>at 3. The <em>Hopkins </em>Court also concluded that in viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution there was sufficient evidence to support a conviction of first-degree murder. Consequently, the trial court did not err in denying the motion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Codefendant Perkins also raised the double jeopardy issue in his separate appeal. In an unpublished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>opinion, the Court of Appeals noted both that the trial of the first-degree murder charge continued after hearing the prosecution\u2019s arguments and that the juiy was ultimately instructed on first-degree murder. Accordingly then, the Court held that \u201c[s]ince the trial court had never indicated to the jury that it was directing a verdict of acquittal on first-degree murder, there was no prejudice to defendant and, more importantly, defendant\u2019s double jeopardy rights were not violated.\u201d Unpublished opinion per curiam, issued November 21, 1995 (Docket No. 160177), slip op at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">The <em>Perkins </em>Court held, just as the Court in <em>Hopkins, </em>that the prosecutor had presented sufficient evidence of premeditation and deliberation so the trial court did not err in denying the motion for directed verdict or in instructing the jury on the charge. \u201cWe are satisfied that the prosecution did present sufficient evidence from which a rational trier of fact could have concluded that the killing was done with premeditation and deliberation.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">However, a third panel of the Court of Appeals heard defendant Vincent\u2019s appeal, and in a published opinion reversed the decision of the trial court. Vincent also argued that his conviction of first-degree murder violated his constitutional right not to be placed twice in jeopardy. 215 Mich App 458, 460; 546 NW2d 662 (1996). The Court agreed, reversed the conviction, and remanded the case \u201cfor entry of a conviction of second-degree murder and for resen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>fencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 471.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court conceded that the trial judge\u2019s first statement \u201cWell, my impression at this time,\u201d was ambiguous, but that the later statement \u201cWhat we have at the very best is second-degree murder,\u201d was not. <em>Id. </em>at 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">We reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and hold, on the basis of the following evaluation, that the judge\u2019s inchoate impressions did not mature into a final judgment of acquittal of the charge. Consequently, Vincent\u2019s right not to be placed twice in jeopardy was not violated.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>n</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">We recognize that a judge\u2019s characterization of a ruling and the form of the ruling may not be controlling. <em>People v Anderson, </em>409 Mich 474, 486; 295 NW2d 482 (1980); <em>United States v Martin Linen Supply Co, </em>430 US 564, 571, n 9; 97 S Ct 1349; 51 L Ed 2d 642 (1977). \u201cThe Court must inquire whether \u2018the ruling in [defendant\u2019s] favor was actually an \u201cacquittal\u201d even though the District Court characterized it otherwise.\u2019 <em>United States v Wilson, </em>420 US 332, 336 [95 S Ct 1013; 43 L Ed 2d 232] (1975).\u201d Ultimately what we must determine is \u201cwhether the ruling of the judge, whatever its label, actually represents a resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.\u201d <em>Martin Linen </em>at 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Determining whether the trial court\u2019s statement, made at the conclusion of the defendant\u2019s motions for directed verdict, was tantamount to rendering a directed verdict is crucial because, if a directed verdict were rendered, further proceedings would violate the defendant\u2019s double jeopardy rights.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">[W]hen a trial court enters such a judgment, the Double Jeopardy Clause bars an appeal by the prosecution not only when it might result in a second trial, but also if reversal would translate into further proceedings devoted to the resolution of factual issues going to the elements of the offense charged. <em>[Smalis v Pennsylvania, </em>476 US 140, 142; 106 S Ct 1745; 90 L Ed 2d 116 (1986).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">Consequently, under federal precedent and our recent decision in <em>People v Nix, </em>453 Mich 619; 556 NW2d 866 (1996), characterizing the court\u2019s comments as a directed verdict would compel us to over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>turn the defendant\u2019s convictions. However, we find that <em>Nix </em>is distinguishable from the case at bar. In <em>Nix, </em>we held that the judge\u2019s order in form and substance was a final judgment of acquittal. The judge undertook an evaluation of all the evidence and determined on the record that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction on any count. A formal order was written and granted. Under those circumstances, we affirmed the Court of Appeals holding that the judge could not stay the entry of this order pending the prosecutor\u2019s appeal and thus avoid the defendant\u2019s protection against double jeopardy. <em>Id. </em>at 622-624. Whether or not erroneous, the judge evaluated the evidence and entered a formal judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Unlike the trial judge in <em>Nix, </em>the trial judge in <em>Vincent </em>did not undertake an evaluation of all the evidence, nor did he render a statement of sufficient clarity and finality that could be construed as an order. Taken in the context of the entire proceedings, the impressions of the judge cannot be transformed into a directed verdict on the issue of premeditation and deliberation. Consequently, we hold that the judge\u2019s comment did not represent an actual resolution of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged. Therefore, further proceedings were not barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause, and the defendant\u2019s rights were not violated.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>We reaffirm the principles articulated in <em>Nix, Anderson, Martin Linen, </em>and <em>Smalis </em>and now undertake to explain why in this case there was no directed verdict.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">In <em>People v Hampton, </em>407 Mich 354; 285 NW2d 284 (1979), this Court considered the standards for directed verdicts, recognizing that inconsistency existed among the published decisions of the Court of Appeals. <em>Id. </em>at 366. In <em>Hampton, </em>we discussed the quantum of evidence required to survive a motion for directed verdict. In assessing the sufficiency of evidence we held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-7\">the trial judge when ruling on a motion for a directed verdict of acquittal must consider the evidence presented by the prosecution up to the time the motion is made, ... in a light most favorable to the prosecution, . . . and determine whether a rational trier of fact could have found that the essential elements of the crime were proven beyond a reasonable doubt .... <em>[Id. </em>at 368.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIU\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Following our decision in <em>Hampton, </em>we stated that \u201c[r]etrial is not permitted if the trial court evaluated the evidence and determined that it was legally insufficient to sustain a conviction.\u201d <em>People v Mehall, </em>454 Mich 1, 6; 557 NW2d 110 (1997) (citing <em>Martin Linen). </em>In <em>Mehall </em>we held that there was no acquittal and that a retrial was not precluded when the judge failed to properly consider all the evidence under the standard articulated in Hampton. See also <em>People v Wolfe, </em>440 Mich 508; 489 NW2d 748 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">We are not convinced that the standards articulated in <em>Hampton </em>and <em>Mehall </em>were met in this trial judge\u2019s statement of his impressions, nor are we convinced that the judge\u2019s statement rose to the requisite level of certainty and finality to constitute a directed verdict. There was no indication in the record that the judge evaluated all the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution. <em>Mehall </em>at 6. There is no way to assess which pieces of evidence reflecting premeditation and deliberation or lack thereof the court considered or rejected because there was no mention of them reflected in the express remarks of the court. There was also no explicit reference to legal insufficiency. Further, although the judge mentioned that he was considering all the factors, there was no indication which factors he had actually considered or rejected.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Accordingly we hold this general inconclusive statement to be no more than a judge thinking out loud. The foundation laid to support this conclusory impression was inadequate. When ruling on the sufficiency of the evidence, a court must generally give a more particularized detailed analysis on the record of the evidence and reasoning that forms the basis of the decision and a clear statement that the motion is either granted or denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">In <em>Tiedman v Tiedman, </em>400 Mich 571, 576; 255 NW2d 632 (1977), Justice Levin observed that \u201c[t]he rule is well established that courts speak through their judgments and decrees, not their oral statements or written opinions. Generally, a judgment or order is reduced to written form, . . . until reduced to writing and signed, the judgment did not become effective . . . .\u201d That case involved a civil matter, but there is no reason that a lesser standard should be acceptable in criminal cases in which a defendant\u2019s liberty interest is at stake. Our rules of criminal procedure and our judgments based on them must not tolerate ambiguity or indecision in judgments rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">The Supreme Court of Washington has decided a case similar to the present one. In <em>State v Collins, </em>112 Wash 2d 303; 771 P2d 350 (1989), the trial judge orally dismissed a charge of third-degree assault as a result of the prosecutor\u2019s failure to produce sufficient evidence regarding the element of intent after hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>argument from both sides. <em>Id. </em>at 304. However, within minutes, the prosecutor offered further argument and authority, and the judge reinstated the charge. The defendant appealed, arguing that her double jeopardy rights had been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">In holding that the judge\u2019s oral ruling was not final when given, the Washington Supreme Court emphatically stated that it was returning to a \u201crule long followed in this state that a ruling is final only after it is signed by the trial judge in the journal entry or is issued in formal court orders.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 308. In overruling a previous case embracing a rule that allowed for too many ambiguous and inconsistent results the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-5\">The outcome of something as important as deciding whether a defendant was exposed to double jeopardy should not hang on such guesswork. ... To serve the ends of certainty, reliance on the final written court order or written journal entry to determine the finality of a ruling is the better rule . . . [m]any judges will think out loud along the way to reaching the final result. It is only proper that this thinking process not have final or binding effect until formally incorporated into the findings, conclusions, and judgment. [Id.][<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>We agree with this simple straightforward reasoning. A judge\u2019s thinking process should not have final or binding effect until formally incorporated into the findings, conclusions, or judgment. This concept finds support in our own court rules. MCR 2.602(A) requires that judgments and orders be \u201cin writing, signed by the court and dated with the date they are signed.\u201d None of the indicia of formality associated with final judgments are present in the trial judge\u2019s comments at issue here. There was no statement in the record that an order or judgment was being entered at all. \u201cOkay\u201d does not equate with \u201cIt is so ordered.\u201d Further, we note that the trial court did not substantially comply with the requirement of MCR 6.419(D) that provides \u201c[t]he court must state orally on the record or in a written ruling made a part of the record its reasons for granting or denying a motion for a directed verdict of acquittal . . . .\u2019\u2019As we stated in part n(B), the loose impressions of the judge cannot be construed as an adequate evaluation of the evidence. Instead, it reflects a tentative conclusion, not a formal resolution on the factual elements of the offense charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">There was nothing to indicate that the judge\u2019s impression in this case was anything more than an initial assessment of a possible future ruling. <em>People v </em>Jackson, 232 AD2d 193; 647 NYS2d 764 (1996). Similarly there was nothing to indicate that this was anything more than a continuing discussion between the parties. <em>State v Newfield, </em>161 Ariz 470, 472; 778 P2d 1366 (Ariz App, 1989). Further, we are inclined to agree with a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit holding that a judge\u2019s decision to submit the charge to the jury implicitly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>denies the motion. <em>United States v Bruno, </em>873 F2d 555, 562 (CA 2, 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The fact that the judge decided to entertain additional arguments the next day is further indication that he had not made a final decision. We are aware that how the judge characterizes his statement is not controlling, nor is the form of the so-called ruling controlling, but in this case we find that the judge was correct. He had not directed a verdict. Statements couched in the terms \u201cmy impression,\u201d \u201cI think,\u201d \u201cin the event that it\u2019s not our premeditation planning episode,\u201d and \u201c[i]t may very well be,\u201d do not resound in finality. To the contrary they are clearly equivocal. We would be hard pressed to call this kind of indecisive pondering a final judgment of acquittal.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">We hold that in order to qualify as a directed verdict of acquittal there must be either a clear statement in the record or a signed order of judgment articulating the reasons for granting or denying the motion so that it is evident that there has been a final resolution of some or all the factual elements of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>offense charged. In this case, the judge\u2019s comments concerning the sufficiency of evidence regarding the issue of premeditation and deliberation lacked the requisite degree of clarity and specificity. In addition, there was no formal judgment or order entered on the record to indicate what the exact nature of the ruling was and why. Accordingly, we hold that the responses of the trial judge to the motions for directed verdicts never became final with respect to the charge of first-degree murder. Consequently, the continuation of the trial and subsequent conviction did not prejudice or violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<judges id=\"b213-4\">Boyle, Riley, and Weaver, JJ., concurred with Mallett, C.J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b200-7\"> We note that in reserving his ruling on the motion for directed verdict that the trial judge violated MCR 6.419(A), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>After the prosecutor has rested the prosecution\u2019s case in chief and before the defendant presents proofs, the court on its own initiative may, or on the defendant\u2019s motion must, direct a verdict of acquittal on any charged offense as to which the evidence is insufficient to support conviction. <em>The court may not reserve decision on the defendant\u2019s motion. </em>If the defendant\u2019s motion is made after the defendant presents proofs, the court may reserve decision on the motion, submit the case to the jury, and decide the motion before or after the jury has completed its deliberations. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">Defense counsel cited the rule, but did not object to the trial court\u2019s express decision to reserve its ruling on the motion. Counsel\u2019s objection was based on the belief that the judge directed a verdict and then changed his mind. We are persuaded that, under the circumstances of this case, any error that might have occurred from the judge\u2019s decision to reserve tire motion was harmless. The issue was never discussed in front of, or taken from, the jury. Even though it is improper to reserve a ruling on this motion, because the defendant must have notice of the charges he is facing before presenting his proofs, we note that when Vincent testified he was still on notice that he was being tried for first-degree murder. Regardless of the propriety of reserving the motion, the charge was never dropped and the presentation of the defense was not impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">See <em>People v Higgs, </em>209 Mch App 306, 307; 530 NW2d 182 (1995) (postponing a hearing on a defendant\u2019s motion for directed verdict is harmless error where the prosecutor presented sufficient evidence to convict the defendant at the close of his proofs).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b203-6\"> This case was remanded to the trial court for resentencing.

From this, it is quite possible that a rational trier of fact could have found that the essential elements of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>crime, premeditation and deliberation, were proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

MCR 6.419 allows the trial court to state orally, or in writing, its reasons for denying or granting the motion. We leave trial judges with this choice, but caution that, whichever form is employed, the judgment must bear sufficient indicia of finality to survive an appeal. Factors that might be considered in evaluating finality, in addition to a clear statement in the record or a signed order, might also include an instruction to the jury that a charge or element of the charge has been dismissed by the judge or that a docket entry has been made reflecting the trial court\u2019s action.

On further appeal, the United States Supreme Court held as follows: \u201cThe Court of Appeals thought, not without reason, that the acquittal was based upon an egregiously erroneous foundation. Nevertheless, \u2018[t]he verdict of acquittal was final, and could not be reviewed . . . without putting [the petitioners] twice in jeopardy, and thereby violating the constitution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 143 (citing <em>United States v Ball, </em>163 US 662, 671; 16 S Ct 1192; 41 L Ed 300 [1896]).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">In <em>United States v Martin Linen Supply Co, </em>430 US 564, 571; 97 S Ct 1349; 51 L Ed 2d 642 (1977), the United States Supreme Court reaffirmed this principle from <em>Ball </em>and <em>Fong Foo, </em>stating: \u201c[W]e have emphasized that what constitutes \u2018an acquittal\u2019 is not to be controlled by the form of the judge\u2019s action.

I don\u2019t see that the participation of any of the defendants is any different then [sic] anyone else as I hear the comment made by Mr. Doll [counsel for Perkins] about the short time in which his client was in the vehicle. But I think looking at it in a broad scope as to what part each and every one of them played, if at all, in the event that it\u2019s not our premeditation planning episode. It may very well be the circumstance for bad judgement was used in having weapons but the weapons themselves may relate to a type of intent, but don\u2019t necessarily have to show the planning of premeditation. I have to consider all the factors. I think that the second Count should remain as it is, felony firearm. And I think that Second Degree Murder is an appropriate charge as to the defendants. Okay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">The majority seizes upon the word \u201cimpression,\u201d when in fact the determinative phrase is \u201cat this time\u201d because this latter phrase refers to a chronological point after the prosecution had presented all its evidence and closed its case in chief.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The majority\u2019s selective extraction of two other phrases \u2014 \u201cin the event that it\u2019s not our premeditation planning episode\u201d and \u201c [i]t may very well be\u201d \u2014 further ignores the conclusive nature of the trial judge\u2019s statements. This is readily demonstrated by reading these phrases in their true context.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Referring to the participation of all three defendants in the crime for which they were tried, the trial judge said: \u201cBut I think looking at it in a broad scope as to what part each and every one of them played, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>at all, in the event that it\u2019s not our premeditation planning episode.\u201d If looked at objectively, it should not be difficult to decipher the essential meaning of this sentence: Looking at the big picture with respect to what part, if any, each and every one of these defendants played in this event, it is not a case involving premeditation or planning.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The other phrase taken out of context by the majority undermines further its attempt to find uncertainty and indecision where, in fact, there exists judicious consideration and decision. The relevant sentence is, \u201c \u2018It may very well be the circumstance for bad judgement was used in having weapons but the weapons themselves may relate to a type of intent, but don\u2019t necessarily have to show the planning of premeditation.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Paraphrased, accurately and in its entirety, the essence of this sentence is as follows: The fact that defendants had weapons may be evidence of their bad judgment, and it is evidence to be considered in determining their intent, but the mere existence of the weapons per se does not prove the premeditation or planning required for a charge of first-degree murder.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And the very next statement of the trial judge, ignored by the majority, shows the truly deliberative nature of his comments: \u201cI have to consider all the factors.\u201d Then, having considered all the evidence, having looked at the \u201cbroad scope\u201d of the circumstances of the crime, having \u201cconsidered] all the factors,\u201d the trial judge concluded: \u201cAnd I think <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>that Second Degree Murder is an appropriate charge as to the defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">The majority\u2019s disregard for the principles articulated in <em>Nix </em>and <em>Anderson </em>leads to its reliance on several irrelevant factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">The majority emphasizes that the trial judge\u2019s statements were made \u201coutside the hearing of the jury.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 114. This fact is of no consequence whatsoever for purposes of applying the federal constitutional decisions of the United States Supreme Court that we acknowledged and applied in <em>Nix </em>and Anderson.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">The majority also inappropriately relies on the majority decision of the Supreme Court of Washington in <em>State v Collins, </em>112 Wash 2d 303; 771 P2d 350 (1989). There are several reasons that this reliance is inappropriate, the dispositive one being that the <em>Collins </em>majority does not even purport to follow the relevant case law of the United States Supreme Court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In fact, the <em>Collins </em>majority fails to even cite the relevant United States Supreme Court cases.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>m</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">In my opinion, the statements of the trial judge, made in response to defense counsel's motions for directed verdict of acquittal on the charges of first-degree murder, constitute \u201ca resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.\u201d <em>Martin Linen Supply, </em>430 US 571.

His belief that he could reverse that ruling simply because the jury did not know about it is clearly at odds with the legal principles reiterated in part I of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">In addition to the fact that the trial judge\u2019s understanding of the controlling legal principles was erroneous, the majority\u2019s conclusion that the trial judge\u2019s violation of MCR 6.419(A) was harmless error because \u201cthe presentation of the defense was not impaired,\u201d <em>ante, </em>p 115, n 1, is equally baseless. The defendant did not know what charges would be submitted to the jury, depriving him of knowledge he had an undisputed right to, knowledge that could have affected the presentation of his defense. More importantly, however, I reject the majority\u2019s attempt even to apply a harmless error analysis in this case. An error affecting a defendant\u2019s federal constitutional right not to be placed twice in jeopardy is not susceptible of harmless error analysis. The majority\u2019s attempt to employ this analysis is erroneous on its face, but is even more so by virtue of its mischaracterizing a federal constitutional violation as a mere violation of a state court procedural rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b216-10\"> Or his \u201cimpression\u201d or his \u201cthink[ing]\u201d or any other synonymous term that, in this context, connotes his \u201cevaluation\u201d of the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b217-7\"> The majority utilizes phrases such as \u201cthe judge\u2019s inchoate impressions,\u201d <em>ante, </em>p 118, \u201cthis conclusory impression,\u201d <em>id., </em>p 123, and \u201cthe loose impressions of the judge,\u201d <em>id., </em>p 125.
