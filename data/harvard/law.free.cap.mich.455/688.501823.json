We conclude in both cases that the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>tiffs failed to present sufficient evidence that discrimination had been a determining factor in their employers\u2019 decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">\n<em>McCONNELL v. ROLLINS BURDICK HUNTER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">In July of 1988, Ted McConnell accepted a job as a sales representative with Rollins Burdick Hunter (rbh). Rbh sold health insurance and provided insurance-related consulting services. At the time that he was hired, McConnell was fifty-five years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">In January of 1989, the plaintiff was informed that he needed to improve his sales production. The plaintiff\u2019s next review was in September of 1989. Because the plaintiff\u2019s sales revenue had not significantly improved by that time, he was informed that if his revenue did not increase that \u201cthere will have to be some adjustment made.\u201d The plaintiff was unable to improve his production.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">Rbh discharged McConnell in January of 1990. At that time, the plaintiff was fifty-seven years old. The plaintiff brought suit against defendants RBH and Miller, Mason, and Dickenson, Inc.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> alleging breach of employment contract, promissory estoppel, and age discrimination. The trial court granted summary disposition for the defendants on each of the plaintiff\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>On appeal, the Court of Appeals initially affirmed the decision of the trial court. The plaintiff then moved for a rehearing on the age discrimination claim which was granted. On rehearing, the Court affirmed, but remanded the case for trial of the plaintiff\u2019s age discrimination claim in an unpublished opinion per curiam. The defendants appealed that decision in this Court. We granted leave and consolidated this case with <em>Town v Michigan Bell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><em>TOWN v MICHIGAN BELL TELEPHONE COMPAN</em>Y</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">In 1980, Veronica Town sought a departmental transfer from her position of product-line manager with the Michigan Bell Telephone Company. She was interviewed by the assessment center and was offered \u00e1 position. She turned it down, however, when she learned of the assessment center\u2019s schedule, which consisted of a four-day work week, with twelve-hour shifts. This schedule was unacceptable to her because she needed to be home in the evenings to care for her husband, who was suffering from severe health problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Instead, the plaintiff accepted a position as manager of market administrators. After one year, the plaintiff\u2019s supervisor notified her that she was being transferred to the assessment center because her position was being consolidated with that of another manager. The person who held the other position was leaving the company. A thirty-five-year-old male, James Aveck, assumed the consolidated position.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">Still under the impression that the assessment center\u2019s schedule was incompatible with her husband\u2019s needs, the plaintiff resigned and accepted early <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>retirement. The plaintiff was forty-nine years old at the time she resigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">The plaintiff filed suit against Michigan Bell in 1983, alleging constructive discharge and age and sex discrimination. After removal to federal court, reinstatement in state circuit court, summary disposition motions, and mediation, the case was tried by a jury in April, 1991. At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s proofs, the defendant moved for a directed verdict, which was taken under advisement by the trial court. After the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, defendant renewed its motion for directed verdict, which the trial court granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s directed verdict. Although it concluded that the plaintiff had been constructively discharged, it agreed with the trial court that the plaintiff had not proven that age was a determining factor in the defendant\u2019s decision. One judge dissented, arguing that the plaintiff had presented adequate evidence of discrimination by discrediting the defendant\u2019s explanation of its decision. Citing <em>St Mary\u2019s Honor Center v Hicks,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the dissenting judge argued that, once the employer\u2019s explanation was discredited, the jury could, but was not required to, find that the real explanation for the employer\u2019s decision was discriminatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">We granted leave to appeal and consolidated this case with <em>McConnell v Rollins Burdick Hunter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">A claim of age discrimination may be shown under ordinary principles of proof by the use of direct or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>indirect evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Alternatively, many courts, including this one,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> have used the prima facie test articulated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp v </em>Green<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as a framework for evaluating age-discrimination claims. Originally applied to cases of race discrimination, the test has been modified to accommodate cases of age and sex discrimination.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The modified <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>prima facie approach requires an employee to show that the employee was (1) a member of a protected class, (2) subject to an adverse employment action, (3) qualified for the position, and that (4) others, similarly situated and outside the protected class, were unaffected by the employer\u2019s adverse conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">The purpose of the prima facie test is to 1) remove the most common nondiscriminatory reasons for the employer\u2019s action,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> such as poor employee performance, and 2) to force the employer to articulate a nondiscriminatory reason for the discharge.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Once the employer produces evidence of a nondiscriminatory reason for the discharge, even if that reason later turns out to be incredible, the presumption of discrimination evaporates.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">After the employer has met its burden of production, the employee must proceed without the benefit of the earlier presumptions. However, elimination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>the presumption does \u201cnot imply that the trier of fact no longer may consider evidence previously introduced by the plaintiff to establish a prima facie case.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As the United States Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-4\">A satisfactory explanation by the defendant destroys the legally mandatory inference of discrimination arising from the plaintiff\u2019s initial evidence. Nonetheless, this evidence and inferences properly drawn therefrom may be considered by the trier of fact on the issue of whether the defendant\u2019s explanation is pretextaal. Indeed, there may be some cases where the plaintiff\u2019s initial evidence, combined with the effective cross-examination of the defendant, will suffice to discredit the defendant\u2019s explanation. [<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Therefore, \u201cthe evidence and inferences that properly can be drawn from the evidence presented during the plaintiff\u2019s prima facie case may be considered in determining whether the defendant\u2019s explanation is pretextual.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Once the presumption drops out of the case, the plaintiff retains the ultimate burden of proving discrimination. Plaintiff has the opportunity to come forward with evidence, including the previously produced evidence establishing the prima facie case, sufficient to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the discrimination was defendant\u2019s true motive in making the adverse employment decision.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>To prevail, the employee must submit admissible evidence to prove that the employer\u2019s nondiscriminatory reason was not the true reason for the discharge and that the plaintiff\u2019s age was a motivating factor in the employer\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, the employee must prove that the employer\u2019s explanation was a pretext for discrimination. The proofs offered in support of the prima facie case may be sufficient to create a triable issue of fact that the employer\u2019s stated reason is a pretext, as long as the evidence would enable a reasonable factfinder to infer that the employer\u2019s decision had a discriminatory basis.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u201cThe strength of the prima facie case and the significance of the disbelieved pretext will vary from case to case depending on the circumstances. In short, everything depends on the individual facts.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Ultimately, the plaintiff will have the burden of producing evidence, whether direct or circumstantial, that proves that discrimination was a determining factor in the employer\u2019s decision. Although the majority decision in <em>Hicks </em>appeared to be unambiguous, \u201cmany readers have found it to be otherwise.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-6\">The effect of <em>Hicks </em>on employer-brought summary judgment motions has been a matter of particular debate. Some employers have argued that, in order to defeat an employer\u2019s motion for summary judgment, <em>Hicks </em>requires plaintiffs to offer substantial evidence <em>both </em>that the employer\u2019s articulated reason was false <em>and </em>that the employer\u2019s true reason was <em>discriminatory </em>\u2014 i.e., a \u201cpretext-plus\u201d standard. Some plaintiffs, on the other hand, have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>argued that once a prima facie case of discrimination is put forward, summary judgment for the employer <em>never </em>is appropriate, even if no evidence is put forward to refute the employer\u2019s articulated nondiscriminatory reason, because the factfinder\u2019s disbelief alone should be enough to permit a finding of pretext.[<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">We decline to adopt either extreme, and, instead, favor an intermediate position, which is the predominant view among the federal circuits. We would hold that when viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the evidence must create a material issue of fact on which reasonable minds could conclude that the employer\u2019s stated reason is a pretext for discrimination for summary judgment to be precluded. Thus, plaintiff will not <em>always </em>present a triable issue of fact merely by rebutting the employer\u2019s stated reason(s); \u201cput differently, that there may be a triable question of <em>falsity </em>does not necessarily mean that there is a triable question of discrimination.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Furthermore, we note that in accordance with nine other federal circuits, \u201cevidence sufficient to discredit a defendant\u2019s proffered nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions, taken together with the plaintiff\u2019s prima facie case, [may be] sufficient to support (but not require) a finding of discrimination.\u2019\u2019<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> \u201cWhere . . . either direct or circumstantial evidence from which a fact-finder could rationally conclude that the employer\u2019s stated reason is a pretext for discrimination, summary judgment normally should be denied.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b785-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>m</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">In light of these principles, we turn to McConnell\u2019s case. Defendants RBH and MMD argue that the plaintiff was not qualified to perform his job, and is therefore unable to satisfy the qualification element of the prima facie case. An employee is qualified if he was performing his job at a level that met the employer\u2019s legitimate expectations.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> By all accounts, the plaintiff\u2019s performance was less than stellar. Indeed, the plaintiff failed to generate enough revenue to pay his own salary. In his first full year, 1989, the plaintiff generated $70,505.11 in revenue while drawing a salary of $84,351.25 during the same period. He was terminated at the end of that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Rather than evaluate plaintiff\u2019s case at the prima facie stage, however, in this case we elect to presume that plaintiff has established a prima facie case. The purpose of the prima facie case is to force the defendant to provide a nondiscriminatory explanation for the adverse employment action. That purpose having been served, we move to the plaintiff\u2019s evidence that the defendant\u2019s proffered nondiscriminatory reason is a pretext for discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">We conclude that plaintiff\u2019s evidence of pretext would have been insufficient to overcome the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. First, the plaintiff argues that his alleged replacement, Lucinda Lawrence, was held to a different standard of performance than he was. To create an inference of disparate treatment, McConnell must prove that he and Law<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>rence were similarly situated, i.e., \u201call of the relevant aspects\u201d of his employment situation were \u201cnearly identical\u201d to those of Lawrence\u2019s employment situation.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> One relevant aspect of the two employees, their salaries, was far from identical. McConnell was paid a base salary of $67,481, while Lawrence\u2019s base salary was $24,000. Additionally, McConnell received benefits that Lawrence did not, such as a private club membership and a leased car. Further, McConnell had over twenty-five years of experience, while Lawrence had much less comparable experience. The most significant distinction between the two employees, however, is that McConnell failed to generate enough sales to cover his own salary, while Lawrence generated sales equivalent to nearly 2.3 times her salary in her first year. Thus, Lawrence was not similarly situated to McConnell because her performance was proportionately higher. A more apt comparison would have been for McConnell to compare himself to another employee who failed to generate enough sales to cover his salary, but who was retained. Accordingly, we conclude that the two employees were not \u201cnearly identical\u201d on a \u201crelevant aspect\u201d of their respective jobs, namely, performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">Second, we also acknowledge the fact that the plaintiff was employed with the defendant for a relatively brief time.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-6\">[I]n cases where the hirer and the firer are the same individual and the termination of employment occurs within a relatively short time span following the hiring, a strong inference exists that discrimination was not a determining factor for the adverse action taken by the employer.[<footnotemark>24</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>The plaintiff has argued that the \u201csame actor\u201d inference should not apply because he was transferred, not hired, as the result of a merger between MMD and rbh. The characterization of plaintiff\u2019s job change is not determining, however, because the same person who discharged the plaintiff, Sandy McMillan, had sole authority to bring plaintiff into his organization. Thus, the \u201csame actor\u201d inference applies because McMillan both approved plaintiff\u2019s \u201ctransfer\u201d from MMD and discharged plaintiff within a period of eighteen months. Because the possibility that the manager at rbh would \u201cdevelop [] an aversion to older people\u201d within an eighteen-month period is remote, at best, we conclude that the plaintiff\u2019s brief tenure with rbh creates an inference that rbh\u2019s decision did not have a discriminatory basis.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Taking the above inference in combination with the paucity of McConnell\u2019s other evidence, we conclude that he did not submit evidence of pretext sufficient to enable a reasonable factfinder to infer that the employer\u2019s decision had a discriminatory basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Accordingly, we would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the trial court\u2019s grant of summary disposition in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">The plaintiff in <em>Town v Michigan Bell </em>alleges both age and sex discrimination in violation of the Michigan Civil Rights Act.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>The defendant, Michigan Bell, contends that the plaintiff was transferred because of an overall reduction in its workforce. The plaintiff\u2019s supervisor, Tom Rodgers, testified that he was advised that he had to reduce the number of managers in the department. This fact was not disputed by the plaintiff. Further, Rodgers offered a plausible explanation for transferring the plaintiff. According to the defendant, Aveck\u2019s marketing skills were superior to those of the plaintiff. Additionally, the defendant claimed that the plaintiff had taken too long to develop her staff and had not spent adequate time visiting customers at their places of business. Because the defendant\u2019s burden of production is met by the introduction of evidence that would \u201csupport a finding that unlawful discrimination was not the cause of the employment action,\u201d we conclude that the defendant presented sufficient evidence to sustain its burden of production and dissolve the plaintiff\u2019s prima facie case.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">In <em>Matras, </em>we held that if an employee is discharged because of a reduction in the employer\u2019s workforce, the employee must also present \u201csufficient evidence on the ultimate question,\u201d namely, whether the employee\u2019s age or sex was a determining factor in the employer\u2019s decision to discharge that employee.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">A layoff in the context of an overall workforce reduction provides a nondiscriminatory explanation for the plaintiff\u2019s discharge. This puts the plaintiff\u2019s case in the same posture as it would be after the employer articulates <em>any </em>legitimate nondiscriminatory explanation in response to the plaintiff\u2019s prima <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>facie case. Once the employer offers such an explanation, the presumption of the prima facie case \u2014 that the employee\u2019s discharge was discriminatory \u2014 evaporates and is no longer relevant.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The plaintiff can no longer rely on the inference of discrimination in the prima facie case, and the evidence must be evaluated in light of the rational inferences it will support.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">The question is whether the plaintiff presented sufficient evidence, taken in a favorable light, to find that age discrimination was a determining factor in the decision to discharge the plaintiff.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> In reviewing a trial court\u2019s grant of a directed verdict, we examine the testimony and all legitimate inferences that may be drawn from it in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s trial strategy was to show that her qualifications were superior to those of Aveck\u2019s. The plaintiff\u2019s former job was as a marketing manager. Although the plaintiff had some marketing experience, her primary experience had been as a manager. Aveck\u2019s experience, on the other hand, had been primarily in marketing and was more extensive than the plaintiff\u2019s. Predictably, much of the trial testimony concerned whether management or marketing skills were more important to the position.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">We agree with the Court of Appeals conclusion that Aveck was qualified for the position. In her testimony, the plaintiff conceded that Aveck was \u201cprobably qualified\u201d for the position, and Aveck testified that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>trained, in his capacity as an instructor, all the personnel that he would be supervising. Further, marketing experience was relevant to the position. Thus, the plaintiffs argument that she was more qualified than Aveck focused on the soundness of Michigan Bell\u2019s selection of one competent employee over another, as opposed to the veracity of its explanation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-5\">[T]he plaintiff cannot simply show that the employer\u2019s decision was wrong or mistaken, since the factual dispute at issue is whether discriminatory animus motivated the employer, not whether the employer is wise, shrewd, prudent, or competent.[<footnotemark>32</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">The comparison was not between an unqualified employee and a qualified employee, but instead between two qualified employees. The plaintiff\u2019s proofs, at most, merely raise questions about Michigan Bell\u2019s business judgment. Accordingly, the plaintiff did not create an issue of fact regarding whether the defendant\u2019s nondiscriminatory explanation for the plaintiff\u2019s transfer was a pretext, much less a pretext for discrimination.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Further, the plaintiff never overcame Michigan Bell\u2019s allegation that she had taken too long to develop her staff and had not spent adequate time visiting customers at their places of business. Under these circumstances, this Court will not second-guess an employer\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">The dissenting Court of Appeals judge argued that the trial court improperly entered a directed verdict for the defendants. The dissenter argued that \u201cthe jury\u2019s apparent disbelief of Rodgers\u2019 testimony, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>together with the other evidence in the case, was sufficient to permit the jury to infer the requisite intentional discrimination.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Other than the presumptions of the plaintiffs prima facie case, we find no evidence in the record to support an inference of discriminatory animus. Relying on <em>Hicks, supra, </em>the dissenter argued that a jury may draw an inference of discrimination solely from its disbelief of the employer\u2019s reason for the discharge. We agree, however, that this merely acknowledges that evidence of falsity may create an inference of discrimination. The <em>Hicks </em>Court was unequivocal about not replacing the plaintiff\u2019s burden of proving discrimination with the lesser burden of proving falsity, as the following passages demonstrate.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-4\">But nothing in law would permit us to substitute for the required finding that the employer\u2019s action was the product of unlawful discrimination, the much different (and much lesser) finding that the employer\u2019s explanation of its action was not believable.[<footnotemark>35</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-5\">[The plaintiff must show] <em>both </em>that the reason was false, and that discrimination was the real reason. [Emphasis in original.][<footnotemark>36</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-6\">It is not enough ... to disbelieve the employer; the factfinder must believe the plaintiff\u2019s explanation of intentional discrimination.[<footnotemark>37</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-7\">Even though (as we say here) rejection of the defendant\u2019s proffered reasons is enough at law to sustain a finding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>discrimination, <em>there must be a finding of discrimination. </em>[Emphasis in original.][<footnotemark>38</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-5\">\u201c[N]one of this means that trial courts or reviewing courts should treat discrimination differently from other ultimate questions of fact.\u201d[<footnotemark>39</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">Taken as a whole, <em>Hicks </em>indicates that, under some circumstances, a plaintiff may create an inference of discrimination through the introduction of evidence showing that the employer\u2019s proffered reason is false. Yet, a plaintiff will not always present a triable issue of fact merely by rebutting the employer\u2019s stated reasons. \u201c[T]hat there may be a triable question of falsity does not necessarily mean that there is a triable question of discrimination.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> This point is demonstrated by the final disposition of the <em>Hicks </em>case. On remand, the district court concluded that the defendant\u2019s proffered reason for discharging Hicks \u2014 alleged rule violations \u2014 was a pretext.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The court was not persuaded that the defendant\u2019s actions were based on a discriminatoiy animus, however, and it entered a judgment for the defendant, which was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">We conclude that the plaintiff in the present case failed to introduce sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that age or sex discrimination was a determining factor in Michigan Bell\u2019s decision to transfer her. Because we would hold that the plaintiff did not present sufficient evidence of discrimina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>tion, the issue whether the plaintiff\u2019s transfer constituted a constructive discharge is moot. The judgment of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">In conclusion, we would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>McConnell v Rollins Burdick Hunter, </em>and reinstate the trial court\u2019s grant of summary disposition.

The job standards and requirements, however, are to be reasonable and consistently applied. <em>Id. </em>As noted by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in <em>Kephart v Institute of Gas Technology, </em>630 F2d 1217, 1219 (CA 7, 1980):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-5\">Qualification obviously depends on the nature of . . . business at any given time. ...

See <em>Hazen Paper Co v Biggins, </em>507 US 604, 611; 113 S Ct 1701; 123 L Ed 2d 338 (1993), quoting <em>Western Air Lines, Inc v Criswell, </em>472 US 400, 422; 105 S Ct 2743; 86 L Ed 2d 321 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">In the instant case, reviewing plaintiffs proofs and drawing any reasonable inferences in his favor, I conclude that he presented evidence establishing a question of fact regarding whether he was minimally qualified. He stated that he thought his job performance was better than those situated similarly to him.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He also noted that, not only did other producers have to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>increase their production but, except for Thomas O\u2019Meara, he may have been producing the most.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">As to whether he was replaced, Bonnie Morton testified that Lucinda Lawrence assumed a majority of plaintiff\u2019s accounts. Defendant contends that Lutz assumed most of the responsibility for plaintiff\u2019s accounts; however, whether Lawrence replaced plaintiff must be left to the province of the trier of fact because it involves findings of fact and weighing credibility.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Because plaintiff was fifty-six years old at the time of his discharge and others similarly situated and outside the protected class were not affected by defendant\u2019s adverse employment action, as well as the dispute surrounding whether Lawrence replaced plaintiff, I conclude that he established a prima facie case of age discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">In rebutting the presumption of discrimination, defendant asserted that plaintiff was discharged for poor performance. Plaintiff argues that defendant\u2019s proffered explanation is merely a pretext for age discrimination. He asserts that defendant committed age discrimination by discharging him and replacing him with the younger Lucinda Lawrence. Plaintiff contends that Sandy McMillan, his supervisor, informed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>him \u201cthat he was expected to generate revenue equal to 3 times his salary and benefit package.\u201d He also contends that \u201cLawrence was not held to this same standard.\u201d However, there is no support in the record for plaintiffs claim that he was expected to generate revenue of two to three times his salary. Plaintiffs claim amounts to an unsubstantiated self-serving allegation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Plaintiff places great weight on defendant\u2019s hiring of Lawrence. However, Lawrence was merely his replacement, not someone who was similarly situated.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It appears, on the basis of the evidence he presented, that Lutz was plaintiff\u2019s best comparison.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Lutz testified that he at least \u201ccovered [his] salary and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>fringes.\u201d Yet, as the lead opinion observes, \u201cplaintiff generated $70,505.11 in revenue while drawing a salary of $84,351.25 . . . .\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 699. Not only does the record indicate that Lutz generated more than plaintiff, but O\u2019Meara generated more as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">The record also evidences that defendant was reasonable in its treatment of plaintiff. In January 1989, McMillan informed plaintiff that he needed to increase his production. The following September, plaintiff testified that he met with McMillan and Thomas O\u2019Meara, plaintiff\u2019s direct supervisor, for a performance evaluation. In that meeting, they informed him that his employment was in jeopardy, barring cognizable improvement in production by year-end.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Plaintiff did not increase his production and, on January 22, 1990, McMillan discharged him for poor performance.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">I conclude that there is no evidence \u201cthat the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Texas Dep\u2019t of Community Affairs v Burdine, </em>450 US 248, 256; 101 S Ct 1089; 67 L Ed 2d 207 (1981), citing <em>McDonnell Douglas, supra </em>at 804-805. The record now before us amply demonstrates that plaintiff had a full and fair opportunity to prove age discrimination \u2014 evidence of which I find lacking.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b793-8\"> <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp v Green, </em>411 US 792; 93 S Ct 1817; 36 L Ed 2d 668 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b793-9\"> I agree with the lead opinion that plaintiff Town failed to establish that defendant\u2019s adverse employment action was a pretext to age and sex discrimination. Merely because Town believed that she was more qualified than James Aveck is not enough to carry her burden of persuasion under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>approach. The Civil Rights Act \u201cprotects, [not the qualified worker, but] as a practical matter, the imperfect older worker from being treated worse than the imperfect younger one.\u201d See <em>Shager v Upjohn Co, </em>913 F2d 398, 403 (CA 7, 1990). In Town\u2019s case, both she and Aveck were qualified. Hence, it became purely a business decision when defendant decided to transfer her, and this Court should be reluctant to second-guess management.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b793-10\"> The lead opinion also errs in concluding that \u201cplaintiff\u2019s brief tenure with [Rollins Burdick Hunter] creates an inference that RBH\u2019s decision did not have a discriminatory basis.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 701. It reaches its conclusion by claiming McConnell was both hired and discharged by the same manager within a period of eighteen months. <em>Id. </em>I disagree. First, plaintiff was not hired by the same \u201cactor\u201d that discharged him. RBH assumed all liability of Miller, Mason, and Dickenson, Inc.\u2019s debts. Hence, plaintiff, along with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>two other employees, was transferred from MMD to RBH. They were not considered new hirees; no new employment application was completed and plaintiffs personnel folder disclosed that plaintiffs date of hire with RBH was April 1, 1986, the date he commenced his employment with MMD. Second, assuming plaintiff was hired and discharged by the same actor, \u201cthis is simply evidence like any other and should not be accorded any presumptive value.\u201d <em>Waldron v SL Industries, Inc, </em>56 F3d 491, 496, n 6 (CA 3, 1995).

The question before the court is not whether the company\u2019s methods were sound, or whether its dismissal of Kephart was an error of business judgment.

Hence, because plaintiff was on notice that he had to increase his production, I conclude that defendant justifiably considered his salary and total benefits in relation to his productivity as grounds for his discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-15\">In <em>Anderson v Baxter Healthcare Corp, </em>13 F3d 1120, 1125-1126 (CA 7, 1994), quoting in part <em>Metz v Transit Mix, Inc, </em>828 F2d 1202, 1212 (CA 7, 1987) (Easterbrook, J., dissenting), the court noted that the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>Court\u2019s decision in <em>\u201cHazen Paper Co </em>vindicates the dissent in <em>Metz </em>which contended that \u2018[w]age discrimination is age discrimination only when wage depends directly on age, so that the use for one is a pretext for the other; high covariance is not sufficient ....\u2019\u201d In <em>Metz, supra </em>at 1212-1213, Judge Easterbrook stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-9\">[E]mployers always should be entitled to consider the relation between a particular employee\u2019s wage and his productivity. . . . Many people under 40 (the lower bound of the protected group) earn $26,000 or more; if such a salary exposes them to discharge on economic grounds, then it should expose older employees to discharge. <em>You do not get immunity from an otherwise lawful employment decision by growing old. </em>As my colleagues say, the \u201cADEA is aimed at protecting the individual employee\u201d but what it protects each employee against is age discrimination. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b800-6\">Cavanagh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJ8\"><em>(concurring in part and dissenting in part). </em>I concur with the majority that plaintiff McConnell established a prima facie case of discrimination, but failed to present sufficient evidence so that defendant\u2019s actions were a result of illegal discrimination. However, I respectfully dissent from the lead opinion that would hold that plaintiff Town failed to present sufficient evidence so that reasonable minds could conclude age was a determining factor in plaintiff\u2019s constructive discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">As to plaintiff McConnell, I agree with Justice Riley that plaintiff presented sufficient evidence to satisfy a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>prima facie case of age discrimination. As she noted, concerns about a plaintiffs performance are more appropriately considered at the second and third stages of the <em>McDonnell </em>Douglas<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> burden-shifting test. This is especially true where, as here, plaintiff has alleged that other employees were also performing as poorly as he. Therefore, defendant\u2019s reason for firing plaintiff was because he was not <em>performing </em>well, not that he was <em>unqualified.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">I disagree with Justice Brickley\u2019s conclusion that, because plaintiff\u2019s manager hired and fired plaintiff within a relatively short period of time, no reasonable jury could find that discrimination was the cause of the termination. Initially, as plaintiff indicates, he was not hired by the same manager that fired him because McMillan was not the person who decided to hire plaintiff. The record establishes that in 1988, plaintiff was told that mmd of Michigan (plaintiffs former employer) would be merging with defendant. Mr. McMillan characterized this activity as a \u201cmerger.\u201d Furthermore, plaintiff was not required to fill out an employment application or go through any of the typical new hire process. Therefore, taken in the light most favorable to plaintiff, Justice Brickley\u2019s assertion that the same actor hired and fired plaintiff is factually incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">In addition to the factual inaccuracies, I would decline to adopt a rigid test for determining whether plaintiff was discriminated against. Justice Brickley\u2019s approach can be characterized as the \u201csame actor inference.\u201d Even assuming that Mr. McMillan was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>same person who hired and fired plaintiff, the inference should not be used by the defendant as a shield from liability; rather, the inference should be used as mere evidence in <em>support </em>of defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">In <em>Waldron v SL Industries, Inc, </em>56 F3d 491, 496, n 6 (CA 3, 1995), the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit rejected the same actor inference, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-6\">[W]e agree with the position advanced by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as amicus curiae: \u201cwhere . . . the hirer and firer are the same and the discharge occurred soon after the plaintiff was hired, the defendant may of course argue to the factfinder that it should not find discrimination. But this is simply evidence like any other and should not be accorded any presumptive value.\u201d . . . Additionally, as the eeoc further notes, it was plausible under the evidence presented at summary judgment that [the defendant] would hire [the plaintiff], use his skills for a few years while a younger person was being \u201cgroomed\u201d for his position, then fire [the plaintiff] because of his age.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">Likewise, the Iowa Supreme Court has also rejected the \u201csame actor inference\u201d in <em>Vaughan v Must, Inc, </em>542 NW2d 533, 539 (Iowa, 1996). It stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-8\">To apply such a wooden rule in an area where each case is factually distinct would effectively grant every employer a grace period at the beginning of each employee\u2019s tenure . . . with no fear of sanctions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">Therefore, I believe that the inference of nonbias is an evidentiary matter for the finder of fact to consider, and should not be a something upon which the court should decide a case as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">However, I concur with Justice Riley that plaintiff failed to present sufficient evidence upon which rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>sonable minds could conclude that age was a determining factor in defendant\u2019s decision to fire him. Plaintiff contends that he was expected to generate revenue equal to three times his salary and benefit package, and that others were not held to the same standard. However, even if others were not making \u201cthree times\u201d their salary and benefits, it is undisputed that plaintiff was not even generating revenue equal to \u201cone time\u201d his salary and benefits. Furthermore, while it is true that plaintiff presented evidence that production was down across the board, he did not present any figures demonstrating that other employees who were generating less revenue than \u201cone time\u201d their salary were retained by the employer. In short, plaintiff failed to show that persons who were performing as poorly as he was were treated differently. Therefore, I concur with the majority that plaintiff McConnell failed to show that reasonable minds could conclude that plaintiff was being discriminated against on the basis of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">As to plaintiff Town, the majority would hold that because both plaintiff and Aveck were qualified for their positions, it was purely a business decision for defendant to retain Aveck. I disagree. While it is true that courts should not second-guess the sound business decisions of an employer, an employer\u2019s actions are not entirely beyond review. Where, as here, the plaintiff has alleged that the decision was not a sound business decision, but rather the product of illegal discrimination, we must review the proofs in the light most favorable to plaintiff to determine whether reasonable minds could conclude that age was a determining factor in its decision to transfer plaintiff. We cannot simply accept defendant\u2019s assertion that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>decision was a business decision without having viewed the record in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">The majority concludes that, because both employees were qualified, the decision of the employer should stand. However, the majority ignores the proofs plaintiff presented at trial, which, taken in the light most favorable to her, would indicate that she was <em>more </em>qualified than Aveck. As noted by the Court of Appeals dissenting judge,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-6\">Part of [plaintiff\u2019s] strategy was to show that the testimony of Tom Rodgers, plaintiff\u2019s supervisor, regarding Aveck\u2019s and plaintiff\u2019s qualifications was unworthy of belief. A reasonable trier of fact could have concluded, after evaluating Rodgers\u2019 testimony, that Rodgers was unfamiliar with Aveck\u2019s skills, that plaintiff\u2019s skills and qualifications were superior to Aveck\u2019s, that Rodgers\u2019 stated reasons for choosing Aveck were a pretext, <em>and that plaintiffs age and sex were determining factors in Rodgers\u2019 decision. </em>[Unpublished opinion, issued February 16, 1995 (Docket No. 144980) (White, J., dissenting), slip op, p 1 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">Furthermore, I agree with the dissenting judge that a plaintiff must do more than simply disprove a proffered reason. <em>Id. </em>Here, plaintiff did not rely solely on the fact that she lost her job to a younger, male employee. Rather, she also presented evidence that she was <em>more </em>qualified than Aveck. Furthermore, she presented evidence that the defendant violated <em>its own policy </em>on involuntary transfers when it transferred her rather than Aveck who had substantially less seniority than plaintiff. Finally, plaintiff presented evidence that the reason she was involuntarily transferred in violation of the company\u2019s internal policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>was because it knew that she could not accept the new position because she could not work the evening hours the job required, and that she previously refused the same position, thus creating a likelihood that the older employee would retire. Plaintiff presented sufficient evidence so that reasonable minds could conclude that a motivating factor in involuntarily transferring plaintiff was her age. Indeed, reasonable minds did conclude that age was a determining factor, as evidenced by the jury\u2019s verdict in plaintiff\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Unlike the majority, I would hold that it was up to the jury to decide whether defendant discriminated against plaintiff. The majority has improperly assumed the role of the jury by concluding that defendant, as a matter of law, did not discriminate against plaintiff. Obviously, reasonable minds can and have disagreed with the majority. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b805-6\">Mallett, C.J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b805-7\">Kelly, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J., only in <em>Town.</em></judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b801-7\"> <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp v Green, </em>411 US 792; 93 S Ct 1817; 36 L Ed 2d 668 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
