We also conclude that an employee must also prove wage loss in order to establish a <em>compensable </em>disability. To prove wage loss, an employee demonstrates that, as a consequence of work-related injury or disease, he has suffered a reduction in his earning capacity. The amount of benefits is based on the employee\u2019s actual wage loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">In application, these basic principles operate to require that an employee must establish (1) a work-related injury, (2) subsequent loss in actual wages, and (3) a causal link between the two. Proof of the three elements will establish that an employee can no longer perform at least a single job within his qualifications and training, thus satisfying the first sentence of subsection 301(4), <em>and </em>that he has suffered a loss in wages, satisfying the second sentence of subsec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>tion 301(4).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Consistent with the language of subsection 301(4) proofs sufficient to permit the magistrate to find that the subsequent wage loss is attributable to the work-related injury establish a compensable disability. Absence of residual earning capacity is not part of the threshold definition of disability.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">In <em>Haske v Transport Leasing, Inc, </em>we hold that the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appellate Commission applied the wrong definition of disability in reversing the magistrate\u2019s grant of benefits for a partial disability. We affirm the Court of Appeals decision and remand to the wcac to determine whether the award of benefits was supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">In <em>Bailey v Leoni Twp, </em>the magistrate found that Bailey did not produce evidence that he suffered a loss of his earning capacity, but did so only in the context of applying an erroneous definition of disability. The wcac applied the proper definition of disability and calculated benefits, but incorrectly stated that the magistrate found as fact that the employee was partially disabled. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the WCAC. Thus, both appellate tribunals applied the correct definition of disability, but neither recognized that the magistrate did not make a factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>finding of disability. We remand to the magistrate for further findings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"Anh\">\n<em>HASKE v TRANSPORT LEASING</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Plaintiff Andrew Haske worked for defendant Transport Leasing as a tractor-trailer driver. On May 18, 1987, he was injured in the course of his employment when his truck tipped over. He suffered injuries to his left arm and leg, and to his neck, which prevented him from engaging in heavy lifting. Haske did not return to Transport Leasing because he was unable to perform the heavy lifting associated with the job. On January 27, 1988, Haske began working for Woodlands Harvesting, driving a truck and hauling woodchips, gravel, and rocks. However, he had to stop working in early October, 1988 because the job also required heavy lifting that was too difficult for him as a result of his injury. On October 10, 1988, he began working for Enterprise Leasing as a road driver. He said this job was \u201ceasy\u201d and that his injury did not prevent him from performing it effectively. In fiscal 1990, he earned approximately $10,500 at this job. His average weekly wage at Transport Leasing had been $596.75 a week, or approximately $31,045 a year, and he had earned $377.99 a week with Woodlands Harvesting, or approximately $19,760 a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">Haske filed a claim for worker\u2019s compensation in December, 1987. In the opinion dated October 28, 1991, the magistrate granted him an open award of $239.46 in weekly payments of worker\u2019s compensation as a partial disability payment. By an amended order, the magistrate increased this payment by $117.63 a week. The magistrate found that Haske was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>totally disabled from the time of his injury, May 18, 1987, until he found work with Woodlands Harvesting on January 27, 1988, and thereafter that he was partially disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">Transport Leasing appealed to the wcac. In a two to one decision, the wcac reversed the grant of worker\u2019s compensation payments, except for the payments he received for the time he was totally disabled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-5\">[W]e believe that the Magistrate improperly focused on plaintiff\u2019s physical limitations as opposed to the limitations on his wage-earning capacity. MCL 418.301(4) [MSA 17.237(301)(4)]. The relevant inquiry is whether plaintiff has the ability to work at any other type of job by virtue of his qualifications and training. A physical limitation is not the equivalent of a \u201climitation of an employee\u2019s wage-earning capacity,\u201d because wage-earning capacity is not necessarily defined by physical ability alone. [1993 Mich ACO 1300, 1302.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Thus, the wcac found that Haske had not suffered a loss of wage-earning capacity because he \u201c[was] still able to perform work within his qualifications and training\u201d as evidenced by his subsequent employments. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">The Court of Appeals granted leave to appeal and reversed and remanded in an unpublished per curiam opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-8\">Although the wcac majority correctly noted that physical limitation is not necessarily dispositive of wage earning capacity, it incorrectly concluded that plaintiff could suffer no loss of wage earning capacity as long as he remained capable of performing any work suitable to his qualifications and training. To the contrary, the relevant inquiry is whether there are any jobs suitable to plaintiff\u2019s qualifications and training which he is no longer fully capable of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>performing as a result of his work injury, not whether there are any other jobs suitable to his qualifications and training which he is still capable of performing. [Issued March 2, 1995 (Docket No. 167920).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">The Court of Appeals remanded the case to the wcac for a determination whether the magistrate\u2019s award was supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Transport Leasing appealed in this Court, and we granted leave to appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">\n<em>BAILEY v LEONI TWP</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">Plaintiff John Bailey worked as a firefighter for defendant Leoni Township beginning in 1966. On July 21, 1987, he was injured while attempting to pull a driver from a vehicle, suffering sharp pain in his neck and shoulder. Bailey stopped working as a result of the injury in September 1987. On November 8, 1987, he returned to work, performing restricted duty of inspecting buildings. He continued to work until March 1988. While working for Leoni Township, Bailey also worked as a self-employed, part-time electrical contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">In May, 1988, Bailey had surgery performed on his neck, removing a disk and fusing one of the neck bones. In September 1988, Dr. Rawal sent a note to Leoni Township regarding Bailey\u2019s physical condition. The township responded that the only work available was full duty, as opposed to light duty, and, consequently, that there was no work available for Bailey. After Bailey exhausted his sick leave with the township, the township informed him that he was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>longer an employee. In 1987, Bailey had been working a day or two a week as an electrical contractor, and, after convalescing from his surgery, he resumed his work in 1988 as an electrical contractor, now working approximately three days a week.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">In June, 1988, Bailey sought worker\u2019s compensation. In an opinion dated November 27, 1989, the magistrate awarded him only \u201creasonable and related medical expenses\u201d for his injury, but denied him weekly benefits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-5\">Plaintiff has two suitable, skilled [employments] for which he is qualified[ \u2014 [electrician and fireman. Even if he is unable to continue to work as a fireman, does he have a loss of wage-earning capacity if he is still able to work full time as a[n] electrician]?] No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-6\">I believe this is precisely the situation the new definition of disability was enacted to address. Here is a man with two skills \u2014 fireman and electrician. Even if [he] is unable to perform one skill, he is still able to do the other. The fact that he is self-employed, works an average of 3 days per week, and earns for tax purposes less than what he makes as a fireman is not determinative of his wage-earning capacity as an electrician. <em>The test of wage-earning capacity is whether he would earn as much working full time as an electrician as he would working full time as a fireman. He never testified that he could not find employment as an electrician or that he even sought such employment. </em>Based on the record, I find his proofs [lacking?] by a preponderance that he is disabled under the new definition of disability. [1990 Mich ACO 1311, 1316 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">Bailey appealed the decision, and the wcac modified the magistrate\u2019s decision. The wcac noted that the magistrate found as fact that Bailey was partially disabled, but denied him benefits because the injury did not impair his work as an electrician. The WCAC found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>that Bailey was impaired in his work as a firefighter and, consequently, that he suffered a limitation of his wage-earning capacity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-6\">The instant plaintiff has a limitation in the skill of firefighting. The Magistrate found as fact that he has a partial disability in the field of his skill. Firefighting, since at least 1966, and until he was injured at it, was work plaintiff could do, and did. No serious argument can be made that it was not work suitable to his qualifications and training. He now has a limitation in his ability to do that work. The fact that he has no great, or any, limitation in his ability to do electrical contracting has no bearing on the inquiry about <em>a limitation </em>in work suitable to his qualifications and training.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-7\">Before the injury, plaintiff\u2019s wage-earning capacity included, inter alia, electrical contracting and firefighting, both suitable to his qualifications and training. He is now impaired in his ability to fight fires, so he has a limitation in his wage-earning capacity in work suitable to his qualifications and training. Probably because he has more time, he now does more electrical contracting than he was doing in July 1987, and to the extent of the increment, defendant is entitled to credit against compensation ordered. <em>[Id. </em>at 1317-1318 (citations omitted; emphasis in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">Leoni Township sought leave to appeal and the Court of Appeals denied leave. On December 30, 1992, this Court remanded the case to the Court of Appeals as on leave granted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On remand, the Court of Appeals affirmed in an unpublished per curiam opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-9\">[Although plaintiff was capable of performing other work which fell within his medical restrictions, he was unable to perform the duties of a firefighter. He suffered a limitation in his ability to perform work suitable to his qualifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>cations and training as a firefighter. Plaintiff is disabled within the meaning of the statutory definition of disability, even though he may be capable of performing other work which falls within his medical restrictions. [Issued May 23, 1995 (Docket No. 160469).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">Leoni Township appealed, and this Court granted leave to appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">I. DEFINITION OF DISABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"ABA\">A. THE STATUTORY LANGUAGE</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">The purpose of the worker\u2019s compensation act, MCL 418.101 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 17.237(101) <em>et seq., </em>is to provide benefits to the victims of work-related injuries by placing the cost of making payments of weekly benefits to disabled employees on the employer. <em>Simkins v General Motors Corp, </em>453 Mich 703, 711; 556 NW2d 839 (1996). The employee must prove by competent evidence under MCL 418.301(1); MSA 17.237(301) that he has received a personal injury arising out of and in the course of his employment in order to qualify for benefits. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>As a threshold matter in proving an injury in chapter 3 of the act, MCL 418.301 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 17.237(301)(1) <em>et seq.,</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the employee must demonstrate that the personal injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>is a work-related <em>disability. </em>See MCL 418.401(2)(b); MSA 17.237(401)(2)(b).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Chapter 3 of the act specifically defines \u201cdisability\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-6\">As used in this chapter, \u201cdisability\u201d means a limitation of an employee\u2019s wage earning capacity in work suitable to his or her qualifications and training resulting from a personal injury or work related disease. The establishment of disability does not create a presumption of wage loss. [MCL 418.301(4); MSA 17.237(301)(4).[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">The sentence defining disability separates the definition of a disability from the concept of wage loss. Hence, there are two relevant inquiries to determine if an employee is entitled to worker\u2019s compensation benefits: (1) whether an employee has proven that a disability exists, and (2) if the employee proves that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>disability exists, whether the employee has proven that the disability resulted in a wage loss. Because wage loss is not presumed, an employee who demonstrates that he has suffered a disability must establish that this disability has resulted in a wage loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">However, in examining the first sentence defining disability, we find that the language is ambiguous because it may reasonably be interpreted to mean either that (1) an employee is disabled only if he suffers a <em>reduction </em>in his wage-earning capacity in all the work he could perform within his qualifications and training before the injury,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> or (2) an employee is disabled if there is at least a single job within his qualifications and training that he can no longer perform because this would be <em>a </em>limitation of his wage-earning capacity. Defendants argue that the first interpretation is the proper one, and plaintiffs contend that the second is the proper one.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The definition was added by the Legislature to the worker\u2019s compensation act by 1981 PA 200, effective March 31, 1982, and the Legislature then amended the definition in 1987 PA 28. Hence, we briefly examine the state of the law before the 1981 amendment, the change the Legislature created in 1981, and the change it intended in 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>B. REVIEW OF THE 1981 AMENDMENT AND THE 1987 REVISION</p>\n<p id=\"A2d\">1. BEFORE THE AMENDMENT OF 1981</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">The worker\u2019s compensation act was initially enacted in 1912 by the Legislature. See <em>Sobotka v Chrysler Corp (After Remand), </em>447 Mich 1, 17; 523 NW2d 454 (1994) (Boyle, J., lead opinion). Before the amendment of 1981, disability was not defined in chapter 3 of the act. The following definition appeared in chapter 4:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-5\">As used in this act:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-6\">(a) \u201cDisability\u201d means the state of being disabled from earning full wages at the work in which the employee was last subject to the conditions resulting in disability.[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">In 1979, two years before the Legislature amended the act to create a new statutory definition of disability, this Court explained that disability was defined as the \u201c \u2018inability to perform the work claimant was doing when injured.\u2019 \u201d <em>Powell v Casco Nelmor Corp, </em>406 Mich 332, 350; 279 NW2d 769 (1979), quoting 2 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, \u00a7 57.53, p 10-129, and citing <em>Allen v Nat\u2019l Twist Drill &amp; Tool Co, </em>324 Mich 660, 663; 37 NW2d 664 (1949) (quoting the definition of disability from \u00a7 417.1, the precursor of subsection 401 [a]).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">Before 1981, the Court developed a distinction between skilled and unskilled labor, see <em>Hutsko v Chrysler Corp, </em>381 Mich 99, 103; 158 NW2d 874 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>(1968),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> even though the statute did not provide for it. In <em>Leitz v Labadie Ice Co, </em>211 Mich 565, 572; 179 NW 291 (1920), the Court explained the difference between these two kinds of work:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-4\">[W]e think it may safely be said that, as generally used and understood, [common labor] signifies that kind of unskilled manual labor with or without simple tools, which is commonly done by the masses of working people in lines of employment necessitating no special trade or previous training before engaging in them beyond what can be quickly learned and effectually performed by the laborer while employed at regular wage under direction of those in charge; as distinguished from that class of skilled and less common manual labor to perform which previous experience, apprenticeship, study, practice or manual training in some special calling, handicraft or trade is required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">This distinction between skilled and unskilled labor was important for determining whether there was a partial or total disability under this chapter of the act. See Welch, Worker\u2019s Compensation in Michigan: Law <em>&amp; </em>Practice (3d ed), \u00a7 8.8, p 8-8. Although Michigan case law does not clearly define total and partial disability, see, e.g., 33 Michigan Digest 2d, Workers\u2019 Compensation, \u00a7 846, pp 119-120, \u00a7 856, pp 123-124, through our holdings we established the general rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>governing the meaning of disability in the context of skilled and unskilled labor.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">A skilled employee was totally disabled if he was unable to perform his skilled position as a result of his injury, even if he was able to earn wages at another kind of employment. See <em>MacDonald v Great Lakes Steel Corp, </em>268 Mich 591, 593; 256 NW 558 (1934).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In contrast, an unskilled employee, or, in other words, an employee working at common labor, was only partially disabled when he was unable to perform his previous job but still able to perform other work \u201cwithin\u201d his employment of common labor. See <em>Miller v S Fair &amp; Sons, </em>206 Mich 360, 364-366; 171 NW 380 (1919). In order to prove total disability, the unskilled employee had to be unable to perform all the jobs within his employment of common labor. See <em>Leitz v Labadie Ice Co, </em>229 Mich 381, 385-386; 201 NW 485 (1924).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, the general rule from case law regarding total and partial disabilities was that an employee is totally disabled if he cannot perform all jobs within his field of employment and is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>partially disabled if he can still perform some jobs within his field of employment. See Welch, Worker\u2019s Compensation (3d ed), <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 8.8, p 8-8.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">2. ENACTMENT OF THE 1981 AMENDMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">In this context, the Legislature added the provision defining disability, subsection 301(4), to the worker\u2019s compensation act in 1981 PA 200, effective March 31, 1982.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> There have been conflicting indications on the meaning of this amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">We determined that the 1981 revisions were designed to modify the expansive interpretations of the act given by this Court. See <em>Dean v Chrysler Corp, </em>434 Mich 655, 666; 455 NW2d 699 (1990). According to the Senate Analysis Section, SB 595, January 7, 1982, p 6, this new provision was designed to \u201ctighten the definition of disability.\u201d Moreover, one of the arguments advanced against the new definition was that it \u201cunjustly penalizes disabled workers, giving them no compensation for injuries which seriously diminish their wage-earning ability if they can find any other kind of work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The legislative intent underlying the amendment, therefore, suggests that the Legislature meant to create a narrow definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>disability, which is consistent with the interpretation of the provision urged by defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Conflicting positions have been taken regarding the possible interpretations of the 1981 amendment. In <em>Dohm v Whirlpool Corp, </em>1989 Mich ACO 16, 17, the wcac expressly rejected the interpretation that an employee must be unable to perform all his work in his field before finding disability. Yet, four years later, in an en banc opinion, the WCAC concluded that the 1981 change was \u201ca dramatic new concept for determining compensable disability\u201d by establishing a new focus on \u201cwage-earning capacity.\u201d <em>Grier v Yellow Freight Systems, </em>1993 Mich ACO 2218, 2224. However, the Court of Appeals concluded that the definition from the 1981 amendment was a codification of the definition of disability that this Court developed in its precedent.

ENACTMENT OF THE 1987 AMENDMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">The statute was amended by 1987 PA 28, which inserted the phrase \u201cwork suitable to his or her qualifications and training\u201d in place of \u201cthe employee\u2019s general field of employment.\u201d According to the Senate Fiscal Agency, SB 67, May 26, 1987, p 1, the revision was enacted to narrow the definition of disability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-5\">Many people believe that the Act\u2019s definition of disability (\u201ca limitation of an employee\u2019s general field of employment resulting from a personal injury or work related disease\u201d) <em>is too broad </em>and, thus, allows an individual to remain designated as \u201cdisabled\u201d even though the individual could work in another capacity for which he or she was trained and qualified but which was not \u201cin the employee\u2019s general field of employment.\u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">In support of the revision, the Senate Fiscal Agency noted that Professor Theodore St. Antoine, who had recommended this change in a 1984 report to Governor James J. Blanchard, indicated that this change would \u201creassure those who believe that the State\u2019s definition of \u2018disability\u2019 is a major flaw in our compensation system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>This Court examined the meaning of the 1987 revision last term in <em>Michales v Morton Salt Co, </em>450 Mich 479, 485-492; 538 NW2d 11 (1995), in reviewing the parallel definition of disability under subsection 401(1) for occupational diseases. We opined that the revision was designed to narrow the scope of an employee\u2019s eligibility for worker\u2019s compensation benefits. <em>Michales, supra </em>at 490. We explained, by relying on Welch, Worker\u2019s Compensation in Michigan: Law &amp; Practice (rev ed), \u00a7 8.10, p 8-11 and \u00a7 8.11, pp 8-14 to 8-15, that this revision operated to reduce the number of positions in employment that could give rise to a claim of disability by redefining the relevant job pool from the broad category of \u201cfield of employment\u201d to the smaller category of \u201cwork suitable to [an employee\u2019s] qualifications and training.\u201d See <em>Michales, supra </em>at 490-491, n 17.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> This understanding of the way in which the Legislature narrowed the definition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>is predicated analytically on the interpretation that an employee is disabled whenever he is rendered unable to perform a single job within the category of jobs he is suited to perform, even if the number he continues to be able to perform is numerous and equally well paying.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">In contrast, under defendants\u2019 interpretation, the 1987 amendment would only operate to narrow the definition of disability if it <em>increased </em>the number of available positions as the relevant job pool for determining whether an employee has suffered an injury. In examining whether an employee can still earn money, if there are more positions that the Court can consider, the employee will have a more difficult time proving that he can no longer earn the same wage for those positions. See <em>Grier, supra </em>at 2224.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Under either analysis, the Legislature evidenced an intent in its 1987 amendment to eliminate the judicially created distinction between skilled and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>unskilled employment. See Welch, Worker\u2019s Compensation (3d ed), \u00a7 8.11, p 8-12.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">By our reasoning in <em>Michales, </em>we suggested that the Legislature intended to provide a definition of disability that is consistent with one urged by plaintiffs. Yet, our understanding of the legislative intent from <em>Dean </em>of the 1981 amendment suggests that the narrow interpretation of disability now urged by defendants was the proper one. Although this background of the statute is helpful in explaining the history of our approach to conflicting interpretation, it does not provide a clear answer to the question before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">C. THIS COURT\u2019S PREVIOUS INTERPRETATION OF SUBSECTION 301(4)</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">We recently rejected the interpretation of the provision that we now reconsider in <em>Rea v Regency Olds/Mazda/Volvo, </em>450 Mich 1201; 536 NW2d 542 (1995). In Rea, the Court of Appeals had held that \u201can employee is \u2018disabled\u2019 ... if the employee suffers from any limitation in wage-earning capacity in work suitable to the employee\u2019s qualifications and training.\u201d 204 Mich App 516, 523; 517 NW2d 251 (1994).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> On the basis of this definition, it concluded that the plaintiff was disabled under the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-8\">[Plaintiff] has suffered a limitation in his ability to perform work suitable to his qualifications and training, in particular the work he was previously doing for defendant. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>is disabled even though he may be capable of performing other unskilled work which falls within his medical restrictions. [204 Mich App 524.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">Hence, according to the Court of Appeals, the plaintiff was injured because he was not able to perform a single position suitable to his qualifications and training, i.e., his previous position.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">We reversed the Court of Appeals decision in an order by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-6\"><em>It is not enough for the claimant claiming partial disability to show an inability to return to the same or similar work. </em>If the claimant\u2019s physical limitation does not affect the ability to earn wages in work in which the claimant is qualified and trained, the claimant is not disabled. [450 Mich 1201 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">In rejecting the Court of Appeals interpretation, we noted that an employee must prove more than the fact that he is unable to perform his previous job or other similar work within his qualifications and training; he must prove that his physical limitation has affected his ability to earn wages in work for which he is qualified and trained.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">D. PROPER INTERPRETATION OF THE DEFINITION OF DISABILITY IN SUBSECTION 301(4)</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">In reexamining our order in <em>Rea, </em>we are now persuaded that the Legislature must have intended, in 1981, to adopt the definition of disability as argued here on appeal by plaintiffs, as the Court of Appeals concluded in <em>Rea, </em>for one basic reason. Given the ambiguity in subsection 301(4) and examined in the context of our precedents, the language of the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>logically sustains this interpretation of the definition of disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Subsection 301(4), as previously stated, requires the employee to prove a disability, i-e., that he is eligible for compensation, and then prove wage loss, i.e., that he is entitled to an award. This language codifies the prior approach in Michigan that injury is not compensable without wage loss. If the employee establishes a disability, he must further prove a wage loss because wage loss will not be presumed. See subsection 301(4). However, <em>in order to prove a wage loss, </em>under the language of the statute and on the basis of our longstanding interpretation of related precedent, most recently confirmed in <em>Sobotka, </em>the employee must establish <em>a reduction in earning </em>capacity.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">With this conclusion, the definition of disability in subsection 301(4) cannot then be logically interpreted as a reduction of wage-earning capacity as long as wage loss is also measured by a reduction in wage-earning capacity. See <em>Lawrence v Toys R Us, </em>453 Mich 112, 121; 551 NW2d 155 (1996) (Levin, J., plurality opinion).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Subsection 301(4)\u2019s second sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>eliminates the possibility that disability and wage loss are defined the same way when it provides that proof of a \u201cdisability does not create [a] presumption of wage loss.\u201d As a consequence, the Legislature must have instead intended a different meaning for disability. The only other meaning that the ordinary words of the statute may sustain is the definition urged by plaintiffs: an employee is disabled whenever he can no longer perform a job suitable to his qualifications and training as a result of his injury. This conclusion is consistent with our analysis in <em>Michales.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">Total disability arises from an injury, i.e., \u201cincapacity for work resulting from a personal injury is total\u201d under subsection 351(1), when an employee proves that he is unable to perform all work suitable to his qualifications and training as a result of his injury.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> A partial disability arises from an injury, i.e., \u201cincapacity for work resulting from a personal injury is partial\u201d under subsection 361(1), when an employee proves that he is unable to perform a single position within his qualifications and training.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">n. THE implications of <em>sobotka</em></p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Because the decision in <em>Sobotka </em>has spawned disagreement at the administrative level and at the Court of Appeals, we turn to discussion of the lead opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>in that case before applying the general principle that an employee must prove an impairment of wage-earning capacity. We again note that the source of this disagreement may be confusion over the difference between the concepts of \u201ca reduction in wage earning capacity\u201d and \u201cresidual wage earning capacity\u201d in the context of a worker claiming partial disability. In <em>Sobotka, </em>an employee was found to be partially disabled from a 1978 injury,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and claimed that this personal injury had totally prevented him from earning a wage under subsection 361(1).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The following portion of the defendant\u2019s brief accurately summarized the questions presented in <em>Sobotka:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-4\">The difference between MTLA\u2019s/plaintiff\u2019s \u201cfall-back\u201d position, on the one hand, and defendant\u2019s position, on the other, can be illustrated as follows. Plaintiff and mtla would have the factfinder ask itself two questions in cases like this:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-5\">(1) Does the employee have some degree of disability?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-6\">(2) If so, has the employee earned any wages after the commencement of that disability?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-7\">If the factfinder\u2019s answer to these questions is that the employee is disabled <em>to any degree </em>and no wages have actually been earned after the commencement of the disability, then the employee is to be automatically awarded the maximum rate of compensation. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-8\">Defendant\u2019s position is that if the employee is partially disabled and if no wages have actually been earned thereafter, then the factfinder must ask:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>(3) <em>Why </em>has the employee earned no wages since the commencement of the disability? [Emphasis in the original.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-4\">If the answer to the question is that the employee has earned no wages because of the work injury, then the employee should receive the maximum rate of compensation to which he or she is entitled. On the other hand, if the answer to the question is that a partially disabled employee is not earning wages within his or her residual capacity for reasons other than the work injury, then the employee does not necessarily receive the maximum rate of compensation. Instead, he or she receives the rate commensurate with the diminution in wage-earning capacity that <em>is </em>the result of the work injury. [See also <em>Sobotka </em>at 18-19.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">We held that \u00a7 361 did not require that plaintiff\u2019s award be reduced by the amount he is hypothetically able to earn after the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">We also addressed what appeared to us to be a straightforward question: Could benefits ever be denied where plaintiff was injured and unemployed? We answered: \u201cYes,\u201d where the defendant carries the burden of showing the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cemployability.\u201d <em>Fellows v Fuller Brush Co, </em>1996 Mich ACO 151, 161.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Our response was intended simply (1) to reject the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the mere fact that a claimant remained unemployed after injury automatically established an absence of wage-earning capacity under \u00a7 361,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> (2) to accept the claim that if the employee has earned no wages because of the work injury, he should receive the maximum benefits to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>which he is entitled, and (3) to reject the claim that a partially disabled employee who is not earning wages receives the rate of benefits \u201cthat is commensurate with the diminution in wage-earning capacity that is the result of the work injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Thus, although we agreed with the defendant that absence of wages not truly related to the work injury did not justify an award of compensation and held that a magistrate could infer that a plaintiff is avoiding work, <em>Sobotka </em>at 27, we rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that a partially disabled worker who is not receiving wages must prove that the absence of wages is due to absence of residual wage-earning capacity. <em>Id. </em>The lead opinion in <em>Sobotka </em>was therefore not intended to resurrect the approach that benefits must be calculated and reduced on the basis of residual earning capacity and furnishes no authority for the proposition that subsection 301(5)(b) requires employees to prove loss of residual earning capacity.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Unemployment or reduced wages must be causally linked to work-related injury, and a plaintiff may not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>reject actual wages reasonably offered or avoid or refuse actual wages.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">While the lead opinion rejected the interpretation that \u201cable to earn\u201d in subsection 361(1) is only synonymous with actual wages earned or refused, see <em>Sobotka, supra </em>at 19, 21-22 (Boyle, J., lead opinion), relying in part on <em>Pulley v Detroit Engineering &amp; Machine Co, </em>378 Mich 418, 423, 428; 145 NW2d 40 (1966), and <em>Hood v Wyandotte Oil &amp; Fat Co, </em>272 Mich 190, 192-193; 261 NW 295 (1935)<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> we quoted with approval this Court\u2019s previous conclusion that the \u201c \u2018real inquiry [for determining loss of wages] relates to the monetary worth of the injured workman\u2019s services in the open labor market under normal employment conditions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sobotka, supra </em>at 24-25 (Boyle, J., lead opinion), quoting <em>Jones v Cutler Oil Co, </em>356 Mich 487, 490; 97 NW2d 74 (1959). However, we did not intend to imply that <em>residual </em>wage-earning capacity was relevant to proof of wage loss. Rather, we intended our analysis to reflect the fact that the magistrate\u2019s role in judging the credibility of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>employee\u2019s evidence is central to determining whether he is entitled to an award.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Although we rejected the plaintiff\u2019s claim that wage loss from any source and a personal injury automatically mandated maximum benefits, we held, as the Court of Appeals correctly concluded in <em>Brown v Contech, Div of Sealed Power Technologies, </em>211 Mich App 256, 262; 535 NW2d 195 (1995), that where unemployment of a partially disabled employee is found to be directly attributable to a compensable injury, maximum benefits may be awarded.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> We observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-7\">Where, on account of an injury, an employee is, in fact, unemployed, the employee is entitled to the maximum benefit allowable under \u00a7 361(1), because the employee is not \u201cable to earn\u201d wages postinjury. <em>[Sobotka </em>at 7-8.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>Most importantly, we rejected the principle that the employer of a partially disabled employee should be credited with a wage-earning capacity in the absence of postinjury employment. As we specifically stated, this means that it is not part of the plaintiff\u2019s burden in proving disability that other factors are not the cause of his unemployment. Plaintiff need not prove what he is theoretically \u201cable to earn\u201d after the injury, that other factors are not the cause of his unemployment, or that the amount of residual capacity is diminished.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> If the magistrate credits testimony that there is a direct link between wages lost and a work-related injury, plaintiff need not prove anything in addition.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> By the language and structure of the statute and previous interpretation of the Court, an employee must prove a reduction in earning capacity. However, <em>Sobotka </em>furnishes no authority for the proposition that plaintiffs must prove absence of residual earning capacity, i.e., an inability to earn the same wages when considering <em>all </em>the jobs within his qualifications and training.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">Further, except as otherwise indicated, subsection 301(5) does not require an <em>adjustment </em>of benefits on the basis of existence of a residual wage-earning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>capacity. Whether disability is total or partial, actual loss of wages causally linked to a work-related injury is loss of wage-earning capacity.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">In summary, absent clear legislative direction to the contrary,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> we conclude that for an employee to carry his burden of proving an impairment of wage-earning capacity, he must prove (1) a work-related injury, (2) subsequent loss in actual wages, and (3) that the injury caused the subsequent wage loss. Where the employee has carried his burden of proving wage loss, he will, as a practical matter, have proven that he is unable to perform a single job within his qualifications and training, and, therefore, that he is disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>in. APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"A9P\">A. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">In reviewing a decision by the wcac, in the absence of fraud, this Court accepts the factual determinations of the commission as conclusive under MCL 418.861a(14); MSA 17.237(861a)(14) if the commission acts within its powers. <em>Goff v Bil-Mar Foods, Inc (After Remand), </em>454 Mich 507, 513; 563 NW2d 214 (1997). However, as we noted earlier, we review questions of law from the wcac\u2019s final orders. <em>Id. </em>at 512, citing subsection 861a(14). The WCAC, in reviewing a decision by the magistrate, determines whether the referee\u2019s decision was supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the whole record under subsection 861a(3). <em>Id. </em>at 513-514.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">B. <em>HASKE</em></p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">In <em>Haske, </em>the wcac found that the employee was still able to perform work within his qualifications and training and, therefore, did not suffer a \u201closs\u201d in wage-earning capacity. Thus, the wcac determined that Haske was not disabled, using an erroneous definition of disability. There is no dispute that he was unable to perform his previous position, but there were other positions he could perform, and, thereby, Haske established a partial disability. However, the wcac found that he was not disabled because he suffered no loss in earning capacity, i.e., what he \u201cis able to earn\u201d after the personal injury, relying on plaintiff Haske\u2019s capacity to earn some wages within his qualifications and training. The proper standard for determining whether plaintiff Haske has proven a loss in wages caused by his disability is explained in part n of this opinion. In proving wage loss, plaintiff Haske <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>must establish to the factfinder\u2019s satisfaction (1) a work-related injury, which he has done in proving a partial disability, (2) an actual loss in wages, and (3) that the injury caused the loss in wages. Because the magistrate applied the correct legal standard and found the causal link between plaintiff\u2019s injury and his postinjury loss in wages, we affirm the Court of Appeals decision to remand the case to the wcac for further proceedings to determine if there was competent, substantial, and material evidence to support the magistrate\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">C. <em>BAILEY</em></p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">In <em>Bailey, </em>the wcac incorrectly concluded that the magistrate found as a fact that the employee had suffered a partial disability and then reversed the magistrate\u2019s denial of benefits because the wcac determined that the employee had suffered a limitation in his earning capacity because he can no longer work as a firefighter. Contrary to the conclusion of the wcac, the magistrate made no finding of fact that Bailey was disabled. There being no factual finding of disability by the magistrate, the WCAC applied the correct legal definition of disability, but erred in awarding benefits. Consequently, we remand this case to the magistrate for a determination regarding whether Bailey has factually proven disability and for further proceedings pursuant to the standards articulated in this opinion.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">We hold that an employee proves a disability where he proves he can no longer perform a job suitable to his qualifications and training as a result of his injury. An employee\u2019s disability is compensable only where he proves wage loss by showing a reduction in earning capacity. An employee establishes a reduction in earning capacity where he establishes to the factfinder\u2019s satisfaction that a reduction or elimination of his wages, subsequent to the work-related injury, is causally linked to the work-related injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">In <em>Haske, </em>we affirm the Court of Appeals decision to remand the case to the wcac, and we direct the wcac to apply the statute\u2019s definition of disability and wage loss in light of this Court\u2019s opinion. In <em>Bailey, </em>we remand this issue to the magistrate for further proceedings consistent with the standards defined in this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b751-6\">Mallett, C.J., and Cavanagh and Kelly, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b721-6\"> While the dissent suggests that the Legislature intended to reject this approach, there is no clear indication of legislative intent supporting this construction.

The establishment of disability does not create a presumption of wage loss.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">The plain language of subsection 301(4) defining disability in the worker\u2019s compensation act is composed of two inquiries: first, whether there is a work-related injury or disease, and, second, whether that work-related injury or disease resulted in \u201ca limitation of an employee\u2019s wage earning capacity in work suitable to his or her qualifications.\u201d I believe that the employee has the burden of proof with respect to both inquiries.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>My approach to subsection 301(4) is criticized as ignoring the import of the second sentence of subsection 301(4). As will be addressed in part IV, I believe that the second sentence states the basic premise that Michigan\u2019s worker\u2019s compensation system is a wage-loss system. Wage loss establishes <em>entitlement </em>to benefits. However, the question of wage loss is reached only after the threshold question of <em>eligibility </em>for benefits under subsection 301(4) has been proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">The first inquiry under subsection 301(4), the existence of a work-related injury or disease, is typically a straightforward one. In these cases there is no dispute regarding the existence of work-related injuries. However, the Court has struggled to articulate the nature and scope of the plaintiff\u2019s burden regarding the second inquiry. Thus, the focus of this opinion is on interpreting \u201ca limitation of an employee\u2019s wage earning capacity in work suitable to his or her qualifications.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">A \u201climitation\u201d is defined as \u201csome factor in [a person\u2019s] makeup which restricts the scope of a person\u2019s activity or accomplishment.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary </em>(3d ed). While a limitation may be purely physical, it would be inconsistent with the plain language of subsection 301(4) to conclude that the Legislature intended \u201ca limitation\u201d to mean nothing more than a physical limitation because the words \u201ca limitation\u201d cannot be considered separately from their restrictive clauses \u201cof an employee\u2019s wage earning capacity in work suitable to his or her qualifications and training.\u201d To prove that a disability exists, the statute requires proof of both a work-related injury or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>disease and \u201ca limitation of an employee\u2019s wage earning capacity in work suitable to his or her qualifications and training.\u201d Thus, the employee must prove more than the work-related disease or injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">I believe that the most basic interpretation of \u201cwage earning capacity\u201d is that it describes an employee\u2019s ability to earn wages. Perhaps because an employee is theoretically able to earn wages in a great variety of ways, the Legislature restricted consideration to \u201cwork suitable to [an employee\u2019s] qualifications and training.\u201d Where an employee is qualified and trained in more than one job, then his wage-earning capacity includes consideration of all those jobs under the plain meaning of subsection 301(4). Whether \u201ca limitation\u201d exists in an individual\u2019s \u201cwage earning capacity\u201d where that individual is qualified and trained in more than one job therefore requires consideration of the effect of the work-related disease or injury on earning capacity in <em>all those jobs </em>in which the individual is qualified and trained.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The statute does not state or imply that inability to perform one job within the individual\u2019s qualifications and training necessarily results in \u201ca limitation [in] wage earning capacity.\u201d Thus, I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that \u201can employee is disabled if there is at least a single job within his qualifications and training that he can no longer perform.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 643. I believe the majority\u2019s conclusion fails to consider whether the overall wage-earning capacity of the individual was actually limited and, therefore, is not true to the plain language of subsection 301(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>\u201c[I]n work suitable to his or her qualifications and training\u201d is a restrictive clause that modifies \u201ca limitation [in] wage earning capacity.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> What work is suitable will obviously depend on the qualifications and training of the employee in each case. The reference to an employee\u2019s qualifications and training restricts the types of employment that can be considered to determine wage-earning capacity. Thus, it would be inconsistent with the language of the clause to find that an injured electrician\u2019s wage-earning capacity included menial labor or unskilled labor.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nor would it be consistent to assume that the electrician could maintain his wage-earning capacity by adopting a new career requiring some additional training.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">Evidently relying entirely on a footnote in <em>Michales v Morton Salt Co, </em>450 Mich 479, 490-491, n 17; 538 NW2d 11 (1995), the majority concludes that <em>Michales </em>held that \u201can employee is disabled whenever he is rendered unable to perform a single job within the category of jobs he is suited to perform, even if the number he continues to be able to perform is numerous and equally well paying,\u201d and therefore, that <em>Michales </em>is consistent with the plaintiff\u2019s theory of disability. <em>Ante, </em>p 651. This strained reinterpretation of <em>Michales </em>deserves rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">In <em>Michales, </em>the Court noted \u201ca person is not compensably disabled within the meaning of the current definition if the employee remains able to perform the work suitable to the employee\u2019s qualifications and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>training without limitation of wage-earning capacity.\u201d <em>Id., </em>pp 493-494. There is no evidence that the Court based its conclusion that the plaintiff was not disabled solely on the fact that he remained able to perform the same duties after the injury as before. The <em>Michales </em>analysis repeatedly emphasized that the plaintiff had not proven a limitation in wage-earning capacity in work suitable to his qualifications and training. <em>Michales </em>noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-6\">The relevant inquiry is not whether there is a theoretical job in the employee\u2019s general field of employment that the employee is no longer able to perform. Instead, the question is whether the employee\u2019s wage-earning capacity, i.e., ability to earn wages, has been limited, considering the employee\u2019s qualifications and training. <em>[Id., </em>p 493, n 19.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">As Justice Cavanagh succinctly stated in his <em>Michales </em>concurrence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-8\">Although [the plaintiff] established a personal injury, he completely failed to introduce any evidence of a limitation in his wage-earning capacity. As required by MCL 418.401(1); MSA 17.237(401)(1), both an injury and a limitation in wage-earning capacity must be shown. A complete failure to introduce any evidence of a limitation in wage-earning capacity resulting from the injury simply precludes an award of benefits as a matter of law. <em>[Id., </em>p 496.][<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">While it is true that the plaintiff in <em>Michales </em>was able to perform the same job before and after the injury, this particular circumstance does not justify the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>majority\u2019s dramatic move away from the language of subsection 301(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Applying my interpretation of subsection 301(4) to the cases presented suggests the following conclusions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">In <em>Bailey, </em>the plaintiff was qualified and trained as a firefighter and an electrical contractor at the time of the injury. I believe that in order to prove disability under the act, Bailey needs to prove that his firefighting injury caused \u201ca limitation [in] wage earning capacity\u201d as both a firefighter and an electrical contractor. A limitation in wage-earning capacity is not simply presumed because he can no longer fight fires; rather, he must show that he has a limitation in his combined wage-earning capacity as a firefighter and an electrical contractor. In other words, I would require plaintiff to prove his inability, resulting from his firefighting-related injury, to earn as much as an electrical contractor as he earned doing both jobs at the time he was injured. Thus, I would find that Bailey has not proven a disability. However, I agree that it is appropriate to remand this case to the magistrate. See n 8.1 would instruct the magistrate to make an additional record regarding Bailey\u2019s wage-earning capacity as an electrical contractor to determine whether the loss of the firefighting income caused a limitation in wage-earning capacity and thus a disability <em>eligible </em>for benefits under subsection 301(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>In <em>Haske, </em>the plaintiff was qualified and trained as a truck driver. After his work-related injury, he eventually continued to work as a truck driver. However, physical restrictions resulting from his work-related injury may have affected his wage-earning capacity as a truck driver. It is unclear whether he was able to earn as much as he earned after the injury with the injury-related restriction as he earned before. Therefore, in order to be found disabled and eligible for benefits, Haske must demonstrate that his wageeaming capacity as a truck driver was limited as a result of the work-related injury. Thus, I dissent from the majority conclusion that Haske is partially disabled on the proofs presented, but I concur with the majority that the case should be remanded to the wcac. However, I would ask the wcac to make additional findings of fact from the record regarding Haske\u2019s wage-earning capacity as a truck driver after the injury in order to determine whether Haske is eligible for benefits under subsection 301(4). If the record is insufficient regarding this necessary information, it would be appropriate to remand to the magistrate to make an additional record regarding Haske\u2019s wage-earning capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">I agree with the concurrence/dissent of Justice Riley that wage loss is the basic operative criterion for determining entitlement to compensation benefits. <em>Post, </em>pp 679-680. However, this fundamental understanding of Michigan\u2019s wage-loss system does not logically support the concurrence/dissent\u2019s conclusion that \u201csubsection 301(4) must define a disability as an inability to perform at least a single job within an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>employee\u2019s qualifications and training.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 680. The concurrence/dissent\u2019s misinterpretation of disability appears to arise from the second sentence of subsection 301(4) that states, \u201c[t]he establishment of disability does not create a presumption of wage loss.\u201d I believe the concurrence/dissent misconstrues the purpose of the second sentence and the effect of my approach to disability. As will be shown below, and contrary to the concurrence/dissent\u2019s assertion that my approach to subsection 301(4) will render the second sentence unnecessary,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> requiring proof of \u201ca limitation of wage earning capacity in work suitable to [an employee\u2019s] qualifications and training\u201d to establish eligibility for benefits is not inconsistent with the concept and calculation of wage loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">The majority similarly misconstrues the second sentence of subsection 301(4) where it states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-5\">[T]he definition of disability in subsection 301(4) cannot then be logically interpreted as a reduction of wage-earning capacity as long as wage loss is also measured by a reduction in wage-earning capacity. . . . Subsection 301(4)\u2019s second sentence eliminates the possibility that disability and wage loss are defined the same way .... <em>[Ante, </em>pp 654-655.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">However, the majority goes further by compressing the questions of disability and wage loss into a combined three-step analysis made entirely out of whole cloth. <em>Id., </em>pp 634 and 662. This three-step test effectively transforms wage loss into mere consideration of actual wages lost. The majority\u2019s three-part test to establish a \u201ccompensable disability\u201d fails to account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>for over forty years of wage-loss analysis that this Court has consistently interpreted to mean more than simply actual wages lost. Wage loss requires consideration of <em>loss of earning capacity. Sobotka v Chrysler Corp (After Remand), </em>447 Mich 1, 24-25; 523 NW2d 454 (1994); <em>Leizerman v First Flight Freight Service, </em>424 Mich 463; 381 NW2d 386 (1985); <em>Kidd v General Motors Corp, </em>414 Mich 578, 591-592; 327 NW2d 265 (1982); <em>Pigue v General Motors Corp, </em>317 Mich 311, 316; 26 NW2d 900 (1947). Further, it is unclear what effect the three-part test has on the majority holding that a disability is a work-related injury or disease plus the inability to perform a single job.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">The second sentence of subsection 301(4), \u201c[t]he establishment of disability does not create a presumption of wage loss,\u201d underscores the basic premise that Michigan\u2019s worker\u2019s compensation system is, and has always been, a wage-loss system. <em>Sobotka, supra </em>at 6 (Boyle, J., lead opinion). Under the wage-loss approach, an employee may prove a disability under subsection 301(4) and thus be <em>eligible </em>for benefits and yet not be <em>entitled </em>to benefits because of other factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">The concept of wage loss is reflected by provisions of the worker\u2019s compensation act such as subsection 301(5)(a), which disqualifies an eligible, disabled employee if the employee has refused favored work, and subsection 301(5)(c), which disqualifies an eligible, disabled employee who earns as much or more after the injury as before, for the duration of such earning. Thus, where an employee effectively removes himself from the workforce by refusing favored work or where he earns more than before the injury, the employee is not entitled to benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>because he has effectively suffered no wage loss. The wage-loss approach is further demonstrated by provisions that adjust the benefits of an eligible employee to reflect the employee\u2019s actual earning after the injury. Subsections 301(5)(b), (d), and (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">However, wage loss requires more than consideration of actual wages lost; it requires consideration of loss of earning capacity. <em>Sobotka, supra </em>at 24-25; <em>Leizerman, supra. </em>This general principle for wage-loss calculation is stated in subsection 371(1).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The actual amount of wage-loss benefits to which an employee is entitled, once eligibility is proven, is determined under subsections 351(l)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or 361(1).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>The majority and the concurrence/dissent of Justice Riley lower the threshold regarding disability (eligibility for benefits) because the language of subsection 371(1) includes consideration of \u201cthe proportionate extent of the impairment of the employee\u2019s earning capacity . . . Presumably the reasoning relates to the substance of the second sentence of subsection 301(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">It is my conclusion that the second sentence of subsection 301(4) means that an injury resulting in \u201ca limitation of an employee\u2019s wage earning capacity\u201d will not always result in a wage loss or entitlement to benefits. I do not believe that my approach to disability violates the mandate of subsection 301(4) that \u201c[t]he establishment of disability does not create a presumption of wage loss.\u201d There may be some redundancy of proof required for \u201ca limitation of an employee\u2019s wage earning capacity\u201d under subsection 301(4) and \u201cthe proportionate extent of the impairment of the employee\u2019s earning capacity\u201d under subsection 371(1); however, the two provisions are not identical in meaning. Subsection 301(4) arguably encompasses a wider range of potential employments than subsection 371(1), because subsection 371(1) expressly limits the wage-earning calculation to those employments that the employee was actually working at the time of the injury. There may well be a situation in which an employee\u2019s current qualifications and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>training include work or employments that he was not actually doing at the time of the injury. If the magistrate so finds, and finds also that the employee\u2019s earning capacity at work is equal to what he was earning at the time of the injury, then the employee would not be disabled and therefore not eligible for benefits. The question of entitlement to wage-loss benefits would simply not be reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">While it is perhaps a rare set of facts that there would be found \u201ca limitation of an employee\u2019s wage-earning capacity\u201d and yet no wage loss, I prefer to follow the plain language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">For these reasons, I concur that these cases should be remanded; however, I would offer different instructions on remand. I dissent from the majority\u2019s reasoning and its conclusion that Haske has proven that he is eligible for benefits under subsection 301(4). I would also find that Bailey has not proven a disability under subsection 301(4) on the proofs presented.</p>\n<judges id=\"b763-6\">Brickley, J., concurred with Weaver, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b751-8\"> This Court has found that both the 1981 and 1987 amendments were intended to make disability more difficult to prove.

Moreover, I agree that the employee must, as an independent second step, prove wage loss by demonstrating a reduction in earning capacity to establish his right to recovery. See <em>ante </em>at 634. In my opinion, this is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>meaning of a <em>compensable </em>disability under subsection 301(4). However, I do not agree with the three-part test the majority has identified from <em>Sobotka v Chrysler Corp (After Remand), </em>447 Mich 1, 17; 523 NW2d 454 (1994), in part n, that operates to displace completely the two-step analysis envisioned by the Legislature and that wrongly lowers the threshold of proof necessary to demonstrate a loss of earning capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">In applying the proper standard, I concur in the majority\u2019s holding in <em>Haske v Transport Leasing, Inc, </em>that plaintiff Andrew Haske was partially disabled and in the decision to remand to the wcac.

PROOF OF A COMPENSABLE DISABILITY UNDER SUBSECTION 301(4)</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">In order to become eligible to receive worker\u2019s compensation benefits under chapter 3 of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act, MCL 418.301; MSA 17.237(301), the employee must prove that he has suffered a personal injury arising out of and in the course of his employment. See MCL 418.301(1); MSA 17.237(301)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In order to meet this test, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>employee must prove that his personal injury was a \u201cdisability\u201d under subsection 301(4):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-4\">As used in this chapter, \u201cdisability\u201d means a limitation of an employee\u2019s wage earning capacity in work suitable to his or her qualifications and training resulting from a personal injury or work related disease. The establishment of disability does not create a presumption of wage loss.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Like the majority, see <em>ante </em>at 642-643, I believe that subsection 301(4) is composed of two proofs: the employee must (1) prove that he has suffered a disability and (2) prove that this disability has resulted in a subsequent wage loss. In other words, the employee must first prove disability and then must prove that it is compensable. See <em>Rea v Regency Olds/Mazda/Volvo, </em>450 Mich 1201, 1202; 536 NW2d 542 (1995) (Riley, J., dissenting) (\u201cTo be a <em>compensable disability </em>under the act, it is necessary to show both the work-related injury <em>and </em>wage loss\u201d) (emphasis in original). Moreover, the Legislature has provided that the calculation of wage loss is measured by an \u201cimpairment [in] earning capacity\u201d in the employments in which the employee was working when the injury occurred. MCL 418.371(1); MSA 17.237(371)(1). <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This Court has reiterated the point on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>several occasions that loss of wage-earning capacity is the basic criterion for determining entitlement to compensation benefits. See, e.g., <em>Leizerman v First Flight Freight Service, </em>424 Mich 463, 473; 381 NW2d 386 (1985).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, I agree with the majority that the first sentence of subsection 301(4) must define a disability as an inability to perform at least a single job within an employee\u2019s qualifications and training. See <em>ante </em>at 634.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">After establishing the proper two-part framework, however, the majority sets it aside in favor of a three-part test that it derived from its analysis of the lead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>opinion in <em>Sobotka, supra. </em>The majority concludes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-4\">In application [of the two-part test], these basic principles operate to require that an employee must establish (1) a work-related injury, (2) subsequent loss in actual wages, and (3) a causal link between the two. Proof of the three elements will establish that an employee can no longer perform at least a single job within his qualifications and training, thus satisfying the first sentence of subsection 301(4), <em>and </em>that he has suffered a loss in wages, satisfying the second sentence of subsection 301(4). <em>[Ante </em>at 634-635 (emphasis in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">There is no basis in the statute for allowing this standard to replace the legislatively established one, i.e., that the employee must prove (1) a disability and then (2) a reduction of his earning capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">As I understand the proper system, a disability would be <em>\u201ca </em>limitation in an employee\u2019s wage-earning capacity\u201d under the first step, because an employee could no longer perform a single job within his qualifications and training, but this fact would not necessarily establish a loss in that employee\u2019s earning capacity when considering <em>all </em>the jobs within his qualifications and training under the second step.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>However, the majority refuses to accept the logic of its own test by rejecting this point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-6\">Absent postinjury employment establishing a new wage-earning capacity, benefit levels are not to be reduced by the proportionate impairment of residual wage-earning capacity. <em>[Ante </em>at 635, n 2.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">In other words, in proving a reduction in earning capacity, the employee apparently has no duty to prove that he is unable to earn the same wage for <em>all </em>the jobs within his qualifications and training. See also <em>ante </em>at 654, n 24, and 661.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>1 disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">In reaching its conclusion, the majority relies on the analysis of the lead opinion in <em>Sobotka, supra </em>at 27, reasoning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-9\">[W]e rejected [in <em>Sobotka] </em>the defendant\u2019s claim that a partially disabled worker who is not receiving wages must prove that the absence of wages is due to absence of residual wage-earning capacity. <em>[Ante </em>at 658.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-10\">This conclusion appears nowhere in the text of the lead opinion in <em>Sobotka. </em>Instead, the lead opinion only concluded that an employee need not refute that he has a <em>theoretical </em>earning capacity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-11\">We reject the contention . . . that plaintiff bears the burden of producing evidence of jobs he could not perform if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>theoretically available and that defendant\u2019s offer of evidence of plaintiff\u2019s ability in the abstract to perform some employment rebuts the inference of causation that arises from a showing of unemployment and injury. <em>[Id. </em>at 27.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">This is a different point from the one the majority makes in the instant case. I agree that an employee need not prove that he has no theoretical earning capacity and that he should not bear the burden of demonstrating that he cannot perform jobs that are not actually available to him. However, he must prove that he cannot earn wages in all the jobs within his qualifications and training <em>that are available. </em>In fact, there is support for this very point in the lead opinion of <em>Sobotka, </em>as the majority notes, where <em>Sobotka </em>quoted from <em>Jones v Cutler Oil Co, </em>356 Mich 487, 490; 97 NW2d 74 (1959):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-5\">\u201c[The] real inquiry [for determining loss of wages] relates to the monetary worth of the injured workman\u2019s services in the open labor market under normal employment conditions.\u201d <em>[Sobotka, supra </em>at 24-25 (Boyle, J., lead opinion).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">The employee must prove that the injury affects his ability to earn in each of the jobs within his qualifications and training that are available to that employee. Where the employee has multiple positions that he may perform within his qualifications and training, he will have to carry his burden with respect to each position.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">Of course, the lead opinion recognized in <em>Sobotka, </em>and I agree, that the employee does not bear the burden of a poor economy. Thus, if the only other positions that the employee is still able physically to perform are not available to him because of the economy, the lead opinion makes clear that he may still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>fully recover. See <em>id. </em>at 27-28. I do not dispute this point. This is now the rule of law in Michigan. See <em>McKissack v Comprehensive Health Services of Detroit, </em>447 Mich 57, 70; 523 NW2d 444 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Nevertheless, in every case in which an employee is partially disabled and unemployed, I would expect that, in order to prove a reduction in earning capacity, an employee would give testimony that either he is physically unable to perform all the jobs that he could previously perform within his qualifications and training available to him or that he has sought work for the jobs he is able to physically perform but did not receive an offer of work. The lead opinion in <em>Sobotka </em>apparently expected as much. See <em>id. </em>at 26 (Boyle, J., lead opinion).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There is also the possibility that the only positions that an employee would physically be able to perform after his injury (within his qualifications and training) would be ones that do not pay the same wage as his previous job. As I understand the employee\u2019s burden of proving a reduction in earning capacity, the injured employee would be bound to seek work in these positions and, if he was able to obtain one, he would receive the difference between his previous wage and his new lesser wage in worker\u2019s compensation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>The meaning of the standard that the majority uses to determine whether there is a reduction of earning capacity, i.e., whether the employee has proven that his injury caused the subsequent wage loss, see <em>ante </em>at 661, is not clearly defined. From the majority\u2019s analysis, I do not know in what circumstances an employee will have carried this burden. I also do not know under what circumstances the magistrate has a basis on which to infer the link between the injury and actual loss of wages. I believe that the magistrate should only infer an employee\u2019s loss of earning capacity in cases in which the facts are sufficient to warrant such an inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">Furthermore, the majority misstates the burden of proof for worker\u2019s compensation cases. In interpreting this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Sobotka, </em>the majority concluded that we determined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-5\">Could benefits ever be denied where plaintiff was injured and unemployed? We answered: \u201cYes,\u201d where the defendant carries the burden of showing the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cemployability.\u201d <em>Fellows v Fuller Brush Co, </em>1996 Mich ACO 151, 161. <em>[Ante </em>at 657.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Thus, the majority states that <em>the employer, as the defendant, </em>carries the burden of proving the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>employee\u2019s employability. The lead opinion in <em>Sobotka, </em>however, only recognized that a finder of fact may infer an impairment of wage-earning capacity from a partial disability where that employee shows a work-related disability and subsequent wage loss. See <em>Sobotka, supra </em>at 15, 25 (Boyle, J, lead opinion). It did not indicate that an employer carries the burden of proving the employee\u2019s employability. Rather, the lead opinion only authorizes the magistrate to infer that an employee has suffered a reduction in earning capacity from the nature of the proofs establishing that he is disabled and suffered a loss in wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">For these reasons, I cannot agree with the three-part test the majority has established, displacing the framework created by the Legislature. These disagreements have implications for the instant cases before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">H. <em>HASKE </em>AND <em>BAILEY</em></p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">In <em>Haske, </em>I agree with the majority that the WCAC applied the wrong definition of disability in reversing the magistrate\u2019s grant of benefits for a partial disability. However, the wcac did find that the employee suffered no loss in earning capacity. Hence, by this finding, the employee would have suffered no wage loss as measured by the reduction of his earning capacity. Nevertheless, the wcac\u2019s finding did not consider whether the jobs that the employee was performing were equally well paying or whether there were <em>available jobs </em>at his previous wage that the employee could perform when it determined that he suffered no loss of wage-earning capacity. Hence, I would also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>affirm the Court of Appeals decision to remand to the WCAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">In <em>Bailey, </em>I agree with the majority that the wcac wrongly concluded that the magistrate found a partial disability. Nevertheless, I would not remand. The magistrate found that Bailey had \u201cnever testified that he could not find employment as an electrician or that he even sought such employment.\u201d As a self-employed professional, this kind of testimony would be critical for establishing a prima facie case that the injury impaired his earning capacity. Bailey has failed to provide evidence that he suffered a loss in what he is able to earn after the personal injury as an electrical contractor. Therefore, the magistrate properly denied him benefits. I believe the wcac erred on a legal question by failing to consider whether Bailey had proven a wage loss. The Court of Appeals also erred in affirming this decision. I would reverse the wcac and the Court of Appeals and reinstate the magistrate\u2019s refusal to grant benefits.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b764-8\"> MCL 418.301(1); MSA 17.237(301)(1) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>An employee, who receives a personal injury arising out of and in the course of employment by an employer who is subject to this act at the time of the injury, shall be paid compensation as provided in this act.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b765-7\"> Subsection 371(1) provides in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-8\">The weekly loss in wages referred to in this act shall consist of the percentage of the average weekly earnings of the injured employee computed according to this section as fairly represents <em>the proportionate extent of the impairment of the employee\u2019s earning capacity </em>in the employments covered by this act in which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>employee was working at the time of the personal injury.

The use of \u201cwage-earning capacity\u201d is not intended to compensate the worker for every employment opportunity that is lost due to injury.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b766-11\"> I also agree that the Legislature intended to abrogate the distinction between skilled and unskilled employment. See <em>id. </em>at 651-652. Further, I agree with the opinion\u2019s definitions of partial and total disability. See <em>id. </em>at 654-655.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b767-7\"> The concurrence/dissent by Justice Weaver advances the other possible understanding of the phrase \u201ca limitation of . . . earning capacity\u201d by arguing that whether there is a limitation \u201crequires consideration of the effect of the work-related disease or injury on earning capacity in <em>all those jobs </em>in which the individual is qualified and trained.\u201d See <em>ante </em>at 668. I cannot accept this interpretation because it effectively renders superfluous subsection 371(1) and eliminates any separate significance to the second sentence of subsection 301(4) (\u201cestablishment of disability does not create a presumption of wage loss\u201d). The system of the concurrence/dissent of Justice Weaver would create a duplication: wage loss is calculated in subsection 371(1) in the same way that Justice Weaver believes that an employee must prove a disability under subsection 301(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b768-12\"> The majority states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-13\">We reiterate that reduction in earning capacity is a different concept than residual earning capacity. <em>[Ante </em>at 654, n 24.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-14\"><em>Sobotka </em>furnishes no authority for the proposition that plaintiffs must prove absence of residual earning capacity, i.e., an ability to earn the same wages when considering <em>all </em>the jobs within his qualifications and training. <em>[Id. </em>at 661.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b770-6\"> In <em>Sobotka, supra </em>at 26, Justice Boyle noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-7\">For example, in the instant case <em>the employee presented evidence that he sought and could not obtain employment </em>and evidence of defendant\u2019s refusal to rehire, which has been described as strong evidence of unemployability. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b770-8\"> Therefore, if the employee did not seek out the lesser-paying positions because of malingering, and was unemployed as a consequence, the employee would only receive worker\u2019s compensation for the reduction in his earning capacity that he suffered because of his injury, but he would not recover the remaining lesser wage that he could have earned had he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>sought work. See, e.g., <em>Williams v Blitz Construction Co, </em>1995 Mich ACO 1169 (reducing an award for an unemployed, injured claimant from $250 a week to $100 a week where there was a lesser paying job actually available within the claimant\u2019s qualifications and training that he was not performing). The majority appears to reject this possibility by requiring that either this employee receive his full previous wage or nothing. See n 38 on p 662 (\u201cWhere the plaintiff is unemployed and the magistrate credits a link between disability and actual lost wages, evidence of residual earning capacity is not probative of any material issue\u201d). This is not, in my opinion, consistent with the act\u2019s requirement that the employee demonstrate wage loss by proving a reduction in earning capacity.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
