The Court is asked to determine what statutory requirements a striking worker must satisfy in order to requalify<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for unemployment benefits under the Michigan Employment Security Act. MCL 421.29(8)(b); MSA 17.531(8)(b). In both these cases, the Michigan Employment Security Board of Review found that the sixteen striking employees requalified for unemployment compensation benefits. They had obtained interim jobs for a combined period of two weeks or more at statutorily prescribed wage-rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">The employers in <em>Orhanen </em>appeal from a decision of the Court of Appeals that affirmed the Board of Review\u2019s grant of benefits to three employees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Each employee had requalified by securing interim employment through a union hiring hall, which included jobs from more than one employer. The struck employers argue that it was error to hold that striking employees can earn requalification wages from multiple employers, as it encourages make-work and bad-faith interim employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">In <em>Asmund, </em>employees appeal from a Court of Appeals decision that the award of unemployment compensation benefits to them was improper.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They assert that the appellate court erred as a matter of law by requiring \u201cgood faith\u201d employment as a necessary element for requalification. The thirteen <em>Asmund </em>employees each worked for only one interim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>employer. However, the Court of Appeals found that they did not act in good faith in obtaining the interim employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">We affirm the Court of Appeals decision in <em>Orhanen </em>and reverse the decision in <em>Asmund.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">Eligibility of employees to receive unemployment compensation benefits and the bases of disqualification for those benefits are established by the mesa. MCL 421.28; MSA 17.530 and MCL 421.29(8)(b); MSA 17.531(8)(b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The issues presented on appeal involve the labor dispute disqualification provision, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-10\">An individual\u2019s disqualification imposed or imposable under this subsection is terminated if <em>the individual performs services in employment with an employer in at least 2 consecutive weeks falling wholly within the period of the individual\u2019s total or partial unemployment due to the labor dispute, and in addition earns wages in each of those weeks in an amount equal to or greater than the individual\u2019s actual or potential weekly benefit rate </em>with respect to those weeks based on the individual\u2019s employment with the employer involved in the labor dispute. [MCL 421.29(8)(b); MSA 17.531(8)0) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">In <em>Orhanen </em>and <em>Asmund, </em>the Court is asked to consider whether, in amending the disqualification provision of \u00a7 29(8)(b), the Legislature intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>(1) that a requirement of \u201cgood faith\u201d be added to the listed objective criteria, and (2) whether it intended that the phrase \u201cservices in employment with an employer\u201d be construed as requiring employment with a single employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">We resolve the issues in favor of the employees. We find that the Board of Review\u2019s interpretations of \u00a7 29(8) (b) are in accord with the underlying purpose of the act itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">THE \u201cGOOD FAITH\u201d CRITERION ISSUE AND THE \u201cSINGLE EMPLOYER\u201d ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">Whether interim employment ends disqualification for unemployment benefits is dependent on the wording of the statute. <em>Thomas v Employment Security Comm, </em>356 Mich 665; 97 NW2d 784 (1959). Because of conflicting Court of Appeals decisions, we are alerted to the fact that the statutory language of \u00a7 29(8)(b) may be subject to differing interpretations. We note that the plain wording of the statute does not express a \u201cgood faith\u201d requirement. We note also that the phrase \u201can employer\u201d may be interpreted in the plural as well as in the singular. Therefore, we consider whether \u201cgood faith\u201d employment with a single employer was nonetheless intended by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">We begin our analysis by examining the rationale underlying the MESA. Doing so sharpens our understanding of the circumstances surrounding its enactment. We review the prelegislative history and the motivations that induced enactment. Horack, <em>The dis</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number><em>integration of statutory construction, </em>24 Ind L J 335, 338 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Next, we look to this Court\u2019s decisions that touch on the history and the circumstances surrounding \u00a7 29(8)(b). <em>Dow Chemical Co v Curtis, </em>431 Mich 471, 480; 430 NW2d 645 (1988); <em>Great Lakes Steel Corp v Employment Security Comm, </em>381 Mich 249, 254; 161 NW2d 14 (1968). Throughout our analysis, we bear in mind the underlying purpose of the act. <em>Dep\u2019t of Social Services v Brewer, </em>180 Mich App 82, 84; 446 NW2d 593 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Once we have ascertained the Legislature\u2019s intent, we follow the primary rule of statutory construction for cases interpreting the MESA: a \u201cliberal\u201d construction to afford coverage and a \u201cstrict\u201d construction to effect disqualification. See <em>Linski v Employment Security Comm, </em>358 Mich 239; 99 NW2d 582 (1959). In order to comply with the public policy of the act, we recognize that this primary rule must prevail, despite any other conflicting rule. <em>People v Russo, </em>439 Mich 584, 595; 487 NW2d 698 (1992). Other rules of construction serve only as guides to assist us in determining the intent with a greater degree of certainty. <em>Nolan v Dep\u2019t of Licensing &amp; Regulation, </em>151 Mich App 641, 648; 391 NW2d 424 (1986). We recognize that, as a general rule, deference is given to an administrative agency\u2019s decisions, provided that the agency\u2019s construction is consistent with the purpose and policies of the statute itself.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>a</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">The mesa was enacted primarily for the benefit of persons involuntarily unemployed. Its purpose is to lighten the burden of economic insecurity on those who become unemployed through no fault of their own. <em>Kalamazoo Tank &amp; Silo Co v Unemployment Compensation Comm, </em>324 Mich 101, 107; 36 NW2d 226 (1949). The act specifies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-5\">Economic insecurity due to unemployment is a serious menace to the health, morals, and welfare of the people of this state. Involuntary unemployment is a subject of general interest and concern which requires action by the legislature to prevent its spread and to lighten its burden which so often falls with crushing force upon the unemployed worker and his family, to the detriment of the welfare of the people of this state. Social security requires protection against this hazard of our economic life. Employers should be encouraged to provide stable employment. [MCL 421.2; MSA 17.502.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">As the MESA is a remedial statute, it should be liberally construed to achieve its intended goal. <em>Dudewicz v Norris Schmid, Inc, </em>443 Mich 68, 77; 503 NW2d 645 (1993). The precise language of the act springs from its underlying policy. The wording expresses our legislators\u2019 ideas, which, taken as a whole, become the basis for legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">As Justice McAllister stated in his dissent in <em>Chrysler Corp v Smith, </em>297 Mich 438, 475; 298 NW 87 (1941):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-8\">The purpose of the legislation is to pay unemployment compensation benefits and to ameliorate the consequences of widespread unemployment. Such compensation is payable to unemployed workers with certain exceptions. To bring claimants within such exceptions, it is necessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>strain at the meaning of the language of the statute and to read into the act exceptions with regard to \u201cintegrated industry,\u201d which are not mentioned anywhere in the legislation. To say the least, this would result in a narrow rather than a liberal construction of the meaning of the statute. It is most salutary, and in this case, in our opinion, conclusive, to bear in mind that the purpose of the legislation is to pay unemployment benefits, and not to refuse them; and a liberal construction results in the allowance of the claims rather than their denial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">We cited the McAllister dissent with approval in <em>Park v Employment Security Comm, </em>355 Mich 103; 94 NW2d 407 (1959), which overruled <em>Chrysler Corp v Smith, supra. </em>See also <em>Johnides v St Lawrence Hosp, </em>184 Mich App 172; 457 NW2d 123 (1990); <em>Wilkerson v Jackson Public Schools, </em>170 Mich App 133, 136; 427 NW2d 570 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">In 1968, this Court interpreted \u00a7 29(8)(b) of the MESA, as then worded,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to mean that interim employment of even a short duration was sufficient to terminate the disqualification. <em>Great Lakes, supra. </em>The only standard to be applied with respect to interim employment was that an employee be an \u201cemployee\u201d of \u201cinterim employing units.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">The question in <em>Great Lakes </em>was whether the phrase \u201cestablishment in which he is or was last employed\u201d would affect the employees\u2019 claims for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 253-254. If it does, then a layoff from an interim employment is not disqualifying under \u00a7 29(8)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The <em>Great Lakes </em>Court did not define the necessary minimum length of interim employment. As a consequence, employees who had worked a few hours or days were able to avoid disqualification. Nor did the <em>Great Lakes </em>Court explicitly interpret \u00a7 29(8) (b) as requiring a subjective criterion of \u201cgood faith\u201d employment. Thus, the mesc urged the Legislature to adopt specific criteria to measure the nature and extent of services required for employees to satisfy \u00a7 29(8)(b) of the mesa.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">After this Court decided <em>Great Lakes, </em>the Legislature enacted 1974 PA 104, which amended \u00a7 29(8)(b).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The amendment was accomplished with an eye toward establishing objective criteria in evaluating interim employment. It supplied a means to determine whether employers are entitled to claim the bar of the disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>The Legislature was aware that the employees in <em>Great Lakes </em>had obtained interim employment with multiple employers collectively. In formulating the amendment, however, the issue whether interim employment with multiple employers satisfies the statutory requirement was not addressed. Rather, the Legislature dealt with the nature and the extent of the employment. It specified the amount of remuneration that an employee must earn (the nature) and the minimum period in which an employee must perform an interim employment (the extent).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">In its first opportunity to review the amended language of \u00a7 29(8)(b), the Court in <em>Dow, supra, </em>traced the history of 1974 PA 104. It identified the Legislature\u2019s underlying intent and goal as being to \u201crestore the viability\u201d of the labor dispute disqualification provision of the mesa. The Court found that the Legislature intended to supply objective, as contrasted with subjective, criteria for evaluating the substantiality of interim employment. <em>Dow, supra </em>at 480, 482. It never addressed the subjective criterion for \u201cgood faith\u201d employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The <em>Dow </em>majority\u2019s only comment on \u201cgood faith\u201d employment was in reference to the history of the adoption of 1974 PA 104. It noted that a majority of jurisdictions had insisted that an employee\u2019s requalification for unemployment benefits requires that new employment be undertaken in good faith after the former employment has been severed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The purpose was to prevent a striker from abusing the system by obtaining a make-work temporary job and then apply<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>ing for benefits while a strike was in progress. <em>Id. </em>But the <em>Dow </em>Court was not persuaded by those standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">It could have (1) adopted a subjective standard for determining whether a good-faith effort had been made by an employee to obtain bona fide employment, or it could have (2) provided a standard by which to judge whether interim employment had been taken merely to bypass the labor dispute disqualification provision. However, it chose to set no standard for determining an employee\u2019s subjective intentions, holding instead that \u00a7 29(8)(b) contained objective criteria. <em>Id. </em>at 482.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">We subscribe to and follow the reasoning of the <em>Dow </em>Court. We will not judicially legislate by adding language to the statute. <em>In re Marin, </em>198 Mich App 560, 564; 499 NW2d 400 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">FACTS AND APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\"><em>EMPIRE IRON MINING v ASMUND </em>AND <em>EMPIRE IRON MINING v ORHANEN</em></p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">The sixteen employees in these cases are members of the United Steelworkers Union. From July 31, 1990, to December 1, 1990, they engaged in a strike against their employers, Empire Iron and Tilden Mining Companies. During the strike, all sixteen obtained interim employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">In <em>Asmund, </em>the employees obtained interim employment from one employer, whereas the employees in <em>Orhanen </em>obtained their interim employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>through a union hiring hall. The jobs secured by the union hiring hall were from multiple employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Nevertheless, in both cases, each employment lasted at least two consecutive weeks, with each interim employer paying the employee wages at or above his benefit rate. In time, when the interim employers laid off or reduced the hours of the employees, each steelworker applied for unemployment compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">The Michigan Employment Security Commission, having initially denied each worker\u2019s application for benefits, changed its rulings on redetermination. The mining companies appealed from that decision to an mesc referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">The referee held a hearing on each claim and reversed the MESC\u2019s decisions. The steelworkers then appealed to the Board of Review, which, in turn, reversed the referee\u2019s decisions, finding that each steelworker had met the necessary statutory requirements for requalification of benefits. MCL 421.29(8)(b); MSA 17.531(8)(b). The circuit court affirmed the Board of Review. The mining companies then appealed to the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">l</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">THE \u201cGOOD FAITH\u201d CRITERION ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">In <em>Asmund, </em>the companies argued that \u00a7 29(8)(b) contained an implied subjective criterion that interim employment be performed in \u201cgood faith.\u201d The Court of Appeals agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-11\">It reasoned that each interim employment had been \u201cmake-work,\u201d created solely for the purpose of allowing the employee to requalify for benefits. Consequently, each worker was barred from receiving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>benefits. <em>Asmund, supra </em>at 121. The steelworkers appealed to this Court, which granted leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The steelworkers in <em>Asmund </em>argue that the Legislature achieved its purpose by amending \u00a7 29(8)(b). They contend that only the requirements expressed in the statute are necessary for requalification. Therefore, they conclude, nothing more should be required. We agree. We cannot read requirements into a statute that the Legislature did not put there.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">In defending their position, the mining companies in <em>Asmund </em>rely on <em>Alin v Alaska Employment Security Comm, </em>17 Alas 607, 615 (1958). They advance <em>Alin </em>as authority for the proposition that a subjective criterion of \u201cgood faith\u201d employment is necessary in evaluating interim employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">In <em>Alin, </em>the court was asked to interpret the phrase \u201clast employed.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It explained the rationale for its conclusion, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-8\">Where the act itself, as here, does not define the meaning of the term \u201clast employed\u201d it would seem that the commission could properly construe it to mean in effect \u201clast <em>regularly </em>employed.\u201d To do otherwise would open the door to unlimited abuse. It would permit a striker to obtain any sort of temporary work and when it was terminated to apply for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>benefits for the loss of the temporary job even though the work stoppage still continued. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The <em>Alin </em>court judicially inserted the word \u201cregularly\u201d when interpreting \u201clast employed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Although this Court has not been asked to interpret the phrase \u201clast employed,\u201d the mining companies have nonetheless asked this Court to follow the <em>Alin </em>court. They seek judicial imposition of a subjective criterion of \u201cgood faith\u201d when an employee has obtained interim employment during a labor dispute. We avoid inserting words in statutes unless necessary to give intelligible meaning or to prevent absurdity. See <em>McKibbin v Corporation &amp; Securities Comm, </em>369 Mich 69; 119 NW2d 557 (1963); <em>Lawrence Baking Co v Unemployment Compensation Comm, </em>308 Mich 198; 13 NW2d 260 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Because of our reluctance to insert words into statutes, we will not read into \u00a7 29(8)(b) a subjective intent requirement of good faith on the part of employees. Given the remedial purpose of the mesa and the potential to overload the system if subjective criteria were adopted, we will not tread where the Legislature has refused to go. Inquiry into the subjective elements of an employee\u2019s employment is outside the bounds of the act.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>2</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">THE \u201cSINGLE EMPLOYER\u201d ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">In <em>Orhanen, </em>the mining companies argued that the plain wording of the statute permits consideration of wages paid by only one employer in determining an employee\u2019s eligibility for benefits. Under the companies\u2019 reading of the statute, then, the steelworkers could not qualify for benefits. A single employer did not pay them enough wages in at least two consecutive weeks of interim employment to meet the requirements of \u00a7 29(8)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Employees Peter Orhanen, Gary Pyykkonen, and Dale A. Toivonen held union millwright cards and secured interim employment with at least three different companies through their union hiring hall.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The employments were transient, involving only one or two long shifts with any one employer. The issue is whether wages paid to the worker by more than one employer in the qualifying period can be combined to entitle the worker to unemployment benefits. We rule that they can.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Initially, the phrase \u201can employer\u201d suggests that the plain language of the termination provision requires that interim employment be with a single employer, only. We cannot interpret \u00a7 29(8)(b) apart from other sections of the statute \u201cwithout constant reference to the whole.\u201d <em>Plymouth Stamping v Lipshu, </em>436 Mich 1, 17; 461 NW2d 859 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">We begin with the requirements that appear in the statute. They establish that an individual can requalify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>for unemployment benefits by (1) performing services in employment for at least two consecutive weeks, and (2) earning wages each week equal to or greater than the actual or potential weekly benefit rate. In defining and calculating the \u201cbenefit rate,\u201d we are required to examine other sections of the act for guidance.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, we review MCL 421.20; MSA 17.521 and MCL 421.50; MSA 17.554, which set forth the standard for determining such rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Specifically, MCL 421.20(b); MSA 17.521(b) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-7\">If the individual earned credit weeks from more than 1 employer, a separate determination shall be made of the amount and duration of benefits based upon the total credit weeks and wages earned with each employer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">Finally, in order to establish the meaning of a \u201ccredit week,\u201d we rely on MCL 421.50; MSA 17.554. That section not only defines \u201ccredit week,\u201d it refers to wages earned from more than one employer. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-9\">(1) If an individual earns wages from more than 1 employer in a credit week, that week shall be counted as 1 multiemployer credit week and shall be governed by the provisions of section 20(e) ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-10\">[2] (a) First, all credit weeks which are not multiemployer credit weeks and which were earned with employers not involved in a disqualifying act or discharge under section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>29(1), and all credit weeks earned with an employer involved in such a disqualifying act or discharge which were earned subsequent to the last act or discharge in which the employer was involved, shall be counted in inverse order of most recent employment with each employer. [MCL 421.50(b); MSA 17.554(b).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">Thus, reviewing the statute as a whole, we conclude that \u201can employer\u201d may be interpreted as meaning multiple employers.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-5\">Statutes in pari materia are those which relate to the same person or thing, or the same class of persons or things, or which have a common purpose. It is the rule that in construction of a particular statute, or in the interpretation of its provisions, all statutes relating to the same subject, or having the same general purpose, should be read in connection with it, as together constituting one law, although enacted at different times, and containing no reference one to the other. <em>[Detroit v Michigan Bell, </em>374 Mich 543, 558; 132 NW2d 660 (1965).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The rule that statutes that relate to the same subject matter should be read, construed, and applied together to distill the Legislature\u2019s intention is of paramount importance in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Next, examining other courts\u2019 decisions, we have found only one that has specifically addressed whether the phrase \u201can employer\u201d in a statute refers to more than one employer. <em>Taminski v Administrator, Unemployment Compensation Act, </em>168 Conn 324; 362 A2d 868 (1975). The Connecticut Supreme Court held in <em>Taminski </em>that wages paid to an unemployment compensation claimant by more than one employer may be combined in determining eligibility for unemployment benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 327. In addition, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>ruled that the word \u201can\u201d as used in the phrase \u201can employer\u201d in its statute is not limited to \u201cone.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The <em>Taminski </em>court stated that its statute did not support the limited interpretation placed upon it. It recognized that its statute was remedial in nature, and therefore, held that its provisions were to be liberally construed for its beneficiaries in order to achieve its purpose. <em>Id. </em>We find the <em>Taminski </em>court\u2019s rationale persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Finally, the Michigan Legislature has provided us with the necessary rules for making this statutory interpretation.

Hence, I would reverse the decisions of the Court of Appeals, the circuit court, and the Board of Review of the Michigan Employment Security Commission in <em>Orhanen </em>and reinstate the mesc\u2019s referee decisions because the three employees, by their own admission, did not work for at least two consecutive weeks with a single employer. In <em>Asmund, </em>I agree with the majority that the statute does not include a good-faith requirement, but I disagree with some of its analysis that suggests that the statute is ambiguous. I agree that this Court should reverse the Court of Appeals decision, but I concur in the result only.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">I. <em>EMPIRE IRON MINING v ORHANEN</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The rules of statutory construction are well established. This Court begins by examining the language of the statute itself. See <em>Tryc v Michigan Veterans\u2019 Facility, </em>451 Mich 129, 135; 545 NW2d 642 (1996). Where the language of the statute is unambiguous, the plain meaning reflects the Legislature\u2019s intent and this Court applies the statute as written. Judicial con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>struction is not permitted. <em>Id. </em>Although this Court affords an agency some deference in interpreting a statute that it executes, the agency\u2019s interpretation is not binding on this Court and cannot be used to overcome the statute\u2019s plain meaning. <em>Ludington Service Corp v Acting Ins Comm\u2019r, </em>444 Mich 481, 505; 511 NW2d 661 (1994). Section 29(8) provides that an employee is disqualified from receiving unemployment compensation benefits during a week in which that employee is unemployed because of a labor dispute. An employee may, however, end this disqualification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-5\">An individual\u2019s disqualification imposed or imposable under this subsection is terminated if the individual performs services in employment <em>with an employer </em>in at least 2 consecutive weeks falling wholly within the period of the individual\u2019s total or partial unemployment due to the labor dispute, and in addition earns wages in each of those weeks in an amount equal to or greater than the individual\u2019s actual or potential weekly benefit rate with respect to those weeks based on the individual\u2019s employment with the employer involved in the labor dispute. [MCL 421.29(8)(b); MSA 17.531(8)(b) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The majority concludes that an employee may terminate his disqualification even if he does not work for two consecutive weeks with a single employer. <em>Ante, </em>p 429. The opinion concludes, without expressly stating, that the statute\u2019s language is ambiguous. I disagree with this approach because I believe that the statute, examined by itself, is unambiguous. In using the phrase \u201cwith an employer,\u201d the Legislature has required that an employee work for two weeks with <em>a single employer </em>in order to requalify for unemploy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>merit compensation benefits during a labor strike. I see no need for judicial construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">The majority relies on other sections of the act, specifically MCL 421.20; MSA 17.521 (determining how benefits shall be paid) and MCL 421.50; MSA 17.554 (defining \u201ccredit week\u201d), to support its claim that \u201can employer\u201d in \u00a7 29(8) may refer to multiple employers. See <em>ante, </em>pp 426-427. However, the specific sections the majority quotes, which indicate that an employee may receive benefits for a week in which he worked for multiple employers, do not govern the circumstance in which an employee attempts to terminate his disqualification under \u00a7 29(8) during a labor strike through interim work. Subsection 29(8) specifically disqualifies an employee for unemployment benefits during a labor dispute and identifies the requirements that he must meet to terminate it. The majority ignores the plain language of \u00a7 29(8), which requires that the interim employment be \u201cwith an employer,\u201d and instead cites other provisions of the act that do not apply in this circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The majority secondly examines a foreign jurisdiction\u2019s treatment of a similarly worded statute in support of its conclusion. See <em>ante, </em>pp 427-428, relying on <em>Taminski v Administrator, Unemployment Compensation Act, </em>168 Conn 324; 362 A2d 868 (1975). Finally, the majority, after its examination of the Connecticut case, relies on the Michigan statutory rule of construction, MCL 8.3b; MSA 2.212(2), for support in reading \u201can employer\u201d to mean \u201cany number of employers.\u201d MCL 8.3b; MSA 2.212(2) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-6\">Every word importing the singular number only <em>may </em>extend to and embrace the plural number, and every word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>importing the plural number <em>may </em>be applied and limited to the singular number. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The majority, by applying this permissive inference to this statute, renders the unambiguous language of the statute ambiguous. The purpose of the statutory rules of construction is to enhance the Court\u2019s ability to interpret the legislative intent when a statute is unclear, not to obscure what is otherwise clear. The Legislature has expressly reserved, under MCL 8.3; MSA 2.212, the application of these statutory rules to cases in which the Legislature\u2019s intent is not manifest, i.e., when the statutory language is ambiguous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-6\">In the construction of the statutes of this state, the rules stated in sections 3a to 3w shall be observed, <em>unless such construction would be inconsistent with the manifest intent of the legislature. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Consequently, I would limit the application of the statutory rules of construction, listed in \u00a7\u00a7 3a to 3w, to statutes in which (1) the plain language does not make the Legislature\u2019s intent manifest, or, in other words, the statute is ambiguous or (2) the statute\u2019s language would otherwise create an absurd result. See <em>Crowley, Milner &amp; Co v Macomb Circuit Judge, </em>239 Mich 605, 615-616; 215 NW 29 (1927) (\u201cThe statute [that the singular number may embrace the plural number] is for use and has been employed to avert <em>ridiculous </em>situations\u201d [emphasis added]). The rule of statutory construction in MCL 8.3b; MSA 2.212(2) should not be applied to the unambiguous language of \u00a7 29(8) because the plain language does not create an absurd result.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>The plain meaning of the statute as written is consistent with this Court\u2019s explanation in <em>Dow Chemical Co v Curtis, </em>431 Mich 471, 481, n 10; 430 NW2d 645 (1988), of the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting this provision. In <em>Dow, supra </em>at 482, we concluded that the Legislature intended to ensure that there were \u201cobjective criteria\u201d for evaluating \u201cthe <em>substantiality </em>of \u2018interim employment\u2019 \u201d necessary to requalify an employee for unemployment compensation benefits dining a labor strike. (Emphasis added.) This Court, in <em>Dow, </em>was evaluating the relevant statutory language in \u00a7 29(8), which, the Court noted, had been enacted \u201cto restore the viability\u201d of the labor dispute disqualification. <em>Id. </em>at 480. The Legislature was attempting to remedy the deficiency created by this Court in <em>Great Lakes Steel Corp v Employment Security Comm, </em>381 Mich 249; 161 NW2d 14 (1968), when we interpreted the predecessor of \u00a7 29 to allow work of \u201ceven a very short duration\u201d to end the labor dispute disqualification. See <em>Dow, supra </em>at 480. Hence, the Legislature adopted the objective criteria outlined in \u00a7 29(8). <em>Id. </em>at 481-482.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See also <em>ante, </em>pp 418-421, for a history of the provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>In the context of the legislative history, the Legislature\u2019s decision in \u00a7 29(8) to use the phrase \u201cwith an employer\u201d indicates that the Legislature intended to create an objective requirement regarding the nature of the work. The majority fails to provide any explanation for the reason that this critical phrase appears in the statute. The statute also requires that the employee work two weeks with the single employer, these two weeks be consecutive, and the employee earn income equal to, or greater than, his weekly benefit rate with his previpus employer dining that period. By requiring that the employment of two consecutive weeks be with a single employer, this provision furthers the Legislature\u2019s wish to safeguard that any interim work be \u201csubstantial[],\u201d see <em>Dow, supra </em>at 482, by ensuring that the employee obtain a stable interim position, and not just makeshift work with various employers for any duration. The requirement that there be only a single employer guarantees that the employee achieved a modest measure of stability in the interim employment before seeking unemployment benefits when that work ceased. Because there is no dispute that these three employees did not work for two weeks with a single employer, I would reinstate the referee decisions that this interim employment did not end the labor dispute disqualification.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">n. <em>EMPIRE IRON MINING v ASMUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">In <em>Asmund, </em>I agree that there is no good-faith requirement in \u00a7 29(8). The majority\u2019s analysis, \u201cby examining the rationale underlying the [Michigan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Employment Security Act],\u201d and by considering the \u201chistory and circumstances surrounding \u00a7 29(8)(b),\u201d <em>ante, </em>pp 415-416, suggests that the statute\u2019s language is ambiguous. Although the opinion claims that it is only engaging in judicial construction in footnote 12 on page 423 to demonstrate that the plain meaning of the statute will not produce an absurd result, the rest of the opinion\u2019s analysis suggests otherwise. I believe that the statute unambiguously fails to include a good-faith requirement. Hence, I do not think there is any reason to engage in judicial construction. See <em>Tryc, supra </em>at 135. I also agree with the majority that an examination of the legislative history of the statute reveals that the Legislature did not intend to create a good-faith requirement, but instead only established objective criteria. See <em>ante, </em>pp 422-423. This judicial construction is only necessary, in my opinion, for demonstrating that the statute\u2019s plain meaning does not create an absurd result.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">In examining the language of \u00a7 29(8), I would hold that the statute requires an employee to prove three points before terminating the labor dispute disqualification: he must prove that (1) he has worked for two consecutive weeks, (2) with the same employer, and (3) has earned a wage equal to or greater than the actual or potential benefit rate from his previous employer. For these thirteen employees in <em>Asmund, </em>each employee satisfied the objective criteria of \u00a7 29(8) by working for a single employer for two consecutive weeks and, during that period, was paid a greater wage than he was paid by his previous employer.
