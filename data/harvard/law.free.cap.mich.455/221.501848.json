The appellate court found that the trial court erred because it failed to expressly consider the statutorily enumerated factors listed in \u00a7 17, specifically, the financial resources and earning ability of the defendant, the financial needs of the defendant and his family, or other relevant factors, such as defendant\u2019s assertion that he played a limited role in the offense. 210 Mich App 467, 471; 534 NW2d 149 (1995).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>We hold that the trial court did not err in failing to hold a separate hearing or make an express determination regarding the defendant\u2019s ability to pay under the Crime Victim\u2019s Rights Act. In reaching its decision, the trial court implicitly considered both the amount of restitution owed and the defendant\u2019s ability to pay within the statutory requirements. The deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>sion of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the order of restitution reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-3\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURE</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">The defendant was charged with four counts of conspiracy to commit uttering and publishing<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and with being a second felony offender. At the plea hearing, the prosecutor agreed to 1) dismiss three counts of uttering and publishing and the supplemental charge, 2) not charge on other similar offenses if defendant cooperated to clear up the other offenses, and 3) recommend a five-year maximum-minimum sentence. The plea agreement also contained an explicit provision that the defendant would be \u201cresponsible for restitution as set by the Court.\u201d Both defendant and defense counsel affirmed that these terms constituted the complete agreement. The defendant admitted giving various persons rides to the store or bank to defraud them of their money and that he had received a portion of the defrauded funds. He also admitted an earlier conviction for uttering and publishing. After finding the plea was voluntary, the court accepted the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">At the plea hearing, the defendant requested a bond reduction so that he could be released pending sentencing. At that time, defense counsel stated that Mr. Grant had six children, had lived in the area for twenty-three years, had family in the area, and had been steadily employed for the past two and a half years. The prosecutor then stated that the amount of money in this case reached \u201cinto the six figures.\u201d In response, the defense attorney asserted that the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>conspirators had been involved in the conspiracy for a longer time and that defendant\u2019s involvement was limited. Defense counsel did agree that hundreds of thousands of dollars had been taken but, he claimed, not by defendant. The judge denied the bond reduction motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">At the sentencing hearing, the judge indicated that he had read the presentence report and the recommendation that, in addition to a term of incarceration, the defendant also pay restitution of $175,000. The report confirmed that the forty-one-year-old defendant had a high school education, had no physical or mental disabilities, and had been previously employed. It related that defendant was not a drug user, was not married, and admitted the paternity of five children.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The report further noted that defendant was on parole supervision from a previous uttering and publishing conviction when the instant offense was committed, and that the offense was a major check-cashing scheme. A Grand Rapids police department investigation had determined that defendant was a primary player in an elaborate check-cashing scheme that used police scanners and various runners to peipetrate the fraud, causing a loss to the victims in excess of $175,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The court asked defense counsel if he and defendant had received the report. Defense counsel replied that both he and defendant had read and reviewed the contents. Both defendant and counsel were given an opportunity to comment on the contents of the report. Counsel claimed that there was no evidence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>support the contention that defendant was one of the main players in the check-cashing scheme and that the defendant only provided rides to three persons to facilitate the check-cashing operation. He stated that the case against defendant did not contain evidence of $175,000 worth of cashed checks. Counsel indicated that the other matters in the report were accurate and that there were no other objections. The defendant agreed with his attorney and made no further comment on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The court acknowledged receipt of the presentence report, the defendant\u2019s statement, which according to the presentence report was the defendant\u2019s written version of the offense (this statement was not received as part of the record), and various letters written on the defendant\u2019s behalf.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The judge stated that he had considered these matters before sentencing and that he had read the presentence report. In accordance with the agreed prosecutorial recommendation, defendant was sentenced to a term of five to twenty-one years, and restitution was imposed as a condition of parole for $175,000 to be paid jointly and severally with other codefendants. Defendant made no objection to the imposition of restitution or the amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The defendant did not assert at any time that he was unable to pay restitution; rather, defense counsel's remarks at sentencing were directed toward the defendant\u2019s alleged limited participation in the conspiracy. The Court of Appeals found that counsel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>comments were \u201cinsufficient to require the trial court to conduct [a separate] evidentiary hearing.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, because defendant did not challenge the accuracy of the restitution figure, offer evidence in support of any other figure, or specifically request an additional hearing on the restitution order, the Court opined that, given the procedural default, \u201cthe trial court was not required to conduct a hearing for the purpose of fulfilling the mandates of [\u00a7 17] MCL 780.767(1); MSA 28.1287(767)(1).\u201d 210 Mich App 471.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">However, the Court of Appeals agreed with defendant that, despite the fact that no separate hearing was required, the trial court\u2019s determination of restitution \u201cfell short of the statutory requirements,\u201d apparently because the trial court did not expressly consider the factors set forth in the statute, that is, the \u201cdefendant\u2019s ability to pay, the financial needs of defendant and his family, or any other nonenumerated but relevant factors, such as defendant\u2019s claimed limited role in the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals vacated the order of restitution and remanded to the trial court for reconsideration. The people sought and we granted leave to appeal. 450 Mich 964 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">R. RESTITUTION</p>\n<p id=\"AXX\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Restitution in Michigan is afforded not only by statute, but also by Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 24, which entitles victims of crime to restitution relief.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In <em>People v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number><em>Peters, </em>449 Mich 515, 523-524; 537 NW2d 160 (1995), we observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">The Michigan Crime Victim\u2019s Rights Act was enacted in 1985 in response to growing recognition of the concerns of crime victims. The act codifies a crime victim\u2019s right to restitution, while leaving to the discretion of the sentencing judge the form the restitution will take ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-6\">In 1988, after the enactment of the Crime Victim\u2019s Rights Act, Michigan\u2019s Constitution was amended to further enumerate the rights of crime victims. These laws underscore the rights of crime victims and the compensatory nature of restitution in Michigan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">The compensatory nature of restitution is, therefore, specifically designed to allow crime victims to recoup losses suffered as a result of criminal conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 523.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>When restitution is ordered by the court either at the judge\u2019s discretion or as part of a plea agreement,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>MCL 780.767(1); MSA 28.1287(767)(1), subsection 17(1) requires:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-5\">The court, in determining whether to order restitution under section 16[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>] and the amount of that restitution, shall consider the amount of the loss sustained by any victim as a result of the offense, the financial resources and earning ability of the defendant, the financial needs of the defendant and the defendant\u2019s dependents, and such other factors as the court considers appropriate[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>The statute involves two separate inquiries: first, a determination of the amount of the victim\u2019s loss and, second, an evaluation of the factors that would affect the defendant\u2019s ability to pay restitution.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The first inquiry requires consideration regarding the amount of the victim\u2019s loss. In the present case, the presentence report recommended restitution in the amount of $175,000 to be paid jointly and severally with other codefendants. Defense counsel stated that both he and defendant had reviewed the report. Defendant did not request a hearing on this issue, there was no objection to the amount of the loss, and defendant did not offer evidence to support any other figure.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The presentence report specifically stated that the police had investigated the conspiracy and confirmed the amount of the loss sustained by the victims. A judge is entitled to rely on the information in the presentence report,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> which is presumed to be accurate unless the defendant effectively challenges the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>accuracy of the factual information.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The defendant knew in advance and agreed that he would be required to pay restitution as \u201cset by the Court\u201d and that the amount was \u201cinto the six figures.\u201d In the present case, the voluntary nature of the plea and the express terms of the plea agreement evidence that defendant was fully aware and accepted his obligation to pay whatever amount the court determined was appropriate restitution for the losses sustained by the victims. The defendant did not present any information contrary to the amount of restitution imposed or offer support for any other figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">b \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">With regard to defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court was required to conduct a separate hearing, we agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>with the Court of Appeals that the statute did not mandate a separate hearing. Because the defendant agreed to make restitution and did not contest the amount of loss, defendant did not effectively challenge the accuracy of the statement regarding the amount of the loss to the victims that was provided in the presentence report. Absent a dispute, the court was not required to make express findings regarding the amount of restitution. The judge properly relied on the information in the presentence report in determining the amount of restitution.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> However, we disagree with the Court of Appeals that defendant\u2019s claim that he had only taken part in three specific minor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>instances that involved him in the conspiracy was not properly considered by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">The Crime Victim\u2019s Rights Act provides restitution \u201cto any victim of the defendant\u2019s course of conduct that gives rise to the conviction . . . .\u201d MCL 780.766(2); MSA 28.1287(766)(2).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The crime of conspiracy involves a defendant\u2019s course of conduct and is based upon an unlawful agreement between coconspirators. A conspirator need not participate in all the objects of the conspiracy. In general, each conspirator is held criminally responsible for the acts of his associates committed in furtherance of the common design, and, in the eyes of the law, the acts of one or more are the acts of all the conspirators. <em>People v Houseman, </em>128 Mich App 17, 23-24; 339 NW2d 666 (1983).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The defendant pleaded guilty of conspiracy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>and accepted restitution set by the court, which he received in exchange for limiting his sentence exposure from life (habitual offender, fourth)<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> to a five-year minimum. The defendant cannot now assert that he is responsible for his acts alone because he is also responsible for the acts of his coconspirators made in furtherance of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Section 17 also requires the court, when determining whether to order restitution under \u00a7 16 and, if ordered, the amount of restitution to be imposed, to consider the following factors: 1) the financial resources and earning capacity of the defendant, 2) the financial needs of the defendant and his dependents, and 3) such other factors as the court considers appropriate. We find that by entering into the plea agreement, defendant acknowledged the existence of these factors and agreed that he could make restitution. We agree with the Court of Appeals decision in <em>People v Hart, </em>211 Mich App 703, 708; 536 NW2d 605 (1995), that a defendant who enters into a plea agreement that includes restitution \u201cimplicitly agree [s]\u201d to pay restitution in an amount to be decided by the court. By voluntarily entering into the plea agreement, the defendant authorized the court to determine that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>the defendant had considered his own financial situation and concluded that he has or will have the ability to pay.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">We also agree with the Court of Appeals in <em>Hart </em>that \u201cthe restitution agreement cannot be construed as establishing a waiver of the right to have a court review such things as ability to pay and resources,\u201d but the statute does not \u201crequire [] the court to hold an evidentiary hearing regarding the enumerated factors . . . .\u201d Rather, the trial \u201ccourt merely must consider those factors in reaching its decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 708-709. The statute places the responsibility on the defendant in the case of a dispute in respect to the proper amount or type of restitution, to demonstrate his financial resources, needs, and the needs of his dependents<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> in order to rebut the presumption created by the defendant\u2019s agreement to pay restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">In the instant case, as in <em>Hart, </em>the lower court considered the enumerated factors and found nothing to overcome the presumption created by defendant\u2019s plea agreement. A review of the presentence report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>and other facts on the record affirmed that the trial court had decided the issue regarding defendant\u2019s earning ability by determining that the defendant possessed skills that would aid him in his search for employment. Accordingly, we agree and adopt the conclusion that, as in Hart:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-5\">[T]he trial court properly considered the express and implied terms of defendant\u2019s restitution agreement, including, of course, his earning ability and financial resources and the financial needs of defendant and defendant\u2019s dependents. In short, defendant\u2019s ambiguous assertions of an inability to pay did not rebut the strong presumption of financial ability created by his entering a plea agreement to pay restitution. <em>[Id. </em>at 710.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">The Crime Victim\u2019s Rights Act was passed in an attempt to address public concerns regarding the disproportionate treatment of victims of crime.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> To rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>tify a perceived insensitivity to the plight of crime victims, the Legislature acted to recognize victims needs and rights. House Legislative Analysis, HB 4009, 4545, and 4370, July 16, 1985, p 2. In addition to other provisions, the Legislature proposed that restitution be made to crime victims who had suffered \u201cdirect or threatened physical, financial, or emotional harm . . . .\u201d In accord with this intent, the statute adopted language from the legislative analysis that contemplates that victims are entitled to full restitution for their losses, payable immediately. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>25</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Following this resolution, the Legislature determined that the court would be required to consider \u201cthe resources and earning ability of the defendant\u201d as well as the \u201cfinancial needs of the defendant and his or her dependents, and other appropriate factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>These considerations indicate that the Legislature was aware that payment of restitution in full, as contemplated, would be dependent on the existing financial resources of the defendant or his ability to earn before a victim might have, in a practical sense, any hope of recovering his losses. Thus, the statute provided a means for the trial court to determine if a defendant had the resources or ability to pay the amount of the victim\u2019s loss and what the victim might actually expect to recover.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>E</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">In the instant case, the trial court properly reviewed and considered defendant Grant\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">presentence report, his written and oral statements, and various letters submitted on his behalf. The presentence report confirmed that the forty-one-year-old defendant had a high school education, no physical or mental disabilities, had previously been employed, was not a drug user, was not married, and admitted the paternity of five nonmarital children for which he claimed a total obligation of $100 a week in child support. The letters in support of the defendant indicated that he had been steadily employed for the past two and a half years at Cascade Engineering and, in addition, was a professional painter. This was sufficient information for the trial court to consider the defendant\u2019s financial resources and the financial needs of the defendant and his dependents.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The defendant did not assert that he could not pay the restitution amount or present any evidence to rebut the \u201cstrong presumption of financial ability created by his entering a plea agreement\u201d that included an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>understanding in the agreement to pay restitution in an amount to be set by the court. 211 Mich App 710.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">We hold that the language of the statute does not require the trial judge to make a separate factual inquiry and individual findings on the record. When determining restitution, whether it is included in the plea agreement or is statutorily imposed at the discretion of the trial court, the statute requires the court \u201cto consider\u201d the enumerated factors in light of all the information available at the time of the sentencing hearing and then impose the sentence. Only an actual dispute, properly raised at the sentencing hearing in respect to the type or amount of restitution, triggers the need to resolve the dispute by a preponderance of the evidence. MCL 780.767(4); MSA 28.1287(767)(4).<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Further, the inclusion of restitution in the plea agreement establishes a strong presumption that the defendant has or will have the financial ability to pay restitution.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>m. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">In sum, we hold that the sentencing court was not required to hold a separate hearing or to make express findings on the record in respect to the amount of restitution or the defendant\u2019s ability to pay restitution absent a timely objection by the defendant. The trial court properly considered the enumerated factors within the statutory requirements. Because defendant did not object to the amount of restitution and did not present any evidence in support of an alternative amount, he has failed to overcome the strong presumption of financial ability to pay restitution created by the voluntary plea agreement. We reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the order of restitution.</p>\n<judges id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Mallett, C.J., and Brickley, Cavanagh, Riley, Weaver, and Kelly, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b309-10\"> Section 17, MCL 780.767(1), (4); MSA 28.1287(767)(1), (4) in existence at the time this defendant was sentenced provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-11\">(1) The court, in determining whether to order restitution under section 16 and the amount of that restitution, shall consider the amount of the loss sustained by any victim as a result of the offense, the financial resources and earning ability of the defendant, the financial needs of the defendant and the defendant\u2019s dependents, and such other factors as the court considers appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-13\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-14\">(4) Any dispute as to the proper amount or type of restitution shall be resolved by the court by a preponderance of the evidence.

A probationer may not be punished if he is unable to afford restitution and can request the court to reduce the amount of restitution. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>A defendant who timely asserts an inability to pay must be heard, at which time the judge shall determine if the restitution is within the defendant\u2019s means. Thus, a defendant\u2019s ability to pay when restitution is imposed need only be determined if the defendant timely asserts either an objection to the amount of restitution or an inability to make such payments. 428 Mich 360 (emphasis in the original).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">We disagree with the Court of Appeals in <em>Grant </em>that the holding of <em>Music </em>should be limited to the probation statute. The Crime Victim\u2019s Rights Act, like the probation statute in <em>Music, </em>makes a distinction between the imposition and payment of restitution. Subsection 17(1) of the Crime Victim\u2019s Rights Act, MCL 780.767(1); MSA 28.1287(767)(1), concerns conditions of payment and specifically cross references \u00a7 16, MCL 780.766; MSA 28.1287(766), which contains various provisions concerning the imposition of restitution. Section 16 also addresses both parole and probation situations, MCL 780.766(13); MSA 28.1287(766)(13) and, similar to the probation statute, provides that a defendant lacking resources to pay may not be punished for failure to pay restitution, MCL 780.766(16); MSA 28.1287(766)(16). The earlier subsections, 13 and 16, were subsequently renumbered 14 and 17, respectively, in a 1993 amendment, with minor language changes.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">When \u00a7\u00a716 and 17 of the Crime Victim\u2019s Rights Act are correctly read together, they fall squarely within the ambit of <em>Music. </em>In imposing restitution as part of a sentence under the act, this statute, like the probation statute, does not expressly state that a sentencing judge is required to hold a separate hearing or make express findings regarding a defendant\u2019s ability to pay restitution at imposition absent a timely assertion by the defendant that he is unable to pay or disputes the amount of restitution. The rationale in <em>Music </em>is equally applicable to the imposition, payment, and punishment provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 16 and 17, MCL 780.766; MSA 28.1287(766) and MCL 780.767; MSA 28.1287(767).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">The combined statutory language of \u00a7\u00a7 16 and 17, like the combined statutory language of the probation statute, requires consideration of payment factors but does not require an express determination on the record regarding the defendant\u2019s ability to pay, absent a timely objection, at the time restitution is imposed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b312-6\"> The victims of the scheme were Great Day Foods, Sy\u2019s Market, and Old Kent Bank.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b313-7\"> In his petition for a court-appointed attorney for the bench trial, defendant indicated that he had an obligation of $100 a week in child support.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b314-7\"> The letters included two letters from his two ex-girl Mends, the mothers of four of his children, one letter from his daughter, one letter from his supervisor at Cascade Engineering, and one letter from a coemployee who had employed him to paint her house.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b315-8\"> 210 Mich App 470, citing <em>Music, supra </em>at 361.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b315-9\"> In 1988, the Michigan electorate approved a constitutional amendment affording crime victims certain legal rights.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-10\">(1) Crime victims, as defined by law, shall have the following rights, as provided by law:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>The right to be treated with fairness and respect for their dignity and privacy throughout the criminal justice process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-9\">The right to timely disposition of the case following arrest of the accused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-10\">The right to be reasonably protected from the accused throughout the criminal justice process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-11\">The right to notification of court proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-12\">The right to attend trial and all other court proceedings the accused has the right to attend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-13\">The right to confer with the prosecution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-14\">The right to make a statement to the court at sentencing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-15\">The right to restitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-16\">The right to information about the conviction, sentence, imprisonment, and release of the accused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-17\">(2) The legislature may provide by law for the enforcement of the section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-18\">(3) The legislature may provide for an assessment against convicted defendants to pay for crime victims\u2019 rights.

Before 1994, \u00a7 16, MCL 780.766(2), (3); MSA 28.1287(766)(2), (3) read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-9\">(2) The court, when sentencing a defendant convicted of a crime, may order, in addition to or in lieu of any other penalty authorized by law or in addition to any other penalty required by law, that the defendant make restitution to any victim of the defendant\u2019s course of conduct which gives rise to the conviction, or to the victim\u2019s estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-10\">(3) If the court does not order restitution, or orders only partial restitution under this section, the court shall state on the record the reasons for that action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-11\">The permissive language of the statute allowed trial courts to order restitution at their discretion. Thus, even absent a specific restitution agreement in the plea, the circuit court had independent statutory authority to order restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-12\">The federal restitution statute in effect before April, 1996, 18 USC 3663(a)(1)(A), parallels the Michigan restitution statute in effect until May, 1994, and has similar provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-13\">The court, when sentencing a defendant convicted of an offense under this title . . . may order, in addition to or, in the case of a misdemeanor, in lieu of any other penalty authorized by law, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>the defendant make restitution to any victim of such offense, or if the victim is deceased, to the victim\u2019s estate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">The federal statute, in contrast to the Michigan statute, expressly recognizes that restitution may be a part of the plea agreement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-8\">The court may also order restitution in any criminal case to the extent agreed to by the parties in a plea agreement.

In the plea agreement, the defendant agreed to pay \u201cin any amount not exceeding $454,477.82.\u201d The defendant did not object when the district court ordered restitution in that amount. On appeal, the court found that the defendant had waived her right to contest the amount of restitution because she had agreed not to \u201cappeal the accuracy\u201d of this factor. The court noted that the presentence report informed the defendant that restitution was applicable, she acknowledged the amount, did not object to the report, and did not argue in opposition to restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\"><em>United States v Gabriele, </em>24 F3d 68, 72 (CA 10, 1994). The court found no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s failure to make a specific loss determination.

The court stated that the statute does not require the trial court to make specific factual findings unless the restitution amount is disputed.

Subsection 13 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-9\">hi determining the amount of restitution, the court shall consider the defendant\u2019s earning ability, financial resources, and any other special circumstances that may have a bearing on the defendant\u2019s ability to pay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">This section has been entirely deleted and a new subsection 13 has been enacted that states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-11\">An order of restitution entered under this section remains effective until it is satisfied in full. An order or restitution is a judgment and lien against all property of the defendant for the amount specified in the order of restitution. The lien may be recorded as provided by law.

While this revised statute was not in effect at the time of the instant defendant\u2019s order of restitution, the Legislature has indicated its intent to carry out the mandate of art 1, \u00a7 24, by authorizing that restitution be imposed at the time of sentencing without regard to the defendants\u2019 ability to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">Federal law has similarly been amended. See 18 USC 3664(f)(1)(a), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-10\">In each order of restitution, the court shall order restitution to each victim in the full amount of each victim\u2019s losses as determined by the court and without consideration of the economic circumstances of the defendant.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b326-11\"> The statute states that, if a court does not order restitution or orders only partial restitution, it will have to explain the reasons on the record.

See n 30 and accompanying text for corresponding federal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-12\">The statute also requires restitution to be paid immediately or, if the court determines the circumstances require, within a specified period or in specific installments. The timing of payment may also be dependent on the defendant\u2019s status of probation or parole.

For example, \u00a7 16 of the act requires, that any restitution ordered shall be set off against any amount that is later recovered by a victim as compensatory damages. MCL 780.766(11); MSA 28.1287(766)(11). In the present case, a bank had significant losses as a result of the check-cashing scheme. If the bank carried liability insurance covering this type of fraudulent scheme, recovery from the insurer would offset the restitution amount, reducing defendant\u2019s obligation.

MCL 780.766(13); MSA 28.1287(766)(13) subsequently renumbered subsection 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Defendants are also protected from jail or incarceration for nonpayment of restitution unless the defendant has resources to pay the restitution or has not made a good-faith effort toward payment of the restitution.
