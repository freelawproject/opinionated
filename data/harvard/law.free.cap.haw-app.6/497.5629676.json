He claims that since the operator of the Intoxilyzer was unqualified under Chapter 111 of Title 11 of the Hawaii Administrative Rules (Rules),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the test result should have been suppressed. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>On September 10, 1985, Police Sergeant William K.C. Ching, Jr. (Ching) conducted the Intoxilyzer test on Defendant who had been arrested for a DUI offense. The test result indicated 0.15 per cent by weight of alcohol in Defendant\u2019s blood.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">At the commencement of a bench trial in the circuit court,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant orally moved to suppress the Intoxilyzer test result, and acceding to Defendant\u2019s request the court consolidated the hearing on the motion and the trial on the merits. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Doyle, </em>64 Haw. 229, 638 P.2d 332 (1981). Ching testified that in 1979 he completed a one-day training program in the operation of the Intoxilyzer at the Kauai Community College, although allowing for coffee breaks and a lunch break the actual training period totaled less than eight hours; he was thereafter certified as an operator; he operated the Intoxilyzer in 1979, 1980, and 1981; and he was \u201crecertified\u201d as an Intoxilyzer operator or had his \u201cpermit renewed\u201d in June 1985. The circuit court denied Defendant\u2019s motion to suppress and found him guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Sections 11-111-4 and 11-111-8 of the Rules provide in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-8\">\u00a7 11-111-4 <em>Operator of breath testing instruments. </em>An operator of breath testing instruments shall be responsible for the proper performance of analysis of breath samples, proper record keeping, and proper reporting of results.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-9\">(1) Any person employed by a county police department, may qualify as an operator by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-10\">(A) Having successfully completed training as specified in this section approved by the department; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-11\">(B) On the effective date of this chapter have not less than one (1) year\u2019s experience in the operation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>approved breath testing instrument to be utilized; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-5\">(C) Being able to exhibit through examination and demonstration or both to the department sufficient skill in the operation and interpretation of results of the approved testing instrument to be utilized.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-6\">(2) Training programs for an operator shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-8\">(B) Consist of a total of eight (8) hours of [certain] subjects[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-9\">\u00a711-111-8 <em>Permits.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-10\">* * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-11\">(b) The chief of police of the respective county\u2019s [sic] shall issue the appropriate permits or renewals to persons who qualify under the applicable provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 11 -111 -3 and 11 -111 -4 of this chapter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-12\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-13\">(d) Permits shall automatically terminate two (2) years from the date issued unless terminated or revoked prior to such date. All renewal requests shall be submitted as required in \u00a7 11-111 -8(a) and (b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-14\">Relying on <em>State </em>v. <em>Nakahara, </em>5 Haw. App. 575, 704 P.2d 927 (1985), Defendant contends that since Ching did not receive eight hours of training in 1979, his initial certification as an operator was invalid. In the alternative, Defendant asserts that, if he was validly issued a permit in 1979, it automatically terminated in 1981 under \u00a7 11 -111 -8(d) and the \u201crenewal permit\u201d issued in June 1985 was invalid. Based on our reading of the Rules, we hold that Ching\u2019s June 1985 permit was valid and Ching was qualified to operate the Intoxilyzer on September 10, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-15\">Regarding administrative rules and regulations, they \u201care. subject to the same principles of construction as apply to the construction of statutes.\u201d <em>Life of the Land, Inc. </em>v. <em>The West Beach Development Corp., </em>63 Haw. 529, 531, 631 P.2d 588, 590 (1981). A cardinal rule of statutory construction is that \u201cwhere the language of the law in question is plain and unambiguous, construction by this court is inappropriate and our duty is only to give effect to the law according to its plain and obvious meaning.\u201d <em>Strouss </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>66 Haw. 32, 50, 657 P.2d 1004, 1016 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>(1982) (quoting <em>In re Hawaiian Telephone Co., </em>61 Haw. 572, 577-78, 608 P.2d 383, 387 (1980)). <em>See also Chun </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., </em>5 Haw. App. 290, 687 P.2d 564 (1984).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AV4v\"><em>Arthur K. Trask, Jr. </em>for defendant-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AcZ\"><em>Alfred B. Castillo, Jr., </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney <em>(Peter M. Morimoto, </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, on the Brief), for plaintiffappellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The effective date of the Rules is November 27, 1981. Section 11-111-4(1) plainly and unambiguously provides that a county police department employee may qualify as an operator of breath testing instruments if he meets one of the three requirements specified in subsections (A), (B), and (C). Subsection (B) states that a person must have \u201cnot less than one (1) year\u2019s experience in the operation of the approved breath testing instrument to be utilized\u201d as of the effective date of the Rules. Having operated the Intoxilyzer in 1979, 1980, and 1981, Ching met the subsection (B) qualification. Therefore, the issuance of an operator\u2019s permit to Ching in June 1985 was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">The facts in <em>Nakahara </em>do not parallel those in this case. In <em>Nakahara, </em>the police officer failed to meet the eight-hour training requirement under subsection (A) and the record did not disclose that he was qualified as an Intoxilyzer operator under subsection (B) or (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">Contrary to Defendant\u2019s contentions, under \u00a7 11-111-4(1), whether Ching completed an eight-hour training program<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or whether he had more than a year\u2019s experience after November 27, 1981, is irrelevant since he qualified under subsection (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">We hold that since Ching was a qualified Intoxilyzer operator with a permit on September 10, 1985, the circuit court properly denied Defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the Intoxilyzer test result.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b517-15\">The Intoxilyzer is a breath testing instrument used to determine the blood alcohol concentration of a person by the analysis of his breath sample.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b517-16\">Chapter 111 of Title 11 of the Hawaii Administrative Rules was formerly contained in Chapter 47 of the Public Health Regulations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b518-12\">Hawaii Revised Statutes \u00a7 291-5(a) (1985) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-13\">In any criminal prosecution for a violation of section 291-4, ten-hundredths per cent or more by weight of alcohol in the defendant\u2019s blood within three hours after the time of the alleged violation as shown by chemical analysis or other approved analytical techniques of the defendant\u2019s blood or breath shall be competent evidence that the defendant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor at the time of the alleged violation.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b518-15\">At his arraignment in the district court, Defendant demanded a jury trial. Consequently, the case was committed to the circuit court. However, in the circuit court Defendant waived a jury trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b520-13\">Our disposition of the case does not require our answering the question whether Ching qualified under \u00a7 11-111-4(1)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
