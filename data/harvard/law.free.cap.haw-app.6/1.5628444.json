(Bishop), which dismissed Rana\u2019s complaint seeking payments of no-fault earnings loss benefits based on \u201cstacking\u201d no-fault insurance coverage on the seven automobiles owned by him and insured by Bishop. Rana also appeals from the order denying his motion for allowance of attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-17\">The issues on appeal and our answers are:</p>\n<p id=\"b22-18\">1. Whether the Hawaii no-fault law, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapter 294 (1976, as amended) (No-Fault Law), precludes \u201cstacking\u201d of no-fault basic insurance coverages where the injured named insured has a single insurance policy covering seven vehicles. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-19\">2. Whether upon the filing of a valid notice of appeal on the merits, the trial court lost its jurisdiction to consider the award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-20\">We therefore affirm the summary judgment, but reverse the order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>denying attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">The facts are not in dispute. In 1982, Bishop issued to Rana a \u201cBusiness Auto Policy\u201d insuring seven automobiles owned and utilized by Rana in his taxicab business.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On December 6, 1982, Rana was injured in an automobile collision<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> while operating one of those automobiles. He sought payments of no-fault earnings loss benefits of $2,000 per month, his actual monthly loss, on the theory that the \u201cstacking\u201d of no-fault basic coverage of $800 earnings loss benefits per vehicle under the policy was permitted and that the \u201cstacked\u201d aggregate limit would be seven vehicles times $15,000 or $105,000. Bishop, however, paid him the monthly statutory limit of $800 for his monthly earnings loss and terminated the payments at $15,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">On June 13, 1983, Rana sued Bishop seeking (1) a declaratory judgment that he was \u201centitled to \u2018stack\u2019 the coverages and limits of all seven automobiles under the one policy,\u201d (2) a money judgment for his actual earnings loss, (3) punitive damages, and (4) attorney\u2019s fees, interest, and costs. Thereafter, Rana moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of Bishop\u2019s liability under the policy and Bishop moved for summary judgment. After a joint hearing on the motions, Rana moved for allowance of attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-7\">On July 2, 1984, the circuit court denied Rana\u2019s motion and granted Bishop\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Rana filed a timely notice of appeal on July 31, 1984. On August 12, 1984, the court denied Rana\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees, and Rana filed an amended notice of appeal on August 20, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-9\">In their respective briefs, both Rana and Bishop refer to the follow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>ing provisions of the No-Fault Law, which as of the date of Rana\u2019s accident on December 6, 1982, read in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">\u00a7 294-2 Definitions. As used in this chapter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-8\">(10) \u201cNo-fault benefits\u201d with respect to any accidental harm shall be subject to an aggregate limit of $ 15,000 per person or his survivor and means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-10\">(C) Monthly earnings loss measured by an amount equal to the lesser of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-11\">(i) $800 per month[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-12\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-13\">\u00a7 294-3 Right to no-fault benefits, (a) If the accident causing accidental harm occurs in this State, every person, insured under this chapter, and his survivors, suffering loss from accidental harm arising out of the operation, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle has a right to no-fault benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-14\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-15\">(c) \u201cMaximum limit\u201d. The total no-fault benefits payable per person or on his death to his survivor on account of accidental harm sustained by him in any one motor vehicle accident shall be $15,000, regardless of the number of motor vehicles involved or policies applicable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-16\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-17\">\u00a7 294-5 Payment from which insurer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-18\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-19\">(c) No payment of no-fault benefits may be made to the occupants of a motor vehicle other than the insured motor vehicle or to the operator or user of a motor vehicle engaging in criminal conduct which causes any loss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-20\">(d) The no-fault insurance applicable on a primary basis to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>accidental harm to which this chapter applies is the insurance on the vehicle occupied by the injured person at the time of the accident, or, if the injured person is a\u2019 pedestrian (including a bicyclist), the insurance on the vehicle which caused accidental harm to such pedestrian (including a bicyclist).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-4\">If there is no such insurance on such vehicle, any other no-fault insurance applicable to the injured person shall apply.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-5\">No person shall recover no-fault benefits from more than one insurer for accidental harm as a result of the same accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-6\">\u00a7 294-11 Required optional additional insurance, (a) In addition to the no-fault coverages described in section 294-10 every insurer issuing a no-fault policy shall make available to the insured the following optional insurance under the following conditions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-8\">(3) Additional coverages and benefits with respect to any injury, death, or any other loss from operation of a motor vehicle. An insurer may provide for aggregate limits with respect to such additional coverage so long as the basic liability coverages provided are not less than those required by section 294-10(a)(1) and (2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b25-10\">Rana contends that the above-quoted sections of the No-Fault Law do not prohibit, but permit, the stacking<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of no-fault policies or coverages. Bishop, on the other hand, argues to the contrary. Based on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>plain and unambiguous language in HRS \u00a7\u00a7 294-2(10) and -3(c), buttressed by the statute\u2019s legislative history, we construe the No-Fault Law to preclude stacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">In construing a statute, the court\u2019s \u201cobjective is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature,\u201d <em>Survivors of Medeiros </em>v. <em>Maui Land &amp; Pineapple Co., </em>66 Haw. 290, 297, 660 P.2d 1316, 1321 (1983), obtained primarily from the language of the statute itself. <em>Treloar </em>v. <em>Swinerton &amp; Walberg Co., </em>65 Haw. 415, 653 P.2d 420 (1982). Thus, \u201cwhere the language of the law in question is plain and unambiguous,... our duty is only to give effect to the law according to its plain and obvious meaning.\u201d <em>In re Hawaiian Telephone Co., </em>61 Haw. 572, 577-78, 608 P.2d 383, 387 (1980). <em>See also Puchert </em>v. <em>Agsalud, </em>67 Haw. 25, 677 P.2d 449 (1984). However, where the statutory language \u201cis ambiguous or of doubtful meaning,... judicial construction and interpretation are warranted[.]\u201d <em>In re Hawaiian Telephone Co., </em>61 Haw. at 578, 608 P.2d at 387. <em>See also State v. Ui, </em>66 Haw. 366, 663 P.2d 630 (1983). And courts may resort to legislative history in construing a statute. <em>Life of the Land, Inc. </em>v. <em>City Council of the City &amp; County of Honolulu, </em>61 Haw. 390, 447, 606 P.2d 866, 899 (1980); <em>Educators Ventures, Inc. v. Bundy, </em>3 Haw. App. 435, 652 P.2d 637 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b26-8\">We apply the foregoing guidelines in construing the No-Fault Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-9\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-10\">We find the language in HRS \u00a7\u00a7 294-2(10) and -3(c) to be plain and unambiguous. HRS \u00a7\u00a7 294-2(10) states that no-fault benefits shall be subject to \u201can aggregate limit of $ 15,000 per person or his survivor,\u201d and HRS \u00a7 294-3(c), titled \u201cmaximum limit,\u201d provides that the <em>\u201ctotal </em>no-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>fault benefits <em>payable per person\" </em>in one accident shall be $15,000, \u201cregardless of the <em>number </em>of <em>motor vehicles involved </em>or <em>policies applicable\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) In our view, the language of those sections indicates a clear legislative intent to prohibit stacking of no-fault basic coverages.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">However, the case of <em>Yamaguchi </em>v. <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., </em>706 F.2d 940 (9th Cir. 1983), which construed the No-Fault Law to permit stacking, <em>see </em>Part I-B <em>infra, </em>indicates that the statutory language may be of doubtful meaning. We will therefore resort to legislative history to ascertain the intention of the legislature in construing the No-Fault Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">2.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-6\">In enacting the No-Fault Law in 1973,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the legislature had</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANf\">two primary objectives in mind: (1) insurance reform in order to (a) expedite the settling of all claims, (b) create a system of reparations for injuries and loss arising from motor vehicle accidents, (c) compensate these damages without regard to fault, and (d) modify tort liability for these accidents; and (2) to establish a system of reasonable cost of motor vehicle insurance with a view to reducing such costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">Hse. Joint Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 187, in 1973 House Journal, at 836.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AD\">The legislators were of the belief</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-8\">that a basic, comprehensive, equitable, and reasonably priced auto insurance policy must satisfy each of the following criteria:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-9\">(1) Provide for a speedy, adequate and equitable reparation for those injured or otherwise victimized;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-10\">(2) Provide for the stabilization and reduction of motor vehicle liability insurance premium rates;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-11\">(3) Provide for insurance coverage for all who required it, at a cost within the reach of every licensed driver;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-12\">(4) Provide for a compulsory insurance system;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-13\">(5) Provide for adequate regulatory control.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b27-14\">Hse. Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 13, in 1973 House Journal, at 1219; Sen. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 4, in 1973 Senate Journal, at 635-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">From such legislative objectives and beliefs emerged the No-Fault Law, its statutory scheme being based \u201con the compulsory coverage of all motor vehicles and operators under no-fault insurance policies and the partial abolition of tort liability.\u201d <em>Barcena </em>v. <em>Hawaiian Insurance &amp; Guaranty Co., Ltd., </em>67 Haw. 97, 102, 678 P.2d 1082, 1086 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">To provide for \u201cadequate and equitable reparation for those injured\u201d and compulsory insurance coverage \u201cat a cost within the reach of every licensed driver,\u201d the legislature had to strike a balance between those objectives. It did so by (1) defining the basic no-fault benefits and subjecting them \u201cto an aggregate limit of $15,000 per person or his survivor[,]\u201d HRS \u00a7 294-2( 10); (2) expressly setting the \u201cmaximum limit\u201d regarding no-fault benefits payable in HRS \u00a7 294-3(c);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and (3) requiring the insurer to make available to the insured optional additional insurance over and above the compulsory basic no-fault coverage. HRS \u00a7 294-11(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">The legislative history of the No-Fault Law evinces a legislative concern to reduce and stabilize automobile insurance costs prevailing prior to its enactment and to provide and maintain reasonable premium rates for no-fault basic coverage. We discern therefrom a legislative intent to prohibit stacking which indubitably will lead to higher premiums for no-fault basic coverage. We therefore conclude that HRS \u00a7\u00a7 294-2(10) and -3(c) precludes the stacking of no-fault basic insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>policies and coverages. To permit stacking would be contrary to an objective the legislature sought to achieve.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">Rana asserts that we have already determined that \u201c \u2018[sjtacking\u2019 of no-fault policies is permitted under the No-Fault Act.\u201d <em>In re Claim of Maldonado, </em>5 Haw. App. 185, 192, 683 P.2d 394, 399-400, <em>rev\u2019d, </em>67 Haw. 347, 687 P.2d 1 (1984). We cited <em>Yamaguchi </em>v. <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., supra, </em>and <em>Mizoguchi </em>v. <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., 66 </em>Haw. 373, 663 P.2d 1071 (1983), in support of the foregoing statement made in <em>Maldonado.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">Unfortunately, our use of the term \u201cstacking\u201d in <em>Maldonado </em>was loose and indiscriminate. There, the construction of HRS \u00a7 294-5(b) was involved, and we and the parties involved in the appeal characterized the issue as being whether the \u201cstacking\u201d of no-fault and workers\u2019 compensation insurance policies was permissible. We looked at the results achieved in <em>Yamaguchi </em>and <em>Mizoguchi, </em>which permitted the \u201cstacking\u201d of optional additional no-fault policy or coverage upon a no-fault basic policy or coverage, and improvidently made a general statement that our No-Fault Law permitted \u201cstacking\u201d of no-fault policies in <em>Maldonado. </em>Since stacking of two or more no-fault basic policies or coverages was not involved in <em>Maldonado, </em>that statement is <em>obiter dictum </em>and not binding.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">In <em>Yamaguchi, </em>the decedent was fatally injured while a passenger in a station wagon covered by a no-fault basic insurance policy issued by National Union Fire Insurance Co. (National Union). The decedent himself owned two automobiles covered by two separate no-fault insurance policies issued by State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. (State Farm). Each of the State Farm policies was endorsed to increase the aggregate limit from $15,000 to $50,000. The issue in <em>Yamaguchi </em>was whether the two State Farm policies could be stacked on the National Union $15,000 basic policy. Holding that the limitation in HRS \u00a7 294-5(c) applied to the decedent in his capacity as an \u201coccupant\u201d only, and not as an \u201cowner\u201d or \u201cinsured,\u201d and that HRS \u00a7 294-5(d) banned \u201cbenefit stacking\u201d or double recovery only, the court of appeals con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>eluded that the No-Fault Law did not prevent \u201cpolicy stacking.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 948-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">\u201c[T]he [state] courts are the final arbiters of the State\u2019s own law[.]\u201d <em>Wardius </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>412 U.S. 470, 477, 93 S. Ct. 2208, 2213, 37 L.Ed.2d 82, 89 (1972). Thus, \u201cwe are not' bound by the federal . . . court\u2019s interpretation of our statutes.\u201d <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Midway Lumber, Inc., </em>114 Ariz. 426, 430, 561 P.2d 750, 754 (1977). <em>See also Kelsay v. Motorola, Inc., </em>74 Ill.2d 172, 384 N.E.2d 353 (1978). We disagree with the <em>Yamaguchi </em>court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">We view HRS \u00a7 294-5(a), (c), and (d) to be subsections dealing with the question of which no-fault insurance applies in case of accidental harm arising in a motor vehicle accident. <em>See </em>8D J.A. Appleman, <em>Insurance Law and Practice </em>\u00a7 5191 (1981) (hereinafter \u201cAppleman\u201d). Subsection (d)\u2019s coverage follows the car rather than the contract. <em>See </em>1 I.E. Schermer, <em>Automobile Liability Insurance </em>\u00a7 13.01 (2 ed. 1985). HRS \u00a7 294-5(d) was added to the No-Fault Law in 1974, Act 168, \u00a7 1, 1974 Haw. Sess. Laws 317, 321, to provide that primary no-fault coverage is \u201cthe policy covering the auto in which the claimant was riding. Specifically: the insurance follows the vehicle insured primarily, and the person only secondarily.\u201d Hse. Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 28, in 1974 House Journal, at 868; Sen. Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 28-74, in 1974 Senate Journal, at 781. As indicated above, we consider HRS \u00a7\u00a7 294-2(10) and -3(c) as the pertinent provisions precluding stacking of no-fault basic policies and coverages.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">Rana\u2019s reliance on <em>Mizoguchi </em>is misplaced. In <em>Mizoguchi, </em>the decedent\u2019s car was covered by a State Farm no-fault policy which included an additional coverage endorsement raising the aggregate limit of no-fault benefits from $ 15,000 to $50,000. Contrary to State Farm\u2019s conten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>tion, the supreme court held that in case of death, work loss benefits are payable and eligible beneficiaries are entitled to no-fault benefits \u201cup to the increased aggregate limit of any <em>additional coverage.\" Id. </em>at 378, 663 P.2d at 1075 (emphasis added). <em>Mizoguchi </em>involved one vehicle and one policy with optional additional coverage permitted by HRS \u00a7 294-11(a)(3). Nonetheless, Rana argues that he had \u201cpurchased additional coverage\u201d like in <em>Mizoguchi. </em>However, Rana\u2019s purchase of \u201cadditional coverage\u201d was for compulsory no-fault basic coverage for each of his other six vehicles as required by HRS \u00a7 294-8(a)(1)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> rather than optional additional coverages under HRS \u00a7 294-11(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">This is a case of first impression before a Hawaii appellate court. Not being bound by <em>Yamaguchi, </em>we construe the No-Fault Law as prohibiting the stacking of no-fault basic insurance policies and coverages.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">Citing the Hawaii cases which permit the stacking of uninsured motorist insurance policies and coverages, <em>e.g. Allstate Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>59 Haw. 44, 575 P.2d 477 (1978); <em>Walton </em>v. <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., </em>55 Haw. 326, 518 P.2d 1399 (1974); <em>Yamamoto </em>v. <em>Premier Insurance Co., 4 </em>Haw. App. 429, 668 P.2d 42 (1983), Rana argues that there is no \u201creasonable basis\u201d for distinguishing between the stacking of uninsured motorist coverages and of no-fault coverages. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">As the federal district court did in <em>Kirsch </em>v. <em>Nationwide Insurance Co., </em>532 F. Supp. 766 (W.D. Pa. 1982), we find that the analogy of the No-Fault Law to the uninsured motorist statute<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> is faulty. In <em>Kirsch, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>court in construing Pennsylvania\u2019s no-fault act considered the same argument presented to us by Rana. Its response was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-6\">This argument fails, however, because the analogy to the Uninsured Motorist Act is faulty. The Uninsured Motorist Act was enacted specifically to provide coverage to innocent victims of negligent acts of uninsured third parties. The Act was not intended to limit causes of action against tortfeasors, but to assure recovery where tortfeasors are financially unable to pay any judgment awarded. The Act does not place any statutory maximum on the amount of coverage any individual insured can obtain, only the minimum amount of coverage each insurance policy must provide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-7\">The No-Fault Act, on the other hand, has an entirely different purpose. The No-Fault Act provides for a specific amount of possible recovery to be awarded to victims of motor vehicle accidents, <em>regardless of fault. </em>This arrangement allows for prompt compensation to victims. However, once the statutory ceilings are exceeded, the negligent party is still liable for any further damages caused by his actions. The cause of action against the faulty driver is not limited at this point. Furthermore, the very fact that, unlike the Uninsured Motorist Act, the No-Fault Act does contain statutory ceilings in the amount of recovery indicates an intent to limit the amount of no-fault recovery under the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 768 (emphasis in original). A Pennsylvania court adopted the above quoted reasoning in <em>Antanovich </em>v. <em>Allstate Insurance Co., </em>320 Pa. Super. 322, 467 A.2d 345 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">We find the quotation from <em>Kirsch </em>applicable to Hawaii\u2019s No-Fault Law and uninsured motorist statute and therefore adopt it.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-10\">Furthermore, under our uninsured motorist statute although the automobile liability insurance policy must include uninsured motorist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>coverage, the insured may \u201creject the coverage in writing.\u201d HRS \u00a7 431-448. However, as indicated <em>supra, </em>no-fault basic coverage is compulsory for each motor vehicle. \u201cBecause no-fault insurance is compulsory insurance, and it is important that the premiums be kept as low as possible while allowing adequate coverage, there is a public policy argument against stacking.\u201d 8D Appleman \u00a7 5192 at 613 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Finally, citing <em>Helmly </em>v. <em>Gulf Insurance Co., </em>159 Ga. App. 339, 283 S.E.2d 370 (1981); <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Iowa Mutual Insurance Co., </em>315 N.W.2d 601 (Minn. 1982); <em>Holman </em>v. <em>All Nation Insurance Co., </em>288 N.W.2d 244 (Minn. 1980); and <em>Travelers Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>93 Nev. 463, 567 P.2d 471 (1977), Rana urges us to follow the pro-stacking cases of other jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">We note that there is no majority rule regarding stacking of no-fault insurance policies and coverages. Comment, <em>Insurance </em>\u2014 Statutes\u2014 <em>Stacking of Uninsured Motorist and No-Fault Coverages as Determined by Legislative Intent, 59 </em>N.D.L. Rev. 251, 252 (1983). <em>See also, </em>Annot., 29 A.L.R.4th 12 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">For the reasons stated above we follow the anti-stacking cases such as <em>Kirsch </em>v. <em>Nationwide Insurance Co., supra; Antanovich </em>v. <em>Allstate Insurance Co., supra; and St. Paul Mercury Insurance Co. v. Andrews, </em>321 N.W.2d 483 (N.D. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">We conclude that the No-Fault Law precludes stacking of no-fault basic insurance coverages and, accordingly, affirm the summary judgment in favor of Bishop.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-10\">The record discloses that at the time the trial court entered its order denying Rana\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs, an appeal on the merits \u2014 the summary judgment in favor of Bishop \u2014 was already pending. We have held that \u201conce the notice of appeal has been filed, the court below lost jurisdiction of the case[.]\u201d <em>Louis </em>v. <em>Corey, 2 </em>Haw. App. 556, 559, 634 P.2d 1055, 1058 (1981). <em>See also Wiginton v. Pacific Credit Corp., 2 </em>Haw. App. 435, 634 P.2d 111 (1981); <em>D\u2019Elia v. Association of Apartment Owners of Fairway Manor, 2 </em>Haw. App. 350, 632 P.2d 298 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>(1981). Of course, the notice must be valid and, in this case, it is. We therefore reverse the \u201cOrder Denying Plaintiffs Motion for Allowance of Attorney\u2019s Fees and Costs\u201d filed on August 13, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Since the case must be remanded regarding the question of attorney\u2019s fees and costs, we believe it appropriate to provide some guidance to the trial court in the further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">Rana requested attorney\u2019s fees under the provisions of HRS \u00a7 294-30(a).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This court has construed that section as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-8\">Read in conjunction with HRS \u00a7 294-4(3), which provides, <em>inter alia, </em>for the mandatory payment of a claimant\u2019s attorney\u2019s fee where a claim is denied and suit is successfully brought to enforce it, it seems clear to us that under HRS \u00a7 294-30, the trial court judge has the discretion to award attorney\u2019s fees and costs to a losing claimant who files for no-fault insurance benefits unless it is determined by the trial court judge that the claim filed is fraudulent, frivolous or excessive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYW\"><em>Kawaihae </em>v. <em>Hawaiian Insurance Companies, </em>1 Haw. App. 355, 358-59, 619 P.2d 1086, 1090 (1980) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">The trial court\u2019s order denying the allowance of attorney\u2019s fees and costs does not state the reasons therefor. Based on the argument made by Bishop and the trial court\u2019s comments at the hearing on the motion, however, we believe that the trial court denied the motion because Rana\u2019s claim for no-fault benefits was \u201cexcessive\u201d under HRS \u00a7 294-30(a). The trial court\u2019s reasoning seems to have been: (1) Bishop had paid Rana the maximum no-fault benefits of $15,000 as defined in HRS \u00a7 294-2(10) and as provided for in the policy; (2) Rana\u2019s claim for additional benefits was based on the stacking of no-fault basic coverages; (3) the trial court ruled against Rana; and (4) therefore Rana\u2019s claim was \u201cexcessive.\u201d If our appraisal of the record is correct, the trial court erred in finding Rana\u2019s claim to be \u201cexcessive\u201d under HRS \u00a7 294-30(a).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b35-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number><em>Mark N.

We do not believe the legislature intended this result. We believe that a claim for medical and hospital expenses which cannot be substantiated by statements and receipts or a claim for earnings loss unsupported by evidence, for example, may be an \u201cexcessive\u201d claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Affirmed in part and reversed in part and remanded for further proceedings in accordance herewith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b23-10\">The record discloses that for the Business Auto Policy the total premium was $3,297, of which $548 was for \u201cPersonal Injury Protection (P.l.P.)

The record does not reveal what the no-fault premium was for each of the other four cars.

Notwithstanding the fact that we are the final arbiters of our own laws and are not bound by the federal court\u2019s interpretation of our statutes, I agree with and would apply the reasoning of the ninth circuit court of appeals in <em>Yamaguchi </em>v. <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., </em>706 F.2d 940 (9th Cir. 1983), and allow \u201cstacking\u201d. I find the terms of our no-fault statute to be highly ambiguous and as susceptible to the ninth circuit\u2019s interpretation as to the majority\u2019s here.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-11\">Moreover, I agree with Rana that the reasoning of those cases allowing stacking in uninsured motorist cases is equally applicable to no-fault cases and invalidates the clauses in his no-fault policy limiting Bishop\u2019s liability. The thrust of those decisions is that provisions in uninsured motorists policies which, \u201cif effectuated, would reduce the benefits directly payable by the injured-insured\u2019s insurer to a sum below the statutory minimum\u201d are invalid. <em>Walton </em>v. <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., </em>55 Haw. 326, 329, 518 P.2d 1399, 1401 (1974). <em>See also Allstate Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>59 Haw. 44, 575 P.2d 477 (1978); <em>American Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Takahashi, </em>59 Haw. 59, 575 P.2d 881 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-12\">In the instant case, Rana paid a sizeable separate premium to obtain no-fault coverage for each of his automobiles, which he was required by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>law to maintain. Bishop accepted his premiums and stood ready to provide no-fault coverage for each and every vehicle covered by the policy. Bishop\u2019s position, now, supported by the majority of this court erases entirely the statutorily-required coverage for each of Rana\u2019s non-occupied automobiles. Bishop has received the windfall ruled against in <em>Walton, supra.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-6\">Secondly and most importantly, it has been held to be unconscionable to permit an insurer to collect a premium for coverage of a type that the insurer is obligated by statute to provide and then to permit the insurer to use language insurer itself devised to avoid liability. <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., </em>318 F. Supp. 1152, 1156 (S.D. Ind. 1970); <em>Blakeslee </em>v. <em>Farm Bureau Mutual Ins. Co., </em>388 Mich. 464, 474, 201 N.W.2d 786, 791 (1972).
