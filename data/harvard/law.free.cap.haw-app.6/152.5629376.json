Pursuant to a motion by Queen\u2019s, additional findings of fact were filed on July 5, 1984. Queen\u2019s appealed on July 9, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-25\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b175-23\">Rule 29 of the Rules of Tax Appeal Court (RTAC) (1981) provides that the Rules of the Circuit Court and the Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) shall govern procedural matters not specifically provided for in RTAC. Except in regard to conclusion of law no. 8, discussed below, we need not consider the clearly erroneous rule relating to findings of fact under Rule 52(a), HRCP (1981), because none of TAC\u2019s findings of fact has been assigned as error and Queen\u2019s is bound by them. <em>Wisdom </em>v. <em>Pflueger, 4 </em>Haw. App. 455, 459, 667 P.2d 844, 848 (1983). However, the trial court\u2019s conclusions of law are freely reviewable by the appellate court. <em>Molokoa Village Development Co. </em>v. <em>Kauai Electric Co., </em>60 Haw. 582, 595-96, 593 P.2d 375, 384 (1979); <em>Nani Koolau Co. v. K &amp; M Construction, Inc., </em>5 Haw. App. 137, 141, 681 P.2d 580, 585 (1984). Aconclusion oflawwhich is supported by the trial court\u2019s findings of fact and which reflects an application of the correct rule of law will not be overturned. <em>Friedrich </em>v. <em>Department of Transpor</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number><em>tation, 60 </em>Haw. 32, 37, 586 P.2d 1037, 1041 (1978); <em>Nani Koolau Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">APPLICABILITY OF THE EXEMPTION</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">The only question raised by Queen\u2019s is whether the exemption provided by \u00a7 8-10.10 is applicable to the entire POB and parking structure. We hold it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">Queen\u2019s assigns the following conclusions of law as error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-9\">3. In tax law, the initial premise of the court is that taxation of the property is the rule. As an exemption is an exception to the rule, exemptions are strictly construed and any doubts as to the existence of the exemption are resolved against the grant of the exemption. <em>In re Perry Tax Appeal, </em>36 Haw. 340 (1943).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-11\">7. The use of the property for a physicians\u2019 office building by physicians who draw patients from the community at large and who are engaged in a profit-making practice does not constitute a hospital purpose within the meaning of Section 8-10.10, ROH.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-12\">8. The parking structure is subject to commingled uses servicing both the exempt hospital and the nonexempt Physicians Office Building. Under Section 8-10.10, ROH, exemption is permitted for portions of buildings which are exclusively used for exempt purposes. Queen\u2019s, however, has failed to show to the satisfaction of the Court what portion, if any can be accurately determined, of the structure is exclusively used by hospital patients, doctors and visitors.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-13\">9. Under Section 8-10.10, ROH, exemption of the property requires not only that Queen\u2019s use the property for nonprofit purposes as defined therein, but in addition that the property not be used for a commercial purpose. [Footnote added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-14\">As will be shown in the discussion hereafter, the conclusions of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>follow logically from the findings of fact and correctly apply the pertinent rules of law. <em>Nani Koolau, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">The thrust of Queen\u2019s argument is that the entire parking structure and POB are exempt from taxation because they serve the purposes of the hospital, Queen\u2019s derives no profit from the activities in those buildings, and the buildings are reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of hospital purposes. The argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The basic question, here, is one of statutory construction: whether the buildings in question are \u201cactually and exclusively\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> used for hospital purposes and, thus, a nonprofit purpose within the meaning of \u00a7 8-10.10 ROH. Afundamental rule of statutory construction is that the statute\u2019s language must be read in the context of the entire statute and construed in a manner consistent with its purpose. <em>State </em>v. <em>Saufua, </em>67 Haw. __, 699 P.2d 988 (1985). A statute must be construed so that, if it can be prevented, no clause, sentence, or word would be superfluous, void, or insignificant. <em>Armbruster v. Nip, </em>5 Haw. App. 37, 40, 677 P.2d 477, 480 (1984). If possible, legislative intent should be obtained primarily from the language of the statute. <em>Id. </em>Courts apply the same rules of construction to municipal ordinances as they do to statutes. <em>Waikiki Resort Hotel, Inc. </em>v. <em>City and County of Honolulu, </em>63 Haw. 222, 239, 624 P.2d 1353, 1365 (1981); <em>Foster Village Community Association </em>v. <em>Hess, 4 </em>Haw. App. 463, 469, 667 P.2d 850, 854 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">The clear purpose of the ordinance is to exempt from real property taxation hospital property actually <em>and exclusively </em>used for hospital purposes. The problem in this case is the nature of the use of the buildings by the tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">Queen\u2019s argues that, under the ruling of <em>In re Fasi, </em>63 Haw. 624, 634 P.2d 98 (1981), the tax on real property is assessed to the owner, <em>id. </em>at 631, 634 P.2d at 104, and, therefore, it is the owners\u2019 use that determines the eligibility of the property for exemption. We find <em>Fasi </em>to be inapplicable, since in that case the City was trying to impose the property tax on a non-owner. That is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>Queen\u2019s further asserts that, since it derives no profit from the activities in either building, their use is \u201cfor nonprofit purposes\u201d and, therefore, the exemption applies. Even granting that argument, however, the clear language of the ordinance requires that not only must the property be actually used for hospital purposes, it must be exclusively so used. Only when those two adjectives conjoin in describing the use is the exemption applicable. Where those requirements are met in regards to the entire property, the exemption will apply to the entire property. Where, however, the entire property is not so used, the ordinance provides that the exemption may be apportioned between those portions of the property that are actually and exclusively used for hospital purposes and those that are not. Section 8-10.10(d) ROH. In this case, the buildings may, <em>arguendo, </em>be actually used for hospital purposes, since the presence of physicians in the close proximity of the hospital is beneficial to the hospital and its patients, nonetheless, the buildings are not exclusively used for that purpose. The physicians are providing a service to their patients, not all of whom are the hospital\u2019s patients. Additionally, the parking structure is serving not only the hospital\u2019s parking needs, but those of the physicians and their patients. Again, not all of those patients are the hospital\u2019s patients. On the record before it, the TAC was unable to determine what portion of the building would be exempt from taxation under \u00a7 8-10.10(d) ROH.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Citing several cases, Queen\u2019s argues that a \u201cstrict but reasonable\u201d construction of the ordinance supports its contention that the buildings in question are reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of hospital purposes and, therefore, are exempt from the tax. However, the argument addresses only one facet of the question. The question is not whether the buildings are reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of the hospital\u2019s purposes. Indeed, the point may be conceded. Nonetheless, the requirement of exclusivity under the ordinance is simply not met where the property is partly used for \u201ccommercial or other purposes.\u201d The construction argued for by Queen\u2019s is insupportable in view of the clear language of the ordinance. <em>In re Queen\u2019s Medical Center, </em>66 Haw. 318, 324, 661 P.2d 1201, 1205 (1983). If \u00a7 8-10.10 were to be read as Queen\u2019s urges, the requirement that the property be \u201cexclusively\u201d used for hospital purposes would be superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">In <em>In re Queen\u2019s Medical Center, supra, </em>the supreme court held that the income received from these same buildings was not exempt from the General Excise Tax Law, HRS chapter 237, under HRS \u00a7 237-23 (Supp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>1984).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The supreme court ruled that it was the nature of the activity, viewed in the light of the statutory language, that was dispositive of the issue of exemption, <em>In re Queen\u2019s Medical Center, </em>66 Haw. at 323, 661 P.2d at 1204, and that the statute itself is the starting point in its construction. <em>Id. </em>at 324, 661 P.2d at 1205. The conclusion of the supreme court was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-5\">While we do not doubt the construction and operation of an office building and parking garage can be related to \u201cbetter, more efficient, and cost effective medical care,\u201d we do not think the activities constitute hospital activities in themselves. We therefore conclude the gross income in question is subject to taxation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 326, 661 P.2d at 1205.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Queen\u2019s argument that <em>In re Queen\u2019s Medical Center </em>should not be considered precedent in the case at bar because the language of the general excise tax exemption is different from that of the real property tax exemption is without merit. As the supreme court pointed out, it is the nature of the activities conducted on the premises and not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>motivation behind them that determines whether the exemption applies. Viewing the nature of the activities within the POB and parking structure in the light of the language of \u00a7 8-10.10 ROH, it is clear that the buildings are not exclusively used for hospital purposes and consequently cannot be totally exempt from the real property tax.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AH\"><em>Ronald </em>/. <em>Heller (.Arthur B.
