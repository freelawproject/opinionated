The dispositive issue on appeal is whether HRS \u00a7 712-1205 permits the testimony of one of defendant\u2019s prostitutes to be corroborated by the testimony of another of defendant\u2019s prostitutes. We answer no and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">On January 25, 1984, a five-count indictment was returned against Defendant. Each count charged that he \u201cdid knowingly advance or profit from prostitution\u201d of a named male who was less than 18 years of age. The named males were Sherman (count I), Bernard (count II), Loren (count III), Robert (count IV), and James (count V).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">At the jury waived trial, the State presented the testimony of the five named males. The States rested without presenting any other evidence. The trial court granted Defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal as to counts I, II, and III. Defendant testified on his own behalf and called his friend Charles Mailo (Mailo) as a witness. The trial court found Defendant guilty of counts IV and V.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>In denying Defendant\u2019s post-trial motion for judgment of acquittal, the trial court concluded, <em>inter alia, </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-5\">2. Under Section 712-1205, <em>H.R.S., </em>corroborative evidence for Counts IV and V was presented by the State through the trial testimonies of Loren . . ., Bernard . . . and Sherman ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-6\">3. Under Section 712-1205, <em>H.R.S., </em>the trial testimonies of Robert . . . and James . . ., the juvenile male prostitutes named in Counts IV and V, corroborated the testimony of each other. Defendant was sentenced to a concurrent prison term of ten years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">His timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">During oral argument, the State\u2019s counsel admitted that the testimony of Defendant and Mailo did not corroborate the testimony of the five named males. Thus, the sole issue involves the statutory construction of HRS \u00a7 712-1205 \u2014 can the testimony of Robert and James be legally corroborated by the respective testimony of Sherman, Bernard, and Loren and can the testimony of Robert and James be legally corroborated by the respective testimony of each other?</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>62 Haw. 112, 612 P.2d 110 (1980), the indictment charged the defendant with promoting the prostitution of two or more unnamed women in count I, of a minor Susan Kuwada in count II, and of a minor Marie Dunbar in count III. Susan Kuwada, Rebecca French, and Laura Decker, who had lived at the defendant\u2019s residence and worked for him as prostitutes, testified at trial. The State argues in this case that <em>Alexander </em>did not determine whether the testimony of one of the defendant\u2019s prostitutes may be corroborated by that of another of his prostitutes under HRS \u00a7 712-1205. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">In <em>Alexander, </em>although it did not expressly discuss the construction of HRS \u00a7 712-1205, the supreme court unequivocally stated, \u201cThe statute, in essence, proscribes the conviction of an alleged panderer solely on the uncorroborated testimony of <em>his prostitutes.\" Id. </em>at 115, 612 P.2d at 112 (emphasis added). The court thus posed the issue to be \u201cwhether their [the prostitutes\u2019] testimony was corroborated as required by HRS \u00a7 712-1205[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 114, 612 P.2d at 112. It then held that the prostitutes\u2019 testimony was corroborated by testimony of Mary Pesta\u00f1a and Detective Barker, documentary evidence consisting of hotel receipts and two \u201ctrick books,\u201d and discernible fingerprints on one of the trick <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>books identified as those of two prostitutes.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A-v\"><em>Philip D. Bogetto </em>for defendant-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ADs\"><em>Willard J. Peterson (Arthur E. Ross </em>on the brief), Deputy Prosecuting Attorneys, for plaintiff-appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">In our view, the supreme court in <em>Alexander </em>implicitly construed HRS \u00a7 712-1205 to preclude one prostitute from corroborating the testimony of another prostitute. Such construction follows from the statement in the commentary on \u00a7 712-1205 that \u201c[r]elying solely on such [uncorroborated] testimony [of a prostitute] presents grave risks.\u201d An appellate court has stated that \u201c[t]he rationale for the corroboration requirement is to protect against false complaints and complaints motivated by revenge and bias.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Montgomery, </em>26 Or. App. 817, 818, 554 P.2d 578, 579 (1976). If a prostitute\u2019s testimony presents grave risks, how can it logically corroborate another prostitute\u2019s testimony?</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Since the testimony of Sherman, Bernard, and Loren was not legally corroborative of the testimony of Robert and James and Robert and James could not corroborate each other\u2019s testimony, the trial court erred in convicting Defendant on counts IV and V.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b122-10\">Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 712-1203(1)(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-11\">Promoting prostitution in the second degree. (1) A person commits the offense of promoting prostitution in the second degree if he knowingly:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-12\">(b) Advances or profits from prostitution of a person less than eighteen years of age.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b122-13\">HRS \u00a7 712-1205 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-14\">Promoting prostitution: corroboration. A person shall not be convicted of promoting prostitution, in any degree, or of attempt to commit any such offense, solely upon the uncorroborated testimony of a person whose prostitution activity he is alleged to have advanced or attempted to advance, or from whose prostitution activity he is alleged to have profited or attempted to profit.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b124-11\">Since Defendant\u2019s conviction is being set aside, discussion of the other issues raised on appeal is unnecessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
