Kamaura (Kamaura) and Amy I. O\u2019Sullivan (O\u2019Sullivan) (collectively Claimants). Since the Kamaura case (No. 10094) and the O\u2019Sullivan case (No. 10095) involve similar facts and common questions of law, they were consolidated for argument and disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">The dispositive questions on appeal are:</p>\n<p id=\"b216-12\">1. Whether <em>Hawaii State Teachers Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Department of Labor and Industrial Relations, </em>56 Haw. 590, 546 P.2d 1 (1976) (hereinafter <em>HSTA), </em>retains its vitality and is applicable to the cases at bar; and</p>\n<p id=\"b216-13\">2. Whether the long term disability insurance benefits received by Claimants constitute \u201csickness pay or similar remuneration\u201d within the meaning of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 383-1(19) (1976).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-14\">We answer yes to both questions and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-15\">Claimants were flight attendants with Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. (Hawaiian Air). Both became pregnant and stopped working as flight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>attendants based on the advice of their respective physicians.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Each used up her accumulated sick leave and vacation benefits, then filed a claim for unemployment benefits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, each Claimant began receiving payments under the Long Term Disability Insurance (LTDI) program maintained pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement between Hawaiian Air and the Association of Flight Attendants, Claimants\u2019 labor union.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">As to each Claimant, the DLlR\u2019s Unemployment Insurance Division (UID) determined that Claimant was \u201cnot unemployed and ineligible for benefits.\u201d On administrative appeals, the DLlR\u2019s referees affirmed the UID\u2019s decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Each Claimant then appealed to the circuit court which determined that Claimants were entitled to unemployment benefits and reversed the referees\u2019 decisions. DLIR now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">Since this is an appeal from the circuit court\u2019s review of an agency decision, we</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-9\">apply the same review standards applied by the circuit court. Agency fact findings are reviewable for clear error. In contrast, an agency\u2019s legal conclusions are freely reviewable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-10\"><em>International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers </em>v. <em>Hawaiian Tele</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number><em>phone Co., </em>68 Haw. __, __, 713 P.2d 943, __ (1986). <em>See also Outdoor Circle </em>v. <em>Harold K.L. Castle Trust Estate, </em>4 Haw. App. 633, 675 P.2d 784 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Here, the referees\u2019 legal conclusions that the LTDI benefits received by Claimants are remunerations in the form of \u201csickness pay or similar remuneration\u201d under HRS \u00a7 383-1(19) are the matters in contention. Those conclusions, reversed by the circuit court, are freely reviewable by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">To qualify for unemployment benefits an individual must be <em>unemployed. </em>HRS \u00a7 383-23 (1976). In defining \u201cunemployment,\u201d HRS \u00a7 383-1(16) (1976)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> provides in part that an individual is unemployed in any week \u201cduring which he performs no services and with respect to which no wages are payable to him[.]\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-10\">In construing HRS \u00a7 383-1(16), the supreme court has stated: [W]e find it necessary to read HRS \u00a7 383-1(16) and (19)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as in pari materia. We conclude that a period of unemployment, as defined in HRS \u00a7 383-1(16), cannot include a \u201cweek of employment\u201d, as defined in HRS \u00a7 383-1(19).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-11\"><em>HSTA, </em>56 Haw. at 593, 546 P.2d at 4 (footnote added). Thus, under <em>HSTA, </em>even if an individual performs no services in employment during a particular week, if he receives HRS \u00a7 383-1(19) remuneration with respect to that week \u201cin the form of vacation, holiday or sickness pay or similar remuneration,\u201d he is not unemployed and is ineligible for unemployment benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>Claimants contend, however, <em>HSTA </em>\u201cis of questionable validity\u201d in the light of <em>Agsalud </em>v. <em>Lee, 66 </em>Haw. 425, 664 P.2d 734 (1983). Because <em>Lee </em>neither cited <em>HSTA </em>nor referred to HRS \u00a7 383-1(19), Claimants argue that HRS \u00a7 383-1(16) only requires a showing that they (I) performed no services and (2) were paid no \u201cwages.\u201d They claim that they clearly performed no services and that LTDI benefits are excluded as \u201cwages\u201d under HRS \u00a7 383-11(1) (1976).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The issue in <em>Lee </em>was different from that in <em>HSTA. Lee </em>was decided under the \u201calternative test for \u2018unemployment\u2019 in \u00a7 383-1 (16)[,]\u201d namely, \u201c[wjhere an individual performs less than full-time work during a week and the wages payable to him with respect thereto are less than the weekly unemployment benefit payable to a person with his work history and earnings record[.]\u201d <em>Lee, 66 </em>Haw. at 429, 664 P.2d at 737.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Moreover, in the recent case of <em>Agsalud </em>v. <em>Blalack, </em>67 Haw. 588, 699 P.2d 17 (1985), the supreme court cited <em>HSTA </em>and held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-7\">For an individual to be unemployed in any week, two conditions must be met: 1) claimant must perform no services in that week; and 2) that no wages or other remuneration similar to vacation, sickness or holiday pay, are payable with respect to that week.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-8\"><em>Blalack, </em>67 Haw. at __, 699 P.2d at 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\"><em>HSTA </em>remains viable and its test is applicable to the cases at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">Contrary to the referees\u2019 determinations, the circuit court concluded that the LTDI benefits \u201cdo not constitute \u2018sickness pay or similar remuneration\u2019 under HRS \u00a7 383-1(19).\u201d DLIR asserts that the circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>court\u2019s conclusion is wrong. We agree with DLIR.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">In the instant cases, DLIR\u2019s Disability Compensation Division approved the \u201csick leave or wage replacement provision\u201d of Hawaiian Air\u2019s collective bargaining agreement with the Association of Flight Attendants as satisfying the requirements of the Hawaii Temporary Disability Insurance (TDI) Law, HRS Chapter 392.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The TDI statute clearly evinces a legislative intent that there should be no duplication of TDI and unemployment benefits.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We conclude from the record that Hawaiian Air\u2019s LTDI program is a sick leave or wage replacement provision within the meaning of the equivalency approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">The TDI Law was enacted to provide employees in private employment \u201creasonable compensation for wage loss caused by disabling nonoccupational sickness or accident where the disability is temporary in nature and exceeds the period of one work-week.\u201d H RS [\u00a7 392-2] (1976). Disability includes the inability to perform employment duties caused by pregnancy. HRS \u00a7 392-3(5) (1976). In our view, a TDI benefit payment constitutes \u201csickness pay or similar remuneration\u201d within the meaning of HRS \u00a7 383-1(19) because both sickness pay and TDI benefits become payable upon an employee\u2019s physical inability to perform his employment services.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">Moreover, unlike <em>Blalack, supra, </em>where severance pay was involved, in the instant cases neither Claimant\u2019s employment with Hawaiian Air was terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">Accordingly, we hold that the LTDI benefits paid to Claimants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>constituted \u201csickness pay or similar remuneration\u201d and that the circuit court erred in reversing the referees\u2019 decisions.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AD8\"><em>Wilfredo Tungol (Wendy K.
