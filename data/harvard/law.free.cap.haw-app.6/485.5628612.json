Hubbell (George) (hereinafter collectively referred to as Plaintiffs) appeal the judgment entered against them upon a special jury verdict, and the trial court\u2019s denial of their motion for a new trial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">On January 29, 1983, Victoria and her son-in-law were travelling by car to a family reunion at the home of Whitney Iseke in Hauula, Oahu. Because neither Victoria nor her son-in-law knew where Whitney Iseke lived, they went first to Defendant-Appellee, Jason Iseke\u2019s (Jason) house for directions. Jason also lived in Hauula on nine (9) acres of land, and raised some livestock on his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-11\">In order to get to Jason\u2019s house, Victoria and her son-in-law had to proceed about 350 feet up a driveway. Although Victoria and her son-in-law apparently did not, while approaching the house, see any signs warning of dogs on the premises,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the evidence is unrebutted that along the driveway were posted three such warning signs. Two of those signs read \u201cPrivate Property No Trespassing Beware of Dogs;\u201d and the other read \u201cBeware of Dogs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-12\">When Victoria and her son-in-law neared the house, she alit from the car and was attacked and bitten by three \u201cwatchdogs\u201d that Jason kept to protect his property and livestock.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-13\">On November 1, 1983, Plaintiffs filed suit against Jason and his wife, Kanani (hereinafter Jason and Kanani will be collectively called Defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>dants), alleging negligence and seeking damages for Victoria\u2019s personal injuries and severe mental and emotional distress, and George\u2019s loss of consortium. Jury trial was held from September 23 to September 26, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The trial judge, over the objections of both parties, submitted a special verdict form to the jurors, which read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\"><em>Question No. 1. </em>Were the Defendants Jason Iseke and Kanani Iseke negligent? Answer \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d in the space provided below.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-7\">Yes:_ No:_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-8\">If you have answered Question No. 1 \u201cYes,\u201d then go on to answer Question No. 2.

On October 9, 1985, judgment on the verdict was entered in favor of Defendants. On October 21, 1985, Plaintiffs moved for a new trial, and on November 14, 1985, the motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-18\">On December 13, 1985, Plaintiffs filed their notice of appeal from the judgment and the denial of their new trial motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-19\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-20\">This dispositive issue is the interpretation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 663-9 (Supp. 1984), which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-21\">\u00a7 663-9 Liability of animal owners, (a) The owner or harborer of an animal, if the animal proximately causes either personal or property damage to any person, shall be liable in damages to the person injured regardless of the animal owner\u2019s or harborer\u2019s lack of scienter of the vicious or dangerous propensities of the animal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-22\">(b) The owner or harborer of an animal which is known by its species or nature to be dangerous, wild, or vicious, if the animal proximately causes either personal or property damage to any person, shall be absolutely liable for such damage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Arguing that in the enactment of the above statutes \u201cthe common law cause of action for negligence was repealed by the legislature,\u201d Plaintiffs contend that HRS \u00a7 663-9 imposes strict liability on dog owners for the injuries proximately caused by their dogs. Therefore, they assert the trial court\u2019s verdict form was erroneous, because it based Defendants\u2019 liability on a finding of negligence. Plaintiffs\u2019 points of error are predicated on their construction of the statutes. Their construction is erroneous and the appeal is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">In construing a statute, the court\u2019s objective \u201cis to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature . . . [which] is to be obtained primarily from the language contained in the statute itself.\u201d <em>In re Hawaiian Telephone Co., </em>61 Haw. 572, 577, 608 P.2d 383, 387 (1980) (citations omitted). \u201cThus, \u2018where the language of the law in question is plain and unambiguous, . . . our duty is only to give effect to the law according to its plain and obvious meaning.\u2019 However, where the statutory language \u2018is ambiguous or of doubtful meaning, . . . judicial construction and interpretation are warranted.\u2019 And courts may resort to legislative history in construing a statute.\u201d <em>Rana </em>v. <em>Bishop Insurance of Hawaii, Inc., </em>6 Haw. App. 1, __, 713 P.2d 1363, 1367 (1985), <em>affirmed, </em>68 Haw. __, 713 P.2d 1363 (1985) (citations omitted). And even where the statutory language may appear clear upon superficial examination, there is no rule of law which forbids the use of available aids to the construction of that language. <em>Black Construction Corp. </em>v. <em>Agsalud, </em>64 Haw. 274, 639 P.2d 1088 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">H RS \u00a7 663-9(a) merely eliminates the necessity to prove \u201cscienter\u201d as an element of an animal owner\u2019s negligence. It is not necessary to prove an animal owner\u2019s knowledge of his animal\u2019s \u201cvicious or dangerous propensities.\u201d Strict liability is imposed by subsection (b) only on the owner of an animal which is \u201cknown by its species or nature to be dangerous, wild or vicious.\u201d H RS \u00a7 663-9 does not clearly and unambiguously preclude strict liability on the part of a dog owner for injuries inflicted by his dog. However, the legislative history of HRS \u00a7 663-9 indicates that strict liability is not imposed on dog owners, because dogs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>are not dangerous, wild or vicious by species or nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">HRS \u00a7 663-9 was enacted in 1980. Act 218, 1980 Haw. Sess. Laws 366-67. The purpose of the act is stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-7\">The legislature finds that recent court decisions allow a dog his \u201cfirst bite\u201d before an owner can be held liable for injuries caused by the dog, while at the same time holding an owner liable for injuries caused to a trespasser attacked by a dog, even if such injuries occur on the private property of the dog owner. The legislature finds both holdings unacceptable. In the first case, innocent public utility employees, visitors, and others legally on a property often go without a remedy. In the second case, numerous state residents who keep dogs or other animals for protection against the rising crime rate (which the legislature herein specifically finds to exist) are hampered in using an effective means of crime prevention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-8\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1, at 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">The court decisions referred to are <em>Pickard </em>v. <em>City and County, </em>51 Haw. 134, 452 P.2d 445 (1969), and <em>Farrior v. Payton, </em>57 Haw. 620, 562 P.2d 779 (1977). In <em>Pickard </em>the supreme court abrogated the common law rule that the liability of an occupier of land to one who comes upon that land is dependent upon the legal status of the person entering. The supreme court held, \u201can occupier of land has a duty to use reasonable care for the safety of all persons reasonably anticipated to be upon the premises, regardless of the legal status of the individual.\u201d <em>Pickard </em>v. <em>City and County, </em>51 Haw. at 135, 452 P.2d at 446. In <em>Farrior </em>the supreme court held that proof of scienter was essential to imposition of liability on an animal\u2019s owner for injuries caused by the animal.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">Conference Committee Report No. 36-80, in 1980 Senate Journal at 958, states that the legislation \u201cabrogates the common law. It does not create strict liability. It merely eliminates scienter as a matter of proof for a plaintiff or lack of scienter as a defense for a defendant.\u201d Thus, under the statute, persons suffering injury caused by an animal must still prove negligence on the part of the animal\u2019s owner in order to make the owner liable for the injury. The injured person must prove duty, breach of duty, and damages; however, the injured person need not prove the owner\u2019s knowledge of the animal\u2019s vicious propensities. This knowledge, scienter, is often referred to as the doctrine of the dog\u2019s \u201cfirst bite.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AFA\">HRS \u00a7 663-9(b) does impose strict liability on owners of animals known by their \u201cspecies or nature to be dangerous, wild or vicious.\u201d However, \u201c[d]ogs are not included in this category since dogs are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>generally of a known vicious nature.\u201d Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 36-80, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The legislative history of HRS \u00a7 663-9 renders Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that dog owners are strictly liable for injuries caused by their dogs untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">We turn now to the points of error raised by Plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">The special verdict form correctly directed the jury to consider the question of Defendants\u2019 negligence. Once the jury found Defendants were not negligent, it was unnecessary for them to deliberate any further.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed instruction no. 2, which was refused by the court, was based upon Plaintiffs\u2019 strict liability theory and, therefore, was properly denied.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-13\">Finally, Plaintiffs\u2019 argument in support of their contention that the trial court erred in denying their motion for new trial is without merit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Since the basis for liability in this case was Defendants\u2019 negligence, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>question is whether the evidence was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ANi\"><em>Fred Paul Benco </em>and <em>Martin A. Steinberg </em>on the briefs for plaintiffs-appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Aic\"><em>Wayson W.S. Wong {Lee, Henderson, Chipchase &amp; Wong, </em>of counsel) on the brief for defendants-appellees.</attorneys>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">Generally, the granting or denying of a motion for a new trial is within the trial court\u2019s discretion. On appeal, unless the appellant shows an error of law or a clear abuse of discretion by the trial court, its ruling will not be disturbed. ... On appeal, the appellate court will review the record below and if there is substantial evidence, more than a scintilla, to support the verdict returned'by thejury, the reviewing court will not upset the denial of a motion for new trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AH9\"><em>Lovell Enterprises </em>v. <em>Campbell-Burns Wood, Inc., </em>3 Haw. App. 531, 541, 654 P.2d 1361, 1368 (1982) (citations omitted). <em>See also Stahl </em>v. <em>Balsara, </em>60 Haw. 144, 587 P.2d 1210 (1978); <em>Petersen </em>v. <em>City &amp; County, </em>53 Haw. 440, 496 P.2d 4 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">Our examination of the record indicates that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict. Defendants\u2019 dogs generally remained in the vicinity of the house, which was 350 feet from the highway, and there were three signs warning Plaintiffs that there was possible danger from dogs on the premises. Thus, we find no abuse of discretion or error of law in the trial court\u2019s denial of Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b506-14\">Victoria\u2019s son-in-law testified that he saw one of the signs as he was leaving the premises.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b511-14\">Plaintiffs also urge as error the trial court\u2019s refusal to give Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed instruction no. 9. However, the specific language of the instruction is not set out in the opening brief in violation of Rule 28(b)(4)(B), Hawaii Rules of Appellate Procedure (1985). Pursuant to Rule 28 we disregard the point. Moreover, according to the brief the instruction related to punitive damages. In view of the jury\u2019s decision that Defendants were not negligent, the issue is irrelevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b511-15\">Plaintiffs also assert as error that the trial court erred in refusing to set aside the jury verdict. However, the record does not reveal, and Plaintiffs\u2019 briefs do not indicate, that Plaintiffs moved separately to set aside the verdict. We assume that this argument relates to the motion for new trial issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
