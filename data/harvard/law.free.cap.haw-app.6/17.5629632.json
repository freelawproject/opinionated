Williams was charged with burglary in the first degree in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 708-810(1)(c) (1976).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A jury found Williams guilty as charged. He appeals the trial court\u2019s refusal to give Defendant\u2019s Requested Instruction No. 6 (Defendant\u2019s No. 6). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-13\">Defendant\u2019s No. 6 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-14\">If you are not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant is guilty of the offense charged, you may find him guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>of any offense which is necessarily included in the offense charged, provided the evidence is sufficient to establish his guilt of such included offense beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-6\">A lesser-included offense to the charge of Burglary in the First Degree is Criminal Trespass in the First Degree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIq\">There are three material .elements to this offense, each of which must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai\">1. The Defendant entered or remained in a dwelling;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah\">2. He did so knowingly;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AA\">3. He did so unlawfully.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AC\">You will notice that this offense differs from the charge of Burglary in the First Degree in that the specific intent to commit a crime against property rights in the building need not be shown. Since the jury was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Williams</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADr\">was guilty of the offense charged, the jury would not have considered whether Williams was guilty of criminal trespass rather than burglary, even if Defendant\u2019s No. 6 had been given. However, when a defendant in a criminal case timely asks for a lesser included offense, instruction to which he is entitled, it is reversible error not to give it. 2 Wright, Federal Procedure and Practice: <em>Criminal 2d </em>\u00a7 498 (1982). Otherwise, a defendant would never have the opportunity to appeal the refusal to give the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-12\">Criminal trespass in the first degree is a lesser included offense of burglary in the first degree. However, a lesser included offense instruction need not be given \u201cunless there is a rational basis in the evidence for a verdict acquitting the defendant of the offense charged and convicting him of the included offense.\u201d HRS \u00a7 701-109(5) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-13\">The primary difference between burglary in the first degree and criminal trespass in the first degree is the presence or absence of an intent to commit in the building a crime against a person or against property rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-14\">The prosecution\u2019s evidence showed that one or more persons unlawfully broke into an Aiea residence (residence), ransacked it, and placed near the front door various items of personal property<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> taken from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>within the residence. Williams, who was apprehended in the vicinity of the residence soon after it had been unlawfully entered, testified that he had mistakenly thought it was a friend\u2019s residence, had knocked on the door for awhile, and had left when no one answered.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b39-7\"><em>Adelina A. Simpliciano, </em>Deputy Public Defender, <em>(Susan Barr, </em>Deputy Public Defender, and <em>David Park, </em>Law Student Intern, on the brief) for defendant-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ACD\"><em>Ernest J. Freitas, Jr., </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, for plaintiffappellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">Thus, the only fact in dispute was whether Williams was the person or one of the persons who unlawfully entered the residence, ransacked it, and placed near the front door various items of personal property taken from within the residence. If Williams is that person or one of those persons, then it follows as does night from day that he entered it with the intent to commit a crime against a person or against property rights. Consequently, there is no rational basis in the evidence to support a finding that Williams knowingly and unlawfully entered the residence without the intent to commit therein a crime against a person or against property rights. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in refusing to give Defendant\u2019s No. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b37-16\">Section 708-810(1)(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-17\">Burglary in the first degree. (1) A person commits the offense of burglary in thefirst degree if he intentionally enters or remains unlawfully in a building, with intent to commit therein a crime against a person or against property rights, and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-18\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-19\">(c) He recklessly disregards a risk that the building is the dwelling of another, and the building is such a dwelling.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b38-15\">Microwave oven, jewelry box, camera, and typewriter.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
