Kaiser appeals from the dismissal of its third-party complaint against Dillingham, and both Kaiser and Dillingham appeal from the dismissal of their indemnity claims against Defendant/Cross-Appellee Association of Apartment Owners of Mt. Terrace (Association), an unincorporated association.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The questions raised in this appeal and our answers are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">(1) Did the trial court err in granting Kaiser\u2019s motion to strike Messier\u2019s Amended Pretrial Statement and denying Messier\u2019s motion to add critical witnesses? Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">(2) Did the trial court err in granting Kaiser\u2019s and Dillingham\u2019s motions for summary judgment?<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court correctly granted summary judgment as to Messier\u2019s products liability claim, but erred in doing so as to his negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">(3) Did the trial court err in dismissing Kaiser\u2019s third-party indemnity claim against Dillingham? Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">(4) Did the trial court err in dismissing Kaiser\u2019s and Dillingham\u2019s indemnity claims against Association? No.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">The Mt. Terrace condominium apartment building (hereafter the building) was developed in 1973 by Kaiser in the Maunalua Bay area of Honolulu. On or about December 8, 1981, Messier, an employee and general manager of Association, was allegedly working on the roof of the building during a rainstorm when a metal panel which had been attached to the roof became dislodged by the storm and struck and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>injured him. Messier received worker\u2019s compensation benefits under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) chapter 386 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Messier filed suit against Association and Kaiser alleging that \u201cthe building was in a dangerous and defective condition, namely a metal panel located on the roof was loose or otherwise inadequately secured[.]\u201d The complaint charged Association was negligent in \u201cfailing to maintain and repair\u201d the building and that Kaiser was negligent in \u201cfailing to adequately design and construct\u201d the building. The complaint was dismissed as to Association on its motion asserting that Messier\u2019s claim against it was barred under HRS \u00a7 386-5.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Kaiser answered the complaint and cross-claimed against Association, alleging that Association\u2019s negligence was the cause of Messier\u2019s injuries. Kaiser also filed a third-party complaint for indemnity against Dillingham, Kaiser\u2019s general contractor for the building, alleging that Messier\u2019s injuries were caused by, <em>inter alia, </em>Dillingham\u2019s negligence. Dillingham answered Kaiser\u2019s third-party complaint and filed a cross-claim for indemnity against Kaiser and Association alleging that Messier\u2019s injuries were caused by their negligence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Dillingham also filed third-party complaints against David G. Stringer &amp; Assoc., Ltd. (Stringer), the architectural firm that designed the building, Hawaii Welding Co., Ltd. (Hawaii Welding), which allegedly installed the metal panel as Dillingham\u2019s subcontractor, and David T. Ishikawa, Hawaii Welding\u2019s trustee in dissolution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Association\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Kaiser\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>and Dillingham\u2019s cross-claims was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Trial was scheduled for June 17, 1985, and discovery was to be completed by May 17, 1985. By December 14, 1984, pretrial statements had been filed on behalf of Messier, Dillingham, Kaiser, and Association. On May 16, 1985, the eve of discovery cutoff and one month before trial, Messier filed a First Amended Pretrial Statement (Pretrial Statement) which identified for the first time a mechanical engineer, a structural engineer (hereafter collectively engineers), and an economist as his expert witnesses, and other witnesses whom Messier intended to call at trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The engineers were Messier\u2019s only experts on the issue of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Asserting that Messier\u2019s late naming of the expert witnesses violated Rule 12(a)(2) of the Rules of the Circuit Court (RCC) (1984),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and was prejudicial, Kaiser moved to strike the Pretrial Statement or, in the alternative, to exclude the tardily named witnesses or continue the trial. Dillingham and Association joined in the motion. On May 23, 1985, Messier filed a motion to add critical witnesses under Rule 12(a)( 15), RCC.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On June 28, 1985, Messier\u2019s motion was denied and Kaiser\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>motion to strike the Pretrial Statement was granted. Messier\u2019s motion for reconsideration was denied by an order entered on July 25, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">On June 17, 1985, the trial court orally ordered that all the defendants would be allowed to file dispositive motions on Messier\u2019s claims.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Consequently, on June 18, 1985, Kaiser filed a motion for summary judgment on Messier\u2019s claims, Dillingham filed a motion to dismiss \u201call claims\u201d against it, and Association filed a \u201cMotion to Dismiss Cross-Claims.\u201d After a hearing, the motions were granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Messier, Kaiser, and Dillingham timely appealed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The appeals will be discussed <em>seriatim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">MESSIER\u2019S APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"Aen\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">The first question raised in Messier\u2019s appeal is whether the lower court abused its discretion in granting Kaiser\u2019s motion to strike Messier\u2019s Pretrial Statement and denying his motion to add critical witnesses. As noted above, both motions were based on Rule 12, RCC. Inasmuch as both motions involve the question whether Messier should have been allowed to present the witnesses\u2019 testimony at trial, they will be considered together.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">Rule 12, RCC, deals with pretrial matters and establishes the posture of a case for trial. Sanctions imposed by the trial court under that rule are reviewable under the abuse of discretion standard. <em>See GLA, Inc. </em>v. <em>Spengler, </em>1 Haw. App. 647, 623 P.2d 1283 (1981). The standard of review is whether the trial court\u2019s action clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or was in disregard of principles of law or practice. <em>Title Guaranty Escrow Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>Powley, </em>2 Haw. App. 265, 630 P.2d 642 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">Kaiser and Dillingham contend that the Pretrial Statement was an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>attempt by Messier to bring in a new claim for strict products liability without amending his complaint. However, Messier\u2019s allegation in his complaint that the building was dangerous and defective, together with the assertion of a strict products liability claim in his original pretrial statement refutes that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Kaiser and Dillingham further argue (1) that Messier had more than ample time to identify his witnesses; (2) that Kaiser and Dillingham were prejudiced by his tardiness because they did not have sufficient time to depose the witnesses or to find their own expert rebuttal witnesses; and (3) that Messier had not provided them with the witnesses\u2019 written statements as required by Rule 12(a)(2)(v), RCC. In our view, however, Messier\u2019s counsel\u2019s explanation for his tardiness constituted good cause under Rule 12(a)( 15) and the trial court\u2019s action exceeded the bounds of reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">We note, first, that in his original pretrial statement Messier indicated that other witnesses would be identified later as they were discovered. There was no attempt by Messier to mislead Kaiser and Dillingham into believing that Messier would not bring in other witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Messier\u2019s counsel explained in his affidavit that when he learned that his economist witness would not be available for the trial he was compelled to find another economist. Additionally, he stated that he had been planning to use an architect as his expert to show liability. However, after Stringer was joined as a third-party defendant and Messier had deposed David G. Stringer, Messier felt compelled to switch to the engineers for expert testimony. Those decisions might have been made at an earlier date. However, on the entire record, we are convinced that Messier\u2019s counsel\u2019s explanation indicated good cause for adding the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">Additionally, we are not convinced that Kaiser or Dillingham suffered undue prejudice. They were doubtlessly inconvenienced, since trial was close at hand; however, they were able to depose the expert witnesses in short order, and although they may have anticipated some difficulty obtaining their own witnesses for rebuttal, that does not appear to have been an insurmountable problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">Finally, we note that Kaiser\u2019s motion requested the alternative remedy of continuing the trial date. We do not believe that any of the parties would have been prejudiced by a continuance. Previously, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>May 1, 1985, Stringer had filed a motion for continuance which Kaiser joined and Dillingham did not oppose. On June 12, 1985, Messier also filed a motion for continuance to allow Judge Philip T. Chun, who had orally granted Kaiser\u2019s motion to strike Messier\u2019s Pretrial Statement and denied Messier\u2019s motion to add critical witnesses, and was on vacation, to hear Messier\u2019s motion for reconsideration of that order.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Standing alone the sanction may not appear harsh. However, in view of the ensuing judgments against Messier, which were based in part upon the argument that Messier would not be able to prove his case without expert witnesses, it took on Draconian dimensions. The trial court should more properly have allowed Messier to add his witnesses and continued the trial to allow the other parties to fully prepare. <em>See Bagalay </em>v. <em>Lahaina Restoration Foundation, </em>60 Haw. 125, 588 P.2d 416 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">We turn now to Messier\u2019s arguments on the summary judgments in favor of Kaiser and Dillingham.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">Messier argues that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing Kaiser and Dillingham<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> to file their motions for summary judgment on the very eve of trial. He asserts that the motions violated Rule 7(f), RCC (1984), which prohibits the filing of motions affecting substantive issues more than 60 days after the filing of a responsive pretrial statement. The argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">Rule 56, HRCP (1980), allows a motion for summary judgment to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>filed at any time. The conflict between Rule 56, HRCP, and Rule 7, RCC, must be resolved in favor of Rule 56. Rule 32, RCC (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Although Messier concedes that Dillingham\u2019s motion was really one for summary judgment and that such motions may be filed at any time, he contends that the motions were improper because they violated Rule 56\u2019s requirement that such motions be served at least ten days before the date of the hearing on the motion. We are not persuaded by the argument, since Messier\u2019s motion for time to respond was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">The standard of review of the summary judgments in this case is whether there are any genuine issues of material fact in the record and whether Kaiser and Dillingham were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Towse </em>v. <em>State, </em>64 Haw. 624, 647 P.2d 696 (1982); <em>Namauu </em>v. <em>City and County, </em>62 Haw. 358, 614 P.2d 943 (1980). The facts in the record and the inferences to be drawn from them are viewed in the light most favorable to Messier. <em>Carrington </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>5 Haw. App. 194, 683 P.2d 1220 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">Messier essentially asserts two claims: strict products liability and negligence. We will discuss the summary judgment motions in relation to the strict products liability claim first, and then in relation to the negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">The thrust of Messier\u2019s complaint is that the building was a \u201cdefective and dangerous product because the metal panel was loose or inadequately fastened\u201d to the building\u2019s roof and, therefore, Kaiser and Dillingham are strictly liable for his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">Kaiser and Dillingham argue that the building is not a product and they cannot, therefore, be held strictly liable for Messier\u2019s injuries. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-12\">In <em>Kaneko </em>v. <em>Hilo Coast Processing, </em>65 Haw. 447, 654 P.2d 343 (1982), the supreme court declined to define \u201cproduct\u201d for the purposes of strict products liability, and noted that a product must be determined on a case-by-case basis guided by case law, public policy, the comments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>to the Restatement (Second) of Torts,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and the Model Uniform Product Liability Act,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> published by the United States Department of Commerce. 44 Fed. Reg. 62714 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Pointing out that the authorities are divided on the question whether a building is a product within the meaning of strict products liability, the <em>Kaneko </em>court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-7\">a prefabricated building that must be assembled is a product where the seller-manufacturer may be found strictly liable for injuries caused by a defective component part. We agree with the conclusions of the <em>Lantis </em>court that strict liability applies to \u201cassembly-type situations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number><em>Id., </em>65 Haw. at 457, 654 P.2d at 350. The supreme court in <em>Kaneko </em>stated that holding the prefabricated building to be a product would reaffirm the policy considerations underlying the strict products liability rule. Maximum protection would be afforded to persons injured by defective products; the burden of distributing the risk would be placed on the seller-manufacturer as a cost of doing business; and the seller-manufacturer would have an incentive to guard against such defects happening in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Another facet of the question of what is a product is represented by <em>Bidar v. AMFAC, Inc., </em>66 Haw. 547, 669 P.2d 154 (1983). In <em>Bidar, </em>the plaintiff was injured when the towel bar in her hotel room\u2019s bathroom tore loose from the wall as she attempted to use it to pull herself up from the toilet. The supreme court declined to extend its holding in <em>Kaneko, </em>stating that \u201can identified component of a prefabricated building can hardly be likened to \u2018a portion of the leased or rented premises... [that] prove[s] defective.\u2019 We perceive no good reason here to lend a more expansive meaning to \u2018product\u2019 than we did in <em>Kaneko[.]\u201d Bidar, </em>66 Haw. at 556-557, 669 P.2d at 161. We, likewise, in the circumstances of this case, decline to hold that the building is a product.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The gravamen of Messier\u2019s complaint is that the metal panel was either inadequately attached to the building or was improperly maintained or repaired. Those allegations are not sufficient in our view to establish strict liability for injuries resulting from a defective building and do not warrant our holding that the building is a product within the rule of strict products liability.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">The policy considerations that form the basis for the strict products liability rule do not compel its application in the instant case. Withholding the rule will not measurably depreciate Messier\u2019s chances of obtaining compensation for his injuries. He does not face the kind of difficulty in proving the negligence of either Kaiser or Dillingham, or both, in the construction of the building as is faced by plaintiffs in other cases where the doctrine of strict products liability has been applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">We turn now to the summary judgments on Messier\u2019s negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>2.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">In discussing Kaiser\u2019s and Dillingham\u2019s motions as they relate to negligence, we start with the proposition that questions of negligence are not ordinarily susceptible to summary judgment. <em>De Los Santos </em>v. <em>State, </em>65 Haw. 608, 655 P.2d 869 (1982); <em>McKeague </em>v. <em>Talbert, </em>3 Haw. App. 646, 658 P.2d 898 (1983). Additionally, if Dillingham or Stringer were negligent then Kaiser\u2019s liability for their negligence depends upon whether they were truly independent contractors, as Kaiser argues, or whether Kaiser exercised such control over their performance of their contracts with it that they were its agents or employees. <em>See Taira </em>v. <em>Oahu Sugar Co., Ltd., </em>1 Haw. App.208, 616 P.2d 1026 (1980). We also note that Dillingham\u2019s argument that Messier could not prove negligence without expert witnesses has been disposed of by our ruling that the trial court erred in denying Messier\u2019s motion to add critical witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">b.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">Kaiser asserts that it cannot be held liable for the negligence of either Dillingham or Stringer, because they were independent contractors. Our view of the record convinces us that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">Kaiser produced as exhibits its construction contract with Dillingham and its architectural agreement with Stringer, which, respectively, placed general responsibility for the completed building on Dillingham and Stringer. It also introduced the depositions of Daniel Buckingham, its employee on the construction project, and of David G. Stringer.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Kaiser\u2019s evidence supports its argument that Stringer and Dillingham were negligent in designing and constructing the building, and that Kaiser did not exercise such control over the performance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>either Stringer or Dillingham as to render Kaiser liable for their negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Messier produced the depositions of David G. Stringer and Ronald W. Anderson (Anderson), Dillingham\u2019s employee on the project, which were taken in this case. Stringer\u2019s testimony indicated that the metal panels were required by Kaiser as part of the building\u2019s design and that the design was approved by Kaiser. Anderson\u2019s deposition indicates that Kaiser had one or more of its employees on the job site daily overseeing the progress of the construction. Messier\u2019s evidence is enough to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to the extent of control that Kaiser had over the design of the panels and the performance of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Messier\u2019s evidence also included correspondence relating to a number of construction defects encountered after the building was completed and occupied which indicated that the metal panels were rusting. A letter from Kaiser to First Hawaiian Bank regarding that problem indicates that Kaiser undertook to have the rusting remedied. Viewed most favorably to Messier, the evidence raises a genuine issue of fact as to whether Kaiser was negligent in not adequately repairing the metal panels when it undertook to remedy the rust situation and in not foreseeing at that time that the metal panels could come loose and cause injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">The question of Kaiser\u2019s liability for its own negligence or for that of Dillingham or Stringer, or both, should have been preserved for trial. The trial court erred in granting both Kaiser\u2019s motion and Dillingham\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">KAISER\u2019S APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">On June 18, 1985, Dillingham filed a motion to dismiss \u201call claims\u201d against it. The order appealed by Kaiser merely granted the motion but did not specifically state that \u201call claims\u201d were dismissed. Construing the order as having done so, Kaiser argues that if the trial court is reversed on Messier\u2019s appeal, the dismissal of its cross-claim against Kaiser should be reversed also. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">We construe the order to be a dismissal of Kaiser\u2019s claim against Dillingham on the grounds that it was moot as a result of the judgment against Messier. Since, the trial court erred in dismissing Messier\u2019s negligence claim against Dillingham, it follows that it was error to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>dismiss Kaiser\u2019s indemnity claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">KAISER\u2019S AND DILLINGHAM\u2019S JOINT APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">The dispositive issue in Kaiser\u2019s and Dillingham\u2019s appeal from the order granting Association\u2019s motion to dismiss their cross-claims is whether our Worker\u2019s Compensation Law, HRS chapter 386, relieves Association of any legal duty it might otherwise have to indemnify Kaiser and Dillingham for any liability they may have for Messier\u2019s injuries.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We answer yes, and affirm the order of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">HRS chapter 386 requires employers to compensate their employees for job-related injuries regardless of fault. <em>Dependents of Fred Crawford, Deceased </em>v. <em>Financial Plaza Contractors, </em>64 Haw. 415, 419, 643 P.2d 48, 51 (1982). HRS \u00a7 386-5 provides that the statutory compensation is the employer\u2019s exclusive liability for work-related injuries, and that the statutory obligation of the employer is exclusive of any claim against it \u201con account\u201d of an eligible injury.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">In <em>Kamali </em>v. <em>Hawaiian Electric Co., </em>54 Haw. 153, 504 P.2d 861 (1972), the Hawaii Supreme Court held that \u201cthe exclusive liability provision precludes only those actions which arise \u2018on account\u2019 of the employee\u2019s injury[,]\u201d and that \u201c[a] third party claim for indemnity is not based on the employee\u2019s injury but is for reimbursement based upon contract or some other independent duty existing between indemnitor and indemnitee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>54 Haw. at 159, 504 P.2d at 865. <em>Kamali\u2019s </em>holding is still good law. <em>See Espaniola </em>v. <em>Cawdrey Mars Joint Venture, </em>68 Haw. __, 707 P.2d 365 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Kaiser and Dillingham contend that Association\u2019s indemnity obligation is based upon Association\u2019s breach of an independent duty owed to them. Dillingham states that Association\u2019s duty \u201cwas to properly maintain and repair the Mt. Terrace condominium building and to adequately warn its employees of a known, potentially dangerous condition.\u201d However, the duty argued for by Dillingham is not owed to Kaiser and Dillingham, and cannot be relied upon by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">The question of duty is a question of law to be determined by reference to the body of statutes, rules, principles, and precedents which make up the law. <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Nagata, </em>68 Haw. __, 730 P.2d 914 (1986). We have not been made aware of any independent duty owed by Association to either Kaiser or Dillingham, or both, which would give rise to Association\u2019s liability to them as an indemnitor.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">It follows that the cross-claims of implied indemnity made by Kaiser and Dillingham against the Association are \u201con account of\u2019 Messier\u2019s injuries, and were properly disposed of.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">Finally, Dillingham and Kaiser contend that policy considerations dictate the recognition of their indemnity claims against the Association so as to effect a just and equitable result. The argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">The court in <em>Kamali, </em>54 Haw. at 157, 504 P.2d at 864, stated that HRS \u00a7 386-5 was a \u201cclear expression of legislative intent to absolve the employer of all liability save that imposed by statute.\u201d The policy of chapter 386 is specific and is a clear expression by the legislature that the statute\u2019s remedies and the exclusiveness of the employer\u2019s liability are just and equitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">As a matter of law Kaiser and Dillingham are not entitled to indemnity from Association and judgment was properly entered against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-12\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b559-13\">Based on the foregoing discussion, we make the following disposition of the appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-14\">(1) The order granting Kaiser\u2019s motion to strike Messier\u2019s Pretrial Statement and denying Messier\u2019s motion to add critical witnesses is vacated;</p>\n<p id=\"b559-15\">(2) The judgments in favor of Kaiser and Dillingham on Messier\u2019s products liability claim are affirmed and the judgments on Messier\u2019s negligence claim are reversed;</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A6e\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number><em>Burt L.
