(Home) appeals from the circuit court\u2019s order granting the motion of plaintiff Aircall of Hawaii, Inc. (Aircall) to compel Home to arbitrate and denying in part Home\u2019s motion for a protective order regarding an opinion letter. The disposition of the appeal requires that we answer the following question: What remedy, if any, is available to Home to prevent the circuit court\u2019s holding, which is unreviewable because of mootness, from having a collaterally conclusive effect? Our answer is to vacate the circuit court\u2019s order and to remand the case with direction to dismiss the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-17\">On January 1, 1984, Tel-Tec Hawaii, Inc. (Tel-Tec), a subsidiary of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>Home, and Aircall executed a joint venture agreement (Agreement). Home also signed the Agreement promising to guarantee up to a specified amount in equipment lease obligations of the joint venture.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">On February 6, 1986, to resolve a dispute, Tel-Tec filed a demand for arbitration against Aircall with the American Arbitration Association (AAA) pursuant to the arbitration provision in the Agreement. Aircall\u2019s motion to implead Home into the arbitration proceeding was denied by the arbitrators. Thereupon, Aircall filed a formal demand for arbitration against Home with the AAA. However, Home refused to arbitrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">On June 17, 1986, Aircall filed this special proceeding, S.P. No. 86-0232, in the circuit court to compel Home to arbitrate. Attached to Aircall\u2019s motion to compel arbitration was a copy of an opinion letter of attorney William M. Swope (Swope) dated July 11, 1985 (Swope\u2019s letter) which had been produced by Tel-Tec in its arbitration proceeding with Aircall. Swope was an officer and director of Home and his law firm was counsel forTel-Tec, Home, and Honolulu Federal Savings and Loan Association (HonFed), the parent corporation of Home. Claiming attorney-client privilege and that Swope\u2019s letter had been \u201cinadvertently produced,\u201d Home moved for a protective order to seal the entire record of the case and to strike Swope\u2019s letter from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">On July 2, 1986, the circuit court entered its order (July 2, 1986 Order) compelling Home to arbitrate and directing the Aircalf-Home arbitration proceeding to be consolidated with the Tel-Tec-Aircall arbitration proceeding. The July 2, 1986 Order also sealed the record of the case but included a finding that \u201cany privilege attaching to the July 11, 1985 letter from William M. Swope, Esq. to Honolulu Federal Savings and Loan Association was waived by the production of the letter by Tel-Tec in the arbitration proceeding[.]\u201d Record Vol. 2 at 126. Home then filed its notice of appeal on August 1, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">On October 1, 1986, the arbitrators issued their award in the consolidated arbitration proceedinginvolvingTel-Tec, Aircall, and Home. The arbitrators found Home not liable to Aircall.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">After Home filed its opening brief in this case, the circuit court entered an order on October 31, 1986, confirming the October 1, 1986 arbitration award in S.P. No. 86-0407<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> commenced by Aircall. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>was no appeal of that order and it is final. Thus, this appeal has been rendered moot and is subject to dismissal. <em>See League of Women Voters </em>v. <em>Doi, </em>57 Haw. 213, 552 P.2d 1392 (1976); <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>McKay, </em>26 Haw. 171 (1921). However, this is not the end of the story.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The July 2, 1986 Order, <em>inter alia, </em>determined that the attorney-client privilege had been waived regarding Swope\u2019s letter. Upon dismissal of the pending appeal, that determination may under the doctrine of collateral estoppel preclude Home, Tel-Tec(its subsidiary), or HonFed (its parent) from litigating the privilege waiver issue in another proceeding. <em>See Santos </em>v. <em>State, </em>64 Haw. 648, 646 P.2d 962 (1982); <em>Silver </em>v. <em>Queen\u2019s Hospital, </em>63 Haw. 430, 629 P.2d 1116 (1981); <em>Gomes </em>v. <em>Tyau, </em>57 Haw. 163, 552 P.2d 640 (1976); <em>Morneau </em>v. <em>Stark Enterprises, Ltd., </em>56 Haw. 420, 539 P.2d 472 (1975). However, the imposition of issue preclusion where appellate review has been frustrated due to mootness is obviously unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">The solution lies in the adoption of the federal practice of having the appellate court \u201cvacate the judgment of the trial court and direct dismissal of the case.\u201d 18 C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure: <em>Jurisdiction </em>\u00a7 4433 at 316 (1981). <em>See also </em>1B J. Moore, J. Lucas &amp; T. Currier, <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00b6 0.416[6] (2 ed. 1984). In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Munsingwear, Inc., </em>340 U.S. 36, 71 S. Ct. 104, 95 L. Ed. 36 (1950), the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-8\">The established practice of theCourt in dealing with a civil case from a court in the federal system which has become moot while on its way here or pending our decision on the merits is to reverse or vacate the judgment below and remand with a direction to dismiss. That was said in <em>Duke Power Co. v. Greenwood County, 299 </em>U.S. 259, 267, to be \u201cthe duty of the appellate court.\u201d That procedure clears the path for future relitigation of the issues between the parties and eliminates a judgment, review of which was prevented through happenstance. When that procedure is followed, the rights of all parties are preservedf.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-9\"><em>Id. </em>340 U.S. at 39-40, 71 S. Ct. at 106-07, 95 L. Ed. at 41 (footnote omitted). More recently, the practice was applied in <em>Great Western Sugar Co. </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>442 U.S. 92, 99 S.Ct. 2149, 60 L. Ed. 2d 735 (1979), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>where a pending appeal of an order compelling arbitration was rendered moot by the completion of the arbitration proceeding, similar to the facts in this case.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A2p\"><em>H.

Ct. at 107, 95 L. Ed. at 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">This opinion clearly indicates that Home\u2019s appeal was not frivolous. We therefore deny Aircall\u2019s Rule 38, Hawaii Rules of Appellate Procedure (1984),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">Accordingly, the July 2, 1986 Order is vacated and the case is remanded with direction to dismiss the action.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b614-11\">We take judicial notice of S.P.
