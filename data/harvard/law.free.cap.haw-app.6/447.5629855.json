(Blair), the insured under a comprehensive general liability insurance policy (Policy) issued by plaintiff Hawaiian Insurance &amp; Guaranty Company, Limited (HIG), the insurer, appeals from the declaratory judgment holding that HIG is not obligated to defend and indemnify Blair under the Policy against the claims of defendant Kukui Nuts of Hawaii, Inc. (KNH). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-12\">On September 13, 1984, KNH filed a 22-count complaint (Complaint) containing 131 paragraphs of allegations against Blair and eleven other named defendants.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Complaint alleged that KNH was successfully engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling leis and jewelry made from Hawaiian kukui<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> nuts, that the defendants imported and sold \u201cfake\u201d Hawaiian kukui nut leis and jewelry \u201cmade from tung nuts grown apparently in Taiwan[,]\u201d and that the importation and sale of such fakes \u201cdrove\u201d KNH into a reorganization proceeding under chapter 11<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the Bankruptcy Code in May of 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Blair tendered the defense of the KNH lawsuit to HIG. On January 14, 1985, HIG commenced this action against Blair and KNH<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> seeking a declaratory judgment that it had no obligation to defend and indemnify Blair under the Policy. Blair counterclaimed alleging that HIG breached the Policy, breached an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under the Policy, breached its fiduciary duty as insurer, and engaged in \u201cunfair claim settlement practices.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">Both HIG and Blair moved for summary judgment. On November 27, 1985, the lower court granted HIG\u2019s motion and denied Blair\u2019s motion. After the entry of a declaratory judgment, Blair appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Since the insurer\u2019s duty to defend its insured is contractual in nature, to determine the scope of such duty, we must first look at the language of the particular policy involved. <em>First Insurance Co. of Hawaii, Inc. </em>v. <em>State, </em>66 Haw. 413, 665 P.2d 648 (1983). Here, the pertinent language in the Policy reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-7\">[T]he company shall have the right and duty to defend any suit against the insured seeking damages on account of such bodily injury or property damage, even if any of the allegations of the suit are groundless, false or fraudulent[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Thus, \u201cthe duty to defend is broader than the duty to pay[,]\u201d <em>Id. </em>66 Haw. at 417, 665 P.2d at 652, and \u201cwhere a suit raises a potential for indemnification liability of the insurer to the insured, the insurer has a duty to accept the defense of the entire suit even though other claims of the complaint fall outside of the policy\u2019s coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, \u201c \u2018the insurer is obligated to provide a defense against the allegations of covered as well as the non-covered claims.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>66 Haw. at 418, 665 P.2d at 652 (quoting 7C J. Appleman, <em>Insurance Law and Practice </em>\u00a7 4684.01 at 106 (Berdal ed. 1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">Conversely, \u201cwhere pleadings fail to allege any basis for recovery within the coverage clause the insurer has no obligation to defend.\u201d 7C J. Appleman, <em>Insurance Law and Practice, </em>\u00a7 4684.01 at 91 (Berdal ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>1979). <em>See Sturla, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Co., </em>67 Haw. 203, 684 P.2d 960 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Like the circuit court, we believe that KNH\u2019s allegations in the Complaint fail to show any liability or loss covered by the Policy. In other words, the bases of Blair\u2019s liability and KNH\u2019s damages averred in the Complaint are not risks HIG undertook to protect under the Policy. Consequently, we hold that the circuit court properly declared that HIG had no duty to defend or to indemnify Blair.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">Blair contends paragraph 128 of the Complaint raised a potential claim of \u201cproperty damage\u201d as defined in the Policy and, therefore, HIG had a duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">Paragraph 128 alleges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-10\">Defendants and each of them have further damaged the value of Plaintiffs product line, trademark(s), tradename(s) and the reputation and good will of Plaintiff in the Community and in the public mind.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">The Policy provides coverage for \u201cproperty damage\u201d caused by an \u201coccurrence\u201d and contains the following definitions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-12\">\u201cOccurrence\u201d means an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions, which results in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-13\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-14\">\u201cproperty damage\u201d means (I) physical injury to or destruction of tangible property which occurs during the policy period, including the loss of use thereof at any time resulting therefrom, or (2) loss of use of tangible property which has not been physically injured or destroyed provided such loss of use is caused by an occurrence during the policy period[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-15\">Blair starts with the premise that KNH\u2019s \u201cproduct line\u201d is \u201ctangible property\u201d consisting of \u201cthe stock of things produced by KNH, or KNH\u2019s \u2018products.\u2019 \u201d Although the Complaint does not allege any \u201cphysical injury\u201d to KNH\u2019s product line, Blair claims there was \u201closs of use\u201d of the product line, contending that \u201cdiminution in value\u201d constitutes \u201closs of use.\u201d Blair concludes its thesis by asserting that since it \u201cdid not intend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>to cause the damages alleged by KNH,\u201d there was an \u201coccurrence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AyB\">For the purpose of this opinion, we assume, but do not decide, that the \u201cproduct line\u201d is \u201ctangible property\u201d and that there was an \u201coccurrence.\u201d We do not agree with Blair, however, that there was a \u201closs of use\u201d of KNH\u2019s product line. There is no allegation in the Complaint that KNH was deprived of the actual use of its products at any time. And we do not agree that damage to the \u201cvalue of KNH\u2019s product line\u201d constitutes \u201closs of use\u201d under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">In support of its contention that \u201cdiminution in value\u201d constitutes \u201closs of use,\u201d Blair relies on four cases. Based on our analysis, however, we believe that Blair\u2019s reliance on those cases was misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Contrary to Blair\u2019s representation, <em>Missouri Terrazzo Co. </em>v. <em>Iowa National Mutual Insurance Co., </em>566 F. Supp. 546 (E.D. Mo. 1983), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>740 F.2d 647 (8th Cir. 1984), involved physical injury to tangible property, not intangible losses to tangible property.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>Missouri Terrazzo, </em>the underlying claim was based on the alleged improper construction of a terrazzo floor by the insured resulting in the diminution of value to the building. The court of appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">Here, the physical damage to tangible property, i.e., the physical deterioration of the floor, is manifest. We agree with Missouri Terrazzo that the diminution in value in this case is \u201cmerely a means of measuring the damage sustained as a result of the property damage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">740 F.2d at 650.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">Blair also relies on a California case, <em>Economy Lumber Co. of Oakland, Inc. </em>v. <em>Insurance Company of North America, </em>157 Cal. App. 3d 641, 204 Cal. Rptr. 135 (1984), and two Illinois cases, <em>Pittway Corp. </em>v. <em>American Motorist Insurance Co., </em>56 Ill. App. 3d 338, 370 N.E.2d 1271 (1977), and <em>CMO Graphics, Inc. </em>v. <em>CNA Insurance, </em>115 Ill. App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>3d 491, 450 N.E.2d 860 (1983). <em>Economy Lumber </em>dealt with issues on the meaning of \u201coccurrence\u201d as applied to the facts of the case and the applicability of a policy exclusion regarding damage to other property caused by the insured\u2019s product. Thus, <em>Economy Lumber </em>is not on point.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">In <em>Pittwav, </em>where the insured\u2019s defective valve assemblies were incorporated into aerosol cans Filled with hair spray, the claimants alleged damage to the completed product (aerosol cans). The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-7\">[T]he term \u201cproperty damage\u201d includes tangible property which has been diminished in value or made useless irrespective of any actual physical injury to the tangible property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-9\">[T]he damage to the completed product exclusive of the value of the defective product furnished by Pittway amounts to damage to tangible personal property within the terms of the policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-10\"><em>Id. </em>56 Ill. App. 3d at 341, 370 N.E.2d at 1274. However, the insured was denied coverage based on a policy exclusion and the insured\u2019s failure to give the insurer timely notice. In <em>CMO Graphics, </em>the court accepted the <em>Pittway </em>court\u2019s construction of \u201cproperty damage\u201d and indicated that had the third party alleged \u201cdamage caused to its products or . . . diminution in market value of its products[,]\u201d there would have been coverage under the policy. <em>Id. </em>115 Ill. App. 3d at 492, 450 N.E.2d at 864.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">Blair argues that <em>Pittway </em>involved an earlier standard form of policy which \u201cmore restrictive[ly]\u201d required damages for loss of use to result from \u201cinjury to or destruction of tangible property.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Since property damage under the Policy in this case encompasses \u201closs of use of tangible property which has not been physically injured or destroyed[,]\u201d Blair contends that \u201cthe <em>Pittway </em>analysis makes clear that a diminution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>to the value of tangible property constitutes a \u2018loss of use.\u2019 \u201d However, in the recent case of <em>Federated Mutual Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Concrete Units, Inc., </em>363 N.W.2d 751 (Minn. 1985), which involved a policy containing the same definition of \u201cproperty damage\u201d as in the Policy, the Minnesota Supreme Court refuted this argument by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-4\">[W]e conclude that \u201cdiminution in value\u201d is not \u201cproperty damage\u201d when defined as either <em>\u201cphysical </em>injury to * * * <em>tangible </em>property\u201d or as \u201closs of use of <em>tangible </em>property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-5\"><em>Id. </em>363 N.W.2d at 756 (emphasis in original). The court distinguished <em>Hauenstein </em>v. <em>Saint Paul-Mercury Indemnity Co., </em>242 Minn. 354, 65 N.W.2d 122 (1954), which had held similarly to Pittway,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsI\">The policy considered in <em>Hauenstein </em>was pre-1966 revision CGL policy, whereas the policy we now consider is a CGL policy as revised in 1973.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-6\"><em>Federated Mutual Insurance Co., </em>363 N.W.2d at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">We note that in the four cases cited by Blair and other similar cases, e.g., <em>Western Casualty and Surety Co. </em>v. <em>Polar Panel Co., </em>457 F.2d 957 (8th Cir. 1972); <em>Geddes &amp; Smith, Inc. </em>v. <em>Saint Paul-Mercury Indemnity Co., </em>51 Cal. 2d 558, 334 P.2d 881 (1959); and <em>Sola Basic Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>90 Wis. 2d 641, 280 N.W.2d 211 (1979), (1) there was a contractual relationship between the third party claimant and the insured who was a contractor, subcontractor, or supplier; (2) the insured\u2019s defective product was incorporated into the claimant\u2019s end product be it a building, industrial product, or installation; and (3) the insured\u2019s incorporated product \u201cdamaged\u201d the claimant\u2019s end product. In this case, there was no contractual relationship between K.NH and Blair and no product of Blair was incorporated into K N H\u2019s \u201cproduct line.\u201d Thus, those cases are neither factually nor legally on point.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">In essence, this case is akin to <em>L. Ray Packing Co. </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Insurance Co., </em>469 A.2d 832 (Me. 1983), where the insured sought to have the insurer defend an antitrust lawsuit commenced by fourteen fishermen. The insured contended that \u201cthe inability to sell the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>herring in a free market is a loss of use of the herring[,]\u201d but the court held that \u201cthe alleged damage can be characterized only as loss of profits[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 835, 836. Likewise, KNH\u2019s allegation of damage to the value of its product line really is an allegation of loss of profits which the Policy does not cover.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">We hold that as applied to the facts in this case, \u201cdiminution in value\u201d does not constitute \u201closs of use\u201d within the meaning of the Policy provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">Blair also contends the allegations in the Complaint infer trade libel or disparagement which constitutes a \u201cpersonal injury\u201d claim under the Policy and require HIG to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">Regarding coverage for personal injury liability, the Policy provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-10\">The company will pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of injury (herein called \u201cpersonal injury\u201d) sustained by any person or organization and arising out of one or more of the following offenses committed in the conduct of the named insured\u2019s business:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-11\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-12\">Group B - the publication or utterance of a libel or slander or of other defamatory or disparaging material, or a publication or utterance in violation of an individual\u2019s right of privacy; except publications or utterances in the course of or related to advertising, broadcasting or telecasting activities conducted by or on behalf of the named insuredf.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-13\">Trade libel or disparagement<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> means \u201cthe publication of matter disparaging the quality of another\u2019s land, chattels or intangible things, that the publisher should recognize as likely to result in pecuniary loss to the other through the conduct of a third person in respect to the other\u2019s interests in the property.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 626 (1977). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>At a minimum, a claim for trade libel or disparagement requires \u201c(1) a publication; (2) which induces others not to deal with plaintiff; and (3) special damages.\u201d <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Great American Insurance Companies, </em>169 Cal. App. 3d 766, 773, 215 Cal. Rptr. 416, 420 (1985). HIG contends that KNH\u2019s Complaint does not allege or imply any disparaging publication.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Count XII of the Complaint alleges that Blair and the other defendants \u201chave passed off artd/or palmed off their products as being those of [KNH] or substantially identical to those of [KNH].\u201d Blair argues that the count XII allegations \u201cspecifically state disparagement.\u201d However, Blair has not submitted, and our research has not located, any case holding that \u201cpassing off\u2019 or \u201cpalming off\u2019 an inferior product for a better product constitutes publication in an alleged trade libel or disparagement case. Such practice may constitute unfair competition. <em>See Singer Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Redlich, </em>109 F. Supp. 623 (S.D. Cal. 1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Moreover, if the count XII allegations reasonably infer publication because \u201cpassing off\u2019 or \u201cpalming off\u2019 entails communication to the buyers or prospective buyers of Blair\u2019s products, the communication constitutes \u201cadvertising\u201d which is excepted from coverage under the Policy. Communications \u201cmade in the context of attempting to induce people to buy [the insured\u2019s] products . . . fall within the realm of <em>advertising' </em>and \u201care excluded from coveragef.]\u201d <em>Nichols, </em>169 Cal. App. 3d at 775, 215 Cal. Rptr. at 421 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Accordingly, there was no coverage under the personal injury liability provisions of the Policy and HIG had no duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">Citing Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 431-455 (1985),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Blair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>asserts it is entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees and costs because \u201cHIG has contested its liability under its policy to provide Blair a defense in the KNH lawsuit.\u201d This assertion is without basis. Under HRS \u00a7 431-455 an insurer\u2019s liability for the insured\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and costs arises only when it is ordered to pay policy benefits. HIG has not been ordered to pay benefits under the Policy.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ag7\"><em>Robert J. Smolenski (James W.
