Dumlao (Dumlao) appeals from his conviction of murder. Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 707-701 (1976).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He argues on appeal that the trial court erred in refusing to give his requested manslaughter instruction. Relying on <em>State </em>v. <em>O\u2019Daniel, </em>62 Haw. 518, 616 P.2d 1383 (1980), he contends there was sufficient evidence that he shot his mother-in-law, Pacita M. Reyes (Pacita), while \u201cunder the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>which there [was] a reasonable explanation\u201d to support an instruction under HRS \u00a7 707-702(2) (1976).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We agree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The trial court instructed the jury that they could find Dumlao guilty of manslaughter if they concluded that he had recklessly shot Pacita to death, HRS \u00a7 707-702(1)(a) (1976),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but refused to give the instruction Dumlao had requested.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">After a jury trial, Dumlao was convicted of murder for shooting Pacita, and of reckless endangering in the first degree, HRS \u00a7 707-713 (Supp. 1984), for shooting and injuring his brother-in-law, Pedrito Reyes (Pedrito). He does not appeal the reckless endangering conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">The questions presented are: (I) what is the meaning of the language of HRS \u00a7 707-702(2); and (II) was there evidence to support the giving of Dumlao\u2019s requested instruction?</p>\n<p id=\"Aqq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>1.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The guiding principle in statutory construction is to ascertain the intent of the legislature as gleaned primarily from the statutory language. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ahakuelo, </em>5 Haw. App. 205, 207, 683 P.2d 400, 402 (1984). <em>See also State </em>v. <em>Ui, </em>66 Haw. 366, 663 P.2d 630 (1983). However, where the language is ambiguous, we are not limited to the words of the statute. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ui. supra, </em>but we may look to other aids to statutory construction to assist us in determining legislative intent. <em>Treloar </em>v. <em>Swinerton &amp; Walberg Co., </em>65 Haw. 415, 421, 653 P.2d 420, 424 (1982). The language of \u00a7 707-702(2) does not comport with the historical test for reducing a charge of murder to manslaughter, and we cannot determine from the language alone whether the legislature intended to effect a change in that test. Consequently, we must seek assistance from other sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The legislative history of \u00a7 707-702(2) is of no assistance, and we must look to the history of the offense of manslaughter generally and under Hawaii law,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and to materials construing the pertinent provision of the Model Penal Code (MPC), upon which our penal code, HRS Title 37, is based.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">HISTORY OF THE MITIGATING FACTOR IN MANSLAUGHTER</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">The principle that the presence of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance will reduce the offense of murder to manslaughter is a modification of the ancient distinction between slaying in cold blood and slaying in the heat of passion existing in Anglo-Saxon criminal law prior to the Norman conquest of 1066.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The \u201cDoctrine of Provocation\u201d became firmly established in the common law in 1628 and the distinction between murder and manslaughter turned on the presence of heat of passion caused by adequate provocation. Donovan and Wildman, <em>Is the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number><em>Reasonable Man Obsolete? A Critical Perspective on Self-Defense and Provocation, </em>14 Loyola L. Rev. 435, 440 and 446 (1981) (hereafter <em>Donovan and Wildman).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">In the United States mutual combat, assault and adultery were gradually recognized as having been legally adequate provocation at common law to reduce murder to manslaughter. In some jurisdictions illegal arrest, injuries to third parties, and even words tending to give rise to heat of passion are sufficient provocation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Donovan and Wildman, supra, </em>at 446-447.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The determination of the adequacy of the provocation gradually became a jury prerogative in marginal cases, and the reasonable person test was devised to assist the jury. <em>Id. </em>at 447-48. Today the test has four elements: (1) provocation that would rouse a reasonable person to the heat of passion; (2) actual provocation of the defendant; (3) a reasonable person would not have cooled off in the time between the provocation and the offense; and (4) the defendant did not cool off. <em>Id. </em>at 448. <em>See also People v. Casassa, </em>49 N.Y.2d 668, 427 N.Y.S.2d 769, 404 N.E.2d 1310, <em>cert denied, </em>449 U.S. 842, 101 S.Ct. 122, 66 L.Ed.2d 50 (1980). The reasonable person yardstick is strictly objective; neither the mental nor physical peculiarities of the accused are evaluated in determining whether the loss of self-control was \u201creasonable.\u201d <em>Donovan and Wildman, supra, </em>at 448-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">CRITICISM OF THE \u201cREASONABLE PERSON\u201d TEST</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">As originally developed the provocation defense focused on the mental state of the accused as the test for moral culpability; however, under the objective or \u201creasonable person\u201d test the individual\u2019s mental state is not the determinative factor. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ott, </em>297 Or. 375, 381, 686 P.2d 1001, 1005 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Some commentators have remarked on the inconsistency of the reasonable person test.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">The reasonable man test, being objective in nature, is antithetical to the concept of mens rea. Like all objective standards, it is an external standard of general application that does not focus on an individual accused\u2019s mental state. Thus, from the point of view of traditional Anglo-American jurisprudence, a paradox is inherent in the use of the reasonable man standard to test criminal responsibility: the presence or absence of criminal intent is determined by a standard which ignores the mental state of the individual accused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEV\"><em>Donovan and Wildman, supra, </em>at 451 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">The objective test placed the jury in the conceptually awkward, almost impossible, position of having to determine when it is reasonable for a reasonable person to act unreasonably. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ott, </em>297 Or. at 381-84, 686 P.2d at 1005-06; <em>see also </em>Ingber, <em>A Dialectic: The Fulfillment and Decrease of Passion in Criminal Law, </em>28 Rutgers L. Rev. 861, 947 (1975).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-8\">In the law of contract and tort, and elsewhere in the criminal law, the test of the reasonable man indicates an ethical standard; but it seems absurd to say that the reasonable man will commit a felony the possible punishment for which is imprisonment for life. To say that the \u201cordinary\u201d man will commit this felony is hardly less absurd. The reason why provoked homicide is punished is to deter people from committing the offence; and it is a curious confession of failure on the part of the law to suppose that, notwithstanding the possibility of heavy punishment, an ordinary person will commit it. If the assertion were correct, it would raise serious doubts whether the offence should continue to be punished.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-9\">Surely the true view of provocation is that it is a concession to \u201cthe frailty of human nature\u201d in those exceptional cases where the legal prohibition fails of effect. It is a compromise, neither conceding the propriety of the act nor exacting the full penalty for it. This being so, how can it be that that paragon of virtue, the reasonable man, gives way to provocation?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">Williams, <em>Provocation and the Reasonable Man, </em>1954 Crim. L. Rev. 740, 742.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">The MPC\u2019s response to this criticism is discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>HAWAII LAW PRIOR TO THE PENAL CODE</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Prior to the effective date of the Hawaii Penal Code (HPC) in 1973, Hawaii statutorily defined manslaughter as any killing \u201cwithout malice aforethought, and without authority, justification, or extenuation.\u201d HRS \u00a7 748-6 (1968). <em>See Commentary on </em>\u00a7 <em>707-702 </em>(1976) (hereafter <em>Commentary). </em>Hawaii case law at that time adhered to the historical common-law principle of reducing murder in the first or second degree to manslaughter when mitigating mental or emotional disturbances were present. Hawaii case law employed the concept of \u201cheat of passion,\u201d <em>The King v. Greenwell, </em>1 Haw. 146 (1853), and recognized a more general approach, acknowledging extenuations attributable to individual mental and emotional weakness under the circumstances. <em>See Commentary, supra. See also The King </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>1 Haw. 150 (1853); <em>Greenwell, supra. </em>However, the latter, more liberal approach, was limited by the additional requirement that the killing be without malice and that the assailant had been provoked by the victim. <em>Commentary, supra; Greenwell, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">HRS \u00a7 707-702(2)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Under H RS \u00a7 707-702(2), the two principal elements of the extenuating factor are established: (1) extreme mental or emotional disturbance and (2) an objective / subjective test of the reasonableness of the explanation for the disturbance. However, the nature of those elements are not clear from the language of the statute, and neither the <em>Commentary </em>nor the legislative history indicates what considerations go into making up those elements. See Sen. Conf. Comm. Rep. Nos. 1 and 2, in 1972 Senate Journal at 734-46; Sen. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 599, in 1971 Senate Journal at 1067; Judicial Council of Hawaii, Penal Law Revision Project, <em>Hawaii Penal Code </em>(Proposed Draft) \u00a7 702 at 180 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">Since HRS \u00a7 707-702(2) is derived from MPC \u00a7 210.3,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we may look <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>to the commentaries and cases from other jurisdictions explaining and construing that section for insight into the meaning of the language of our statute. <em>See Witherspoon </em>v. <em>Salm, </em>251 Ind. 575, 579, 243 N.E.2d 876, 878 (1969); 73 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Statutes </em>\u00a7 166 (1974). We will examine the first element of \u00a7 707-702 first.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">\u201cExtreme mental or emotional disturbance\u201d sometimes is, but should not be, confused with the \u201cinsanity\u201d defense. The point of the extreme emotional disturbance defense is to provide a basis for mitigation that differs from a finding of mental defect or disease precluding criminal responsibility. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ott, </em>297 Or. at 391, 686 P.2d at 1011. The disturbance was meant to be understood in relative terms as referring to a loss of self-control due to intense feelings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">The extreme mental or emotional disturbance concept of the MPC must also be distinguished from the so-called \u201cdiminished capacity\u201d defense.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-9\">The doctrine of diminished capacity provides that evidence of an abnormal mental condition not amounting to legal insanity but tending to prove that the defendant could not or did not entertain the specific intent or state of mind essential to the offense should be considered for the purpose of determining whether the crime charged or a lesser degree thereof was in fact committed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-10\"><em>State </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>67 Haw. 471, __, 691 P.2d 1166, 1168 (1984).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-11\">Although the MPC does <em>not </em>recognize diminished capacity as a distinct category of mitigation, II Model Penal Code and Commentaries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>\u00a7 210.3 at 72 (Official Draft and Revised Comments 1980) [hereafter cited as 1980 MPC Commentary], by placing more emphasis than does the common law on the actor\u2019s subjective mental state, it also may allow inquiry into areas which have traditionally been treated as part of the law of diminished responsibility or the insanity defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Thus, the MPC is said to have in fact adopted an expanded concept of diminished capacity to reduce murder to manslaughter. <em>People </em>v. <em>Spurlin, </em>156 Cal. App. 3d 119, 127 n.4, 202 Cal. Rptr. 663, 668 n.4 (1984).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">Diminished capacity involves a mental disturbance which peculiarly involves the killer. Heat of passion is a concession to human weakness, to a universal human condition. <em>Diminished capacity is an effort to reduce punishment because the actor is not like all humans, whereas heat of passion reduces punishment because the actor is, unfortunately, \u00a1ike most humans. </em>[Footnotes omitted and emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">Dressler, <em>Rethinking Heat of Passion: A defense in Search of a Rationale, </em>73 J. Crim. L. and Criminology 421, 459-60 (1982) (hereafter <em>Dressier).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">The MPC merges the two concepts of heat of passion and diminished capacity.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-9\">It is enough if the killing occurs while the defendant\u2019s capacity to form an intent to murder is diminished by an extreme mental or emotional <em>disturbance </em>deemed to have a reasonable explanation or excuse from the defendant\u2019s standpoint. [Emphasis included.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Afa\">\n<em>Spurlin, supra.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">An explanation of the term \u201cextreme emotional disturbance\u201d which reflects the situational or relative character of the concept was given in <em>People v. Shelton, </em>88 Misc.2d 136, 149, 385 N.Y.S.2d 708, 717 (1976), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-11\">[T]hat extreme emotional disturbance is the emotional state of an individual, who: (a) has no mental disease or defect that rises to the level established by Section 30.05 of the Penal Law;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and (b) is exposed to an extremely unusual and overwhelming stress; and (c) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>has an extreme emotional reaction to it, as a result of which there is a loss of self-control and reason is overborne by intense feelings, such as passion, anger, distress, grief, excessive agitation or other similar emotions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> [Footnotes added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">It is clear that in adopting the \u201cextreme mental or emotional disturbance\u201d concept, the MPC intended to define the provocation element of manslaughter in broader terms than had previously been done. It is equally clear that our legislature also intended the same result when it adopted the language of the MPC.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">We turn then to the second prong of our analysis, the test to determine the reasonableness of the explanation for the mental or emotional disturbance. It is here that the most significant change has been made in the law of manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The anomaly of the reasonable person test was corrected by the drafters of the MPC through the development of an objective/subjective test of reasonableness. <em>See </em>1980 MPC Commentary, <em>supra. Dressler, supra, </em>at 431, explains that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-6\">it makes the test more, although not entirely, subjective, by requiring the jury to test the reasonableness of the actor\u2019s conduct, \u201cfrom the viewpoint of a person in the actor\u2019s situation.\u201d Thus, the actor\u2019s sex, sexual preference, pregnancy, physical deformities, and similar characteristics are apt to be taken into consideration in evaluating the reasonableness of the defendant\u2019s behavior. (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">This more subjective version of the provocation defense goes substantially beyond the common law by abandoning preconceptions of what constitutes adequate provocation, and giving the jury wider scope. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">Under the prior law of provocation, personal characteristics of the defendant were not to be considered. U nder the M PC a change from the old provocation law and the reasonable person standard has been effected by requiring the factfinder to focus on a person in the defendant\u2019s situation. Thus, the MPC, while requiring that the explanation for the disturbance must be reasonable, provides that the reasonableness is determined from the defendant\u2019s viewpoint. The phrase \u201cactor\u2019s situation,\u201d as used in \u00a7 210.3(b) of the MPC, is designedly ambiguous and is plainly flexible enough to allow the law to grow in the direction of taking account of mental abnormalities that have been recognized in the developing law of diminished responsibility. 1980 MPC Commentary, <em>supra, </em>at 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">Moreover, the MPC does not require the provocation to emanate from the victim as was argued by the State here. <em>Spurlin, </em>156 Cal. App. 3d at 127 n.4, 202 Cal. Rptr. at 668 n.4; 1980 MPC <em>Commentary, supra, </em>at 60-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">In light of the foregoing discussion and the necessity of articulating the defense in comprehensible terms, we adopt the test enunciated by the New York Court of Appeals in <em>People </em>v. <em>Casassa, </em>49 N.Y.2d 668, 427 N.Y.S.2d 769, 775, 404 N.E.2d 1310, 1316, <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 842, 101 S.Ct. 122, 66 L.Ed.2d 50 (1980):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-11\">[W]e conclude that the determination whether there was reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>explanation or excuse for a particular emotional disturbance should be made by viewing the subjective, internal situation in which the defendant found himself and the external circumstances as he perceived them at the time, however inaccurate that perception may have been, and assessing from that standpoint whether the explanation ... for his emotional disturbance was reasonable, so as to entitle him to a reduction of the crime charged from murder , . to manslaughter .... [Footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">The language of HRS \u00a7 707-702(2) indicates that the legislature intended to effect the same change in the test for manslaughter in Hawaii\u2019s law as was made by the MPC. Therefore, we hold that under HRS \u00a7 707-702(2) the broader sweep of the emotional disturbance defense applies when considering whether an offense should be reduced from murder to manslaughter. To hold that the pre-penal code law of provocation continues to hold sway would be to render the language of \u00a7 707-702(2) meaningless. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>59 Haw. 456, 460-62, 583 P.2d 337, 341 (1978); <em>see </em>HRS \u00a7 701-104 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">Thus, we hold in the instant case that the trial court was required to instruct the jury as requested by Dumlao, if there was any evidence to support a finding that at the time of the offense he suffered an \u201cextreme mental or emotional disturbance\u201d for which there was a \u201creasonable explanation\u201d when the totality of circumstances was judged from his personal viewpoint.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">We turn now to the question of whether there was evidence to support the proffered instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">In the instant case, there was evidence of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b204-12\">Arthur Golden, M.D., Dumlao\u2019s expert witness, stated at trial that his diagnosis of Dumlao was one of \u201cparanoid personality disorder,\u201d which is a \u201clong range, almost lifetime or certainly over many, many years, emotional or mental disorder. It is almost a way of functioning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"As3\">Dr. Golden diagnosed Dumlao as having unwarranted suspiciousness, one of the basic indicators of the \u201cparanoid personality disorder.\u201d That unwarranted suspiciousness included pathologicaljealousy, which Dumlao suffered throughout his ten-year marriage. Dumlao harbored the belief that other males, including his wife\u2019s relatives, were somehow sexually involved with her. He could never figure out exactly who or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>where or how, yet this extreme suspiciousness persisted.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Dr. Golden described the second major sign of Dumlao\u2019s paranoid personality disorder as hypersensitivity, characterized by being easily slighted or quick to take offense, and a readiness to counterattack when a threat was perceived. For example, when somebody glanced or gazed at his wife, he would consider it a personal affront and could well believe that a sexual overture had been made to her. Dr. Golden believed that at the time of the offense Dumlao felt the need to counterattack because Dumlao perceived a very substantial threat. Dr. Golden stated that \u201c[pjerhaps an ordinary individual in his situation would not have. He did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Dr. Golden gave other examples from Dumlao\u2019s history, illustrating his extreme and irrational reactions to outwardly normal events.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Dr. Golden\u2019s observations were supported by the testimony of the State\u2019s witnesses Eduardo, Agapito and Pedrito Reyes, his brothers-in-law, as well as Florentina, his wife, and Gaudencio Dumlao, his father. For example, according to Florentina, during their entire marriage Dumlao\u2019s extreme jealousy had caused him to beat and kick her, throw a knife at her, threaten her with his gun. He threatened on numerous occasions to beat or kill her. Dumlao accused her of having sexual relations with her brothers. Moreover, he would get angry for no more reason than that she might be behind some man in the checkout line at the store, and Dumlao would conclude that she was \u201ctalking to him or whatever, like that\u201d and become jealous.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">Dumlao\u2019s extreme and irrational jealousy concerning his wife was known to all the family members. According to Agapito, they couldn\u2019t even talk to their sister in Dumlao\u2019s presence. \u201cIf we have to talk to her, we have to talk from a distance because he suspects us.\u201d Furthermore, Dumlao \u201cnever allowed us to talk in a group.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">Dumlao\u2019s testimony, describing his own perceptions of the night in question, further confirms the nature of his extreme jealousy. Dumlao described how he became suspicious and jealous of his wife that night because of the way that Agapito looked at him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-10\">A. I had this feeling that something going to happen when I leave because the action that I seen \u2014 Agapito.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-11\">Q.

She got up so I lay down \u2014 1 laid down on the bedroom so 1 \u2014 1 kick or push her on the side over there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-20\">Dumlao went on to describe how, after his father had counseled him and he went back in the room, he could hear the voices of the others talking in the living room.

However, Dumlao was entitled to have the jury make that decision using the objective/ subjective test.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">The fact that the other witnesses contradicted his testimony concerning an attack by Pedrito, and that his testimony that he was only trying to scare Pedrito does not comport with the manslaughter defense, does not detract from Dumlao\u2019s right to the instruction based on the above evidence. Dumlao was entitled to an instruction on every theory of defense shown by the evidence. <em>See State </em>v. <em>O\u2019Daniel, supra. </em>It was the jury\u2019s province to determine the weight and credibility of that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Reversed and remanded for new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b194-16\">Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 707-701(1) (1976) defines murder as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuV\">Murder.

They are material because they bear upon the inference as to the actor\u2019s character that it is fair to draw upon the basis of his act.
