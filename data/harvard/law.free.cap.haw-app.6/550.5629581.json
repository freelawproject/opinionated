Ibsen (Defendant) for the offense of driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor (DUI). Claiming that the person who took the blood specimen from him was unqualified, Defendant contends that the court erred in failing to suppress the blood test result.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree and vacate the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-11\">On March 9, 1986, Defendant was involved in a two-car accident. The police officer investigating the accident arrested him for a DUI offense. Since he elected to take a blood test rather than a breath test, Defendant was taken to the Wilcox Memorial Hospital. There, Wendy Hashizume (Hashizume) withdrew blood from Defendant for the alcohol blood test. Subsequently, a chemical test performed by Dr. Quentin Belles disclosed 0.151 per cent by weight of alcohol in Defendant\u2019s blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-12\">At the commencement of the bench trial on April 18, 1986, Defendant orally moved to suppress the blood test result.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Based on Hashizume\u2019s testimony that she had graduated in 1984 from the University of Hawaii with a Bachelor of Science degree in medical technology, was certified by the American Society of Clinical Pathologists as a medical technologist, and had been working at the Wilcox Memorial Hospital since August 1985, the district court found her to be a qualified \u201cclinical laboratory technologist.\u201d The court denied Defendant\u2019s motion to suppress and subsequently found him guilty of the DUI offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-13\">Section 11-111-5(d) of Chapter 111 of Title 11 of the Hawaii Admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>istrative Rules (Rules)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provides in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-6\">Blood samples shall be collected from living individuals within three hours of an alleged offense <em>only by a person authorized by law, </em>namely a physician, registered nurse or clinical laboratory technologist. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Although the district court found that Hashizume was \u201ca clinical laboratory technologist,\u201d we conclude that the record fails to disclose that she was \u201ca person authorized by law\u201d to collect blood from Defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">The State correctly alleges the Rules do not define \u201cclinical laboratory technologist.\u201d The State proceeds to Chapter 30 of the Public Health Regulations for the definition and qualifications of \u201cclinical laboratory technologist.\u201d Arguing that Hashizume met the qualifications set forth in section 8-Dl(a)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of Chapter 30, the State then asserts Hashizume was qualified to collect Defendant\u2019s blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">The State\u2019s argument conveniently ignores a vital requirement of \u00a7 11-11 l-5(d) of the Rules. Under the section, only persons <em>authorized by law </em>are qualified to collect blood. The law, namely, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 286-152 (1976)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-10\">Persons qualified to take blood specimen. No person other than a physician, licensed laboratory technician, or registered nurse may withdraw blood for the purpose of determining the alcoholic content therein. This limitation shall not apply to the taking of a breath specimen.</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"Ay-f\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number><em>Arthur K. Trask, Jr. </em>for defendant-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Au1\"><em>Peter M. Morimoto, </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, for plaintiffappellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">HRS \u00a7 286-152 clearly requires the laboratory technician to be licensed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AK1\">Here, there is no evidence in the record that Hashizume was licensed by the Department of Health as a clinical laboratory technologist or a laboratory technician. Therefore, based on the evidence, since she was unqualified to withdraw blood from Defendant, the district court should have suppressed the blood test result. <em>State </em>v. <em>Nakahara, </em>5 Haw. App. 575, 704 P.2d 927 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Judgment vacated and case remanded for retrial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b571-14\">Disposition of this case does not require our consideration of other points raised on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b571-15\">The motion to suppress was based on two grounds: (1) there was no probable cause for the arrest of Defendant; and (2) the taking of his blood and the procedures that were followed were not in strict compliance with the Department of Health regulations, Chapter 111 of Title 11 of the Hawaii Administrative Rules (Rules).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b572-11\">Chapter 111 of Title 11 of the Hawaii Administrative Rules was formerly contained in Chapter 47 of the Public Health Regulations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b572-13\">Section 8-Dl(a) of Chapter 30 of the Public Health Regulations states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-14\">1.
