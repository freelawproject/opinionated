Chaney, Inc. (Chaney) (collectively Appellees). The appeal raises the following questions of first impression:</p>\n<p id=\"b376-18\">1. Whether a condominium owners association and its managing agent have a duty to protect condominium owners and their guests from foreseeable criminal acts committed by third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-19\">2. Whether in a negligence action against a condominium owners association and its managing agent for criminal acts of third parties, the plaintiff may establish foreseeability by evidence other than prior similar criminal incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>We answer yes to both questions and reverse the summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The Association is an unincorporated association of apartment owners in the 1260 Richard Lane condominium project (Project).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Chaney is a Hawaii corporation hired by the Association as its managing agent. The Dukesherers are the owners of apartment 506A in the Project.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">The evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to Appellants, as we must in reviewing a summary judgment, <em>Fernandes </em>v. <em>Tenbruggencate, </em>65 Haw. 226, 649 P.2d 1144 (1982); <em>Silver v. George, </em>64 Haw. 503, 644 P.2d 955 (1982); <em>Kang </em>v. <em>Charles Pankow Associates, </em>5 Haw. App. 1, 675 P.2d 803 (1984), reveals the following facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">The Moodys came to Hawaii from California to attend the wedding of their daughter Jane to John Dukesherer. On the evening of May 19, 1979, the Moodys were alone in apartment 506A since the Dukesherers had departed on their honeymoon. Before retiring Jacqueline locked the front door of the apartment. During the early morning hours of May 20, 1979, two unidentified males entered the apartment through the front door. To get to the apartment, the males had to use either the elevators or the stairways, which were common areas and under the control of the Association. The exact method of entry into the apartment is unknown; however, no signs of forced entry were evident.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The males assaulted and robbed the Moodys. Jacqueline was raped and sodomized. Russell was shot. The assailants fled and were never apprehended.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">On September 17, 1980, Appellants filed a complaint against the Association, Chaney, and several other defendants.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The complaint alleged that Appellees \u201cwere negligent in the maintenance and manage<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>ment\u201d of the Project and were \u201calso responsible for the failure of the security system installed therein.\u201d Appellants prayed for special and general damages,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> costs, and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">On June 28,1983, the trial court entered its order granting Appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment and expressly directing the entry of judgment under Rule 54(b), Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (1981). On May 2, 1984, a judgment was filed pursuant to the June 28, 1983 order. Appellants\u2019 timely appeal followed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">\u201cA fundamental requirement of a negligence action is the existence of a duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Namauu </em>v. <em>City &amp; County, </em>62 Haw. 358, 361, 614 P.2d 943, 945 (1980). <em>See also First Insurance Co. of Hawaii, Ltd. </em>v. <em>International Harvester Co., </em>66 Haw. 185, 659 P.2d 64 (1983); <em>Ono </em>v. <em>Applegate, </em>62 Haw. 131, 612 P.2d 533 (1980). The existence of such a duty is \u201centirely a question of law.\u201d <em>Bidar v. Amfac, Inc., </em>66 Haw. 547, 552, 669 P.2d 154, 158 (1983). <em>See also Kelley </em>v. <em>Kokua Sales &amp; Supply, Ltd., </em>56 Haw. 204, 532 P.2d 673 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">Relying on <em>King </em>v. <em>Ilikai Properties, Inc., 2 </em>Haw. App. 359, 632 P.2d 657 (1981), and the principles stated in Restatement (Second) of Torts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 314A, 315 (1965),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Appellees argue that they had no duty to protect Appellants from criminal acts of third parties because there was no \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between Appellees and Appellants.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Appellees therefore assert that they were entitled to a summary judgment as a matter of law. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">If the four special relationships specified in \u00a7 314A \u2014 common carrier-passenger, inkeeper-guest, landowner-invitee, and custodian-ward \u2014 were intended to be exclusive, Appellees\u2019 assertion may be correct. However, the drafters of the Restatement commented that the relations listed in \u00a7 314A \u201care not intended to be exclusive, and are not necessarily the only ones in which a duty of affirmative action for the aid or protection of another may be found.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 314A, comment b. Moreover, the drafters expressed their view that the \u201claw appears . . to be working slowly toward a recognition of the duty to aid or protect in any relation of dependence or of mutual dependence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>The realities of modern day apartment living have induced some courts to view \u201cthe landlord-tenant relationship as a \u2018special\u2019 one that justifies imposing a duty on the landlord to provide some protection against criminal acts.\u201d Comment, <em>California Landlords' Duty to Protect Tenants from Criminals, </em>20 San Diego L. Rev. 859, 865 (1983). However, the courts have not held that \u201cthe landlord is by any means an insurer of the safety of his tenants.\u201d <em>Kline </em>v. <em>1500 Massachusetts Avenue Apartment Corp., </em>439 F.2d 477, 487 (D.C. Cir. 1970). The duty imposed on the landlord \u201cis only one to exercise <em>reasonable care under the </em>circumstances.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 314A, comment e (emphasis added). The landlord is free of liability \u201cwhere he neither knows nor should know of the unreasonable risk,\u201d and \u201cis not required to take any action where the risk does not appear to be an unreasonable one[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, the landlord need not \u201ctake any action until he knows or has reason to know that the plaintiff is endangered[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>comment f.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Basically, the landlord\u2019s duty to act arises after he has received notice, actual or constructive, of criminal activity either on his premises or in the immediate vicinity thereof.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See Kline, supra; Totten </em>v. <em>More Oakland Residential Housing, Inc., </em>63 Cal. App. 3d 538, 134 Cal. Rptr. 29 (1977); <em>Scott v. Watson, </em>278 Md. 160, 359 A.2d 548 (1976). The crucial question is that of foreseeability \u2014 whether under the facts the third parties\u2019 criminal act was a foreseeable risk against which the landlord was obligated to protect the tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>We believe that in the area of the landlord-tenant relationship, the landlord has the duty to protect the tenant from foreseeable criminal acts of third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The question then is whether a condominium owners association and its managing agent have a similar duty as a landlord to protect resident condominium owners from foreseeable criminal acts of third parties. We hold that they do.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">In our view, the condominium owners association-residential condominium owner relationship is analogous to that of the landlord-tenant relationship. <em>See O'Connor </em>v. <em>Village Green Owners Ass\u2019n, </em>33 Cal. 3d 790, 662 P.2d 427, 191 Cal. Rptr. 320 (1983). <em>Cf. Pratt </em>v. <em>Maryland Farms Condominium Phase 1, </em>42 Md. App. 632, 402 A.2d 105 (1979) (implicit analogy between landlord and condominium corporation in negligence action). When a condominium owners association \u201cperforms all the customary business functions which in the traditional landlord-tenant relationship rest on the landlord\u2019s shoulders[,]\u201d such as managing the project, maintaining and repairing the common areas, providing security, and obtaining insurance, <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>33 Cal. 3d at 796, 662 P.2d at 431, 191 Cal. Rptr. at 324, the courts impose on the association the same duty of care as a landlord. <em>Compare Kline, </em>439 F.2d at 481 (duty placed on landlord to take steps to minimize \u201cpredictable risk\u201d to his tenants of criminal assault on the portion of the premises exclusively within his control) <em>with White </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>17 Cal. App. 3d 824, 830-31, 95 Cal. Rptr. 259, 262-63 (1971) (condominium association may be sued for negligence by an association member, since the association was responsible for the common areas and the member had no effective control of the association\u2019s management body). The underlying reasoning for the imposition of the duty on the association is that it is the only one in a position to maintain and secure the common areas which are under its exclusive control. <em>White, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">Here, the Association employed Chaney, a property management firm. Chaney\u2019s responsibilities included the inspection and maintenance of the buildings and common areas of the Project and maintenance of the Project\u2019s security. As required by Hawaii Revised Statutes \u00a7 514A-86 (Supp. 1984), the Association maintained insurance coverage for the Project. Clearly, the Association performed all the customary business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>functions generally assumed by a landlord and, consequently, subjected itself to a duty of protecting resident condominium owners from foreseeable criminal acts of third parties.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Chaney, in turn, is subject to the same duty imposed on the Association.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> When a property management firm acts on behalf of and subject to the control of the condominium owners association, the firm is deemed an agent of the association. <em>See Ireland </em>v. <em>Wynkoop, </em>36 Colo. App. 205, 539 P.2d 1349 (1975). As an agent in control of the premises, a property management firm is under the same duty as the association to keep the premises under its control in a safe condition. <em>See Bryant </em>v. <em>Sherm\u2019s Thunderbird Market, </em>268 Or. 591, 522 P.2d 1383 (1974); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Henger, </em>148 Tex. 456, 226 S.W.2d 425 (1950); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 383 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">The question left is whether the Association and Chaney owed a similar duty to the Moodys, who were not residential condominium owners, but guests of such owners. We answer yes. Since it is reasonable to anticipate that guests of residential condominium owners will be upon the Project premises, we see no reason why the same duty of care should not be extended to them. In this jurisdiction, we no longer recognize the common law status of the person on the premises\u2014 whether he is a licensee or invitee \u2014 as determinative of the duty of the owner of the premises. The crucial fact is whether that person was reasonably anticipated to be upon the premises. <em>Gibo </em>v. <em>City &amp; County, </em>51 Haw. 299, 459 P.2d 198 (1969); <em>Pickard </em>v. <em>City &amp; County, </em>51 Haw. 134, 452 P.2d 445 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">In <em>King </em>v. <em>Ilikai Properties, Inc., supra, </em>this court held that there was no \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between the condominium owners association and the plaintiffs. Appellees claim that that holding is dispositive here. We do not agree. The facts in <em>King </em>are different from those in this case. In <em>King, </em>the assault occurred in a private condominium apartment located in a building which was operated as a hotel, the plaintiffs were a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>tenant of the condominium apartment owner and the tenant\u2019s guest, and the defendants were the corporate hotel operator, the condominium owners association, and the apartment owner. Here, the plaintiffs are the condominium apartment owners and their guests and the defendants are the Association and its managing agent. Unlike <em>King, </em>here the only parties having full control of the common areas and sole responsibility for the Project security are the Association and its managing agent. A relationship of \u201cmutual dependence,\u201d absent in <em>King, </em>is therefore evident here. <em>See </em>II.A., <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">If a condominium owners association or its managing agent has knowledge of criminal activities on its project premises or in the immediate neighborhood, the association has a duty to take reasonable measures, in view of the existing circumstances, to protect residential condominium owners from criminal acts of third parties. Whether Appellees had knowledge of criminal activities and therefore whether the criminal attack on the Moodys was reasonably foreseeable by them are issues of material fact generally not subject to summary adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Appellees contend that neither of them had notice of any prior violent criminal acts on the Project premises. They claim that \u201c[i]n the absence of prior similar violent crimes, the risk of criminal assault is pure speculation and, as a matter of law, not reasonably foreseeable.\u201d We are thus urged to adopt what has been characterized as the \u201cprior similar incidents\u201d rule in <em>Isaacs </em>v. <em>Huntington Memorial Hospital, </em>38 Cal. 3d 112, 695 P.2d 653, 211 Cal. Rptr. 356 (1985). Jurisdictions which have adopted this rule hold that in the absence of prior similar incidents, an occupier of land is not bound to anticipate the criminal acts of third parties, especially where the assailant was a complete stranger to both the occupier and the victim and where the criminal act resulting in the injury came about precipitously. <em>Relyea </em>v. <em>State, </em>385 So. 2d 1378 (Fla. App. 1980); <em>Rosensteil </em>v. <em>Lisdas, </em>253 Or. 625, 456 P.2d 61 (1969); <em>Shipes </em>v. <em>Piggly Wiggly St. Andrews, Inc., </em>269 S.C. 479, 238 S.E.2d 167 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">The \u201cprior similar incidents\u201d rule has been the subject of increased criticism because it is fatally flawed in numerous respects. These flaws were succinctly summarized by the California Supreme Court in <em>Isaacs </em>v. <em>Huntington Memorial Hosp., supra, </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>First, the rule leads to results which are contrary to public policy. The rule has the effect of discouraging landowners from taking adequate measures to protect premises which they know are dangerous. This result contravenes the policy of preventing future harm. Moreover, under the rule, the first victim always loses, while subsequent victims are permitted recovery. Such a result is not only unfair, but is inimical to the important policy of compensating injured parties. Surely, a landowner should not get one free assault before he can be held liable for criminal acts which occur on his property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-6\">Second, a rule which limits evidence of foreseeability to prior similar criminal acts leads to arbitrary results and distinctions. Under this rule, there is uncertainty as to how \u201csimilar\u201d the prior incidents must be to satisfy the rule. The rule raises a number of other troubling questions. For example, how close in time do the prior incidents have to be? How near in location must they be? The rule invites different courts to enunciate different standards of foreseeability based on their resolution of these questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-7\">Third, the rule erroneously equates foreseeability of a particular act with previous occurrences of similar acts. This court has already rejected that notion. \u201c \u2018The mere fact that a particular kind of an accident has not happened before does not . . . show that such accident is one which might not reasonably have been anticipated.\u2019 [Citation.] Thus, the fortuitous absence of prior injury does not justify relieving defendant from responsibility for the foreseeable consequences of its acts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-8\">Finally, the \u201cprior similar incidents\u201d rule improperly removes too many cases from the jury\u2019s consideration. It is well established that foreseeability is ordinarily a question of fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-9\"><em>Isaacs, </em>38 Cal. 3d at 125-26, 695 P.2d at 658-59, 211 Cal. Rptr. at 361-62 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">Based on the sound reasoning set forth in <em>Isaacs, </em>we reject the \u201cprior similar incidents\u201d rule as \u201cthe\u201d basis for establishing foreseeability of criminal assault. We find no logic in a rule of law which allows an occupier of land one free assault before liability may be imposed. <em>See Paterson </em>v. <em>Deeb, 472 </em>So.2d 1210 (Fla. App. 1985). Evidence of prior similar incidents is not the <em>sine qua non </em>to a finding of foreseeability. <em>Kwaitkowski </em>v. <em>Superior Trading Co., </em>123 Cal. App. 3d 324, 176 Cal. Rptr. 494 (1981). <em>Cf. Farrior </em>v. <em>Payton, </em>57 Haw. 620, 562 P.2d 779 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>(1977) (scienter of \u201cvicious propensities\u201d and \u201cdangerous propensities\u201d of a dog). While proof of prior similar incidents is probative of foreseeability, such proof is not the prerequisite, and its absence does not foreclose a finding of foreseeability. <em>Paterson, supra, </em>at 1215. Rather, the touchstone of liability is foreseeability of criminal attack based on the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Isaacs, </em>38 Cal. 3d at 130, 695 P.2d at 661, 211 Cal. Rptr. at 364. Foreseeability must be analyzed in light of all the circumstances on a case by case approach.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-5\">(0)ther types of evidence may also establish foreseeability, such as the nature, condition and location of the defendant\u2019s premises. ... \u2018[W]hat is required to be foreseeable is the general character of the event or harm . . . not its precise nature or manner of occurrence.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-9\"><em>Id. See also Bigbee </em>v. <em>Pacific Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>34 Cal. 3d 49, 665 P.2d 947, 192 Cal. Rptr. 857 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">The totality of the circumstances in this case suggests not only that the question regarding the foreseeability of the assault should have been the subject of a trial but also the question regarding whether Appellees acted reasonably under the circumstances at the time of the assault:</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">(1) Rafael Fajardo, a Honolulu Police Department detective, states in his affidavit that \u201c[djuring [his] ten years of work as a detective, there has consistently been.a high rate of crime in the Kalihi area, with particular reference to the crimes of burglary, theft and assault. ... The heaviest saturation of crime ... is in the immediate vicinity of Kuhio Park Terrace . . . which includes the project.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">(2) Roy Wayne Cook, Sr., an alleged expert by experience and education in the matter of security measures, states in his affidavit that in his opinion, based upon his knowledge, training and expertise, the locking system employed at the complex \u201cwas not an adequate security locking system for use in residential units.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-13\">(3) The deposition testimony of Al Kort, Appellees\u2019 representative, discloses that the security guard was to make his rounds by walking through the floors of the Project\u2019s two buildings and the perimeter of the Project every forty minutes. During the time of the assault, the guard should have passed by the Dukesherers\u2019 apartment \u201cat least\u201d twice. On the night of the assault the guard failed to complete his nightly report because he was in a \u201churry to get home.\u201d The guard\u2019s whereabouts at the time of the assault are in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-14\">(4) Louise Savea, resident manager, testified at her deposition that on a night prior to the assault on the Moodys one guard was caught <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>sleeping on duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">(5) Sesera Selu, the guard on duty, testified when deposed that on the night of the assault he heard a loud noise in the nature of a gun shot or hammer sound. However, contrary to training instructions, he failed to go inside the building to investigate the origin of the noise.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">(6) A President\u2019s Report, the annual report of the Board of Directors, states, \u201c[t]here were cases of unsolved rape, robbery and break-in in this project. <em>All of these related to security problems.\" </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">(7) The evidence in the record further indicates the occurrence of a prior burglary on the premises, acts of vandalism, repeated attempts by unknown parties to keep fire escape doors open,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and rumors of a master key floating around.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">We believe that based on the totality of these circumstances, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment. \u201c[J]ust as we may not rely upon our private judgment on this issue, so the trial court may not impose its private judgment upon a situation, such as this, in which reasonable minds may differ.\u201d <em>Schwartz </em>v. <em>Helms Bakery Limited, </em>67 Cal. 2d 232, 244, 430 P.2d 68, 76, 60 Cal. Rptr. 510, 518 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">We are reluctant to have questions of foreseeability resolved by summary judgment when an intervening act is involved. <em>See McKenna </em>v. <em>Volkswagenwerk, </em>57 Haw. 460, 558 P.2d 1018 (1977); <em>Leary </em>v. <em>Poole, </em>5 Haw. App. 596, 705 P.2d 62 (1985). Foreseeability \u201cmay be decided as a question of law only if, \u2018under the undisputed facts there is no room for a reasonable difference of opinion.\u2019\u201d <em>Isaacs, </em>38 Cal. 3d at 126, 695 P.2d at 659, 211 Cal. Rptr. at 362. We believe that the evidence in this case, when viewed in a light most favorable to the Appellants, is sufficient to raise genuine issues of material fact as to (1) whether the assault was foreseeable, and (2) whether Appellees, at the time of the assault, provided security in accordance with the standards required of a reasonable and prudent person under the same or similar circumstances. <em>See Gomez v. Ticor, </em>145 Cal. App. 3d 622, 193 Cal. Rptr. 600 (1983); <em>Walkoviak </em>v. <em>Hilton Hotels Corp., </em>580 S.W.2d 623 (Tex. Civ. App. 1979). Such issues are to be resolved by the trier of fact, and are not proper issues to be determined as a matter of law in a summary judgment proceeding.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AL6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number><em>Nathan J.

The Association employed a security guard on Mondays through Fridays from 11:30 p.m. to 7:30 the next morning and on Saturdays and Sundays from 4:00 p.m. to 8:00 the next morning. There is evidence that during the early morning hours of Sunday, May 20, 1979, its security guard was negligent. Having undertaken at the apartment owners\u2019 expense to provide the security service, the Association is liable if it performed negligently and its negligence was a substantial factor cause<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of damage to the Moodys.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">I disagree with the majority\u2019s interpretation of the <em>King </em>v. <em>Ilikai Properties, Inc. </em>case. In my view, the majority\u2019s opinion reverses this court\u2019s holding in that case. <em>See Wolsk </em>v. <em>State, </em>68 Haw. 302, 711 P.2d 1300 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">In <em>King, </em>all of the more than 1,000 apartments in the Uikai\u2019s Tower Building were condominium apartments. Many of the apartment owners leased their apartments to Ilikai Properties, Inc. (IPI), who rented them to its customers as hotel rooms. Others, such as Shigeta, leased them to tenants, such as King. Others resided in them.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">Thus, the only relevant difference between IPI and King was that IPI leased many apartments to rent to its customers as hotel rooms and King leased only one apartment for her own occupancy. Whatever security services IPI provided was as innkeeper to its hotel guests. IPI did not have any more responsibility for the security of non-hotel guests than did Shigeta or the other owners or lessees of the apartments not leased to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>IPI.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">This court held that neither Shigeta nor the Ilikai Association of Owners nor IPI owed any legal duty to King and her guest, Kelley, to protect them in King\u2019s apartment from the foreseeable criminal acts of third parties. If, as the majority holds in this case, a landlord owes such a duty to his tenant and his tenant\u2019s guests, then Shigeta owed such a duty to King and Kelley. If all condominium associations owe such a duty to the owners and lessees of the condominium apartments and their guests, then the Ilikai Association of Owners owed such a duty to Shigeta, King, and Kelley.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">I also disagree that all condominium associations have a legal duty to protect their apartment owners and persons reasonably anticipated to be on the premises from the harm caused on the premises by the foreseeable<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> criminal acts of third persons.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">The Dukesherers are the owners of Hale Kekoa condominium apartment A506. The Hale Kekoa condominium consists of two buildings. The makai or \u201cA\u201d building has five floors of apartments and 50 apartments. The mauka or \u201cB\u201d building has six floors of apartments and 114 apartments. The Dukesherers are also the owners of a .6% undivided interest in the Hale Kekoa\u2019s common elements which includes its limited common elements which includes one parking space per apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">The affairs of the Association are governed by a nine-member Board of Directors (Board). Three are elected each year for three-year terms. When voting for Board members, each apartment owner votes the amount of his, her, or its percentage interest in the Hale Kekoa\u2019s common elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">According to the Hale Kekoa\u2019s By-Laws, the Board is responsible, <em>inter alia, </em>for the \u201c[operation, care, upkeep and maintenance of the common elements.\u201d Nothing in Hawaii Revised Statutes chapter 514 (Hawaii\u2019s Horizontal Property Regime law) or in the Hale Kekoa condominium documents obligates the Association to provide security devices or services for the benefit of its apartment owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">In my view, the majority\u2019s decision imposes a legal duty which ought not be imposed except by the parties involved or by the legislature. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>There is scant evidence that condominium apartment owners and persons reasonably anticipated to be on the premises want or need such judicial intervention.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In my opinion, the imposition of the legal duty imposed by the majority\u2019s decision is not in the public interest.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">The only way condominium associations can realistically protect themselves against the liability of this duty is by installing state of the art security devices and improvements, employing reliable security personnel and services, and buying insurance. In my view, the majority\u2019s decision erroneously imposes these requirements on condominium buyers and owners who do not want or need the bother, the intrusiveness, or the additional expense that such devices, improvements, personnel, services, and insurance will cause them, their lessees, and their guests</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b387-12\"><em>See McKenna v. Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft, </em>57 Haw. 460, 558 P.2d 1018 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b388-12\">In this day and age when no one and no place is safe from the criminal acts of third persons, we may expect the foreseeability issue to be decided against the associations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b388-13\">I express no opinion on the same question with respect to landlords and tenants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b389-5\">When persons consider buying a condominium apartment, they can easily determine what kind, if any, of security devices, services, and improvements are needed and provided. if they are dissatisfied with the existing situation, they should not make the purchase. If after they purchase they think more or better devices, services, and improvements are necessary, then as voting members of the association they can attempt to convince the association\u2019s other voting members and board to have them provided. The cost of those items will be directly and immediately passed on to them and the other apartment owners in the form of special assessments or regular maintenance fees. They can also install additional security devices in their own apartment at their own expense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Logically, if all condominium associations have a legal duty to protect their apartment owners and persons reasonably anticipated to be on the premises from the harm caused on the premises by the foreseeable criminal (and noncriminal) acts of third persons, then architects and developers have a correlative duty to design and develop all condominium developments to facilitate associations in the fulfillment of their duty.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
