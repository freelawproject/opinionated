On June 25, 1984, the circuit court entered an \u201cAmended Decision Granting Partial Summary Judgment and Denying Defendants\u2019 Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment\u201d (Amended Decision). In effect, the Amended Decision (1) decreed that the State Department of Social Services and Housing (DSSH) could not disqualify adults and their children from medical and financial general assistance benefits because of the failure of one adult member of the assistance household to comply with the work requirements imposed by Hawaii Public Welfare Manual (HPWM) \u00a7 3113.08 (December 1978);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (2) ordered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>payment of wrongfully denied benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The Interim Director of DSSH who is now the Director (Director) and the State Medical Care Administrator (collectively \u201cdefendants\u201d) appealed the Amended Decision, and plaintiffs cross-appealed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">The consolidated actions are here on appeal for the second time. We dismissed the first appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction on grounds that the appeal was not from a \u201cfinal judgment.\u201d <em>Jacober </em>v. <em>Sunn, </em>5 Haw. App. 20, 674 P.2d 1024 (1984). In that opinion, we delineated the relevant facts up to the time of the first appeal. We incorporate those facts in this opinion by reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">Upon remand, pursuant to plaintiffs\u2019<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> motion to amend the original February 3, 1982 decision, the circuit court entered the Amended Decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">The Amended Decision redefined the class as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-10\"><em>Subclass A: </em>All residents of the State of Hawaii and members of their assistance households who have been denied medical assistance or money payments by the Department of Social Services and Housing due to a failure of a parent or person with legal responsibility for support to comply with the work requirements imposed by Hawaii Public Welfare Manual Section 3113.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-11\"><em>Subclass B: </em>All residents of the State of Hawaii who are minors, or who are under the age of 21, who have been denied medical assistance or money payments by the Department of Social Services and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Housing because a parent or person with legal responsibility for support failed to comply with the work requirements imposed by Hawaii Public Welfare Manual Section 3113.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">As to the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 claims, the Amended Decision ordered and decreed that from December 1978 through October 1982:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">1. All Hawaii residents, including unborn children, who were under the age of 21, who were financially eligible were entitled to receive medical assistance pursuant to the Hawaii State Plan for Medical Assistance under Title XIX of the Social Security Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">2. Defendants could not disqualify adults and their children from medical and/or financial General Assistance benefits based on the failure of another adult in the assistance household to comply with the work requirements of Section 346-71, H.R.S.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-8\">3. Provisions of H.P.W.M., Section 3113, which required the Defendants to disqualify adults and their children from medical and/or financial General Assistance benefits based on the failure of another adult in the assistance household to comply with the work requirements of the General Assistance program were invalid because such provisions were not authorized by Section 346-71, H.R.S.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-9\">4. The procedure section of H.P.W.M. Section 3404 was invalid as it was a rule as that term is defined by Section 91-1(4), H.R.S., which was not properly adopted pursuant to Section 91-3, H.R.S. Pursuant to provisions of H.P.W.M. 3404.3(a)(3)(c), the work requirements under Section 3113 did not apply to those applying for medical assistance only.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-10\">5. Plaintiffs and eligible members of the class shall be entitled to recover from Defendants retroactive benefits for medical expenses and financial benefits which should have been paid by Defendants but for the wrongful denial of the above-described assistance. Reimbursement for all payments of financial benefits and medical expenses shall commence from December 1978 and continue through October 1982.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-11\">6. Defendants shall reinstate members of assistance households who apply for retroactive General Assistance benefits if their benefits were reduced, terminated, denied, or not reinstated, pursuant to the invalid and inoperative rules. Such reinstatement shall be effective as of the date of the error, but in no event before December 1978, and such household members shall be reinstated to the General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Assistance benefit level and status which the members would have received, but for the rules declared unlawful in this Order. Such reinstatement shall remain in effect and retroactive benefits shall be awarded through the benefit month of October 1982, so long as the applicant or recipient remained eligible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-4\">7. Defendants may reduce or terminate the retroactive public assistance benefits awarded Plaintiffs and class members commencing in the benefit month after October 1982, based on the new rules which were properly promulgated as of October 20, 1982; provided, however, that the Defendants must provide each Plaintiff and class member a notice and opportunity to contest such proposed reductions and/or terminations, pursuant to H.R.S. Chapter 91.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-5\">8. Defendants shall, within four months of the date of entry of this Order, process all applications for reinstatement filed by Plaintiffs and class members and shall notify all applicants in writing as to the Defendants\u2019 decision on their application for retroactive benefits. All applicants for retroactive benefits shall also be advised of their right to contest an adverse determination by the Defendants on their claim through the contested case procedures specified by the Rules and Regulations of the Department of Social Services and Housing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">On August 15, 1984, the lower court authorized defendants to file an interlocutory appeal from the Amended Decision and this appeal and cross-appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">The issues raised by defendants\u2019 appeal and our answers are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">I. Whether in implementing H RS \u00a7 346-71 as it read after its amendment on May 23, 1978 DSSH was authorized to adopt rules which disqualified all members of the assistance unit (AU) from medical and/or financial general assistance (GA) program benefits if one or more of the members of the AU was disqualified. No.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">II. Whether plaintiffs are entitled to recover benefits allegedly denied them wrongfully by DSSH through October of 1982, when DSSH promulgated its rules authorized by and implementing the May 19, 1982 amendments to HRS \u00a7 346-71 (1978). Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">III. A. Whether defendants who are authorized to bring an action in the circuit court seeking a declaration that a certain agency rule is invalid may simultaneously seek the award of benefits allegedly denied them wrongfully. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>III.B. Whether plaintiffs\u2019 claims against DSSH for the award of benefits allegedly denied them wrongfully are barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. No.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The issue presented by plaintiffs\u2019 cross-appeal and our answer is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">IV. Whether plaintiffs are separately assured financial or medical GA program benefits from DSSH pursuant to HRS \u00a7\u00a7 346-55 and 346-53(c) (1976), irrespective of their disqualification under HPWM \u00a7 3113.08 (December 1978). No.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">\n<em>DEFENDANTS' APPEAL</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">Based on the plain and unambiguous language of HRS \u00a7 346-71 (1978), we hold that DSSH was not authorized to promulgate the disqualification provisions of HPWM \u00a7 3113 adopted by DSSH in December 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">When DSSH adopted HPWM \u00a7 3113 in December of 1978, HRS \u00a7 346-71 (1978) read in pertinent part as follows:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-11\">General assistance, (a) The department of social services and housing shall administer and provide public assistance to eligible persons who are disabled, or are at least 55 years of age, or have dependent children in the home not otherwise provided for under this chapter, and who are unable to provide sufficient support for themselves or those dependent upon them, provided that such persons are bona fide residents of this State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-12\">* * * *c *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-13\">(c) A person with child shall be eligible for general assistance if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-14\">(1) He is unemployed for reasons other than voluntary separation without good cause or for misconduct; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-15\">(2) He is actively and diligently seeking gainful employment; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-6\">(3) He has not refused to accept employment when offered; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-7\">(4) He has registered and is available for work as required by section 383-29; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-8\">(5) He has exhausted all of his benefits under chapter 383; provided, however, should the benefits of any person under chapter 383 be less than those for which he would otherwise be eligible hereunder, he shall be eligible for supplementary general assistance; and provided further, that this provision of exhaustion shall not apply to those persons not entitled by law to such benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-9\">* * * * Jjc</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">(e) The department shall further require in addition to the conditions and requirements stated in subsections (c) and (d), that persons who are physically fit, able to work, and employable shall as a condition to receiving general assistance, register for work on public work projects and accept an assignment to work under section 346-31 or accept such employment as may be offered to them by the department under section 346-102 or by an employer. The term \u201cpublic work projects\u201d includes any kind of labor under the department of accounting and general services of the State or the department of public works of any county, or under any other department, board, commission, or agency of the State or any county. All such agencies may employ persons registering under this section. Payment for the work shall not be made from the funds of the agency employing such persons but shall be made from the funds of the department. The department shall promulgate such rules and regulations as it deems necessary to enforce and carry out this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">(f) Applicants and recipients shall be required to satisfy all applicable provisions of this section. Recipients disqualified for failure to comply with any of the requirements under the provisions of this section shall be excluded from general assistance for a period not to exceed twelve months.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-12\">(g) The department shall by rules adopted pursuant to chapter 91, establish criteria and standards for the foregoing conditions and requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>HRS \u00a7 346-71(a) (1978) states that DSSH shall provide public assistance to three unqualified categories of individuals who are \u201cdisabled, or are at least 55 years of age, or have dependent children in the home not otherwise provided for under this chapterf.]\u201d Similarly, HRS \u00a7 346-71(c) (1978) provides that \u201c[a] person with child shall be eligible for general assistance\u201d if the individual satisfies the work requirements specified in subsections (c) and (e). The statutory disqualification contained in HRS \u00a7 346-71(f) (1978) further provides that \u201c[Recipients disqualified for failure to comply with any of the requirements under the provisions of this section shall be excluded from general assistance\u201d and does not provide that all other qualifying members of the recipient household be disqualified upon the noncompliance of one adult. In our view, the language of those sections indicates a clear legislative intent to provide assistance to the qualifying individuals irrespective of the conduct of one of the adults in that household and further to require only the individual applicant to comply with the work requirements as a condition precedent to receiving benefits under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Moreover, no language appears in the statute susceptible to DSSH\u2019s interpretation that the legislature intended to authorize disqualification of all members of the household upon the disqualification of one adult. Rather, when viewing the statute in its entirety, the primary purpose of the enactment is to provide general assistance to all those needy individuals whom the legislature has defined by statute and, further, to impose certain requirements as a precondition to the receipt of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Additionally, HRS \u00a7 346-71 (1978) does not authorize DSSH to enact the additional requirements and disqualifications contained in HPWM \u00a7 3113 (December 1978). Under HRS \u00a7 346-71(e) (1978), DSSH is specifically authorized and required \u201cto promulgate such rules and regulations as it deems necessary to enforce and carry out this section.\u201d However, this authority is limited to enacting rules and regulations which are reasonably related to carrying into effect the purposes and provisions of the legislation. <em>In re Carlson, </em>38 Haw. 9 (1948); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hawaii County, </em>473 F.Supp. 261 (D. Hawaii 1979). It, therefore, may not enact rules and regulations which enlarge, alter, or restrict the provisions of the act being administered. <em>In re Carlson, supra; Dickey v. Rapid Transit Co., </em>15 Haw. 304, 307 (1903); see also 73 C.J.S. <em>Public Administrative Law and Procedure </em>\u00a7 89 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">In our view, DSSH\u2019s interpretation of HRS \u00a7 346-71 (1978) is inconsistent with the legislative intent and purpose of the statute. There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>fore, we conclude that the rules adopted by DSSH which pertain to the disqualifications in this case are void and unenforceable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Defendants also argue that plaintiffs may only recover retroactive benefits up to May 19, 1982, the date on which relevant amendments to HRS \u00a7 346-71 were enacted by the legislature (May 19, 1982 statutory amendments) and may not recover benefits through October 1982, when DSSH promulgated the new rules implementing these amendments in accordance with the Hawaii Administrative Procedure Act (HAPA), HRS chapter 91. In essence, defendants contend that the amendments to HRS \u00a7 346-71 are effective and enforceable on the date of legislative enactment and are, therefore, not subject to the rulemaking provisions of the HAPA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">After its amendment on May 19, 1982, HRS \u00a7 346-71(e) (1982) specifically authorized and required DSSH to \u201cpromulgate such rules and regulations as it deems necessary to enforce and carry out this section.\u201d HRS \u00a7 346-71(g) (1982) further required DSSH to adopt rules pursuant to HAPA to \u201cestablish criteria and standards for the foregoing conditions and requirements.\u201d Based on these provisions, the statutory amendments did not become operative until DSSH performed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>conditions specified by the statute by adopting rules implementing the amendments and establishing certain standards for its provisions. <em>See In re Marques, </em>37 Haw. 260 (1945); 73 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Statutes </em>\u00a7 374 (1974). Thus, in order to be valid and enforceable, those rules must have been established in accordance with HAPA.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Burk </em>v. <em>Sunn, </em>68 Haw. __, 705 P.2d 17 (1985); <em>Costa </em>v. <em>Sunn, </em>64 Haw. 389, 642 P.2d 530 (1982); 5 Haw. App. 419, 697 P.2d 43 (1985). In the instant case, DSSH concedes that its rules implementing the May 19,1982 statutory amendments were not promulgated in accordance with HAPA until October 1982. Accordingly, we affirm the lower court\u2019s decision that plaintiffs are entitled to recover benefits through October 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">Defendants contend that although the circuit court was authorized to issue a declaratory judgment as to the validity of DSSH\u2019s rules under HRS \u00a7 91-7 (1976), it was not authorized to grant plaintiffs\u2019 ancillary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>relief by ordering defendants to pay them the benefits denied them wrongfully. Defendants assert that such ancillary relief is unauthorized by statute or case law and is barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">We determined in <em>Costa </em>v. <em>Sunn, </em>5 Haw. App. 419, 697 P.2d 43 (1985), that the circuit court has authority to grant ancillary monetary relief in an HRS \u00a7 91-7 declaratory judgment action. The <em>Costa </em>holding is applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">The monetary relief sought by plaintiffs is authorized by HRS \u00a7 661-1 (Supp. 1984). In relevant part, it provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-10\">Jurisdiction. The several circuit courts of the State ... shall... have original jurisdiction to hear and determine the following matters. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-11\">(1) All claims against the State founded upon any statute of the State; or upon any regulation of an executive department^]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq_j\">Plaintiffs\u2019 claims for benefits are founded upon H RS \u00a7 346-71 which, in 1976, provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-12\">General assistance. The department of social services and housing shall administer public assistance to those needy persons not otherwise provided for under this chapter, who for reasons satisfactory to the department are unable to provide sufficient support for themselves or those dependent upon them, provided that such persons are residents of this State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-13\">In 1978 and 1982, HRS \u00a7 346-71 was amended to provide and it now provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-14\">General assistance, (a) The department of social services and housing shall administer and provide public assistance to eligible persons who are disabled, or are at least fifty-five years of age, or have dependent children in the home not otherwise provided for under this chapter, and who are unable to provide sufficient support for themselves or those dependent upon them; provided that such persons have first been determined ineligible for a comparable federally funded financial assistance program and are bona fide residents of this State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>In our view, a statute that requires the DSSH to \u201cadminister public assistance to . . . needy persons\u201d or to \u201cadminister and provide public assistance to eligible persons\u201d authorizes the eligible persons to sue the DSSH for the recovery of those benefits wrongfully denied. Any other interpretation would improperly allow the executive department to violate the legislative mandate and frustrate the legislative purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Defendants argue that <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Companies, </em>68 Haw. __ (Nos. 9411 and 9965, October 15, 1985), is authority for their contention that monetary relief is barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. We disagree. Upon being injured in an automobile accident, Washington, a public assistance recipient, applied for benefits under her free no-fault insurance policy. When her claim for benefits was denied, she sued for the benefits and for damages caused by the allegedly wrongful refusal to pay her the benefits. The supreme court held that she was properly denied benefits under HRS \u00a7 294-2(10) (Supp. 1984). It also held that Washington\u2019s claim for damages was barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. However, its holding with respect to Washington\u2019s claim for damages was not directed at and is not applicable to her claim for benefits. It was directed at and applies only to her claim for special damages, $175,000 general damages, and no less than $7 million punitive damages allegedly caused by the wrongful refusal to pay benefits.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">\n<em>PLAINTIFFS' CROSS-APPEAL</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Atl\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">Plaintiffs contend that under HRS \u00a7\u00a7 346-55 and 346-53(c) (1976) certain children and adults under 21 were guaranteed \u201cpublic assistance benefits\u201d and could not be disqualified from those benefits by HPWM \u00a7 3113.08 (December 1978). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">HRS \u00a7\u00a7 346-53(c) and 346-55 (1976) provides as follows:<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Amr\">\u00a7 346-53 Determination of amount of assistance.</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"A4m\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number><em>Steven K.
