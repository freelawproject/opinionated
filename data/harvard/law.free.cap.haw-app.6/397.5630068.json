Makanui (Barbara) and Abraham Kahiwahiwa Makanui (Abraham) appeal the July 26, 1985 summary judgment dismissing their case.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Although, as evidenced by the caption, the original pleading filed by plaintiffs is confusing, we construe it as being (1) an administrative appeal and (2) a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">We vacate the July 26, 1985 summary judgment and decide this appeal as if the dismissal was based on a Rule 12(b)(6), Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) (1981), motion. Under Rule 12(b)(6), we affirm the dismissal of (1) plaintiffs\u2019 administrative appeal; (2) plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief; and (3) plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for damages against some of the defendants. We reverse the dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for damages against some of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">The dispositive issues and our answers are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">I. Did the lower court reversibly err in hearing and deciding defendants\u2019 June 6, 1985 Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment while precluding plaintiffs from deposing certain defendants? Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">II. Are plaintiffs\u2019 administrative appeal and complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief subject to dismissal for mootness? Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">III. Have plaintiffs alleged a cognizable claim for damages for violation of Abraham\u2019s federal constitutional rights? Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-12\">IV. Are any of the defendants absolutely or qualifiedly immune from plaintiffs\u2019 federal damage claims for violation of Abraham\u2019s federal constitutional rights? Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-13\">Abraham was 17 years of age and a Waimea High School (WHS) senior during the 1984-85 school year.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-14\">On October 1, 1984 Abraham and his mother, Barbara, signed a document entitled \u201cAthletic Rules and Policies\u201d (agreement). The agreement appears to implement the desires or requirements of defendants WHS, Kauai Interscholastic Federation (KIF), and Hawaii High School Athletic Association (HHSAA). In relevant part the agreement states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-15\">It is an honor and a privilege for me to participate in athletic activities at Waimea High School. I realize that as an athlete, I am a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>member of a team. This means that sometimes it may be necessary for me to make personal sacrifices in the interest of the whole team. I further realize that as an athlete, I am a \u201cpublic figure\u201d whose conduct will be constantly under the observation of a \u201ccritical public.\u201d Therefore, I hereby agree to obey the following general rules, the athletes\u2019 code to conduct, and the training rules as set up by the athletes, the Waimea High School Athletic Department and the Hawaii Interscholastic Federation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-6\">I. GENERAL RULES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-7\">*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-8\">F. I will conduct myself in an exemplary manner, both on and off the campus. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-9\">*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-10\">III. RULES AND POLICIES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-11\">*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-12\">B. Athletes may be suspended from any team by the athletic director or by the coach for infractions of training rules, disrespect to coaches and other school officials, or for any other misbehavior warranting suspension. The principal is the only person that has the authority to drop any athlete from the team.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-13\">C. The principal, upon the recommendation of the athletic director or coaches, may withhold from participation: (1) any athlete whose undesirable behavior or attitude may be detrimental to the team; (2) any athlete who has been arrested for a law violation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-14\">*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-15\">E. Nothing in this [sic] athletic rules and policies shall be construed as requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt before suspension may be imposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-16\">*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-17\">We have read the above general rules, athletes\u2019 code of conduct, and the policies of the athletic department. We hereby agree to abide by the above rules and we fully understand that any infraction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>these rules may result in suspension and/or expulsion from the school term.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">After school on April 18, 1985, Abraham set off fireworks in the WHS parking lot. After investigating the incident and reviewing Abraham\u2019s prior WHS record, WHS officials (1) reported the incident to the Kauai Police Department which led to the arrest of Abraham; (2) suspended Abraham from school on April 22 and 23, 1985; and (3) declared Abraham ineligible for further participation on the WHS track team. Consequently, Abraham, who was potentially a state champion in the 1600- and 3200-meter events, was not allowed to participate in the Hawaii State Track Meet on May 4, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 request for a contested case hearing was denied by Kauai Department of Education officials. Although plaintiffs were advised that they could seek relief from the State Superintendent and the Board of Education, they did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">On April 30, 1985 plaintiffs filed in circuit court a notice of appeal under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapter 91 and Rule 72, HRCP, and a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief and damages for violation of constitutional rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">On June 6, 1985 defendants filed a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted or for clearly indicating on its face the existence of affirmative defenses. 5 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: <em>Civil </em>\u00a7 1357 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">On July 1, 1985 plaintiffs deposed Jon Derby, the vice principal of WHS. On July 3, 1985 plaintiffs noticed the depositions of Basilio Fuertes, Jr., WHS athletic director; David Walker, WHS track team coach; and Dr. Mitsugi Nakashima, district superintendent for Kauai schools, to be taken on July 10, 1985. On July 5,1985 plaintiffs deposed State Senator Neil Abercrombie.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">On July 9, 1985 defendants obtained an <em>ex parte </em>protective order precluding plaintiffs from deposing Basilio Fuertes, Jr., Rodney Hus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>tead, David Walker, and Dr. Mitsugi Nakashima on July 10, 1985. The order was granted based on the following representations by defendants\u2019 counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-6\">4. That [defendants] have filed a Motion to Dismiss which is scheduled for hearing on Thursday, July 11, 1985;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-7\">5. That because [defendants\u2019] motion is challenging the Court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction, [defendants] believe that the case will be resolved on the law and not the facts;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-8\">6. That [defendants] believe that no amount of fact finding will assist [plaintiffs] in their action since this case should be resolved on the law[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">In relevant part the July 9, 1985 protective order stated: \u201cIn the event that [defendants\u2019] Motion To Dismiss scheduled for hearing on July 11, 1985, not be granted, then [plaintiffs] may reschedule the depositions of the individuals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">Defendants\u2019 June 6, 1985 Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss was heard on July 11, 1985. As permitted by Rule 12(b), the motion was heard and decided as a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56, HRCP, notwithstanding plaintiffs\u2019 complaint about the restrictiveness of the protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">On July 26, 1985 the lower court dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-13\">When a protective order precluding plaintiffs from deposing potentially relevant witnesses is issued in anticipation of and subject to court action on defendants\u2019 Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, basic fairness and Rule 56(f) require that before the Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss is heard and decided as a Rule 56 motion for summary judgment, the protective order must be lifted unless the plaintiffs agree otherwise. <em>See </em>10A Wright-Miller-Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure: <em>Civil \u00a7 </em>2741 (1983). Since the July 9, 1985 protective order was not lifted and plaintiffs did not agree otherwise, we vacate the summary judgment and decide this appeal as if the lower court dismissed Abraham\u2019s complaint under Rule 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-15\">Plaintiffs contend that Chapter 19, Title 8, Subtitle 2, Part 1, Hawaii <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Administrative Rules, effective September 1, 1982, precludes enforcement of their October 1, 1984 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Plaintiffs further contend that the validity and enforceability of their October 1, 1984 agreement is governed by HRS Chapter 91, the Hawaii Administrative Procedures Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Since Abraham has graduated from WHS, both contentions raise moot issues. Moreover, in the context of this case, these issues do not sufficiently affect the public interest to warrant application of the exception to the general rule that appellate courts do not consider moot issues. <em>Wong </em>v. <em>Board of Regents, </em>62 Haw. 391, 616 P.2d 201 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">A complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that no relief can be granted under any set of facts that can be proved in support of its allegations. <em>Giuliani </em>v. <em>Chuck, </em>1 Haw. App. 379, 620 P.2d 733 (1980). <em>See Scheuer </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>416 U.S. 232, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">Under this standard of review, plaintiffs have stated a cognizable claim for damages for violation of at least one of Abraham\u2019s federal constitutional rights.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although plaintiffs have failed to allege a federal damage claim based on a violation of Abraham\u2019s federal due process rights, their complaint sufficiently alleges a cognizable federal damage claim for violation of his federal equal protection rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">State courts have concurrent jurisdiction over federal damage claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1976).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Martinez </em>v. <em>California, </em>444 U.S. 277, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>283-84 n.7, 100 S.Ct. 553, 558, 62 L.Ed.2d 481, 488 (1980). Under \u00a7 1983, \u201conly two \u2014 allegations are required to order to state a cause of action. First, the plaintiff must allege that some person has deprived him of a federal right. Second, he must allege that the person who has deprived him of that right acted under color of law. <em>See Monroe </em>v. <em>Pape, </em>365 U.S. 167, 81 S.Ct. 473, 475, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961).\u201d <em>Gomes v. Toledo, </em>446 U.S. 635, 640, 100 S.Ct. 1920, 1923, 64 L.Ed.2d 572, 577 (1980). <em>See also York </em>v. <em>Story, </em>324 F.2d 450, 453 (9th Cir. 1963), <em>cert. denied, </em>376 U.S. 939, 84 S.Ct. 794, 11 L.Ed.2d 659 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">\n<em>Due Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">The right to participate in interscholastic athletics is not a \u201cliberty\u201d or \u201cproperty\u201d interest entitled to protection under the due process clause. <em>See, e.g., Rutledge </em>v. <em>Arizona Board of Regents, </em>660 F.2d 1345, 1352-53 (9th Cir. 1981); <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Louisiana High School Athletic Association, </em>430 F.2d 1155, 1158 (5th Cir. 1970); <em>Colorado Seminary (University of Denver) v.

Neither did the denial of this right constitute a \u201cgrievous loss\u201d for purposes of fixing the substantive content of actions cognizable under that provision. <em>Rutledge, </em>660 F.2d at 1353.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">\n<em>Equal Protection</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">With respect to the equal protection claim, Abraham has met the requirements for a \u00a7 1983 claim under <em>Gomez, supra, </em>by alleging in relevant part as follows:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqu\">\n<em>I.

This action is brought against the above-named Defendants * * * who have illegally and without properfoundation [sic], attempted to prevent HIWA MAKANUI from running in the State track meet put on by HAWAII HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION, which meet is scheduled for May 4, 1985, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>cruelly and unusually punishing him for a pyrotechnics violation which occurred on school campus, after school hours, and by dismissing him from the Waimea High School Big Blue Mean Machine trach [sic] team, in carrying out unauthorized discipline in violation of Chapter 91, H.R.S., Chapter and Rules of the D.O.E., Rule 19, the Hawaii State Constitution, the Constitution of the United States, and all concepts of fair play, due process, equal protection, cruel and unusual punishment, interference of the State government in parental-minor discipline[.] * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-5\">\n<em>III.

Their actions are racial discriminatory, sexually discriminatory, marital status discriminatory, age discriminatory, and without any merit. Their findings are clearly erroneous, and malicious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-9\"><em>See also Snowden </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>321 U.S. 1, 64 S.Ct. 397, 88 L.Ed. 497, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>321 U.S. 804, 64 S.Ct. 778, 88 L.Ed. 1090 (1944); <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Norris, </em>300 F.2d 24 (9th Cir. 1962). Moreover, the allegations with respect to WHS and possibly KIF and HHSAA constitute action taken under color of law. <em>See Jones </em>v. <em>Oklahoma Secondary Sch.

HRS Chapter 662.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">A suit against a state\u2019s agencies or against its officers or agents in their official capacities is a suit against the state and not against its officers or agents in their individual capacities. <em>Kentucky </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>__ U.S. __, 105 S.Ct. 3099, 87 L.Ed.2d 114 (1985). Consequently, Hawaii, its agencies,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and its officers and agents in their official capacities are immune from and cannot be held liable for claims for money damages for violations of constitutional rights under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Kapil v.

In the specific context of school discipline, a local official acts in bad faith and is not immune from liability for damages under \u00a7 1983 (1) if the constitutional right allegedly infringed by them was clearly established at the time of their challenged conduct; (2) if they knew or should have known of that right; and (3) if they knew or should have known that their conduct violated the constitutional norm. <em>Procunier </em>v. <em>Navarette, </em>434 U.S. 555, 562, 98 S.Ct. 855, 860, 55 L.Ed.2d 24, 31 (1978); <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Strickland, supra.
