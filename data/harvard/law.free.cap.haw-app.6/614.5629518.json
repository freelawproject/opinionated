Richardson and his wife, Margie J. Richardson (hereinafter the Richardsons), and Copthorne N.V. (Copthorne), a Netherland Antilles corporation (hereinafter where appropriate the Richardsons and Copthorne will be referred to collectively as Plaintiffs), appeal from the order dismissing their complaint against Defendants-Appellees Howard T. Lane (Lane), Willis Sinsabaugh (Sinsabaugh), and Waterfront Properties, Inc. (Waterfront), a Hawaii corporation (hereinafter where appropriate Lane, Sinsabaugh and Waterfront will be referred to collectively as Defendants), from the default judgments entered against them on the counterclaims of Lane and Sinsabaugh, and from the trial court\u2019s March 19,1985 order award<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>ing costs and attorney\u2019s fees to Sinsabaugh and Waterfront under Rule 68, Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) (1980). We affirm, except for the order of March 19, 1985, which we order vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">This case began as a dispute between the parties over structural deficiencies in a residence purchased by the Richardsons from Lane<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> under an agreement of sale (agreement) which was later assigned to Copthorne. After the complaint, counterclaims against Plaintiffs by Lane for default on the agreement and by Lane and Sinsabaugh for defamation, and cross-claims between Lane and Sinsabaugh and Waterfront were filed, trial was scheduled for January 21, 1985. Meanwhile, the matter had deteriorated into a battle over discovery proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">On January 16, 1985, as a result of the most current discovery proceedings dispute between Plaintiffs and Defendants, Lane filed a motion seeking, <em>inter alia, </em>(1) dismissal of the complaint; (2) default judgment against Plaintiffs on Lane\u2019s counterclaim; and (3) preclusion of the testimony of three of Plaintiffs\u2019 expert witnesses. The motion was heard on January 17, 1985, and on that day the trial court orally ordered that Plaintiffs\u2019 three experts would be precluded from testifying. Also on January 17, 1985, Lane filed another motion to dismiss alleging that Plaintiffs had failed to comply with a January 14, 1985 order that they deposit in court a sum equal.to all payments that had not been made by them under the agreement. This motion was heard on January 18, 1985, and on the same day the trial court orally ordered Plaintiffs to deposit with the court $743,750 cash or other security by 9:30 a.m., January 21, 1985, the day of trial. Written orders denying the dismissals and the default judgment but granting the motion to preclude Plaintiffs\u2019 three experts from testifying and requiring Plaintiffs to deposit $743,750 with the court were entered on January 28, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">On the morning of trial, the jury panel was present and Defendants appeared with their attorneys. Plaintiffs\u2019 attorney was present, but Plaintiffs were not. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel filed an \u201cAffidavit of Leon D. Richardson Disqualifying the Honorable Edwin Y. Sasaki\u201d (Judge Sasaki), who had presided over Lane\u2019s dismissal motions and who was to be the trial judge. Judge Sasaki refused to disqualify himself. Plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>tiffs\u2019 counsel then told Judge Sasaki that Plaintiffs were unable to proceed to trial because of the sanctions imposed by Judge Sasaki and Judge Sasaki\u2019s refusal to disqualify himself. Judge Sasaki ordered the trial to proceed and directed the clerk to call the roll of the jurors. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel then requested a bench conference at which he stated that Plaintiffs had instructed him \u201cnot to participate in this proceeding\u201d because they were \u201cbeing deprived of their constitutional right to trial by jury and to a trial judge who is impartialf.]\u201d At the end of the bench conference, Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel left the courtroom. The trial court thereupon orally dismissed the complaint on its merits, dismissed the cross-claims between Lane and Sinsabaugh and Waterfront, entered a default against Plaintiffs on Lane\u2019s and Sinsabaugh\u2019s counterclaims, and allowed Defendants to present proof of damages. On January 24, 1985, the court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law, a judgment in favor of Lane and Sinsabaugh, and a separate judgment in favor of Sinsabaugh and Waterfront.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">The judgments (1) dismissed the complaint against all Defendants with prejudice; (2) cancelled the agreement of sale and terminated all of Plaintiffs\u2019 right, title and interest in the property; (3) authorized Lane to retain all sums paid under the agreement of sale; (4) awarded Lane and Sinsabaugh $1.00 on their counterclaims for defamation; (5) ordered issuance of a writ of possession to Lane; and (6) granted Defendants leave to move for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">On February 4, 1985, Plaintiffs filed a motion seeking(l) relief from the order dismissing the complaint and from the judgment, (2) a new trial, and (3) a stay of the judgment. After a hearing, which was attended by Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, the motion was denied on February 26, 1985. Meanwhile, on February 19, 1985, Plaintiffs filed a motion to vacate the default judgment, the order of dismissal, and the order precluding Plaintiffs\u2019 expert witnesses\u2019 testimony, which was denied on March 19, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">During the period when Plaintiffs were attacking the dismissals and judgments. Defendants moved for costs and attorney\u2019s fees and gave notice of their motions to Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel. Although neither Plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>nor their counsel appeared at the hearings on the motions, they did file written objections on \u201cjurisdictional and constitutional grounds.\u201d On March 6, and 19, 1985, respectively, Lane\u2019s motion and Sinsabaugh\u2019s and Waterfront\u2019s motion for award of attorney\u2019s fees were granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Plaintiffs filed notices of appeal on February 25, 1985, and on April 18, 1985, which were both dismissed on jurisdictional grounds on December 31, 1985. On May 5, 1986, Plaintiffs filed another notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">The following three questions are determinative of this appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">(1) Did the trial court err in dismissing Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint?</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">(2) Did the trial court err in entering default judgments in favor of Defendants on their counterclaims?</p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">(3) Did the trial court err in denying Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to set aside the order dismissing its complaint and the default judgments?</p>\n<p id=\"b638-11\">We find no error. Additionally, for reasons discussed below we will not consider any alleged errors that occurred prior to dismissal of the complaint. Other matters raised by Plaintiffs on appeal are utterly without merit and will not be discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-13\">When Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel informed the trial court that Plaintiffs had instructed him not to participate further in the proceedings and left the courtroom, Plaintiffs effectively abandoned their cause of action and the trial court correctly dismissed the complaint under Rule 41(b), HRCP,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for lack of prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>Dismissals with prejudice are not favored, <em>see Lim </em>v. <em>Harvis Construction, Inc., 65 </em>Haw. 71, 647 P.2d 290 (1982), and appellate courts will uphold such a sanction by the trial court only \u201cwhen there is a \u2018clear record of delay or contumacious conduct... and where lesser sanctions would not serve the best interests of justice.\u2019\u201d <em>Bagalay </em>v. <em>Lahaina Restoration, </em>60 Haw. 125, 132, 588 P.2d 416, 422 (1978) (quoting <em>Boazman </em>v. <em>Economics Laboratory, Inc., </em>537 F.2d 210, 212 (5th Cir. 1976)); 9 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: <em>Civil </em>\u00a7 2369, at 195 (1971). A party\u2019s refusal to proceed with trial is cause for dismissal of his complaint. 9 Wright &amp; Miller, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2370, at 209-210; <em>Michelson </em>v. <em>Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., </em>429 F.2d 394 (2nd Cir. 1970); <em>Thompson v. Fleming, </em>402 F.2d 266 (5th Cir. 1968); <em>Hooper v. Chrysler Motors Corp., </em>325 F.2d 321 (5th Cir. 1963), <em>cert. denied, </em>377 U.S. 967, 84 S.Ct. 1647, 12 L.Ed.2d 736 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">A case factually similar to the case at bar is <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Sielaff, </em>492 F.2d 917 (3d Cir. 1974). There, the plaintiff, on the day of trial and against the advice of his lawyer, refused to proceed to trial on his civil rights complaint because the trial judge had denied his petition for writs of <em>habeas corpus ad testificandum </em>for the appearance of three of his fellow prison inmates as plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses, claiming those witnesses were essential to his case. The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for dismissal for lack of prosecution and the appellate court affirmed. Observing that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-6\">[n]o precise rule can be laid down as to what circumstances justify a dismissal for failure to prosecute, but the procedural history of each case must be examined in order to make that determination. The power of the court to prevent undue delays and to achieve the orderly disposition of cases must be weighed against the policy of law which favors disposition of litigation on its merits[,]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A80\"><em>id., </em>at 918, the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-7\">From a careful consideration of the history of this litigation and from all the surrounding circumstances, we hold that the district court\u2019s dismissal of plaintiffs case for lack of prosecution was not an abuse of discretion. Indeed, appellant left the district judge no choice. The appellant refused to proceed with the trial because of the court\u2019s adverse decision on his motion for issuance of a writ <em>ad testificandum </em>for the three inmates at Graterford, despite the advice of his counsel that the \u201cproper procedure\u201d was to proceed. Both the appellant and Rayford Smith were present, having been transferred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>by the prison authorities to the courthouse. The issues in the case may well have been resolved without the other inmate witnesses. If appellant had proceeded, he might have been successful. If appellant had proceeded and lost, the appellate court would have had a complete record upon which to make its determination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-6\">For these reasons we affirm the dismissal for lack of prosecution and do not reach the substantive issue involving the denial of the writ of habeas corpus <em>ad testificandum. </em>To adjudicate the issue of the writ under the circumstances of this case would undermine the \u201cbasic and persisting policy against piecemeal appeals.\u201d <em>Cf. Borden Co. </em>v. <em>Sylk, </em>3 Cir. 1969, 410 F.2d 843; <em>Kelly v. Greer, </em>3 Cir. 1961, 295 F.2d 18; <em>Panichella </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania Railroad Co., </em>3 Cir. 1958, 252 F.2d 452, 454. If a litigant could refuse to proceed whenever a trial judge ruled against him, wait for the court to enter a dismissal for failure to prosecute, and then obtain review of the judge\u2019s interlocutory decision, the policy against piecemeal litigation and review would be severely weakened. This procedural technique would in effect provide a means to avoid the finality rule embodied in 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1291. To review the district court\u2019s refusal to grant the writ under the facts of this case is to invite the inundation of appellate dockets with requests for review of interlocutory orders and to undermine the ability of trial judges to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 919.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">We adopt the reasoning of <em>Marshall </em>and apply it to the instant case. By refusing to proceed with the trial, Plaintiffs left the trial court no choice but to dismiss their complaint. Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the preclusion order was destructive of their case carries no weight against the record here. There is no way we can evaluate the effect of the order because Plaintiffs\u2019 refusal to proceed has left us without a record of the remainder of their proof. Finally, as stated above, we will not discuss alleged errors that occurred prior to the dismissal of the complaint, as to do so would be contrary to this jurisdiction\u2019s policy against piecemeal appeals.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Doe V </em>v. <em>Roe V, </em>5 Haw. App. 610, 704 P.2d 940 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"A3K\">We point out that we do not deem it fatal to the trial court\u2019s decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>that it acted <em>sua sponte </em>rather than on a motion to dismiss from Defendants. We are aware that in <em>Lim </em>v. <em>Harvis Construction, Inc., </em>65 Haw. 71, 647 P.2d 290 (1982), the supreme court held that dismissal under Rule 41(b) requires a motion, notice and hearing. However, the circumstances in that case were vastly different from those in the case at bar. In <em>Lim </em>the court\u2019s order of dismissal was based only on a letter from defense counsel. Here, Plaintiffs\u2019 intentions were announced by their counsel in court before he exited. A formal motion, notice, and hearing would have been superfluous. Moreover, a fair inference from the record is that Plaintiffs and their counsel would not have appeared at such a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Plaintiffs contend the default judgment is in error because they were not given any notice of the hearing on the application for default judgment on Defendants\u2019 counterclaims, as required by Rule 55(b)(2), HRCP (1980).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The argument is specious. The same actions by Plaintiffs that justified the dismissal justified the trial court in declaring the default and rendering the default judgment. Defendants were present with their witnesses, and in light of all the circumstances, there was no conceivable reason for the trial court to refuse to proceed with Defendants\u2019 proof. Moreover, we see no reason why Plaintiffs might have thought that their exit from the courtroom would deprive the trial court of its jurisdiction and authority to act.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>While the failure to give the required notice is generally regarded as a serious procedural irregularity that may afford the basis for reversal on appeal, or for relief under an appropriate clause of Rule 60(b) and in conjunction with other irregularities may render the judgment void, the error should not usually be treated as so serious as to render the judgment void. It should be considered in the light of surrounding circumstances and will, at times, be harmless.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">7 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b6 60.25[2], at 60-238 (2d ed. 1985) (footnotes omitted). <em>Cf. Blois </em>v. <em>Friday, </em>612 F.2d 938 (5th Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Here, the surrounding circumstances render the procedural error harmless.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Plaintiffs argue that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to set aside the dismissal and the default judgments, citing Rule 60(b), HRCP (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">The function of an appellate court in an appeal from the trial court\u2019s refusal to set aside a default judgment \u201cis to determine whether the district court failed to set aside a void judgment or abused its discretion.\u201d <em>Textile Banking Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>Rentschler, </em>657 F.2d 844, 850 (7th Cir. 1981). There is nothing in the record to render the judgment void, and the circumstances clearly indicate no abuse of discretion by the trial court in denying Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to vacate the dismissal and the default judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">Although the findings of fact and conclusions of law and the judgments were not submitted to Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel for approval as to form as required by Rule 21, Rules of the Circuit Court (RCC) (1971), those documents do not vary from the record and Plaintiffs were not prejudiced. <em>Cf. Baldwin </em>v. <em>Hawaiian Agronomics Co., </em>53 Haw. 447, 496 P.2d 9 (1972). The record does show that notices of the entry of those documents were sent to Plaintiffs on January 24, 1985. In our view, the failure to comply with Rule 21, RCC, does not, in the circumstances of this case, render the order of dismissal or the judgments void, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Plaintiffs\u2019 Rule 60(b) motions. <em>Isemoto Contracting Co., Ltd. </em>v. <em>Andrade, </em>1 Haw. App. 202, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>616 P.2d 1022 (1980).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AYh\"><em>Gary Victor Dubin </em>for plaintiffs-appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AZk\"><em>Michael W.

The ensuing orders and judgments comport with all of the prior proceedings and rulings and indicate that Plaintiffs were not prejudiced by that <em>ex parte </em>meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">On March 19, 1985, the trial court ordered Plaintiffs to pay $12,297.49 to Sinsabaugh and Waterfront as costs and attorney\u2019s fees they had argued were due them under Rule 68, HRCP.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The trial court erred. Rule 68\u2019s provision requiring the offeree to pay the offeror\u2019s costs and attorney\u2019s fees is not applicable in a case where judgment is rendered against the offeree. <em>See Crown Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Financial Security Life Ins.

For failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with these rules or any order of court, a defendant may move for dismissal of an action or of any claim against him. After the plaintiff, in an action tried by the court without a jury, has completed the presentation of his evidence, the defendant, without waiving his right to offer evidence in the event the motion is not granted, may move for a dismissal on the ground that upon the facts and the law the plaintiff has shown no right to relief. The court as trier of the facts may then determine them and render judgment against the plaintiff or may decline to render any judgment until the close of all the evidence. If the court renders judgment on the merits against the plaintiff, the court shall make findings as provided in Rule 52(a). Unless the court in its order for dismissal otherwise specifies, a dismissal under this subdivision and any dismissal not provided for in this rule, other than a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, for improper venue, or for failure to join a party under Rule 19, operates as an adjudication upon the merits.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b640-9\">The transcript of the January 21, 1985 hearing indicates that Plaintiffs\u2019counsel orally requested permission to take an interlocutory appeal, which was denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Rule 55(b)(2), HRCP (1980), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-8\">Rule 55.
