The dispositive issue on appeal is whether the Joint Underwriting Plan (JUP) of the Hawaii no-fault insurance law, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapter 294 (No-Fault Law), requires the assignment of Neumann\u2019s claim for accidental harm against an alleged \u201cunidentified hit-and-run motorist\u201d to an automobile liability insurance company, where Hawaiian Insurance and Guaranty Company, Ltd. (HIG), the insurer of the car in which Neumann was the passenger, had paid to Neumann \u201cno-fault benefits\u201d totaling $15,000 and mandatory public liability policy coverage for accidental harm of $25,000. We answer no and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-14\">The pleadings reveal the following facts. On September 27, 1981, while a passenger in a car owned and operated by Curtis W. Jenkins (Jenkins), Neumann sustained injuries when the car went off the right edge of a roadway and overturned. Neumann claims that the accident occurred when Jenkins had \u201cto swerve to avoid an oncoming vehicle.\u201d Record at 86. He refers to the driver of that vehicle as \u201can unidentified hit-and-run motorist.\u201d Record at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-15\">Jenkins\u2019 car was insured by HIG. Neumann made a demand upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>HIG for the combined policy limits of both the public liability and uninsured motorist coverages under Jenkins\u2019 policy. HIG paid Neumann $25,000, the policy limit under the liability coverage, in addition to $15,000, the aggregate limit of no-fault benefits, but denied Neumann\u2019s demand for payment under the uninsured motorist coverage. According to HIG\u2019s counsel, under the terms of Jenkins\u2019 policy \u201cthere cannot be a double recovery under both the uninsured motorist provisions and the bodily injury liability provisions.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Record at 70-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">On March 15,1983, Neumann requested defendant Mario R. Ramil, State Insurance Commissioner (Commissioner), to assign Neumann\u2019s claim against the unidentified \u201chit-and-run\u201d motorist to a designated insurance carrier under the provisions of the JUP, HRS \u00a7\u00a7 294-20, <em>et seq. </em>The Commissioner denied Neumann\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">On February 15, 1985, Neumann filed a complaint seeking mandatory injunctive relief or, in the alternative, a writ of mandamus against the Commissioner.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">On March 13, 1985, the Commissioner moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that it failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Rule 12(b)(6), Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (1981). On May 13, 1985, the circuit court granted the Commissioner\u2019s motion, and Neumann appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">Neumann argues that (1) in addition to his claims for no-fault benefits and for bodily injuries under the public liability coverage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>against HIG, he has a claim of $25,000 for his injuries against the insurer of the other car involved in the accident; (2) because an unidentified \u201chit-and-run\u201d motorist was involved, the insurer of that car cannot be identified; and (3) therefore, under the JUP his claim should be assigned to a designated insurance carrier. On the other hand, the Commissioner contends that based on the facts alleged in the complaint, the assignment requested by Neumann is impermissible. We agree with the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">The No-Fault Law \u201cis bottomed on the compulsory coverage of all motor vehicles and operators under no-fault insurance policies and the partial abolition of tort liability.\u201d <em>Barcena </em>v. <em>Hawaiian Insurance &amp; Guaranty Co., Ltd., </em>67 Haw. 97, 102, 678 P.2d 1082, 1086 (1984). It requires the compulsory no-fault policy to include (1) coverage providing for no-fault benefits and (2) liability coverages for (a) personal injuries and (b) property damages. HRS \u00a7 294-10.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">Because of its declared purpose of providing \u201cinsurance coverage for all who require it, at a cost within the reach of every licensed driver[,]\u201d the legislature was concerned about the \u201chigh-risk driver, . . . the licensed driver while on welfare, ... the grossly surcharged physically handicapped driver, ... the driver previously convicted of a serious traffic offense and who has been licensed again[.]\u201d Hse. Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 13, in 1973 House Journal, at 1219, 1221; Sen. Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 4, in 1973 Senate Journal, at 635, 637. Because of the need to \u201c[pjrovide for a speedy, adequate and equitable reparation for those injured or otherwise victimized[,]\u201d the legislature was concerned about \u201ca person with a legitimate claim [who] had no insurance company to turn to[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>The legislature resolved those concerns by establishing the Assigned Risks and Claims Plan (ARCP) as part of the No-Fault Law. Act 203, \u00a7 1, 1973 Haw. Sess. Laws 381, 393-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>In 1974, however, the legislature repealed the ARCP and created the JUP. All insurers licensed \u201cto write and engage in writing automobile insurance\u201d in Hawaii are members of the JUP. HRS \u00a7 294-20. Licensed drivers who fall within the classifications set forth in HRS \u00a7 294-22, such as \u201cassigned risk drivers,\u201d public assistance drivers, and physically handicapped drivers, may apply for basic no-fault coverages and optional additional insurance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The premium rates under the JUP are set by the Commissioner after consultation with the board of governors. HRS \u00a7 294-24. The JUP also provides for the assignment of claims of persons suffering accidental harm who have no insurance company to turn to for redress. HRS \u00a7 294-23. The JUP Bureau (Bureau) established by the Commissioner assigns the applications for no-fault coverages and claims for no-fault benefits and claims pursuant to mandatory public liability policies under the JUP to the insurers it designates. HRS \u00a7 294-20(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Neumann asserts the Bureau must assign his claim for personal injuries against the unidentified \u201chit and run\u201d motorist to a designated insurer under HRS \u00a7 294-23(a) which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-7\">(a) Each person sustaining accidental harm, or the person\u2019s legal representative, may, except as provided in subsection (b)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of this section, obtain the no-fault benefits through the plan whenever:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>(1) No insurance benefits under no-fault policies are applicable to the accidental harm; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">(2) No such insurance benefits applicable to the accidental harm can be identified; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-7\">(3) The only identifiable insurance benefits under no-fault policies applicable to the accidental harm will not be paid in full because of financial inability of one or more self-insurers or insurers to fulfill their obligations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">(Footnote added.) He argues that his claim for accidental harm against the \u201chit and run\u201d motorist qualifies under HRS \u00a7 294-23(a)(2) because the motorist is unidentified and, consequently, the applicable insurance benefits cannot be identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">Neumann misreads HRS \u00a7 294-23(a). That section refers to claims for \u201cno-fault benefits\u201d only and not to claims based on mandatory public liability policies for accidental harm or property damage. As used in HRS \u00a7 294-23(a), the words \u201cno-fault benefits\u201d are words of art as defined in HRS \u00a7 294-2(10) and the benefits are subject to an aggregate limit of $15,000 per person.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">The use of the words \u201caccidental harm\u201d in HRS \u00a7 294-23(a) supports our restrictive construction. The No-Fault Law defines \u201caccidental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>harm\u201d to mean \u201cbodily injury, death, sickness, or disease caused by a motor vehicle accident to a person.\u201d HRS \u00a7 294-2(1). The broad construction urged on us by Neumann would require HRS \u00a7 294-23(a) to include a person sustaining \u201cproperty damage\u201d as well as \u201caccidental harm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Here, Neumann received \u201cno-fault benefits\u201d totaling $15,000 from HIG, Jenkins\u2019 insurer. Thus, \u201cno-fault benefits\u201d under Jenkins\u2019no-fault policy were applicable and such benefits applicable to Neumann\u2019s accidental harm could be identified. Based on the facts alleged, Neumann was not eligible for benefits under HRS \u00a7 294-23(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">Neumann contends in the alternative, however, that his claim qualifies for assignment under HRS \u00a7 294-23(c) which reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-8\">(c) Any person eligible for benefits under this section, or who becomes eligible to file a claim or an action against the mandatory public liability or property damage policies, shall, upon the bureau\u2019s determination of such eligibility, be entitled to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-9\">(1) The full no-fault benefits as if such victim had been covered as an insured at the time of the accident producing the accidental harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-10\">(2) The rights of claim and action against the insurer, assigned under section 294-20(b), with reference to the mandatory public liability policy for accidental harm, and with reference to the mandatory property damage policy for property damage sustained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-11\">We perceive Neumann\u2019s argument to be that since the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d is used in the statute, even if he is not eligible under HRS \u00a7 294-23(a), he qualifies under HRS \u00a7 294-23(c) because he is \u201celigible to file a claim against the mandatory public liability\u201d policy. He states that his claim, in this case, is against the policy of the insurer to be assigned since an unidentified \u201chit and run\u201d motorist was involved. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-12\">The divergent construction of HRS \u00a7 294-23(c) by the parties indicates and we conclude that the statutory language is ambiguous. Consequently, we will apply the rules of statutory construction in interpreting that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-13\">Where the statutory language is ambiguous, a court\u2019s \u201cprimary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>objective is to ascertain and give effect to legislative intention.\u201d <em>Puchert </em>v. <em>Agsalud, </em>67 Haw. 25, 34, 677 P.2d 449, 456 (1984); <em>see also Lussier </em>v. <em>Mau-Van Development, Inc. II, </em>4 Haw. App. 421, 667 P.2d 830 (1983). \u201cThe statutory language of a subsection should not be read in isolation^] ... [it] must... be read in the context of the section as a whole and construed consistently with its scheme and purpose.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>5 Haw. App. 491, __, 704 P.2d 905, 909-10, <em>aff\u2019d, </em>68 Haw. __, 704 P.2d 883 (1985) (citations omitted). A court \u201cmay resort to legislative history in construing a statute.\u201d <em>Rana </em>v. <em>Bishop Insurance of Hawaii, Inc., </em>6 Haw. App. __, __, 713 P.2d 1363, 1367, <em>aff\u2019d, </em>68 Haw. __, 713 P.2d 1363 (1985); <em>see also State v. Ui, </em>66 Haw. 366, 663 P.2d 630 (1983); <em>Armbruster </em>v. <em>Nip, </em>5 Haw. App. 37, 677 P.2d 477 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">As indicated above, when the No-Fault Law was enacted in 1973, the ARCP was established to provide a remedy for \u201ca person with a legitimate claim [who] had no insurance company to turn to, because the vehicle was uninsured, unidentified, or because the insurance company was insolventf.]\u201d Hse. Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 13, in 1973 House Journal, at 1219, 1221; Sen. Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 4, in 1973 Senate Journal, at 635, 637. When the ARCP was replaced by the JUPin 1974, the legislative concern was for the \u201cvictims for whom no [no-fault] policy is applicable, such as the hit-skip victim.\u201d Hse. Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 28, in 1974 House Journal, at 864, 866; Sen. Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 28-74, in 1974 Senate Journal, at 776, 779. To indicate the limited applicability of claim assignments under the JUP, the report stated \u201c[t]he number of such claims should be quite limited since the hit-skip victim who is a member of a family with a no-fault policy would be covered under it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When HRS \u00a7 294-23(b) was amended in 1978, the legislative intent in establishing the assigned claims program was stated to be \u201cto serve as an avenue of last resort for those innocent injured victims who have no appropriate no-fault policies available, such as the hit-skip victim who may not own a car.\u201d Sen. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 340-78, in 1978 Senate Journal, at 911. <em>See also </em>Hse. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 864-78, in 1978 House Journal, at 1799, 1800.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-11\">In light of such legislative intent, we construe HRS \u00a7 294-23 as setting up the following scheme of assigned claims. Subsection (a) establishes the eligibility requirements for \u201cno-fault benefits\u201d \u2014 a person must sustain \u201caccidental harm\u201d and must not be covered by a \u201cno-fault policy.\u201d For example, an uninsured pedestrian injured by an unidentified hit-skip vehicle meets the eligibility requirements. Subsection (b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>provides that such person must be \u201cinnocent\u201d and not disqualified thereunder.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Subsection (c) provides that, (l) a person eligible under subsection (a) is entitled to full \u201cno-fault benefits\u201d; (2) such person who meets a HRS \u00a7 294-6(a) threshold requirement<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> then becomes eligible \u201cto file a claim or an action against the mandatory public liability\u201d policy; and (3) such person who suffers property damage then becomes eligible to \u201cfile a claim or an action against the mandatory... property damage\u201d policy. Eligibility under subsection (c) is initially determined by the Bureau.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">We are aware of the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d rather than the conjunctive \u201cand\u201d in subsection (c) and our construction of that section requires the substitution of the word \u201cand\u201d for the word \u201cor.\u201d The rule of construction stated in HRS \u00a7 1-18 (1976)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> permits the substitution. <em>See Wee </em>v. <em>Board of Accountancy, </em>51 Haw. 80, 84, 452 P.2d 94, 97 (1969). \u201cThe sense of a word which harmonizes best with the whole context of the statute and promotes in the fullest manner the apparent policy and objects of the legislature must be adopted.\u201d <em>In re City &amp; County of Honolulu Corporation Counsel, </em>54 Haw. 356, 374, 507 P.2d 169, 178 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Here, Neumann was ineligible for \u201cno-fault benefits\u201d under HRS \u00a7 294-23(a). Consequently, although he met the threshold requirement,<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number><footnotemark>10</footnotemark> he was not entitled to an assigned claim to proceed against the mandatory public liability policy under HRS \u00a7 294-23(c).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Adk5\"><em>Sharon On Leng (Melvin Y.

Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 431-31 (1985). We believe the use of the DCCA in the caption was descriptive of the Commissioner, and this opinion treats the Commissioner as the sole defendant in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">Prior to the filing of the complaint against the Commissioner, plaintiff William Charles Neumann (Neumann) filed a petition for a writ of mandamus against the Commissioner in the supreme court on November 30, 1984.
