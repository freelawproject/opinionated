We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">UUR is a portion of Ulumalu Road which runs in a mauka-makai<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> direction on the slopes of Mt. Haleakala. Ulumalu Road is intersected by Kaupakalua Road at a point called \u201cFive Corners.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The section of Ulumalu Road mauka of Five Corners is known as UUR. Maui Ranch Estates is a private subdivision that has access to UUR over Maluna Place, approximately 2,000 feet mauka of Five Corners. It is the 2,000-foot section of UUR between Five Corners and Maluna Place which is at the heart of this controversy. UUR continues mauka past Maluna Place.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-12\">Ulumalu is an ahupuaa<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which was awarded as Part 1 of Royal Patent Grant 10474 to N. Namauu on September 29, 1852. In about 1883, the Hui Kuai Aina O Ulumalu (hui), composed of approximately 50 shareholders, purchased the ahupuaa consisting of about 1,500 acres, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>from Namauu. Subsequently, most of the hui members\u2019 interests were acquired by Haiku Fruit and Packing Co., Ltd. (Haiku Fruit), Maui Agricultural Co., and Hawaiian Commercial and Sugar Co., Ltd. In order to partition the property, the ahupuaa was conveyed by the owners to E. D. Baldwin in 1926, who in turn reconveyed the property in separate parcels to the owners. However, the land within the roadway was not included in any reconveyance. Testimony at trial indicated that Haiku Fruit built UUR around 1913 and maintained it until sometime after 1919. Thereafter, the County of Maui (County) engaged in its maintenance until 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">In 1968, the County approved the Maui Ranch Estates subdivision consisting of 73 lots. At that time UUR was included in the County\u2019s Public Works Department\u2019s inventory of county roads. UUR is unimproved and unpaved, and has no regulatory traffic signs on it. No government utility services are provided for Maui Ranch Estates.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">In 1981, the County\u2019s Director of Public Works directed the County\u2019s Superintendent of Roads to discontinue maintaining private roads. UUR was declared a private road and thereafter no further maintenance was authorized or conducted. As a result of the declaration that UUR was not a public road, the lots within the Maui Ranch Estates became ineligible for either FH A mortgage financing or for conventional mortgage loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Association, a Hawaii non-profit corporation made up of the owners of the lots within the Maui Ranch Estates, originally filed this action against the State of Hawaii (State) alleging that UUR was a state highway, that it was in need of repair, and that the United States Postal Service was threatening to suspend service to Maui Ranch Estates unless reasonable repairs and maintenance were made. Association also alleged that State had breached its duty to repair and maintain UUR. The complaint was later amended to add the County and the other corporate and individual defendants. The non-government defendants were named as individuals or entities who may have a claim to UUR or who are owners of land adjoining UUR. The amended complaint alleged that the State and the County were in breach of their duty to maintain and repair UUR.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Association requested that the trial court enter judgment declaring (1) that UUR is a \u201cpublic highway\u201d and/or a \u201ccounty highway,\u201d owned by the State or the County; (2) that either or both State or County have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>the duty to repair UUR and were in breach of that duty;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (3) that those defendants be ordered to perform such repairs. The Association also demanded damages, attorney\u2019s fees and costs. On August 29, 1984, the State\u2019s motion for summary judgment was granted. Therefore, the question remaining was whether UUR was a county highway. After a bench trial, the trial court entered its Findings of Fact (FOF) and Conclusions of Law (COL) on December 4, 1984, and dismissed the complaint.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On March 29, 1985, Association\u2019s Motion for Amendment of Findings of Fact was granted in part and denied in part,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and its Motion for Amendment of Judgment or for New Trial was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Although Association challenges many of the trial court\u2019s FOF and COL,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the fundamental question is whether the court was correct in holding that UUR is not a county highway. We answer yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Association puts forth three alternative theories to support its position that UUR is a county highway: first, UUR became a \u201cpublic highway\u201d upon the enactment of the Highway Act of 1892 (Highway Act); second, UUR is a county highway under the doctrine of common law dedication; and third, the County of Maui is estopped from denying that UUR is a county highway. We will discuss below Association\u2019s theories <em>seriatim. </em>First, however, we must set forth in some detail the standards that establish the parameters for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">I.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-9\">A trial court\u2019s findings of fact will not be set aside unless (1) the findings are not supported by substantial evidence and are, conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>quently, clearly erroneous or (2) a reviewing court, upon examination of all the evidence, is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">Where the determination of an issue depends upon the credibility of witnesses, the scope of review of an appellate court is limited by the due regard given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of witnesses. \u201cAn appellate court will not pass upon issues dependent upon credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence; this is the province of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Shannon </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>49 Haw. 661, 667, 426 P.2d 816, 820 (1967)[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-7\"><em>Nani Koolau Co. v. K &amp; M Construction, Inc., </em>5 Haw. App. 137, 139-140, 681 P.2d 580, 584 (1984) (citations other than <em>Shannon </em>omitted). \u201c[W]here the trial court\u2019s determinations of fact are largely dependent upon the resolution of conflicting testimony, great weight will be accorded its findings upon review.\u201d <em>Shinn </em>v. <em>Edwin Yee, Ltd., </em>57 Haw. 215, 219, 553 P.2d 733, <em>737 </em>(1976).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-8\">A conclusion of law is not binding upon an appellate court and is freely reviewable. ... A conclusion of law which is supported by the trial court\u2019s findings of fact and which reflects an application of the correct rule of law will not be overturned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-9\"><em>Nani Koolau Co. v. K &amp; M Construction, Inc., </em>5 Haw. App. at 141, 681 P.2d at 585 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">Association\u2019s first argument is that UUR became a government road upon the enactment of the Highway Act,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which specifically provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>that a private road may become a public highway by dedication if it existed prior to the enactment of the statute and had been dedicated or abandoned to the public as a highway for at least five years. Although section 3 of the act requires that a private road must be accepted or adopted by the Minister of the Interior, the supreme court has held that formal acceptance is not a requirement where a road, originally private, existed and had been abandoned for five years at the time of the act\u2019s passage. <em>In re Kelley, </em>50 Haw. 567, 445 P.2d 538 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Association contends that the evidence shows that UUR existed in the same location pre-1892 as at the time of suit and had been abandoned for five years prior to the Highway Act. Consequently, Association argues that the trial court erred in finding that UUR did not exist in its present location prior to 1892. The argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">The evidence regarding the time when UUR was opened or laid out at its present location was conflicting. Although the inference suggested by Association can be made from the evidence, that is not the inference made by the trial court. There is consistent and credible evidence that the pre-1892 road had a more mauka alignment than at present. We will not disturb the trial court\u2019s determination of the credibility and weight of that evidence. <em>Nani Koolau Co. </em>v. <em>K &amp; M Construction, Inc., supra. </em>Moreover, we are not convinced that a mistake has been made. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">Association argues that if UUR did not become a public highway upon passage of the Highway Act, then in the alternative, it became a county highway by common law dedication. That argument, also, is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">Dedication is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-11\">[t]he appropriation of land, or an easement therein, by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>owner, for the use of the public, and accepted for such use by or on behalf of the public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 371 (5th ed. 1979). Dedication of land for public use may be achieved either by statute or by common law. Statutory dedication occurs when the statutory provisions are complied with. <em>City of Kechi v. Decker, </em>230 Kan. 315, 634 P.2d 1099 (1981); 23 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Dedication </em>\u00a7 38 (1983). Common law dedication is accomplished either expressly, as by deed, or impliedly, as by acts and conduct which manifest an intent to give the property for public use. <em>City of Kechi </em>v. <em>Decker, supra; </em>23 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Dedication </em>\u00a7 3 (1983). However, before the municipality can be held responsible for maintenance, repair, and liability there must be unequivocal acceptance by the municipality. <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>City of Bethany, </em>588 P.2d 567 (Okla. 1978); McQuillin, <em>Municipal Corporations </em>\u00a7 33.44 (3rd ed. 1983).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">In the absence of statute, an offer to dedicate land to public use is not required to be accepted by public authorities; it may be accepted by the general public. If acceptance by public authorities is required by statute, it must be made by persons competent to act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">23 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Dedication </em>\u00a7 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">In the light of the provisions of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 264-1 <em>(1985),</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we hold that the doctrine of common law dedication does not convert a private roadway into a county highway, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>lower court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">HRS \u00a7 264-1 requires that a private roadway surrendered or abandoned to public use is not a county highway unless it is adopted as such by resolution of the legislative body of the county. Essentially, HRS \u00a7 264-1 adopts the common law principle that a private roadway may be surrendered or abandoned to public use. However, the roadway does not become a county highway unless and until it is accepted by the legislative body.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">A public highway is not a state highway unless it is designated for inclusion in the State Highway System under HRS \u00a7 264-41 (1976). All public highways which are not state highways are county highways or they are not public highways. <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7 264-1 (1976). A highway is not a county highway unless it is accepted or adopted as such by the county council. There is no evidence in the record of the designation, acceptance, or adoption of this road by the state or the county.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-8\"><em>Santos </em>v. <em>Perreira, </em>2 Haw. App. 387, 390, 633 P.2d 1118, 1122 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">In the instant case, as in <em>Santos </em>v. <em>Perreira, supra, </em>there is no evidence that the Maui County Council (council) accepted UUR as a public road. Since Association\u2019s argument is based upon surrender or abandonment, acceptance can only be shown by a resolution of the council. HRS \u00a7 264-1. There is no evidence of such a resolution. Therefore, we are bound by the strict application of HRS \u00a7 264-1 to conclude that UUR is not a county highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">Association argues, however, that although there was no official resolution by the council, acceptance was evidenced by the fact that County employees maintained and repaired the road from 1919 to 1981, and it was registered on their \u201cIndex of County Roads\u201d until the latter date. They argue that these acts by County employees manifested acceptance of UUR as a county road.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">However, under HRS \u00a7 264-1 only the county council is authorized to accept dedication of a private road. The acts of County\u2019s employees are not evidence of the council\u2019s acceptance. <em>See Santos </em>v. <em>Perreira, supra. </em>A municipality\u2019s legislative body can only act officially through ordinance or resolution or by voting on a motion made at a council meeting. <em>Life of the Land </em>v. <em>City and County of Honolulu, </em>61 Haw. 390, 423, 606 P.2d 866, 887 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"A_vO\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">Finally, Association argues that the County should be estopped from denying that UUR is a public highway because the County \u201cconsistently and specifically represented to the developer, real estates sales people and purchaser [sic] of Maui Ranch Estates subdivision\u201d that UUR was a public highway. We need not decide whether a county highway may be established in this jurisdiction by estoppel against a county because, assuming the estoppel theory is applicable, we agree with the trial court that Association \u201cfailed to establish any detrimental reliance on its part.\u201d COL no. 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">In support of its detrimental reliance argument, Association cites the testimony of Lawrence B. McNeil (McNeil), the developer of the project. Although a close reading of his testimony indicates that when he conferred with the County\u2019s officials about his subdivision he was already of the opinion that UUR was a public road, McNeil did testify that he would not have put in the subdivision if he did not believe UUR was a county road. However, in COL no. 13, the trial court took judicial notice that the County\u2019s Subdivision Ordinance did not prohibit subdivisions on private roads. Association does not challenge that conclusion. Reading the FOF and COL as a whole, it seems clear that the trial court implicitly rejected McNeil\u2019s testimony that he would not have proceeded with the subdivision if UUR were not a public road. <em>See Hana Ranch, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kumukahi, </em>6 Haw. App. __, __, 720 P.2d 1023, 1029 (1986). McNeil\u2019s activities were not in an effort to ascertain that UUR was a public road in order to proceed with the subdivision. McNeil\u2019s conversations with the County\u2019s officials were for the purpose of determining whether they had any objections as to where he planned to route his electrical and water lines. Inasmuch as the subdivision could have proceeded even though UUR was not a public road, Association\u2019s argument of detrimental reliance is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">We conclude after thorough examination of the record that the trial court\u2019s FOF are not clearly erroneous and no mistake was made. The COL are based upon the findings, and correctly state the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"AhtA\">Affirmed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A8V\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number><em>Boyce R.
