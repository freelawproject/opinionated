We vacate the judgments and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">At approximately 8:50 p.m., on July 25,1979, the right side of a 1974 Dodge van driven by Grant Murakami (Grant) collided into the rock wall and the bridge railing of the Makawao Bridge (also known as the Kailua or Oliveira Bridge). Grant, age 23, was driving from Makawao toward Pukalani. His fiancee, Wendy Hondo (Wendy), was the sole passenger. Grant attempted to reverse the van from the wall and railing, but the van would not move. Wendy watched Grant exit the van via the driver\u2019s side door and proceed toward the rear. Thereafter, Wendy exited the van via the driver\u2019s side door to look for Grant. She could not find him. She called for him. There was no response. A passerby suggested that Grant might be in the gulch under the bridge. They found Grant unconscious there. His most serious injury was a brain clot. He died 13 days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">The jury answered the special verdict form in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-8\">\n<em>Question No. 5.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-9\">A. Without taking into consideration reduction of any plaintiffs damages due to any negligence attributable to Grant Murakami, deceased, state the full amount of damages to be awarded to the Estate of Grant Murakami:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-10\">for the reasonable value of his medical, funeral and burial expenses; $ 34,528.76</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-12\">for the past earnings and present value of the future earnings as would have been earned by Grant Murakami, deceased; $450,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-15\">for any conscious pain and suffering had by Grant Murakami, deceased, prior to his death: $ 30,000</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-17\">B. State the full amount of damages to be awarded plaintiffs Richard Murakami and Lois Murakami, for their mental distress incurred during Grant Murakami\u2019s hospitalization and for their loss of filial respect, love, care, affection and attention of their deceased son:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-18\">Richard Murakami $175,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-19\">Lois Murakami $300,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aicg\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-5\"><em>Question No. 6. </em>With respect to any negligence, legally a cause of the death of Grant Murakami, state the relative degree of such fault, attributable to either or both the County of Maui and/or Grant Murakami, described in percentage (%), so that such percentage allocation of such fault, singly, or in combination, totals 100%:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AN7\">Answer: Defendant County of Maui: 75%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-6\">Grant Murakami, deceased: 25%</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Judgment was entered awarding Grant\u2019s estate 75% of its damages and awarding Richard and Lois Murakami 100% of their damages.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">The jury trial began on April 29, 1985. On April 25, 1985, over the County\u2019s objection, the lower court granted plaintiffs\u2019 December 31, 1984 motion <em>in limine </em>and ordered that: \u201cNo mention of the speed of the vehicle operated by Grant Murakami, prior to colliding with the Kailua Bridge, or any portion thereof, argument thereon or jury instruction pertaining thereto, shall be permitted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">At and in the vicinity of the bridge, the speed limit was 30 miles per hour. An advisory speed limit of 20 miles per hour was posted. In a deposition, the County\u2019s expert in accident reconstruction testified that at the initial impact, the van\u2019s speed was in excess of 35 miles per hour. In their answering brief, plaintiffs contend that \u201c[bjecause no causal relation between the speed of the Murakami van and Grant\u2019s later fall from the bridge can be shown, such evidence was properly excluded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">The bridge railing was 2 feet high, 8 inches wide at its top, and 87 feet long. A cemented irregular rock wall, generally 18 inches high and 18 inches wide, extended from each end of the bridge railing parallel to the road.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The sides of the rock wall and the top of the bridge railing closest to the road ran along the same course. Thus, on the side farthest from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>the road, the rock wall extended 10 inches further out than the top of the bridge railing.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The van came to rest with approximately two-thirds of the van past the junction of the rock wall and the bridge railing. Plaintiffs\u2019 theory of how and where Grant fell was that in an effort to find out why he could not reverse the van from the rock wall and bridge railing, Grant stepped onto the rock wall, walked on it toward the bridge railing, and, in the darkness, fell at the junction of the rock wall and the bridge railing because he could not see the 6-inch increase in height and the 10-inch decrease in width at that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The Makawao Bridge was illuminated by two overhanging street lights attached to poles on the side of the road. One pole was located across the street in front of where the van came to rest and the other was across the street behind the van\u2019s resting place. Each pole was approximately 100 feet from the junction of the rock wall and the bridge railing. Each light was a \u201c400-A luminary with 250-watt lamp.\u201d Two of plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses (Officer Paul Winters and accident reconstruction expert Harry J. Krueper) testified that the van blocked the street lights from illuminating the junction of the rock wall and bridge railing where Grant allegedly fell.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Since it was the placement of the van that blocked the street lights and foreseeably initiated the unfortunate sequence of events that resulted in Grant\u2019s death, Grant\u2019s negligence, if any, in driving the van to its place of rest may have been a substantial factor cause of the harm. <em>See McKenna </em>v. <em>Volkswagenwerk, </em>57 Haw. 460, 558 P.2d 1018 (1977); <em>Leary </em>v. <em>Poole, </em>5 Haw. App. 596, 705 P.2d 62 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">In their answering brief, plaintiffs appear to agree with our analysis when they state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-9\">The above factors coalesced into causing Grant\u2019s fall and subsequent death. The lane narrowness permitted van contact with the wall. Absence of a shoulder or sidewalk compelled Grant to walk upon the rock wall to view the area of van/wall contact. No chain fence prevented him from doing so. No guardrail existed to prevent a potential fall. No warning devices whatsoever described the undetectable narrowing of the rock wall surface (18\" to 8\") at the bridge rail juncture and increased height of the rail thereat. No illumination lighted the darkened area.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">Over the County\u2019s objection, the lower court gave Plaintiffs\u2019 Instruction 13A as Court\u2019s Instruction 24, which states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>The collision of the Murakami van with the rock wall may not be considered by you in determining whether Grant Murakami engaged in negligent conduct, if any, which may have been a legal cause of his fall. Such matters are not relevant in your deliberations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ac7A\">Although the County properly appealed the April 25, 1985 <em>in limine </em>order, it failed as required by Rule 28(b)(4), Hawaii Rules of Appellate Procedure, to raise Court\u2019s Instruction 24 as a point of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Since Court\u2019s Instruction 24, which precluded the jury from considering the collision of the van into the rock wall in determining Grant\u2019s contributory negligence, was not appealed, and the speed of the van covered in the April 25, 1985 <em>in limine </em>order had relevance only with respect to the collision, we need not, and do not, rule on the propriety of the <em>in limine </em>order.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">11.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">At the trial, the lower court instructed the jury in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Instruction 1, Court\u2019s Instruction 13:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-11\">The burden is on a party having to prove a claim or defense to prove every essential element of the claim or defense by a preponderance of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-12\">To \u201cestablish by a preponderance of the evidence\u201d means to prove that something is more likely so than not so. In other words, a preponderance of the evidence means such evidence as, when considered and compared with that opposed to it has[,] more convincing force and produces in your minds belief that what is sought to be proved is more likely true than not true.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-13\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Instruction 2, Court\u2019s Instruction 14:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-14\">The burden of proving that the defendant County of Maui was negligent, and that such negligence was a legal cause of the death of Grant Murakami, is on the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs must also prove their damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-15\">The burden of proving that plaintiff Grant Murakami, deceased, was negligent, and that his negligence was a legal cause of his death, is on the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-16\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Instruction 14, Court\u2019s Instruction 25 (given over objection):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADc\">In the absence of eyewitness testimony or physical evidence to the contrary, a decedent, such as Grant Murakami, is rebuttably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>presumed to have been exercising due care at the time of the occurrence giving rise to his later death and is not held to as high degree of proof as would be required of a plaintiff who could describe the occurrence himself were he alive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Court\u2019s Instruction 31 (modified and given over objection):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">In this case, in addition to denying that any negligence on its part legally caused injury to the plaintiff, the defendant claims that the plaintiff himself was negligent and that plaintiffs own negligence was a legal cause of the plaintiffs injuries. This is called contributory negligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">The burden is on the defendant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence any contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff. We conclude that Court\u2019s Instruction 25 should not have been given</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AyZ\">and that it is prejudicial error necessitating a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Court\u2019s Instruction 25, which is based on dicta contained in <em>Sherry </em>v. <em>Asing, </em>56 Haw. 135, 531 P.2d 648 (1975), is discussed in the context of amnesiacs in Annot., 88 A.L.R.3d 622 (1978). In our view, the instruction involves two distinct concepts which we will discuss separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">The first part of Court\u2019s Instruction 25 involves a rebuttable presumption of Grant\u2019s due care. We need not decide whether this presumption is of the kind described in Rule 303, Hawaii Rules of Evidence, Chapter 626, Hawaii Revised Statutes (1981) (HRE), or Rule 304, HRE, because, in either case, the instruction should not have been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">Rule 304 describes presumptions imposing the burden of proof. Being deceased, Grant was not a party. Grant\u2019s negligence was an issue raised by the County\u2019s affirmative defense, and, without the presumption, the County had the burden of proof regarding that issue. Therefore, Court\u2019s Instruction 25 was superfluous and confusing and should not have been given because \u201c[t]he policies behind a presumption are usually fully satisfied by placing the burden of persuasion upon the adversary.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Lorenzo, </em>61 Haw. 236, 247, 602 P.2d 521, 529-530 (1979). <em>See Jurman </em>v. <em>Samuel Braen, Inc., </em>47 N. J. 586, 222 A.2d 78 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">Rule 303 describes presumptions imposing the burden of producing evidence. The above discussion regarding Rule 304 is applicable here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>also. Moreover, a Rule 303 presumption disappears if and when such evidence that would support a finding of Grant\u2019s negligence was introduced. Upon the disappearance of the presumption, the giving of Court\u2019s Instruction 25 is error. Thus, the question is whether evidence was introduced that would support a finding of Grant\u2019s negligence. Upon a review of the record, our answer is yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">The second part of Court\u2019s Instruction 25 involves a reduction of the \u201cdegree of proof\u2019 required from Grant\u2019s estate. In our view, that part of the <em>Sherry </em>v. <em>Asing </em>dicta and of the cases it cites as authority<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> are wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">This case involves three claims. All three are against the County: 1) Grant\u2019s estate\u2019s claim; 2) Grant\u2019s father\u2019s claim; and 3) Grant\u2019s mother\u2019s claim. It involves no cross-claims, no counterclaims, and only one affirmative defense: the County\u2019s affirmative defense of Grant\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">It is plaintiffs\u2019 burden to prove defendant\u2019s negligence by a preponderance of the evidence. It is defendant\u2019s burden to prove plaintiff decedent\u2019s negligence (lack of due care) by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">Reasonably construed, Court\u2019s Instruction 25 contradicted Court\u2019s Instructions 13, 14, and 31; erroneously and prejudicially instructed the jury that with respect to claims 1, 2, and 3 plaintiffs did not have the burden of proof or their burden of proof was less than by a preponderance of the evidence; and erroneously and prejudically instructed the jury that with respect to the County\u2019s affirmative defense the County\u2019s burden of proof was greater than by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-11\">Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel encouraged such erroneous conclusions when in closing argument he told the jury in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-12\">Because the law recognizes someone that has died, he can\u2019t come to tell you exactly what happened, where his death occurred, unwitnessed by anybody else, as the case here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>So the law says to you that you must presume that at the time the boy fell, in this case he was exercising due care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">Why do I say that? Because I will show in relevant part the instruction that the judge is going to give you on this issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">\u201cIn the absence of eyewitness testimony or phys[i]cal evidence to the contrary, a decedent, such as Grant Murakami, is rebuttably presumed to have been exercising due care at the time of the occurrence giving rise to his later death...\u201d \u2014 and here\u2019s what\u2019s important, ladies and gentlemen \u2014 . .he is not held to as high degree of proof as would be required of a plaintiff who could describe the occurrence himself were he alive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-8\">This is one of the major principles of law that you may utilize in analyzing Grant\u2019s conduct, because despite what you were told at the beginning of the trial that each party starts out equal \u2014 we talked about that \u2014 that you had no beliefs who might be more at fault, because you hadn\u2019t heard any evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-9\">Well, that was true from your standpoint. You shouldn\u2019t ever come into this courtroom with any pre-conceived ideas that the estate was better off than the State or that Grant was better off than the State or the parents were better off than the State or the County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-10\">But you didn\u2019t know, and now you do that the law says at this point in time Grant is one up on the County. The County doesn\u2019t have any presumption of due care like that. There will be no instruction told you along this line. Only Grant Murakami, because he died and can\u2019t come to court and tell you what happened, is given the presumption that he was exercising due care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-11\">And I submit to you, they would then have to create evidence, the defense, to counter that presumption. They would have to shoulder the burden of proof to prove very clearly to you that this due care presumption should not exist. And don\u2019t do on speculation, ladies and gentlemen. Do it on evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-13\">The lower court instructed the jury in Plaintiffs\u2019 Instruction 20, Court\u2019s Instruction 35 (modified and given over objection) in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-14\">The elements of damages you may consider in making an award to the respective plaintiffs in this case are:</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"Acb\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number><em>Howard M.

Without taking into consideration reduction of any plaintiffs damages due to any negligence attributable to Grant Murakami, deceased, state the full amount of damages to be awarded to the Estate of Grant Murakami:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-11\">for the * * * present value of the future earnings as would have been earned by Grant Murakami, deceased; $450,000</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-14\">The instruction required the jury to reduce the present value of Grant\u2019s projected future earnings by his probable cost of maintaining himself and his probable family. However, question 5 of the special verdict form asked the jury to state the present value of Grant\u2019s projected future earnings without any reduction. Therefore, the jury was not asked and did not answer the relevant question.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-15\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-16\">We express no opinion on any of the County\u2019s other points on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-17\">Accordingly, the May 10, 1985 Judgment and the June 3, 1985 Amended Judgment are vacated and this case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b538-12\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Instruction 17, Court\u2019s Instruction 34 states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-13\">If you find that Grant Murakami was negligent, and that such negligence was a legal cause of his death, such negligence, if any, shall not be imputed to his surviving parents nor diminish any recovery to which you find they are entitled.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b538-14\">Originally, the bridge railing and rock wall were higher but became lower with each repavement of the road.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b542-13\"><em>Schultz </em>v. <em>Lindsay Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Erickson, </em>352 F.2d 425 (8th Cir. 1965); <em>Schechter v.
