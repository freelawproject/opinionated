The State, on the other hand, contends that because a qualified operator tested the Intoxilyzer for accuracy with a \u201cbeam attenuator\u201d at the time Defendant\u2019s breath was tested, the fondational requirement was met. We hold that the record of the case is inadequate to support the State\u2019s contention. We therefore vacate the judgment of conviction and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">After being arrested for DUI, Defendant consented to a breath test at the police station. Police officer Byron Ono (Ono), a certified operator, administered the breath test on Defendant on the Intoxilyzer. The test result indicated 0.13 percent by weight of alcohol in Defendant\u2019s blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">At the bench trial, Ono testified that in administering the test, he followed each step on the Honolulu Police Department Intoxilyzer Operational Checklist (Checklist). The Checklist includes three phases in sequence: (1) preparation, (2) testing of the subject, and (3) calibration. Ono testified that a beam attenuator was used to verify \u201cthe [Intoxilyzer] readings to be true and correct.\u201d May 16, 1986 Transcript at 39. According to Ono, he inserted the beam attenuator having a known value of \u201c.20\u201d into the Intoxilyzer. <em>Id. </em>at 31. When the Intoxilyzer tested the beam attenuator, the value obtained was 0.20 percent. \u201cThis indicated to [Ono] that the machine was calibrated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">No witness, other than Ono, testified regarding the Intoxilyzer or the beam attenuator. No criminalist testified that the Intoxilyzer was tested for accuracy with simulator solutions containing known alcohol concentrations before and after the date of Defendant\u2019s breath test.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Rolison, </em>6 Haw. App. __, 733 P.2d 326 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Souza, </em>6 Haw. App. __, 732 P.2d 253 (1987). The Intoxilyzer test result was admitted into evidence over Defendant\u2019s objection. Based on the test result of 0.13 percent, the trial court found Defendant guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\"><em>State </em>v. <em>Rolison, supra, </em>and <em>State </em>v. <em>Souza, supra, </em>clearly indicate that to meet the foundational requirements for the admission of the Intoxilyzer test result into evidence, there must be a showing of strict compliance with \u00a7 11-11 l-2(b)(3) of Chapter 111 of Title 11 of the State\u2019s Administrative Rules (Rules). That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-10\">Testing for accuracy shall be done no less frequently than every thirty (30) days and after every maintenance and repair using a minimum of two (2) reference samples of known alcohol concentrations at a known temperature within the range of one hundredths to thirty hundredths percent weight per volume (0.01 % to 0.30% W V) or higher known alcohol concentrations that are recommended by the breath testing instrument\u2019s manufacturer. The results of such analysis must agree with the reference sample value within the limits of plus or minus one hundredths percent weight per volume (\u00b10.01 % W/ V) or such limits set by the director.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">Defendant contends that there was no showing of strict compliance with \u00a7 11-111-2(b)(3). The State argues, however, that since \u201cthe beam attenuator is ... a reference sample which duplicates a specific alcohol concentration^] [i]t is more accurate than using a simulator solution to test the calibration\u201d of the Intoxilyzer. The record of the case is inadequate to support the State\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-13\">The consideration of an appeal is made \u201cbasically upon the record certified to [the appellate court by the lower court].\u201d <em>McAulton </em>v. <em>Smart, </em>54 Haw. 488, 492, 510 P.2d 93, 96 (1973). Putting it another way, a review must be based \u201cupon the evidence contained in the record, not upon matters outside of the record[.]\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Onishi, </em>53 Haw. 593, 597, 499 P.2d 657, 660 (1972). <em>See also Orso </em>v. <em>City &amp; County, </em>55 Haw. 37, 514 P.2d 859 (1973); <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>Point After, Inc., 2 </em>Haw. App. 65, 626 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>P.2d 193 (1981). And if the record is inadequate for decision on the issue presented, the appellate court will not decide the issue. <em>Tagawa </em>v. <em>Maui Publishing Co., </em>49 Haw. 675, 427 P.2d 79 (1967), <em>cert. denied, </em>396 U.S. 822, 90 S. Ct. 63, 24 L. Ed. 2d 73 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The State\u2019s argument is premised on the definition of \u201creference sample\u201d in the Rules which includes \u201clens . . . that registers on an appropriate instrument a known concentration of ethyl alcohol.\u201d \u00a7 11-111-1.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, the record contains no evidence explaining the nature of the beam attenuator and its use in conjunction with the Intoxilyzer. The State adduced no evidence at trial that the beam attenuator is a lens-like object or is operated with a lens nor expert testimony regarding its accuracy in testing the Intoxilyzer. Thus, the record is clearly inadequate for an appellate decision on the issue raised by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">It is true that for \u201cthe necessary factual basis for decision, we may consider, in addition to the facts shown in the record, such facts as the [trial] court could have judicially noticedf.]\u201d <em>McAulton </em>v. <em>Smart, </em>54 Haw. at 492, 510 P.2d at 96. <em>See also Eli </em>v. <em>State, </em>63 Haw. 474, 630 P.2d 113 (1981). In this case, however, the trial court could not have judicially noticed that the beam attenuator \u201cis a reference sample which duplicates a specific alcoholic concentration,\u201d and we cannot do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">At trial, Defendant questioned whether the utilization of a beam attenuator was an acceptable means of testing the accuracy of the Intoxilyzer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, whether the beam attenuator was an acceptable reference sample was an \u201cadjudicative fact.\u201d <em>See </em>Commentary to Rule 201, Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) (1981). This adjudicative fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>cannot be categorized as \u201cgenerally known\u201d or \u201ccapable of accurate and ready determination\u201d as required by Rule 201(b), HRE,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and, consequently, could not be judically noticed by the trial court.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Abcc\"><em>Kazuo Oyama </em>for defendant-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Ax6m\"><em>Candace Kay Andersen, </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, for plaintiffappellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">This is a case where \u201c[j]udicial notice should not be used as a device to correct on appeal an almost complete failure to present adequate evidence to the trial court.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>351 F.2d 336, 341 (2d Cir. 1965), <em>cert. denied, </em>383 U.S. 907, 86 S. Ct. 884, 15 L. Ed. 2d 662 (1966). Accordingly, we decline to do so and conclude that the State has failed to show strict compliance with \u00a7 11-111-2(b)(3) of the Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Judgment of conviction vacated and remanded for retrial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b644-21\">Hawaii Revised Statutes \u00a7 291-4(a)(2) (1985) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-22\">(a) A person commits the offense of driving under the influence of intoxicating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>liquor if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-10\">(2) The person operates or assumes actual physical control of the operation ot any vehicle with 0.10 per cent or more, by weight of alcohol in the person\u2019s blood.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b645-11\">Criminalist Milton Chang (Chang) was called and sworn as a witness after the trial court had admitted the Intoxilyzer test result into evidence over Defendant\u2019s objection. Upon Defendant\u2019s objection that Chang\u2019s testimony was not \u201cproper\u201d unless the State was \u201cadmitting there was error.\u201d the State excused Chang as a witness.
