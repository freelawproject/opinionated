Lotsof (Lotsof) appeals both the May 23, 1984 judgment and the November 20,1984 award of costs in favor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>plaintiff law firm Hoddick, Reinwald, O\u2019Connor &amp; Marrack<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (HROM). We affirm the May 23, 1984 judgment and vacate the November 20, 1984 award of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">In <em>Manley </em>v. <em>Akamai Corporation, </em>Third Circuit Civil No. 3214 (Civil 3214), the plaintiff, Jacob R. B. Manley (Manley), was represented by five successive lawyers (or law firms). HROM was the fifth counsel. Hyman Greenstein (Greenstein) was the fourth counsel. Manley agreed to pay Greenstein all of his out-of-pocket costs and a contingent fee of one-third of the recovery. Lotsof was Greenstein\u2019s salaried employee assigned to work on Manley\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">In April 1975 Lotsof used his accrued vacation time in preparation of leaving Greenstein\u2019s employ.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">By memorandum dated May 5, 1975, Greenstein wrote to Lotsof in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-8\">1. I wish to relieve you of any further duty and responsibility in the Manley case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-9\">2. Kindly list for me all of the files you do want to take with you - and we will make equitable arrangement concerning the same upon my return to the city.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">(Plaintiffs Exhibit 22.)</p>\n<p id=\"b317-11\">By letter dated May 15, 1975, Manley wrote to Greenstein as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AL_\">This letter will serve to confirm our earlier discussion and agreement this morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-12\">1 desire to retain and employ Dennis E. W. O\u2019Connor, Esq. and his associates to represent me exclusively in the above captioned matter, thereby relieving you and your firm of any further responsibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-13\">I hereby agree to reimburse you for all actual out-of-pocket expenses and costs that your firm has advanced (excepting, of course, fees for attorneys, secretarial or overhead expenses). In the event I am successful in the above captioned matter, I agree to pay you the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-14\">a. Such sum as fairly represents the work your associate Mr. Charles Lotsof has expended in the matter up to date;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>b. I agree to pay to you or assign to you 10% of the net amount received by me either by way of funds or property derived as a result of the within lawsuit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">(The term net shall be construed to be net amount received by me after deduction of all attorneys\u2019 fees.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">(Plaintiffs Exhibit 6 at 1.) Greenstein confirmed the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">When Manley hired HROM, they agreed upon a contingent attorney fee of 50%.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">On August 27, 1975 Manley settled Civil 3214 for $26,000 cash and a $75,000 secured five-year installment promissory note providing for interest at eight percent per annum. The final installment was paid on May 28, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">On September 3, 1975 Manley and HROM reduced their fee agreement to writing as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-11\">From the $26,000 cash the outstanding fees and costs of attorneys Hyman Greenstein, Allan Levin and Steve Christensen will be paid in an amount which approximates $3,200. In addition, the costs expended by O\u2019Connor and the law firm to date will be paid. The balance of the money, or approximately $22,000, will be paid to Manley.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-12\">In accordance with the terms of the settlement the $75,000 note will be held by O\u2019Connor and the law firm. All proceeds from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>note, both principal and interest will be distributed as received, 2/3 to the law firm and 1/3 to Manley. All proceeds retained by the law firm will constitute payment of legal fees by Manley at time of receipt to the law firm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">(Plaintiffs Exhibit 11 at 1-2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">By letter dated September 9, 1975 Greenstein wrote to HROM in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-7\">I would appreciate knowing the amount, nature, and form of the settlement and hereby put you on notice that we are claiming an attorney\u2019s lien in the matter in the amount as follows: Balance due on costs advanced, $1,651.16; two month\u2019s work (Mr. Lotsof), $3,000.00; plus 10 percent of the amount to be received by Mr. Manley under the settlement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">(Plaintiffs Exhibit 25.)</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">HROM responded by a letter dated September 11, 1975 stating in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-10\">I enclose our check for $1,651.16[.] <em>* * *</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-11\">Mr. Manley indicated at the time of settlement that there were additional arrangements between you and he which he would take care of himself. It was my belief when he brought the file from your office to ours that you had a firm understanding regarding fees which would not involved [sic] this office.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-12\">(Exhibit A to Plaintiffs Exhibit 40.)</p>\n<p id=\"b319-13\">On September 25, 1975 Lotsof wrote to HROM in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-14\">[I]f you think that I will put 500 hours into a case, welcome you to work with me on it when trial seems almost certain, argue a Motion in Court to enable you to join, watch you settle it cheap because you never did prepare it adequately for trial, and then let you run off with the whole fee, you are very unrealistic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-15\">The Manley case [Civil 3214] itself stood for the proposition that the person who sets up a sweet deal for others should not himself be frozen out when the others take over.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-16\">(Exhibit A to Plaintiffs Exhibit 40.)</p>\n<p id=\"b319-17\">By letter dated February 6, 1980, Greenstein wrote to Lotsof as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-18\">This is to affirm our agreement that I have assigned to you my entire claim for attorneys\u2019 fees in the aforereferenced matter on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>condition that if you are successful in realizing any monies, you shall remit to my office the first $3,000.00, representing two months of your salary while in my employ.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">(Defendant\u2019s Exhibit T.) Lotsof confirmed the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">On September 19, 1980 HROM filed a complaint for a declaratory judgment that Lotsof was not entitled to any payment from HROM. Lotsof responded with a thirteen-count counterclaim for an award of all or a portion of HROM\u2019s ethically permissible share of the recovery in Civil 3214, all of HROM\u2019s allegedly ethically impermissible share, and punitive and treble damages. Manley was not a party in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">Lotsof asserted two claims against HROM: (1) As Greenstein\u2019s assignee, he claimed the fees due Greenstein. (2) He claimed fees of $65 per hour for the 11.9 hours he worked in April 1975 when he was on his terminal vacation from Greenstein\u2019s firm, the 2.5 hours he allegedly worked from May 1, 1975 through May 15, 1975 when he was no longer employed by Greenstein, and the 13 hours he allegedly worked after May 15, 1975 when Greenstein was no longer counsel in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-11\">The lower court denied Lotsofs claims and ordered him to pay HROM costs in the amount of $2,825.28.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-13\">First, we will discuss the November 20, 1984 order requiring Lotsof to pay costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-14\">The order denying Lotsofs motion for a new trial was filed on July 10, 1984. Lotsof filed a notice of appeal on August 8, 1984. The order taxing costs was filed on November 20, 1984. Lotsof filed an \u201cAmended Notice of Appeal\u201d on November 28, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-15\">The lower court lost its jurisdiction over the case when Lotsof filed his first notice of appeal on August 8, 1984. <em>See Wisdom </em>v. <em>Pflueger, 4 </em>Haw. App. 455, 461, 667 P.2d 844, 849 (1983). Therefore, the November 20, 1984 order taxing costs is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-17\">Second, we will determine whether the doctrine of the division of the highest ethical contingency percentage to which the client contractually agreed is applicable in Hawaii. This doctrine is explained in <em>Saucier </em>v. <em>Hayes Dairy Products, Inc., on rehearing </em>373 So.2d 102 (La. 1978), as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-5\">[W]e conclude that only one contingency fee should be paid by the client, the amount of the fee to be determined according to the highest ethical contingency percentage to which the client contractually agreed in any of the contingency fee contracts which he executed. Further, that fee should in turn be allocated between or among the various attorneys involved in handling the claim in question, such fee apportionment to be on the basis of factors which are set forth in the Code of Professional Responsibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">We believe that this resolution comports with the letter and spirit of the Code of Professional Responsibility. It is an equitable solution to this problem. The amount prescribed in the contingency fee contract, not quantum meruit, is the proper frame of reference for fixing compensation for the attorney prematurely discharged without cause. We choose to vindicate the contingency fee contract rather than render it nugatory. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-7\">This solution envisions apportionment of only the highest agreed upon contingent fee in accordance with factors set forth in the Code of Professional Responsibility. Thus the fee is to be apportioned according to the respective services and contributions of the attorneys for work performed and other relevant factors. * * * [T]his solution should assure fair treatment of the client who will never be compelled to pay more than one reasonable contingency fee in an amount he has agreed to pay. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-8\">This Court should not and will not countenance the payment of duplicitious and/or excessive fees. Nor will we allow the first attorney to be denied payment of the fee to which he is entitled. Therefore if the second attorney has already collected his contingent fee, and if the client, Mr. Saucier, asserts his right to recover from the second attorney the money paid to which the attorney is not entitled, that second attorney should be ordered to restore the same to Mr. Saucier as having been a payment of a thing not due. * * * The second attorney, along with the first attorney, will then be accorded the opportunity to establish his right to receive an appropriate apportionment of the one contingent fee owed by Mr. Saucier for legal services rendered in connection with his claim.'</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 118-119.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">We find no merit in the <em>Saucier </em>doctrine. First, <em>Saucier </em>is incompati<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>ble with the <em>quantum meruit </em>rule of <em>Booker </em>v. <em>Midpac Lumber Co., Ltd., </em>65 Haw. 166, 649 P.2d 376 (1982). Second, it fails to provide for the situation where, as here, the client knowingly and voluntarily agreed to pay the subsequent attorney a contingent fee of 50% and to pay the costs and fees due the prior attorney. Third, in some cases a contingent fee of 100% or more is ethically permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">DR 2-106 and -107 of the Hawaii Code of Professional Responsibility (1981) (Code) provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-7\">DR 2-106 Fees for Legal Services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-8\">(A) A lawyer shall not enter into an agreement for, charge, or collect in an illegal or clearly excessive fee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-9\">(B) A fee is clearly excessive when, after a review of the facts, a lawyer of ordinary prudence would be left with a definite and firm conviction that the fee is in excess of a reasonable fee. Factors to be considered as guides in determining the reasonableness of a fee include the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-10\">(1) The time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-11\">(2) The likelihood, if apparent to the client, that the acceptance of the particular employment will preclude other employment by the lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-12\">(3) The fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-13\">(4) The amount involved and the results obtained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-14\">(5) The time limitations imposed by the client or by the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-15\">(6) The nature and length of the professional relationship with the client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-16\">(7) The experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-17\">(8) Whether the fee is fixed or contingent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-18\">(C) A lawyer shall not enter into an arrangement for, charge, or collect a contingent fee for representing a defendant in a criminal case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-19\">Under the Code, a fee based on hourly rates or <em>quantum meruit </em>may exceed the amount of the client\u2019s recovery. Likewise, in cases where the value of the recovery is less than the value of the ethically permissible fee, a contingent fee of 100% or more than 100% of the client\u2019s recovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>is ethically permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Moreover, the factors outlined in DR 2-106 are expressly not exclusive. In our view, the law of supply and demand is also a legitimate factor. Here, Manley was more interested in contracting for O\u2019Connor\u2019s services than O\u2019Connor was in contracting to serve Manley.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Third, we will review Lotsofs entitlement to recovery as Greenstein\u2019s assignee.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">Originally, Manley agreed to pay Greenstein a contingent fee of one-third. When Manley discharged Greenstein, he agreed to pay Greenstein (a) a reasonable fee for Lotsofs services and (b) 10% of his net recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">When an attorney who is employed on a contingent fee contract is discharged without fault on his part before the happening of the contingency, the contingent fee contract is ended and the attorney is entitled to an award of the reasonable value of his services as agreed upon or as determined by the court under the guidelines of <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>Hui Wahine, Inc., </em>49 Haw. 241, 413 P.2d 242 (1966), but in the exercise of its discretion. <em>Booker </em>v. <em>Midpac Lumber Co., Ltd., supra. </em>Under this rule, Greenstein was entitled to the reasonable value of his and Lotsofs services, and Manley\u2019s agreement to pay Greenstein 10% of Manley\u2019s net recovery was enforceable only to the extent the actual dollar amount it represented did not exceed the reasonable value of Greenstein\u2019s services. In our view, however, the percentage fee agreed upon after the discharge is presumptively reasonable and a party alleging that it exceeds that reasonable value of the prior services has the burden of proof on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">Fourth, we will review Lotsofs entitlement to recovery from H ROM for his services in Civil 3214 during his terminal vacation from Green-stein\u2019s employ and thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">In the lower court, Lotsof asserted many theories to support that portion of his claim against HROM. He appears to appeal only the denial of his theories of joint venture, implied contract, and unjust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>enrichment.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Upon a review of the record, we find no error in the denial of recovery for his post-Greenstein services under any theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">Fifth, we will review Lotsofs entitlement as Greenstein\u2019s assignee to any portion of the attorney fee Manley paid to HROM.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">A. Initially, we will review Lotsofs entitlement to that portion of HROM\u2019s fee that was unquestionably ethically permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">As noted in section IV above, Lotsof failed in his effort to prove any basis for his claim of entitlement to HROM\u2019s ethically permissible fees. Therefore, the lower court did not err in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">B. Secondly, we will review Lotsofs entitlement to the portion of HROM\u2019s fee that was allegedly ethically impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-12\">Any attorney who receives more than an ethically permissible fee from a client holds the excess in trust for the client\u2019s account. Any former attorney for the client in the case may require the trustee-attorney to remit all or part of the excess to him when by the client\u2019s agreement or judgment against the client he proves his unsatisfied entitlement to a specific amount of ethically permissible costs and fees in the case from the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-13\">Here, however, the lower court found that HROM\u2019s fee in this case was ethically permissible. Upon a review of the record, we find no error in that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-14\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-15\">Sixth, we will determine whether the lower court erred in refusing to enforce Lotsofs attorney\u2019s lien which he acquired by assignment from Greenstein.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-16\">On September 9, 1975 Greenstein advised HROM of his attorney\u2019s lien claim for fees. On February 6, 1980 Greenstein assigned his lien claim to Lotsof. However, HROM subsequently disbursed proceeds to Manley without satisfying Greenstein\u2019s or Lotsofs lien for fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-17\">Hawaii recognizes the right of a discharged attorney who served under a contingent fee agreement to assert a charging lien for costs advanced and reasonable attorney fees against his former client\u2019s recovery in the case. <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Miyashiro, </em>50 Haw. 413, 441 P.2d 638 (1968).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number><em>See also </em>7 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Attorneys at Law </em>\u00a7\u00a7 324-327 (1981). Thus, after Greenstein asserted his lien against Manley\u2019s portion of the recovery, HROM held Manley\u2019s portion of the recovery subject to the lien. On the other hand, HROM was not obligated to pay the lien until the lienor established by Manley\u2019s agreement or judgment against Manley the lienor\u2019s unsatisfied entitlement to a specific amount of ethically permissible costs and fees from Manley.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AhU\"><em>Charles S. Lotsof, </em>appellant pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A_t\"><em>Alexander C. Marrack (James R. Moore </em>and <em>Wesley H.H. Ching </em>with him on the brief; <em>Hoddick, Reinwald, O\u2019Connor &amp; Marrack </em>of counsel) for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">HROM paid the lien for costs. Lotsof asserted a lien for fees in two categories: (1) as Greenstein\u2019s assignee and (2) for his services during and after his terminal vacation from Greenstein\u2019s employ. With regard to category (2), Lotsof did not prove that Manley owed him anything for those services. There is no evidence in the record that Manley agreed to pay for these services. Moreover, the lower court found that Lotsof performed no work after April 30, 1975 that materially assisted HROM in the preparation and prosecution of the case. With regard to category (1), Lotsof did not prove the specific amount due. Since Lotsof failed to prove all of the material elements of his lien claim, the lower court did not err in refusing to enforce Lotsofs lien.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Accordingly, the May 23,1984judgment is affirmed. The November 20, 1984 order taxing costs is vacated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b317-15\">In 1975 plaintiff law firm Hoddick, Reinwald, O\u2019Connor &amp; Marrack was known as Anthony, Hoddick, Reinwald &amp; O\u2019Connor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b318-13\">In his deposition, which was introduced in evidence, Manley testified in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-14\">Q. Was Mr. O\u2019Connor interested in taking the case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-15\">A. I don\u2019t think he was aggressively interested in it at the time. He indicated interest. I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t need another client. 1 felt that I needed O\u2019Connor more than he needed me, so I was aggressive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-16\">1 let him know that I would be interested in making an exceptional proposal to him to get his ability in this, to get him in this litigation I was involved in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-17\">And then 1 proposed \u2014 I guess after we discussed it back and forth, I proposed a 50 percent contingency with Mr. O\u2019Connor, plus costs, plus his costs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-18\">Q. [I]n your discussions with Mr. O\u2019Connor, did you inform Mr. O\u2019Connor that you would take responsibility for paying your other lawyers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-19\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-20\">Plaintiffs Exhibit 40 at 19-23.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b325-10\">The court in <em>Carroll </em>noted that the order of substitution should be conditioned upon immediate reimbursement by the client to the outgoing attorney of court costs advanced. Apparently, that instruction was not followed when HROM replaced Greenstein in Civil 3214.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b325-11\">In our view, Lotsof confused \u201cowed\u201d with \u201cpaid.\u201d Lotsof thought that Manley had \u201cpaid\u201d all he should but that some of what Manley \u201cpaid\u201d to HROM should have gone to Lotsof instead of HROM. However, the fact that Manley overpaid HROM did not mean that Manley did not \u201cowe\u201d Lotsof. It only meant that HROM owed Manley, and Lotsof had an alternative source of payment. If Manley did not \u201cowe\u201d Lotsof, then Lotsof had no basis for a lien against the amount HROM owed Manley.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
