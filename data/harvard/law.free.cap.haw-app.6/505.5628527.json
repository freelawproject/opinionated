(P &amp; S) (collectively Plaintiffs) appeal from (1) the summary judgment in favor of defendant City and County of Honolulu (City)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Francis Keala (Keala) and (2) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>judgment based on the jury\u2019s special verdict in favor of defendants Modesto Ramos, Jr. (Ramos) and Robert Burns (Burns). Plaintiffs contend that (1) the trial court erred in granting the summary judgment because there were genuine issues of material fact for the jury to resolve and (2) the erroneous granting of certain motions in limine resulted in the unfavorable verdict and judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">This is basically an alleged police brutality case arising out of an incident that occurred in the early morning hours on July 5, 1980, in Wahiawa, Oahu. Ramos and Burns are police officers with the Honolulu Police Department (HPD). Keala was then the HPD\u2019s chief of police.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">On June 29, 1982, Plaintiffs filed a five-count complaint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Count I alleged that Ramos and Burns \u201cintentionally, willfully and maliciously attacked and beat Plaintiffs Meyer, Wood and Pustka, without provocationf.]\u201d Count II alleged that Ramos and Burns arrested Meyer and Wood without \u201cprobable cause or an arrest warrant[.]\u201d Count III alleged that Ramos and Burns \u201cviolated 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985\u201d by \u201cdepriving Plaintiffs of their civil rights while acting under color of state law,\u201d and that the City was responsible for their acts \u201cunder the theory of respondent [sic] superior.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Count IV alleged that the City and Keala were negligent in retaining Ramos on the police force despite \u201cnumerous charges of brutality\u201d filed and disciplinary action taken against him. Count V alleged that because of the tortious acts of Ramos and Burns, P &amp; S \u201clost the services of its employees Meyer and Wood, and suffered special damagesf.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">On November 28, 1984, the trial court granted defendants\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment as to: (1) all claims against Keala, (2) the 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim against the City, and (3) the 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985 claim against all defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">On the morning of March 25, 1985 when trial was scheduled to begin, defense counsel filed five motions in limine which the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>granted in most part. Thereafter, the jury trial commenced. After Plaintiffs rested, the court directed a verdict in Burns\u2019 favor on Wood\u2019s assault and 'battery claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On April 3, 1985, the jury rendered a favorable verdict for Ramos and Burns. After judgment was entered on the verdict, Plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">We will first discuss Plaintiffs\u2019 challenge of the in limine orders and then examine the summary judgment in favor of Keala and the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">1. EVIDENCE OF TERMINATION OF PRIOR CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">Plaintiffs contend the trial court erred in granting the defense motion in limine \u201cwhich precluded evidence that charges against Meyer were dropped from being presented to the jury\u201d on the basis that such evidence was admissible to show \u201cgood grounds for a subsequent malicious prosecution action by the supposed defendant.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">Plaintiffs\u2019 contention would have been correct if Meyer had a pending claim for malicious prosecution, an essential element of which would be \u201cthat the prior proceedings were terminated in the [plaintiffs] favor[.]\u201d <em>Brodie </em>v. <em>Hawaii Automotive Retail Gasoline Dealers Ass\u2019n, Inc., 2 </em>Haw. App. 316, 318, 631 P.2d 600, 602 (1981), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>65 Haw. 598, 655 P.2d 863 (1982). However, the trial court ruled Meyer had \u201cno claim for malicious prosecution,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Transcript by Nakata, Vol. I at 10, and Meyer has not appealed this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">Meyer alleged a claim for false arrest. Since \u201ca person who is falsely arrested is at the same time falsely imprisoned,\u201d false arrest and false imprisonment as tort claims are \u201cdistinguishable only in terminology.\u201d 32 Am. Jur. 2d <em>False Imprisonment </em>\u00a7 2 at 59 (1982). For both false arrest and false imprisonment, the essential elements are \u201c(1) the detention or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>restraint of one against his will, and (2) the unlawfulness of such detention or restraint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 5. <em>See also </em>W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, <em>Law of Torts, </em>\u00a7 11 (5th ed. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Favorable termination of prior criminal proceedings in favor of the plaintiff is not an element of false arrest. Therefore, the fact that charges against Meyer were dropped in the prior criminal proceeding was not admissible into evidence and the trial court did not err. <em>See Leong </em>v. <em>Honolulu Rapid Transit, </em>52 Haw. 138, 472 P.2d 505 (1970); <em>Ferreira </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., 4 </em>Haw. App. 12, 657 P.2d 1066 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">II. EVIDENCE OF CONSPIRACY</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Plaintiffs next contend the trial court erred in granting the defense motion in limine precluding \u201ctestimony as to appellees\u2019 conspiracy to violate appellants\u2019 civil rights from being presented to the jury.\u201d This contention is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">The only allegation of conspiracy in the complaint appears in count III regarding violation of Meyer\u2019s and Wood\u2019s civil rights. Paragraph 20(c) alleges that \u201cDefendants... [initiated, aided and conspired for the malicious and unfounded criminal prosecution of Plaintiff Wood[.]\u201d At the time the trial court granted the motion in limine, the City and Keala had already prevailed on the 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> claims byway of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">Thus, Plaintiffs were properly precluded from presenting any evidence of conspiracy involving the City and Keala. The record discloses that Plaintiffs were permitted to elicit a complete range of testimony of Ramos\u2019 and Burns\u2019 acts, individually and in concert, statements, and feelings regarding the arrest of Meyer and the arrest and prosecution of Wood. Consequently, if the trial court\u2019s in limine order was wrong with respect to Ramos and Burns, there was no prejudicial effect and such error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>III. EVIDENCE OF FUTURE DAMAGES</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Citing <em>McKeague </em>v. <em>Talbert, </em>3 Haw. App. 646, 658 P.2d 898 (1983), Plaintiffs claim the trial court erred in granting the defense motion in limine excluding \u201cevidence of Meyer\u2019s permanent and future damages\u201d from being presented to the jury by other than a medical expert since Meyer\u2019s damages were \u201cplainly apparent.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\"><em>McKeague </em>is distinguishable. In <em>McKeague, </em>the defendant objected to the jury instruction on future damages, claiming a lack of expert testimony \u201cestablishing future pain and suffering as a reasonable medical probability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>3 Haw. App. at 658, 658 P.2d at 907. However, a neurologist, who had treated the plaintiff, testified that the plaintiff \u201cwould achieve relatively complete recovery within four to eight months\u201d after the plaintiffs medical examination which occurred on September 15, 1980. <em>Id. </em>3 Haw. App. at 659, 658 P.2d at 908. The trial began on February 4, 1981. This court held the neurologist\u2019s testimony \u201csufficient for the jury to find that plaintiff would continue to face pain and suffering at least until the time [the neurologist] indicated probable complete recoveryf.]\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">Here, in their November 28, 1984 \u201cAmended Pre-Trial Statement\u201d Plaintiffs listed Noboru Oishi, M.D. (Dr. Oishi), as \u201cMeyer\u2019s physician\u201d who would testify \u201cas to Plaintiff Meyer\u2019s injuries and damages.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, at the December 10, 1984 deposition, Dr. Oishi was asked whether Meyer had sustained any kind of permanent injury as a result of the July 5, 1980 incident. Dr. Oishi testified that Meyer was \u201cpretty well recovered.\u201d Deposition of Dr. Oishi at 45. Unlike <em>McKeague </em>where the plaintiffs suffering still existed at the time of trial and was diagnosed to last probably three-and-one-half months longer, Meyer was \u201cpretty well recovered\u201d when the motion in limine was filed on March 25, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">Therefore, we find no abuse of discretion<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in the trial court\u2019s ruling to exclude the admission of evidence of Meyer\u2019s permanent and future <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>damages in the absence of expert testimony substantiating the claim. <em>See Bachran </em>v. <em>Morishige, 52 </em>Haw. 61, 469 P.2d 808 (1970); <em>Franco </em>v. <em>Fujimoto, </em>47 Haw. 408, 390 P.2d 740 (1964) (overruled in part on other grounds, <em>Barretto </em>v. <em>Akau, </em>51 Haw. 383, 393, 463 P.2d 917, 923 (1969)).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">IV. CHARACTER EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Plaintiffs argue the trial court erred in granting the defense motion in limine excluding evidence of \u201cthe very violent reputations and characters\u201d of Ramos and Burns. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">The motion in limine sought to exclude evidence of \u201cRamos\u2019 and Burns\u2019 alleged propensities for violent or belligerent conduct\u201d through \u201c[sjpecific instances of violent or belligerent acts allegedly committed by Defendants Ramos and Burns . . . including . . . other civil lawsuits, Honolulu Police Commission complaints, and complaints made to the Honolulu Police Department.\u201d In their memorandum in opposition, Plaintiffs cited <em>Feliciano </em>v. <em>City &amp; County, </em>62 Haw. 88, 611 P.2d 989 (1980), and argued that such evidence was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">In <em>Feliciano, </em>the supreme court held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-9\">It is well-settled that evidence of the good or bad character of either party to a civil action is generally inadmissible. ... In civil actions for assault and battery, however, there are two firmly established exceptions to the rule. First, where a defendant in a civil action for assault and battery pleads self-defense, he may introduce evidence of the plaintiffs reputation for violent behavior if he proves it was known to him. ... Second, irrespective of previous knowledge, where in a civil action for assault there is an issue as to who committed the first act of aggression, evidence of the good or bad reputation of both plaintiff and defendant for peacefulness is also admissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIc\"><em>Id. </em>62 Haw. at 91-92, 611 P.2d at 991-92 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">Plaintiffs claim the \u201ckey question\u201d in this case is \u201c \u2018who struck the first blow?* \u201d Consequently, they assert <em>Feliciano\u2019s </em>second exception is applicable and character evidence of good or bad reputation is admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">Since the <em>Feliciano </em>decision, the Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE), Act 164, 1980 Haw. Sess. Laws (Special Pamphlet), became effective on January 1, 1981. We must therefore apply, not the <em>Feliciano </em>exception, but Rule 404, HRE, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-12\">Character evidence not admissible to prove conduct; exceptions; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>other crimes, (a) Character evidence generally. Evidence of a person\u2019s character or a trait of his character is not admissible for the purpose of proving that he acted in conformity therewith on a particular occasion, except:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-6\">(1) Character of accused. Evidence of a pertinent trait of his character offered by an accused, or by the prosecution to rebut the same;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-7\">(2) Character of victim. Evidence of a pertinent trait of character of the victim of the crime offered by an accused, or by the prosecution to rebut the same, or evidence of a character trait of peacefulness of the victim offered by the prosecution in a homicide case to rebut evidence that the victim was the first aggressor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-8\">(3) Character of witness. Evidence of the character of a witness, as provided in rules 607, 608, 609, and 609.1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-9\">(b) Other crimes, wrongs, or acts. Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible where such evidence is probative of any other fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, modus operandi, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">Rule 404(a) bars character evidence in civil actions \u201cwhen offered circumstantially to prove likelihood of particular conduct on a particular occasion.\u201d Rule 404 Commentary. Putting it another way, the \u201ccircumstantial use of character\u201d is not permitted. C. McCormick, <em>Law of Evidence </em>\u00a7 188 at 554 (3d ed. E. Cleary 1984). Exceptions (1) and (2) in Rule 404(a) allow the circumstantial use of character. However, because of the use of the words \u201caccused\u201d and \u201cprosecutor\u201d and in view of the Rule 404 Commentary, those exceptions are applicable in criminal cases only.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See </em>2 J. Weinstein &amp; M. Berger, <em>Weinstein\u2019s Evidence </em>(1985). We therefore hold that Rule 404(a) has abrogated <em>Feliciano\u2019s </em>second exception and Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on <em>Feliciano </em>was misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Moreover, Rule 404(b) precludes the use of \u201cevidence of any specific instance of conduct . . . when the only relevance is in the two-step inference from \u2018other\u2019 conduct to general character and then \u2018to show that he acted in conformity therewith\u2019 on the occasion in question.\u201d Rule 404 Commentary. When evidence of \u201cother crimes, wrongs, or acts\u201d are offered for specified purposes other than mere character and propensity, Rule 404(b) provides that it <em>\u201cmay </em>be admissible provided the Rule 403 test is met.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Here, the in limine order properly excluded evidence of \u201cother crimes, wrongs, or acts\u201d to be used to prove Ramos\u2019 and Burns\u2019 character and propensity for violence from which to inferentially show that in conformance with such character and propensity they committed the assaultive acts on July 5, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Rule 404 \u201cdoes not deal with the situation where the character of a person is itself an element of a claim or defense.\u201d Rule 404 Commentary. In other words, \u201ccharacter in issue\u201d is beyond the scope of Rule 404. 22 C. Wright &amp; K. Graham, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure: <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 5235 (1978). Further, Rule 405(b) expressly provides that proof of \u201cspecific instances of his conduct\u201d may be made where \u201ccharacter or a trait of character of a person is an essential element of a charge, claim, or defensef.]\u201d However, in this case, the character of violence or aggressiveness of Ramos or Burns was not an essential element of a claim of assault and battery or defense of self-defense. The character was simply probative of an element of the claim or defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting the motion in limine regarding the character evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">V. SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON NEGLIGENCE CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">Plaintiffs contend generally that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the City and Keala. Because summary judgment was granted regarding all claims against Keala, we assume that Plaintiffs are challenging the summary judgment in Keala\u2019s favor on the count IV negligence claim. However, Plaintiffs have not argued this point in their briefs. In arguing that summary judgment was improper, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Plaintiffs cite four cases: <em>Brandon </em>v. <em>Holt, </em>469 U.S. 464, 105 S. Ct. 873, 83 L. Ed. 2d 878 (1985); <em>Monell </em>v. <em>New York Dept. of Social Services, </em>436 U.S. 658, 98 S. Ct. 2018, 56 L. Ed. 2d 611 (1978); <em>Anthony </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>767 F.2d 657 (10th Cir. 1985); and <em>Rymer </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>754 F.2d 198 (6th Cir. 1984). All of these cases involve 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> not negligence claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">We therefore hold that Plaintiffs have waived this contention. <em>See Quality Furniture, Inc. v. Hay, </em>61 Haw. 89, 595 P.2d 1066 (1979); <em>Johnson v. Robert\u2019s Hawaii Tour, Inc., 4 </em>Haw. App. 175, 664 P.2d 262 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Regarding the City, it did not seek nor obtain a summary judgment on the negligence count. However, Plaintiffs abandoned their negligence claim against the City by failing to assert that claim at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">VI. SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">Plaintiffs assert the trial court erroneously granted the City and Keala summary judgment on the 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> claim under count III.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The jury verdict finding that neither Ramos nor Burns was liable regarding the violation of Meyer\u2019s and Wood\u2019s constitutional rights claim renders this assertion moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">A municipality has no \u00a7 1983 liability under the doctrine of respondeat superior. <em>Monell </em>v. <em>New York City Dept. of Social Services, supra. </em>\u201c[I]t is liable only if its employees deprived plaintiff of [his] constitutional rights pursuant to a policy or custom of the city.\u201d <em>Varela </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>746 F.2d 1413, 1418 (10th Cir. 1984). Since the jury found that Ramos <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>and Burns did not deprive Meyer and Wood of their constitutional rights, <em>a fortiori, </em>the City cannot be liable under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Asq\"><em>Fred Paul Benco </em>for plaintiffs-appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A5xD\"><em>James R. Aiona, Jr., </em>Deputy Corporation Counsel, for defendantsappellees.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Regarding Keala, if count III alleges a \u00a7 1983 claim against him, it is in his official capacity as chief of police. In his official capacity, Keala\u2019s position is like that of the City. <em>See Brandon </em>v. <em>Holt, supra. </em>Like the City, Keala cannot be liable under \u00a7 1983 if police officers Ramos and Burns were not liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">VII. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the summary judgment in favor of the City and Keala and the judgment based on the jury verdict in favor of Ramos and Burns.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b526-19\">The appeal is also from the summary judgment in favor of the Honolulu Police Department (HPD). \u201c[T]he legislature duly delegated the administration of police . . . matters... to the counties,\u201d <em>Hawaii Government Employees' Ass'n </em>v. <em>County of Maui, </em>59 Haw. 65, 79, 576 P.2d 1029, 1038 (1978), and under article VI, chapters 1 and 6, of the Revised Charter of the City &amp; County of Honolulu (1984 ed.), the HPD is a department placed under the supervision of the managing director of the City and County of Honolulu (City). Not being an independent legal entity, the HPD should have been dismissed as a separate defendant. All liability charged against the HPD would be charged against defendant City. See <em>Waller v. Butkovich, </em>584 F. Supp. 909, 925 (M.D.N.C. 1984). Thus, in this opinion, the claim against the HPD is treated as a claim against the City.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b527-9\">The counts were titled as follows: \u201cCOUNT I - CIVIL ASSAULT AND BATTERY,\u201d \u201cCOUNT II - FALSE ARREST,\u201d \u201cCOUNT III - VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS,\u201d \u201cCOUNT IV - NEGLIGENCE,\u201d and \u201cCOUNT V - INTENTIONAL INTERFERENCE WITH CONTRACTUAL RELATIONS.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b527-10\">Although Count III does not specifically name defendant Francis Keala (Keala), the use of the word \u201cDefendants\u201d in the count may be deemed to include Keala.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b528-11\">The directed verdict was based on the testimony of plaintiff Abel Wood, Jr. (Wood) that it was Officer Ramos rather than Officer Burns who had assaulted him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b528-12\">The trial court ruled that Wood alleged a claim for malicious prosecution and denied the motion in limine as to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-13\">We deplore Plaintiffs\u2019 sloppy pleading practice. Although they had. specifically titled each of the five counts in the complaint, <em>see </em>note 2, <em>supra, </em>Plaintiffs later convinced the trial court that the complaint alleged, as to Wood, claims for malicious prosecution, conspiracy to maliciously prosecute, and false imprisonment without even amending the complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b529-10\"> 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985 (1982) is titled \u201cConspiracy to interfere with civil rights\u201d and under subsection (3) thereof, a person deprived of his civil rights by the conspiracies of private persons has a right of action for damages against any one or more of the conspirators.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">Conspiracy claims can also be made under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>See Briley </em>v. <em>California, </em>564 F.2d 849 (9th Cir. 1977); <em>Rundle v.
