(Plaintiff), appeals from the judgments awarding attorney\u2019s fees to Defendants-Appellees, Blair, Ltd. (Blair) and R. Baird &amp; Co., Inc. (Baird) (where appropriate, Blair and Baird will hereinafter be collectively referred to as Defendants), entered on November 25, 1985, and December 2, 1985, respectively.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-13\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b453-14\">Plaintiff was in the business of manufacturing and selling \u201cHawaiian\u201d kukui nut<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> leis and jewelry made in Hawaii. In May 1984, Plaintiff filed for reorganization under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>On September 13, 1984, Plaintiff filed a complaint and motion for preliminary injunction against Defendants and numerous other business establishments and individuals,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> alleging that the defendants had injured its reputation and its business of selling \u201cauthentic\u201d \u201cHawaiian\u201d kukui nut leis, by distributing and selling leis that were not made from \u201cHawaiian\u201d kukui nuts but from other nuts not grown or prepared for sale in Hawaii. Plaintiff specifically alleged 21 causes of action, ranging from negligence to copyright infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Up to the time of the judgments appealed from, the trial court had levied against Plaintiff numerous sanctions for attorney\u2019s fees and costs totalling approximately $12,000.00 for \u201cdiscovery abuses.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">On May 16, 1985, Plaintiff filed a Rule 54(b), Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) (1981), motion seeking to have those sanction orders and other orders and/or judgments finalized for appeal purposes.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At the May 31, 1985 hearing on the motion the trial court heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>argument from counsel, and an oral motion by defendant Ritz Department Stores for an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred in opposing Plaintiffs Rule 54(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">On June 17, 1985, the trial court filed a written order denying Plaintiffs motion, holding that there was a total lack of justification for the Rule 54(b) certification. The order further stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-6\">2. In accordance with Section 603-21.9(6), Hawaii Revised Statutes, and to promote justice in the matters pending before the Court, the motions by the respective opposing parties for an award of their reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs incurred in connection with opposing plaintiffs said motion for 54(b) certification, be and hereby are GRANTED. Said award of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees in favor of each of the respective opposing parties shall not exceed $150.00 apiece, and shall be proven by affidavit submitted by the respective attorneys for each of the opposing parties setting forth the hours worked, description of the work performed, hourly billing rates and description and amount of costs incurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Pursuant to the order, Defendants Blair and Baird filed motions to enter judgments in their favor for attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $150 each. The motions were granted and the judgments entered on November 25,1985, and December 2,1985, respectively. Plaintiff filed its notice of appeal from those two judgments on December 26, 1985.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">The dispositive issue in this appeal is whether the trial court abused its discretion in imposing the sanction of awarding attorney\u2019s fees to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>Defendants. Plaintiff argues that there is no legal basis for the trial court\u2019s order awarding attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">The general rule in this jurisdiction is that attorney\u2019s fees and costs may not be awarded absent statute, agreement, stipulation, or precedent authorizing the allowance thereof. <em>Wohlschlegel </em>v. <em>Uhlmann-Kihei, Inc., 4 </em>Haw. App. 123, 135, 662 P.2d 505, 513 (1983); <em>Smothers </em>v. <em>Renander, 2 </em>Haw. App. 400, 633 P.2d 556 (1981); <em>Cuerva &amp; Associates </em>v. <em>Wong, </em>1 Haw. App. 194, 616 P.2d 1017 (1980). The applicable standard of review for the reasonableness of an allowance or award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs where authorized is abuse of discretion. <em>Booker </em>v. <em>Midpac Lumber Co., Ltd., </em>65 Haw. 166, 171, 649 P.2d 376, 380 (1982). \u201cIn a legal sense discretion is abused whenever in the exercise of its discretion the court exceeds the bounds of reason, all of the circumstances before it being considered.\u201d <em>Ariyoshi </em>v. <em>HPERB, </em>5 Haw. App. 533, 542, 704 P.2d 917, 925 (1985), citing <em>Berry v. Chaplin, </em>74 Cal. App. 2d 669, 169 P.2d 453, 456 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">Although the trial court possesses inherent power to do those things necessary for the proper administration of justice, <em>Barks </em>v. <em>White, </em>365 N.W.2d 640 (Iowa App. 1985); <em>Roadway Express, Inc. </em>v. <em>Piper, </em>447 U.S. 752, 100A S.Ct. 2455, 65 L.Ed.2d 488 (1980); <em>Jacuzzi </em>v. <em>Jacuzzi Bros., Inc., </em>243 Cal. App. 2d 1, 52 Cal. Rptr. 147 (1966), including the power to issue contempt sanctions, <em>Cooke </em>v. <em>United States, </em>267 U.S. 517, 539, 45 S.Ct. 390, 395, 69 L.Ed. 767, 775 (1925), impose sanctions for discovery abuses, <em>Barks v. White, supra, </em>and assess attorney\u2019s fees for abusive litigation practices, <em>Roadway Express, Inc. </em>v. <em>Piper, supra, </em>\u201c[bjecause inherent powers are shielded from direct democratic controls, they must be exercised with restraint and discretion.\u201d <em>Roadway Express, Inc. </em>v. <em>Piper, </em>447 U.S. at 764, 100A S.Ct. at 2463, 65 L.Ed.2d at 500.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">In <em>Roadway Express, Inc., supra, </em>the supreme court stated that a finding that counsel\u2019s conduct \u201cconstituted or was tantamount to bad faith\u201d was a necesssary precedent to any sanction of attorney\u2019s fees under the court\u2019s inherent powers. <em>Id. </em>447 U.S. at 767, 100A S.Ct. at 2465, 65 L.Ed. at 502. We adopt the bad faith requirement set forth in <em>Roadway </em>as a limitation on the trial courts\u2019 inherent powers to impose sanctions of attorney\u2019s fees for abusive litigation practices, and we will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>review the lower court\u2019s action for abuse of discretion in light of that limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">The parties have not cited us to any authority for or against a court\u2019s authority to impose sanctions for bringing a Rule 54(b) motion. The imposition of sanctions against a party for abusive actions during discovery proceedings is authorized by Rule 37, HRCP (1981). However, the trial court\u2019s exercise of that authority is subject to review for abuse of discretion. <em>Harada </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>60 Haw. 467, 591 P.2d 1060 (1979); <em>Lothspeich </em>v. <em>Fong, </em>6 Haw. App. __, 711 P.2d 1310 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">In the instant case, the trial court relied on Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 603-21.9(6) (1976) for the award of attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> HRS \u00a7 603-21.9(6) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-9\">Powers. The several circuit courts shall have power:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-11\">(6) To make and award such judgments, decrees, orders, and mandates, issue such executions and other processes, and do such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>other acts and take such other steps as may be necessary to carry into full effect the powers which are or shall be given to them by law or for the promotion of justice in matters pending before them.</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"AW4\"><em>William H. Lawson </em>for plaintiff-appellant Kukui Nuts of Hawaii, Inc.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AbHN\"><em>Michiro Iwanaga (Barry M. Kurren </em>with him on the brief; <em>Burke, Sakai, McPheeters, Bordner &amp; Gilardy </em>of counsel) for defendantappellee R. Baird &amp; Co., Inc.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">In our view, HRS \u00a7 603-21.9(6) is merely a legislative restatement of the inherent powers doctrine, and the exercise of the powers set forth there is subject to the abuse of discretion standard of review. There is nothing in the sanction order or in the record to indicate bad faith by Plaintiffs counsel in bringing the Rule 54(b) motion. <em>Roadway Express, Inc., supra. </em>The lower court\u2019s reliance on HRS \u00a7 603-21.9(6) is couched in language too general in nature to constitute the requisite finding. We conclude, therefore, that the lower court abused its discretion in awarding attorney\u2019s fees and entering the judgments appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">We reject Defendants\u2019 argument that the lower court imposed the sanctions on account of previous discovery misconduct by Plaintiff. There is nothing in the record to intimate that that was the reason for the lower court\u2019s actions, and the argument is little more than conjecture. Moreover, the lower court had already imposed sanctions against Plaintiff for that alleged misconduct and we cannot say that it intended to impose additional sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Plaintiff also argues that it was unconstitutional and a violation of due process of law to award attorney\u2019s fees in these circumstances. In view of our holding that the award of attorney\u2019s fees was an abuse of discretion, it is not necessary to discuss that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b453-15\">The judgments are appealable as collateral orders. <em>Harada v.

HRS \u00a7 607-14.5 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-13\">(a) In any civil action in this State where a party seeks money, damages or injunctive relief, or both, against another party, and the case is subsequently decided, the court may. as it deems just, assess against either party, and enter as part of its order, for which execution may issue, a reasonable sum for attorneys\u2019fees, in an amount to be determined by the court upon a specific finding that the party\u2019s claim was completely frivolous; provided the amount shall not exceed twenty-five per cent of any amount originally prayed for by the party assessed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-14\">(b) In determining the award of attorneys\u2019 fees and the amounts to be awarded, the court must find in writing that all claims made by the party are completely frivolous and are totally unsupported by the facts and the law in the civil action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-15\">However, the trial court here merely concluded that there was a \u201ctotal absence of the finding necessary for the designation of final and appealable judgments\u201d pursuant to Rule 54(b). The court did not make a specific finding as required in HRS \u00a7 607-14.5(b) that the claims were \u201ccompletely frivolous\u201d and \u201ctotally unsupported by the facts and the law in the civil action.\u201d Defendants\u2019 reliance on the statute is misplaced. We cannot from the record supply the finding for the lower court. Moreover, attorney\u2019s fees are not to be awarded under the statute until the case is decided. Here, the case is not decided.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
