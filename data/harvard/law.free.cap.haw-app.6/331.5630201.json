We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"A6y\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">After Defendant\u2019s conviction in criminal no. 52574, his trial counsel appealed,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> raising ten points of error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The supreme court affirmed Defendant\u2019s conviction in a memorandum opinion entered December 14i 1981, in which only one of Defendant\u2019s points of error was discussed. In.disposing of Defendant\u2019s other arguments in that appeal, the supreme court stated it had carefully reviewed the record of the proceedings and found no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">On September 28, 1984, Defendant, acting <em>prose, </em>filed his Petition, which the circuit court granted after a hearing. In its order the circuit court held that Defendant was denied effective assistance of counsel in his first appeal, because appellate counsel failed to allege as an issue on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>appeal the trial judge\u2019s denial of Defendant\u2019s motion to <em>voir dire </em>the prospective jurors in criminal no. 52574 individually as to details of pre-trial publicity about the case to which the jurors had been exposed. The circuit court held that the failure to raise the issue \u201cconstituted an omission which was the result of unprofessional or incompetent judgment.\u201d The circuit court also concluded that had the issue been raised on appeal there was a reasonable probability that Defendant\u2019s conviction would have been reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">State argues that (1) the circuit court did not have jurisdiction to hear Defendant\u2019s Petition; and (2) since the trial judge did not err in limiting the <em>voir dire </em>of the prospective trial jurors. Defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel, either at trial or on appeal. We disagree with State on the jurisdictional question, but agree on point (2). The points will be discussed seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">State contends that the circuit court did not have jurisdiction over this matter, since the Petition alleged only the failure to appeal the trial court\u2019s denial of Defendant\u2019s motion \u201cto suppress the press access to the trial itself\u2019 as ineffective assistance of appellate counsel and not appellate counsel\u2019s failure to appeal the request to <em>voir dire </em>the prospective jurors individually. Thus, State asserts. Defendant waived the <em>voir dire </em>issue and he was not entitled to relief under Rule 40(a)(3). The argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">We view Rule 40(a)(3) as holding that an issue is deemed waived if it was not raised at any time before the Rule 40 petition. Failure to raise it specifically in the petition does not <em>per se </em>defeat the possibility of obtaining relief on that ground in the Rule 40 proceeding. Waiver in such circumstances can only be lodged against the petitioner when it may be inferred from an examination of the entire record.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">The proceeding outlined under Rule 40 is designed to encompass previously cumbersome and often misunderstood legal writs. One of the rule\u2019s purposes is to afford wider post-conviction relief in our state courts, thus lessening conflicts with the federal courts in the latters\u2019 exercise of their power to protect an individual\u2019s federal constitutional rights from illegal state action. <em>See Post Conviction Procedure A Suggested Solution, 2 </em>Harv. J. on Legis. 189 (1965). In our view, one purpose of the specificity requirement for the petition under Rule 40(c) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>is to give State notice of the issues it will be required to meet.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Although the Petition did not specify as a ground for relief the precise factual basis upon which the circuit court ruled, it must be borne in mind that Defendant was <em>pro se </em>when he filed the Petition and should not suffer for his inability to articulate his claim. <em>See Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galloway, </em>212 Pa. Super. 154, 239 A.2d 893 (1968). His brief at least alerted State to the general issue of effectiveness of appellate counsel. When counsel was later appointed for Defendant<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> he filed a memorandum in support of the Petition, which clearly raised the <em>voir dire </em>issue. The issue was responded to by State in its supplemental memorandum in opposition to the Petition, after noting its objection, and was apparently argued to and considered by the circuit court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We note that Rule 40(e) provides that amendments to the petition shall be freely allowed. We see no reason, in view of the proceedings below, why the Petition in this case cannot be deemed to have been amended to include the <em>voir dire </em>issue. <em>Cf. </em>Rule 15(b), Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (1981).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">State also argues that since the <em>voir dire </em>issue was not raised in the direct appeal and Defendant did not prove extraordinary circumstances to justify his failure to do so, the issue was waived. Rule 40(a)(3). The argument is without merit. The matter of ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to raise the issue on appeal could not have been raised in the direct appeal from the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">111.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">In essence, State argues that Defendant was not denied effective assistance of trial or appellate counsel, because (1) the trial judge did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>abuse his discretion in denying Defendant\u2019s motion to allow him to <em>voir dire </em>the jurors individually, and (2) the issue of the trial judge's denial of Defendant\u2019s motion for <em>voir dire </em>of the prospective jurors, if raised on appeal, \u201cwould [not] have been clearly more likely to result in reversal or an order for a new trial[.]\u201d <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Greer, </em>778 F.2d 350, 353 (7th Cir. 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Although there are several cases in this jurisdiction establishing the standards for determining ineffective assistance of counsel at the trial level, <em>e.g., State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>68 Haw. __, 712 P.2d 496 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>McNulty, </em>60 Haw. 259, 588 P.2d 438 (1978); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kahalewai, </em>54 Haw. 28, 501 P.2d 977 (1972); <em>State v. Casipe, </em>5 Haw. App. 210, 686 P.2d 28 (1984), there are none discussing the standards for assessing an allegation of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Other courts, federal and state, diverge widely in the standards used to judge ineffectiveness of appellate counsel. <em>Evitts </em>v. <em>Lucey, </em>469 U.S. __, __ n.9, 105 S.Ct. 830, 837 n.9, 83 L.Ed.2d 821, 831 n.9 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\"><em>State </em>v. <em>Antone, </em>62 Haw. 346, 615 P.2d 101 (1980), instructs us that the burden of establishing ineffective assistance of counsel is upon Defendant, who must show specific errors or omissions of counsel reflecting lack of skill, judgment or diligence, and which resulted in either the withdrawal or substantial impairment of a potentially meritorious defense. <em>Id. </em>62 Haw. at 348-349, 615 P.2d at 104. \u201cCounsel\u2019s assistance need not be errorless nor will it be judged ineffective solely by hindsight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The fundamental question is whether, viewed as a whole, the assistance provided is \u201cwithin the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kahalewai, </em>54 Haw. at 30, 501 P.2d at 979.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">In <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), decided after <em>State </em>v. <em>Antone, supra, </em>the United States Supreme Court established a more difficult burden to be met by a defendant in establishing ineffective assistance of trial counsel. In <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>the Hawaii Supreme Court stated that the standard adopted in <em>Antone </em>is not the <em>Strickland </em>standard, and that, for purposes of judging ineffective representation claims under article I, section 14 of the Hawaii constitution the standard established in <em>Antone </em>would be applied. <em>Id. </em>68 Haw. at __ n.7, 712 P.2d at 500 n.7. In <em>Smith, </em>as in this case, the defendant had asserted violation of his right to effective assistance of counsel under both the United States and Hawaii constitutions and, as stated, the supreme court applied <em>Antone\u2019s </em>standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\"><em>Ant one\u2019s </em>standard was not established to determine effectiveness of counsel on appeal. However, in <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Greer, supra, </em>at 352, it was held that the standard for effective assistance of trial counsel can be used as a basis for establishing a standard for effective assistance of appellate counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\"><em>Gray </em>holds that appellate counsel is not required to advance every conceivable argument on appeal that the trial record supports, but only that appellate counsel\u2019s choice of issues for appeal not fall below \u201can objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 353. In order to determine whether that standard has been met, the trial record first must be examined to see if appellate counsel failed to present significant and obvious issues on appeal. Any such significant issues must then be compared to those which were raised and if the ignored issues are clearly stronger than those raised, the presumption of effective assistance of counsel is overcome. <em>Id. </em>at 352.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The <em>Grav </em>court remanded the case to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>the district court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">with instructions to review the trial court record and determine whether the issues which petitioner claims appellate counsel failed to raise, would have been clearly more likely to result in reversal or an order for a new trial, and were so obvious from the trial record that the failure to present such issues amounted to ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 353. The principles enunciated in <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Greer </em>are similar to those of <em>Antone </em>at the trial level and we adopt and apply them in this case. However, we need not remand this matter to the circuit court to compare the trial record with the issues raised on appeal. There is no dispute, here, over the trial proceedings in criminal no. 52574, and we have taken judicial notice of the briefs in the appeal from that conviction. Our review of the record in this case and criminal no. 52574 convinces us that Defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">In the instant case, the circuit court did examine the portion of the trial record dealing with Defendant\u2019s motion to <em>voir dire </em>the jurors individually. However, it does not appear that the circuit court compared the issue of the trial court\u2019s denial of Defendant\u2019s motion with the issues raised on appeal. The circuit court concluded as a matter of law that (I) the trial court\u2019s denial of Defendant\u2019s motion to examine the prospective jurors individually was an abuse of discretion, (2) the failure to raise the issue on appeal resulted from \u201cunprofessional or incompetent judgment,\u201d (3) that had the issue been raised on appeal, there was a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that Defendant\u2019s conviction would have been reversed and, therefore, (4) Defendant was denied his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel on appeal. In our view, conclusions (2) and (3) are really findings of fact subject to the clearly erroneous standard of review, while conclusions (1) and (4), as conclusions of law, are subject to the \u201cright/wrong\u201d standard. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Miller, 4 </em>Haw. App. 603, 671 P.2d 1037 (1983). The record does not support (2) and (3) and we hold they are clearly erroneous. Conclusions of law (1) and (4) are in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">In the direct appeal from Defendant\u2019s conviction, appellate counsel alleged error by the trial court in denying his pre-trial motions to dismiss the indictment and to suppress evidence wrongfully seized. He alleged error in the admission of various items of evidence, over his objections as to lack of foundation and extreme prejudice, and attacked the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on manslaughter as an included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>offense and to furnish the jury with a verdict form reading \u201cnot guilty.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Finally, he attacked the extended sentence meted out by the court. The arguments presented by appellate counsel were resourceful and plausible, and the briefs indicate a profound and intimate knowledge on his part of the legal principles relating to the issues he raised. Although none of those arguments were successful, the issue of the trial court\u2019s denial of Defendant\u2019s motion to be allowed to <em>voir dire </em>the prospective jurors individually pales by comparison with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">There is no dispute that there was a great deal of publicity regarding the event out of which the charges against Defendant arose in March of 1979. Defendant argues that, in addition, on August 8, 1979, approximately seven weeks prior to the start of his trial, another \u201csniping\u201d incident occurred in Waikiki. This brought on another spate of news reports regarding Defendant\u2019s alleged offenses and about the psychology of \u201csnipers.\u201d Defendant argues that eleven of the first twelve jurors who were seated in the jury box indicated that they had been exposed to media accounts of the case and his motion to allow him to conduct <em>voir dire </em>of those jurors individually should have been granted. Individual <em>voir dire </em>was necessary, he contended, in order to determine what the jurors had been exposed to and whether that exposure could in any way impair their ability to act as fair and impartial jurors. His motion to examine the jurors individually was denied. Defendant argues here, that it was ineffective assistance of appellate counsel not to have raised that denial as an issue on appeal. We disagree. We do not believe the issue created a reasonable probability of reversal or an order for a new trial. <em>Gray, </em>at 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\"><em>State </em>v. <em>Pokini, </em>55 Haw. 640, 526 P.2d 94 (1974), cited by Defendant in support of his argument in this court that the trial court committed reversible error in denying his <em>voir dire </em>motion does not assist him. In <em>Pokini, </em>the supreme court held that \u201cthe amount and nature of pre-trial publicity directly determine the lengths to which a trial judge must go on <em>voir dire </em>to assess the possibility of prejudice resulting from that publicity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 642, 526 P.2d at 99 (citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Wakinekona, </em>53 Haw. 574, 579-80, 499 P.2d 678, 682 (1972)). In <em>Pokini </em>there was a plethora of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>pre-trial publicity regarding all of the participants in the trial, including the judge. The same defendants had been convicted in a previous case tried before the same judge, and in which the prosecution used the same witness. The pre-trial publicity was \u201csubstantial\u201d and continued until two weeks before trial. In particular, the publicity described the defendant, James Pokini, as the leader of a \u201cgang\u201d responsible for several robberies on Oahu. The supreme court held that the trial court committed reversible error by \u201cpre-empting\u201d the <em>voir dire </em>and conducting only a perfunctory examination of the jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">In the instant case, the publicity does not, in our opinion, approach the magnitude of <em>Pokini. </em>Moreover, we are. convinced from the record that the examination of the jurors that was allowed in the instant case was sufficient to assure Defendant a trial by a fair and impartial jury. None of the jurors indicated an inability, as a result of the publicity, to be fair and impartial. Defendant\u2019s trial counsel, also, appeared satisfied with the jury\u2019s final makeup, since he waived Defendant\u2019s last two peremptory challenges. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Defendant\u2019s <em>voir dire </em>motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">In the light of the trial record and the actions of appellate counsel, Defendant has not shown that he was denied effective assistance of counsel on appeal. Appellate counsel\u2019s choice of issues on appeal did not fall below \u201can objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Greer, supra, </em>at 353, and Defendant has not shown that the performance of appellate counsel was \u201cso clearly prejudicial to [his] substantial rights as to jeopardize the very fairness and integrity of [the appellate process].\u201d <em>Watson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>39 Crim. L. Rep. at 2071.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">The appeal in criminal no. 52574 indicates a thorough examination of the trial record by appellate counsel and a studied effort to raise and argue those issues which, in his judgment, would be the most persuasive on the appellate court. The fact that he was unsuccessful is of no import. We are convinced that the issue of <em>voir dire </em>would have had less chance of success than those issues raised by appellate counsel and, thus, was not \u201cclearly stronger\u201d than the issues raised, <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Greer, supra, </em>at 352. Neither does the record show that the failure to raise the issue on appeal resulted from the ignorance or inadvertence of appellate counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">Finally, Defendant\u2019s argument that he was denied effective assistance of appellate counsel because appellate counsel should have withdrawn from the case prior to the appeal is without merit.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AV4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number><em>Peter Van Name Esser (Peter M.

The court did not discuss the standard to be used to judge appellate counsel\u2019s effectiveness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b357-9\">Recently, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals established a different standard for resolving claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. <em>Watson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>39 Crim. L. Rep. (BNA) 2070, 508 A.2d 75 (1986). Holding that, because appellate courts give incisive consideration to all issues raised by an appellant, the outcome of a case on appeal is rarely dependent upon the exceptional skill of appellate counsel. However, if an issue not raised on appeal had merit and would be determinative on the prosecution of the defendant, there may well be ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. The District of Columbia court ruled that appellate counsel\u2019s performance will be deemed ineffective if it is so clearly prejudicial to the defendant\u2019s substantial rights as to jeopardize the very fairness and integrity of the appellate process. Paraphasing <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). which dealt with the two-pronged test for judging effectiveness of trial counsel, the <em>Watson </em>court stated that \u2018\u201cthe benchmark for judging any claim of ineffectiveness must be whether counsel\u2019s conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the [appeal] cannot be relied on as having produced a just result.\u2019\u201d <em>Watson, </em>39 Crim.
