We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand with directions.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">On December 19, 1979, Petitioner filed a HUPA petition alleging Defendant to be the natural father of her female child born on April 20, 1979. The petition sought an order requiring Defendant to reimburse Petitioner for the expenses incident to her pregnancy and the birth of the child and for the support, maintenance, and education of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">After extensive discovery and a prolonged bench trial,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the family court entered its findings of fact, conclusions of law and order adjudging Defendant to be the natural father of the child on March 16, 1984 (Paternity Order).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">Thereafter, further discovery was conducted in the support phase of the case. After an evidentiary hearing the family court entered its findings of fact, conclusions of law and judgment on July 15, 1985 (Support Order). The Support Order required Defendant to make specific payments for the support, maintenance and education of the child and to reimburse Petitioner specified amounts for birth related expenses and for past child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">On July 17, 1985, the family court entered its decision and order awarding Petitioner $154,349 for attorney\u2019s fees and costs (Fee Order).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">Defendant\u2019s notice of appeal is from the Paternity, Support, and Fee Orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-11\">II. DETERMINATION OF PATERNITY</p>\n<p id=\"b651-12\">In the Paternity Order, based on its findings of fact the family court made the following conclusions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-13\">1. Petitioner and Defendant had sexual intercourse with each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>other on August 4, 1978. Neither Petitioner nor Defendant used any contraceptives during that sexual intercourse. This sexual intercourse resulted in the conception of the subject child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-6\">2. During the period conception could occur, Petitioner did not have sexual intercourse with any men (other than Defendant) who could be the father of the subject child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-7\">3. The subject child was born on April 20, 1979. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-8\">4. All of the blood tests and related statistical analyses used herein were properly administered, calculated and interpreted. None of those blood tests and related analyses excluded Defendant as a possible father of the subject child. Further, those tests validly indicate that there is more than a 99% statistical probability that Defendant is the natural father of the subject child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-9\">5. The Court therefore concludes that Petitioner has proven by a preponderance of all of the evidence that Defendant is the natural father of the female child born to Petitioner on April 20, 1979.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">Record Vol. 11 at 22-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-11\">Defendant attacks those conclusions by challenging eleven of the nineteen findings in the Paternity Order.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s challenge is based on the ground that although the findings are supported by substantial evidence, those findings would have been otherwise if the family court (1) had not excluded evidence of Petitioner\u2019s sexual relations with other men and (2) had allowed the review and analysis of Petitioner\u2019s diaries by handwriting experts. The challenge has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-12\">A. <em>Evidence of Sexual Access and HRS </em>\u00a7 <em>584-14(b) and (c)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b652-13\">In HUPA proceedings, evidence regarding sexual access to the mother by men other than the alleged father is restricted. HRS \u00a7 584-14(b) and (c) (1985) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-14\">(b) Testimony relating to sexual access to the mother by an unidentified man at any time or by an identified man at a time other than the probable time of conception of the child shall be inadmissible in evidence, unless offered by the mother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-15\">(c) In an action against an alleged father, evidence offered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>him with respect to a man who is not subject to the jurisdiction of the court concerning his sexual intercourse with the mother at or about the probable time of conception of the child shall be admissible in evidence only if he has undergone and made available to the court blood tests the results of which do not exclude the possibility of his paternity of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">During the trial, Defendant sought to elicit expert testimony from Ralph Hale, M.D., on the issue of whether or not Defendant was the child\u2019s father based on the date of sexual intercourse, August 4, 1978, testified to by Petitioner. Since the medical opinion would have been based on Dr. Hale\u2019s review of matters which revealed sexual contacts of Petitioner by unidentified men both within and without the probable period of conception,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> upon Petitioner\u2019s objection, the family court excluded the proffered testimony. The court also refused to permit the cross-examination of Petitioner regarding her 1977 pregnancy which was terminated by an abortion. Both evidentiary rulings were based on HRS \u00a7 584-14(b) and (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Referring to the Commissioners\u2019 Comment to \u00a7 14 of the Uniform Parentage Act (UPA) (Comment),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Defendant argues that the sole objective of HRS \u00a7 584-14(b) and (c) is to resolve the problem of perjured testimony where <em>exceptio plurium concubentium </em>or the multiple access defense is raised. Defendant therefore contends that HRS \u00a7 584- 14(b) and (c) are inapplicable to Dr. Hale\u2019s proffered testimony to prove \u201cnonaccess\u201d of Petitioner by Defendant on August 4,1978, and to cross-examination relating to Petitioner\u2019s 1977 pregnancy to impeach Petitioner. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The reach of HRS \u00a7 584-14(b) and (c) is more expansive than as contended by Defendant. HRS \u00a7 584-14(b) excludes \u201c[tjestimony relat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>ing to sexual access to the mother by an unidentified man <em>at any time[.]\" </em>(Emphasis added.) Also, the Comment indicates that a purpose of UPA \u00a7 14 was to close \u201cthe door to the wanton attacks on the mother\u2019s character[.]\u201d The legislature\u2019s enactment of HRS \u00a7 584-14(b) and (c) reflects its belief that \u201cas a matter of public policy the mother is entitled to protection from uncorroborated charges of promiscuity.\u201d <em>Murillo </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>206 N.J. Super. 196, 204, 502 A.2d 54, 58 (1985) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Dr. Hale\u2019s nonaccess opinion testimony would have been based on information of sexual access to Petitioner within and without the probable period of conception by unidentified men. The impeachment evidence likewise would have involved unidentified or identified men, other than Defendant, with sexual access to Petitioner clearly outside of the probable period of conception pertinent in this case. In our view, HRS \u00a7 584-14(b) and (c) do not permit the besmirching of the mother\u2019s character in the name of \u201cnonaccess\u201d or \u201cimpeachment.\u201d The family court properly held that HRS \u00a7 584-14(b) and (c) were applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Defendant contends, in the alternative, that if HRS \u00a7 584-14(b) and (c) exclude his \u201cnonaccess\u201d evidence and precludes his \u201cimpeachment\u201d cross-examination, the statute is unconstitutional. Defendant asserts that the application of the statute deprived him of his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">At the outset, we note a well-settled precept that a statute \u201cis presumptively constitutional, and a party challenging the statute has the burden of showing unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Schwab </em>v. <em>Ariyoshi, </em>58 Haw. 25, 31, 564 P. 2d 135, 139 (1977). <em>See also State </em>v. <em>Mueller, 66 </em>Haw. 616, 671 P.2d 1351 (1983). In our view, Defendant has failed to meet this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">\u201cThe legislature in its discretion may, without denial of due process of law, prescribe changes in the rules of evidence for the trial of civil cases,. . . subject... to the limitation that it may not preclude a party from presenting the facts supporting his theory of the case.\u201d 16D C.J.S. <em>Constitutional Law </em>\u00a7 1164 at 85 (1985). Our legislature in its judgment deemed that societal needs required restriction in the admissibility of sexual access evidence in paternity cases and enacted HRS \u00a7 584-14(b) and (c). However, as we stated in <em>Doe IV </em>v. <em>Roe IV, </em>5 Haw. App. 558, 705 P.2d 535 (1985), \u201cthe statute does not foreclose all testimony regarding sexual relations, but only such relations allegedly occurring with unidentified men or with identified men other than during the conception period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>5 Haw. App. at 563, 705 P.2d at 541 (footnote omitted). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>Thus, an alleged father is not precluded from presenting unexcluded pertinent facts regarding sexual access. Moreover, the right of cross-examination is not absolute without restriction even in criminal cases. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>62 Haw. 572, 671 P.2d 1214 (1980). Thus, we see no due process of law problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Our research did not uncover any reported case discussing due process of law in the context of UPA \u00a7 14. However, statutes excluding certain evidence in paternity proceedings have withstood due process challenges in other jurisdictions which have paternity statutes other than the UPA. In <em>\u201cHH\u201d </em>v. <em>\u201cII\u201d, </em>31 N.Y.2d 154, 335 N.Y.S.2d 274, 286 N.E.2d 717 (1972), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>409 U.S. 1121, 93 S. Ct. 945, 35 L. Ed. 2d 254 (1973), there was a constitutional challenge to a statute which, in a paternity proceeding, excluded a respondent\u2019s uncorroborated proof of access by others to the woman involved. The court found no constitutional infirmity on due process of law grounds regarding the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">In <em>Cardenas </em>v. <em>Chavez, </em>103 Mich. App. 646, 303 N.W.2d 3 (1981), the statute expressly provided that blood test results are admissible in paternity actions only in cases where definite exclusion is established by those results. The plaintiff-mother contended that the exclusion from evidence of HLA (human leukocyte antigen) blood test results deprived her of due process of law. The Michigan Appellate Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-7\">The provisions of the Paternity Act as presently written did not deny plaintiff of her right to a meaningful hearing, nor did the exclusion of the HLA test results from evidence deny plaintiff an opportunity for a fair and effective trial. Other evidence supporting plaintiffs claim of paternity was available. Therefore, the burden placed before plaintiff by these provisions of the Paternity Act was not so great that the act is devoid of all rationality.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-8\"><em>Id. </em>103 Mich. App. at 648, 303 N.W.2d at 4 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">Accordingly, we hold that the family court\u2019s exclusion of sexual access evidence proffered by Defendant and preclusion of cross-examination of Petitioner regarding her 1977 pregnancy were neither errors of law nor abuses of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">B. <em>Petitioner\u2019s Diaries and the Appointment of Experts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">Both Petitioner and Defendant sought pretrial discovery of each other\u2019s diaries. To protect the parties\u2019 rights of privacy, the family court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>judge<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> conducted an <em>in camera </em>examination of the diaries and on May 13, 1982, filed orders containing \u201cexcerpts\u201d from the diaries which were deemed to be relevant or reasonably calculated to lead to discovery of admissible evidence and were to be disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">On March 24, 1983, about five weeks before the scheduled trial, Defendant filed a motion to compel production of Petitioner\u2019s original diaries. On April 15,1983, the family court denied the motion. However, on April 27, 1983, the court <em>sua sponte </em>appointed a special master to review Petitioner\u2019s original diaries and \u201c[t]o assist the parties and the Court, to ensure that each party has an opportunity to review the accuracy and authenticity of the diaries, extracts and modifications[.]\u201d The order required Petitioner and Defendant to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-7\">prepare a written list of questions and requests each party wants the Special Master to answer or perform concerning the diaries, other material and extracts. . . . The Court will decide which of the questions and requests the Special Master will answer and perform. The Special Master shall promptly prepare and file a written response to the questions and requests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">Record Vol. 8 at 286-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">In the interim the trial commenced on May 2, 1983. Instead of filing a list of questions and requests, on May 16, 1983 and June 2, 1983, Defendant filed motions seeking to have an expert retained by Defendant\u2019s counsel, but supervised by the Special Master, examine Petitioner\u2019s diaries. Both motions were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">After the filing of Defendant\u2019s third motion on June 21, 1983, the court on June 30, 1983, ordered the Special Master to review Petitioner\u2019s original diaries and to complete certain tasks based on Defendant\u2019s requests. The order also directed the Special Master to file an appropriate motion if \u201cexpert assistance is needed to assist her in her review of the subject material[.]\u201d Record Vol. 9 at 130. Without filing a motion for expert assistance, the Special Master filed her report on August 3,1983. In her report the Special Master indicated that she consulted a \u201cnationally recognized expert in the area of questioned documents[,J\u2019 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>based on such consultation, determined that submission of the material to an expert for analysis would be of no assistance. Record Vol. 10 at 19h. On August 17, 1983, the Special Master filed a supplement to her report answering questions interposed by Defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">On August 17, 1983, Defendant filed a motion for the \u201c[appointment of an expert examiner of questioned documents\u201d to examine and analyze Petitioner\u2019s original diaries. Record Vol. 10 at 22. On September 20, 1983, the court denied the motion stating, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-6\">During the trial in this case, Petitioner was thoroughly crossexamined<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> by Defendant\u2019s attorneys concerning Petitioner\u2019s diaries^]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-7\">With regard to certain entries, including the August 4, 1978 entry, Petitioner acknowledged during the trial that she sometimes made entries in her diary after the day on which the recorded event occurred. Therefore, there is no need for expert analysis to determine whether Petitioner made all diary entries on the same day as the occurrence of the event mentioned in the diaries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-8\">The Court is therefore not persuaded that expert analysis would assist the Court in deciding the issues of this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">Record Vol. 10 at 70 (footnote added).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">Defendant asserts that the family court abused its discretion in refusing to allow \u201cPetitioner\u2019s diaries [to be] reviewed and analyzed by handwriting experts[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">Based on the record as summarized above, we find no abuse of discretion by the family court. Rather, in our view, the court exercised its discretion judiciously.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-12\">III. AWARD OF CHILD SUPPORT</p>\n<p id=\"b657-13\">The Support Order includes 35 findings of fact and 33 conclusions of law. The undisputed findings disclose that Petitioner graduated from college, is unmarried, and is employed as a buyer for a department store. Her annual salary as of 1984 was $34,000. She owns a two-bedroom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>condominium apartment subject to a mortgage of $48,000. She also owns a 1978 BMW which is fully paid for and has a vested interest of about $54,500 in her employer\u2019s profit-sharing plan. Petitioner has no obligation to support anyone other than her child involved in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Defendant was married in 1981 but has no children from the marriage. He is licensed to practice law but his employment is with a family partnership and a family connected corporation. Based on the court\u2019s finding, which Defendant disputes, Defendant\u2019s gross yearly income for the period from 1978 through 1984 averaged about $ 110,000. Defendant admitted to owning assets having a net worth of$2,300,000.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Defendant has no obligation to support anyone other than his wife who is also employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">Based on its findings and conclusions, the family court<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> issued an award requiring Defendant to make the following payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">1. For \u201cbasic\u201d child support, $ 1,600 (80% of $2,000) per month from July 5, 1985 until April 20, 1992. Thereafter, $1,900 (80% of $2,375) per month until the child attains 18 years of age, graduates from high school, or discontinues high school, whichever last occurs; provided, if the child continues with post high school education, the payment shall continue until the child graduates or attains 24 years of age, whichever first occurs;</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">2. For birth related expenses, $432.80; for past child support through September 30, 1984, $49,970.40; and for past child support from October 1, 1984 through June 30, 1985, $14,400, less any court ordered child support payments already made;</p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">3. For \"educational\u201d support, 80% of the child\u2019s tuition, excluding summer school, plus $500 per school year, commencing July 1, 1985. For post high school education, 80% of the child\u2019s tuition without deductions for scholarships, plus the additional cost of coach class air transportation for two trips between the child\u2019s home and school. All payments to be made into a trust fund established with a Hawaii trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>company; and</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">4. For \u201ctravel opportunity\u201d support, $2,000 plus cost of two first class round-trip tickets between Honolulu and New York City annually commencing July 1, 1985 until July 1, 1993. Thereafter, $3,000 plus cost of two first class round-trip tickets between Honolulu and New York City annually with the last payment to be made on July 1, 2000. All payments are to be made to the aforesaid trust fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Defendant challenges 12 of the findings and 28 of the conclusions and asserts that the family court abused its discretion in making the child support award. We hold that based on the relevant facts in this case, the award is excessive and therefore the court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">A. <em>Applicable Legal Principles</em></p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">Under HUPA, the relationship between any parent and child, including the duty of support, is not dependent on marriage. HRS \u00a7 584-2. Thus, upon a finding of paternity, the family court may enter an order for child support payments against the father. \u201cIn determining the amount to be paid by [the father] for support of the child and the period during which the duty of support is owed,\u201d H RS \u00a7 584-15(e) requires the court to \u201cconsider all relevant facts,\u201d including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-9\">(1) The needs of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-10\">(2) The standard of living and circumstances of the parents;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-11\">(3) The relative financial means of the parents;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-12\">(4) The earning ability of the parents;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-13\">(5) The need and capacity of the child for education, including higher education;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-14\">(6) The age of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-15\">(7) The financial resources and the earning ability of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-16\">(8) The responsibility of the parents for the support of others; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-17\">(9) The value of services contributed by the custodial parent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJzA\">In the determination of the support award, \u201cit is appropriate that a full exploration be conducted in each of the statutorily enumerated factors[.]\u201d <em>Vasquez </em>v. <em>Bolduc, </em>212 N.J. Super. 455, 457, 515 A.2d 500, 501 (1986). The implication is that the court should not rely only on one or two of the factors to the exclusion of the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-19\">The standard of review of the family court\u2019s findings of fact is the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d test. <em>Doe III </em>v. <em>Roe III, </em>3 Haw. App. 241, 648 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>199 (1982). Conclusions of law are reviewed <em>de novo. Friedrich </em>v. <em>Dept. of Transportation, </em>60 Haw. 32, 586 P.2d 1037 (1978); <em>Nani Koolau Co. v. K &amp; M Construction, Inc., </em>5 Haw. App. 137, 681 P.2d 580 (1984). The abuse of discretion standard is applicable to the review of the child support award. <em>State ex rel. Parlow </em>v. <em>Law, </em>39 Wash. App. 173, 692 P.2d 863 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">We will apply the foregoing principles in the review of the Support Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">B. <em>Apportionment of Support Obligation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">Initially, Defendant contends that the family court erred in its conclusion that \u201cDefendant should pay 80% of the basic and 80% of most special support requirements of the child.\u201d Conclusion of law 23. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">Defendant argues in his brief that since both Petitioner and Defendant have the financial ability to equally contribute to the support of the child, \u201cthe burden is largely an equal one.\u201d However, this 50-50 argument was abandoned during oral argument when Defendant\u2019s counsel conceded that an apportionment of 67% to Defendant and 33% to Petitioner would be fair. We note in passing that the UPA does not \u201ccreate an irrebuttable presumption of co-equal supportf.]\u201d <em>Linda D. </em>v. <em>Fritz C., </em>38 Wash. App. 288, 300, 687 P.2d 223, 229 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">Defendant asserts, however, that the respective incomes of Defendant and Petitioner do not support an 80-20 apportionment of the support obligation. Our answer is that HRS \u00a7 584-15(e) permits the court to consider not only the \u201cearning ability\u201d of the parents, but also their \u201crelative financial means.\u201d Thus, we find no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s imposition of an 80% burden of child support on Defendant. <em>Cf. Cleveland v. Cleveland, </em>1 Haw. App. 187, 616 P.2d 1014 (1980) (in a divorce case, the court may consider the father\u2019s estate and net worth in ordering child support).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-11\">C. <em>Amounts of Child Support Payments</em></p>\n<p id=\"b660-12\">In the Support Order, the family court divided the support award into three component parts: basic child support, educational support, and travel opportunity support. Based on our computation, before the increases provided for in the Support Order take effect. Defendant\u2019s child support payments on an annual basis total $26,660 as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>Basic ($1,600 x 12) $19,200</p>\n<p id=\"A1X\">Educational (80% of tuition<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> + $500) 3.060</p>\n<p id=\"Ayz\">Travel opportunity (2 first class</p>\n<p id=\"ANCE\">round-trip tickets<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> + $2,000) 4,400</p>\n<p id=\"AI5\">$26,660</p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">The basic child support will increase on May 1, 1992, the educational support will increase as tuition costs increase and if the child goes away for her post high school education, and the travel opportunity support will increase on July 1, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-11\">Defendant contends that the family court abused its discretion in making the total child support award. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-12\">We do not agree with Defendant that the need of the child is controlling. Nor do we believe, however, that the child\u2019s support should be determined mainly on the non-custodial father\u2019s standard of living. <em>Ellen N. </em>v. <em>Stuart K., </em>88 Misc. 2d 280, 387 N.Y.S.2d 367 (1976). The court must be cognizant of the fact that \u201cto raise [the mother\u2019s] standard of living through the vehicle of child support would constitute the imposition of an unauthorized obligation on part of the father toward the mother.\u201d <em>Kathy G. J. </em>v. <em>Arnold D., </em>116 A.D.2d 247, 255, 501 N.Y.S.2d 58, 64 (1986), <em>cert. </em>denied, __ U.S. __, 107 S. Ct. 927, 93 L. Ed. 2d 979 (1987). Also, an award for child support is for the child\u2019s current needs based on the child\u2019s appropriate standard of living and not for the purpose of saving portions thereof for future needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-15\">We will review the three components of the child support with the foregoing considerations in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-20\">1. Basic Child Support</p>\n<p id=\"b661-16\">The family court concluded that, exclusive of education and travel, \u201cthe appropriate basic support requirements level of the child is presently $2000.00 per month in order to achieve the appropriate standard of living for the child.\u201d Conclusion of law 20. The findings and record do not support this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-17\">In her income and expense statement filed on July 3,1984, Petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>listed her child\u2019s monthly expenses (inclusive of school expense of $320) as totaling $820. One-half of general monthly expenses for mortgage, utilities and apartment maintenance fees, and car expenses equaled $434. Thus, the child\u2019s monthly expenses, exclusive of schooling, totaled $934.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Petitioner\u2019s testimony indicated that the actual expenditures for the child were based solely on her limited income. Her position was that, with Defendant\u2019s contribution of child support, the monthly expenditure would be increased by $500<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> of which $250 would be for travel expenses. Thus, with support contribution from Defendant, the monthly expenses, exclusive of schooling and travel expenses, would total $1,184.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">However, stating that \u201cit is better to be approximately right than be exactly wrong[,]\u201d the court boosted the basic support requirement to $2,000 per month. Conclusion of law 20. Furthermore, without supporting evidence in the record, the court determined that the monthly basic support requirement would increase to $2,375 commencing May 1, 1992, \u201cbecause of the increased age of the child.\u201d Conclusion of law 24. We hold that the family court abused it discretion regarding the amount of basic child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">We conclude that based on the record the basic monthly child support would be $1,200<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> of which Defendant should pay $960. Also, the automatic increase scheduled to commence May 1, 1992 should be deleted, subject to the right of Petitioner to seek an increase pursuant to HRS \u00a7 584-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">2. Educational Support</p>\n<p id=\"b662-10\">Both the Petitioner and the child were interested in the child attending Punahou School, a private school, and the child has been admitted there. Based on the child\u2019s needs and her parents\u2019 standard of living and earning ability, we find no abuse of discretion in the court ordering Defendant to pay <em>80% </em>of the child\u2019s tuition and other costs, including post high school education or training. Regarding post high school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>education or training, however, we find it unreasonable not to permit deductions for scholarships. We conclude that if the child receives a scholarship, grant, or other entitlement covering full or partial costs of tuition and other expenses, Defendant\u2019s, as well as Petitioner\u2019s, obligations for the child\u2019s educational support should be reduced proportionately based on the 80-20 formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">For consistency, the Support Order should be modified so that Defendant\u2019s share of educational support until the child finishes high school would be 80% of the tuition, including summer school, books, fees, and other school expenses, and the payment of $500 by Defendant should be deleted.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">3. Travel Opportunity Support</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">The family court found that in her employment as a buyer, Petitioner takes about five two-week buying trips a year. Defendant also travels regularly. It is not unreasonable therefore to allow the child of Petitioner and Defendant to have travel opportunities. Petitioner\u2019s position was that if Defendant had contributed to the child\u2019s support, $250 per month or $3,000 per year would have been expended for the child\u2019s travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">The court\u2019s award of travel opportunity support was not unreasonable, but the amount awarded was excessive and an abuse of discretion. In our view, based on the consideration of all relevant factors, including the fact that the child will be in school at least nine months each year, and maybe longer if she attends summer school, and that she will be traveling with and staying with Petitioner whose travel expenses are paid for by her employer, an award of $1,000 plus the cost of one coach class, instead of first class, round-trip ticket between Honolulu and New York is sufficient. Furthermore, with no evidence of inflationary factors in the record, the increase to $3,000 after July 1, 1993 is unsupportable.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">We also conclude that the court\u2019s requiring Defendant to pay for the child\u2019s travel opportunities to and including July 1,2000 was an abuse of discretion. On July 1, 2000, the child will be past twenty-one years of age. A parent\u2019s obligation to support a child generally ceases when the child attains the age of majority, which is eighteen years in Hawaii. <em>See </em>50 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Parent and Child </em>\u00a7 102 (1971). It is true that HRS \u00a7584-15(e) permits the family court to extend the obligation to support the child beyond the age of majority based on all relevant facts. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>there is nothing in the record to support the court\u2019s decision to require Defendant to pay travel opportunity support beyond April 20, 1997, when the child attains eighteen years of age. Moreover, we note that, if the child pursues post high school education away from home, the Support Order requires Defendant to pay the transportation costs for two trips<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> between Hawaii and the school location.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">IV. AWARD OF ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES AND COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">Regarding attorney\u2019s fees and costs, HRS \u00a7 584-16 provides in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-8\">Costs. The court may order reasonable fees of counsel, experts, and the child\u2019s guardian ad litem, and other costs of the action and pretrial proceedings, including blood tests, to be paid by the parties in proportions and at times determined by the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">Petitioner sought an allowance of $ 171,003.56 for attorney\u2019s fees and $23,540.66 for costs, or a total of $194,544.22. In its Fee Order, the family court awarded Petitioner a total of $154,349 for fees and costs to be paid by Defendant. Defendant claims that the award is unreasonable, \u201cexceeding] any rational measuring base.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">The family court is given broad discretion to award attorney\u2019s fees and costs under HRS \u00a7 584-16. <em>L.D.G. by and through S.G. </em>v. <em>E.R., </em>723 P.2d 746 (Colo. App. 1986). And the court\u2019s award will not be disturbed on appeal if the record discloses adequate showing of reasonableness of the award. <em>E.M.F. </em>v. <em>N.N., 717 </em>P.2d 961 (Colo. App. 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">Here, the record includes affidavits of Petitioner\u2019s counsel, together with detailed summaries of the services rendered, time spent, hourly rates, and costs incurred. Also, Petitioner\u2019s counsel was cross-examined under oath by Defendant\u2019s counsel regarding the time sheets and costs incurred. Based on such evidence, the court excluded certain fees and costs and made its award on a proportional basis in the Fee Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-12\">Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in the family court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs and affirm the Fee Order.</p>\n<p id=\"Att\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">We affirm the family court\u2019s March 16, 1984 Paternity Order and July 17, 1985 Fee Order. However, we vacate the July 15, 1985 Support Order, remand the case, and direct the family court to amend the Support Order as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">1. The basic support requirement for the child shall be reduced from $2,000 per month to $1,200 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">2. Regarding basic child support, Defendant shall pay $960 per month, payable in two installments of $480 each on the 5th and 20th days of each month, instead of $1,600 per month payable in two installments of $800 each. Also, the automatic increase in the payments commencing May 1, 1992 is to be deleted.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">3. Regarding past child support during the period of October 1, 1984 through June 30, 1985, Defendant shall pay $8,640 (9 months * $960), instead of $14,400, less any court ordered child support payments already made. The birth related expenses of $432.80 and past child support through September 30, 1984, of $49,970.40 are to remain unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">4. Regarding educational support, Defendant shall contribute to the trust fund commencing July 1, 1985, and annually thereafter on or before July 1, 80% of the child\u2019s full annual school tuition (including summer school, if applicable) and the estimated cost of books, fees, and other school expenses each year. If Defendant\u2019s deposit does not cover his share of the cost, he shall promptly deposit the balance. Regarding post high school educational support, if the child receives a scholarship, grant, or other entitlement covering tuition and other costs, Petitioner\u2019s and Defendant\u2019s obligations shall be reduced proportionately on an 80-20 basis. All remaining provisions relating to educational support are to remain unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">5. Regarding travel opportunity support, Defendant shall contribute to the trust fund commencing July 1, 1985, and annually thereafter on or before July 1, $1,000 plus the estimated cost of one coach class, round-trip ticket between Honolulu and New York City with the obligation ending on April 20, 1997, when the child attains eighteen years of age. Other provisions dealing with the increases in the amount of travel opportunity support are to be deleted.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">6.
