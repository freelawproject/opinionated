(Consolidated), the owner of the dominant estate, appeals from an adverse summary judgment in favor of defendant Waikiki Business Plaza, Inc. (Plaza), the owner of the servient estate. The dispositive issue is whether the owner of the servient estate can erect and maintain structures on a portion of an easement for ingress and egress which is of a specified width and length and with definite boundaries, where the structures do not \u201cobstruct\u201d the dominant estate owner\u2019s use of the easement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We answer no and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-15\">To facilitate a better understanding of the facts in this case, we include a map as a part of the opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-16\">Consolidated is the owner of Lots 2-C-l and 2-E-l of Land Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Application 551 located in Waikiki.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When Pacific Theatres and Supply Company, Limited, Consolidated\u2019s predecessor in title, acquired these lots in 1934, the deed (Land Court Document No. 31617) provided that the conveyance was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\">TOGETHER with the perpetual right of ingress and egress over the 10-foot strip of land on the Ewa [western] side of [Lots 2-C-1 and 2-E-l], known and designated as Lot 2-B on said Map No. 20, and subject to any prior easements created and existing upon said Lot 2-B.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Consolidated has been operating a movie theater, now known as Waikiki No. 3, on these lots since 1936.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Plaza is the owner of Lot 259 on which stands the multi-story Waikiki Business Plaza building (Plaza Building). The transfer certificate of title which evidences Plaza\u2019s ownership provides that Lot 259 is encumbered by Easement \u201cB\u201d which is subject to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">Perpetual right of way in favor of the owners of Lots 2-C-l, 2-E-l, ... as granted in Document Nos. 31617, . . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">Easement \u201cB\u201d is a portion of Lot 2-B and was established by Land Court Order No. 22297 filed March 18, 1964, upon the consolidation of Lots 2-B, 117, 146, and 147 and their resubdivision into Lots 257, 258, and 259 and the designation of Easement \u201cB,\u201d as shown on Land Court Map 56<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of Application 551. Ten-foot wide Easement \u201cB\u201d abuts a portion of the west boundary of Consolidated\u2019s Lot 2-E-l from Kalakaua Avenue northward for approximately 216 feet and lies within and adjoins the east boundary of Plaza\u2019s Lot 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">In the course of construction of the Plaza Building, William Koon Hee Mau and Jean Rachael Mau(Maus), Plaza\u2019s predecessors in title to Lot 259, and Consolidated executed an agreement dated September 3, 1965 (1965 Agreement). The 1965 Agreement provided, <em>inter alia, </em>as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">1. The Maus were permitted to build a sidewalk and curb in the 5-foot wide western portion of Easement \u201cB\u201d (Area 1 on the map) for \u201cpedestrian passageway\u201d use by both parties in conjunction with the Plaza Building.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">2. The remaining 5-foot wide eastern portion of Easement \u201cB\u201d (Area 2 on the map), together with a portion of Lot 2-E-1 (Area 3 on the map), were to be used as \u201ca roadway\u201d by both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">3. If and when Consolidated ceased using Area 2 for \u201cvehicular roadway purposes,\u201d (a) the \u201cright and license\u201d of both parties to use Areas 2 and 3 as a roadway would \u201ccease and terminate,\u201d (b) the use of Area 1 as a \u201cpedestrian passageway\u201d would continue, and (c) the \u201crights and privilege to use Area 2 for pedestrian, but not vehicular, traffic by the parties\u201d would remain unaffected.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">Subsequently, from a date undisclosed in the record, Consolidated ceased using Areas 2 and 3 for vehicular traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">In June 1971, Plaza entered into a license agreement with Michael Ambler (Ambler), doing business as Taiwan Shop. The agreement permitted the use of the sidewalk area of Easement \u201cB\u201d (Area 1) by Ambler to set up vendors\u2019 booths. After Consolidated\u2019s objection,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in September 1971, Ambler executed a license agreement with Consolidated promising to pay it a monthly fee of $ 1,000. This arrangement continued until 1982 when Ambler vacated the area because he was delinquent in the payment of the monthly fees to Consolidated and also because the license had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">In January 1983, Plaza commenced commercial activities on the sidewalk area of Easement \u201cB.\u201d Plaza caused to be placed in the area ten structures, each approximately four feet wide and six feet long, on which merchandise was displayed and sold. Consolidated objected to these activities to no avail.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-12\">On October 26, 1983, Consolidated filed a complaint seeking (1) an injunction restraining Plaza \u201cfrom closing, obstruction [sic], constructing or allowing commercial carts and counters\u201d on Easement \u201cB,\u201d (2) special damages, and (3) costs and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>On May 22, 1985, concluding that Plaza\u2019s occupation of \u201c4 feet by 216 feet of the easement by having permanent carts located therein\u201d was \u201cnot an obstruction thereof,\u201d the lower court granted Plaza\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Upon denial of its motion for reconsideration. Consolidated timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">11.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">A motion for summary judgment should be granted if the record discloses that \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Rule 56(c), Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (1981). <em>See Hulsman </em>v. <em>Hemmeter Development Corp., </em>65 Haw. 58, 647 P.2d 713 (1982); <em>Leary </em>v. <em>Poole, </em>5 Haw. App. 596, 705 P.2d 62 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Here, the material facts set forth above are not in dispute. Neither party disagrees with the lower court\u2019s finding that Plaza occupied four feet in width of the 10-foot wide Easement \u201cB\u201d leaving six feet of the easement area unobstructed for ingress and egress by theater goers to Consolidated\u2019s theaters.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">However, based on the undisputed facts, we conclude that Plaza was not entitled to a judgment as a matter of law..</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">Plaza justifies the reduction of the width of Easement \u201cB\u201d \u2019s right of way from ten feet to six feet, by contending that \u201cas owner of the servient tenement, [it] is entitled to make all uses of its land, including commercial uses, which do not unreasonably interefere with Consolidated\u2019s easement of ingress and egress.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">The general rule is stated in <em>Aladdin Petroleum Corp. </em>v. <em>Gold Crown Properties, Inc., </em>221 Kan. 579, 561 P.2d 818 (1977), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9H\">[W]here the width, length and location of an easement for ingress and egress have been expressly set forth in the instrument the easement is specific and definite. <em>The expressed terms of the grant or reservation are controlling in such case and considerations of what may be necessary or reasonable to a present use of the dominant estate are not controlling. </em>If, however, the width, length and location of an easement for ingress and egress are not fixed by the terms of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>grant or reservation the dominant estate is ordinarily entitled to a way of such width, length and location as is sufficient to afford necessary or reasonable ingress and egress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-6\"><em>Id. </em>221 Kan. at 584, 561 P.2d at 822 (emphasis added). <em>Accord, Andersen </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>625 P.2d 282 (Alaska 1981); <em>Lindhorst </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>616 P.2d 450 (Okla. Ct. App. 1980). <em>See also </em>3 H. Tiffany, <em>The Laws of Real Property </em>\u00a7 805 (3d ed. 1939). It therefore follows that where the grant or reservation specifies \u201cthe way must be of a certain width, no structures can be erected which encroach on the width stated.\u201d 28 C.J.S. Easements \u00a7 97 at 779 (1941). <em>See also Aladdin Petroleum Corp., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Here, the width, length, and location of Easement \u201cB\u201d for ingress and egress were clearly set forth in the Land Court documents and on the pertinent Land Court maps. The description of Easement \u201cB\u201d is definite and \u201cadmits of no ambiguity.\u201d <em>Lindhorst </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>616 P.2d at 454. Consequently, the terms of the grant of the right of way to Consolidated\u2019s predecessor in title control rather than necessity and reasonableness relative to Consolidated\u2019s present use of Easement \u201cB.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">The 1965 Agreement did not adversely affect Consolidated\u2019s right of ingress and egress in Easement \u201cB.\u201d The 1965 Agreement was a license, and a license in real property \u201cis an \u2018authority to do a particular act or series of acts upon another\u2019s land without possessing any estate therein.\u2019\u201d <em>In re Fasi, </em>63 Haw. 624, 629 n.8, 634 P.2d 98, 102, n.8 (1981) (quoting <em>McCandless v. John Ii Estate, </em>11 Haw. <em>777, </em>789 (1899)). <em>See also, 25 </em>Am. Jur. 2d <em>Easements and Licenses </em>\u00a7 123 (1966). The sidewalk constructed in Area 1 of Easement \u201cB\u201d by the then owners of the servient estate pursuant to the 1965 Agreement in no way diminished the use of the easement area as a right of way for ingress and egress.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">Moreover, Consolidated\u2019s agreement to permit Plaza\u2019s licensee to use a portion of Easement \u201cB\u201d for commercial purposes for a period of approximately eleven years did not result in a partial abandonment of the easement area. The law is clear \u201cthat where an easement is created by grant, deed, or reservation no duty of user devolves upon the owner of the dominant estate as a condition of his right to retain and assert his interest therein.\u201d <em>Suzuki </em>v. <em>Garvey, </em>39 Haw. 482, 486 (1952). <em>See also 25 </em>Am. Jur. 2d <em>Easements and Licenses </em>\u00a7 105 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">Nonetheless, relying heavily on <em>Baum </em>v. <em>Glen Park Properties, </em>660 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>S.W.2d 723 (Mo. App. 1983), Plaza insists that it may erect structures within Easement \u201cB\u201d if they do not unreasonably interfere with Consolidated\u2019s right of ingress and egress. In <em>Baum, </em>the plaintiff sold a portion of her tract of land to the defendant and reserved in the deed \u201can easement for road purposes over a strip of land forty (40) feet wide lying northwest and adjacent to [a certain] described line.\u201d <em>Id. </em>660 S.W.2d at 724. Subsequently, the defendant erected a sign, installed curbing, and planted trees in the easement area. The Missouri Appellate Court held that the defendant \u201cwas entitled to erect any structure on the easement as long as that structure did not interfere with the reasonable use by respondent for purposes of ingress and egress to and from her land.\u201d <em>Id. </em>660 S.W.2d at 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">We are not persuaded by the <em>Baum </em>opinion<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and choose to follow the general rule as set forth in <em>Aladdin Petroleum Corp., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Plaza\u2019s reliance on <em>Goo </em>v. <em>Young, </em>36 Haw. 132 (1942), is misplaced. The issue in <em>Goo </em>was whether there was an abandonment of the whole or a portion of an easement of right of way created by a deed or grant. The court did state that the owner of the servient estate may build <em>over </em>or <em>under </em>the surface of the easement area \u201cif there is no interference with the passageway.\u201d <em>Id. </em>36 Haw. at 150. The court made no reference to erection of structures <em>on </em>the surface of the easement area.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">111.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">We hold that since the right of way over Easement \u201cB\u201d was acquired by grant to Consolidated\u2019s predecessor in title and the width, length, and location of the easement were specific and definite in the grant documents, Plaza had no legal right to reduce the width of Easement \u201cB\u201d by any obstruction. Therefore, Plaza was not entitled to a summary judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A4H\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number><em>Lloyd Y.

Larson </em>with him on the brief; <em>Kobayashi, Watanabe, Sugita &amp; Kawashima, </em>of counsel) for defendant-appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">It is foreordained that Consolidated will be entitled to a judgment on remand. Consequently, we direct the lower court to enter a summary judgment in Consolidated\u2019s favor after determining the appropriate equitable remedy and damages, if any, to be awarded to Consolidated. <em>See In re Estate of Magoon, </em>58 Haw. 345, 569 P.2d 884 (1977); 6-Pt.2 J.

App. 1983), cited the cases of <em>Amitin </em>v. <em>Izard, </em>252 S.W.2d 635 (Mo. App. 1952), and <em>Reutner </em>v. <em>Vouga, </em>367 S.W.2d 34 (Mo. App. 1963). However, both <em>Amitin </em>and <em>Reuter </em>do not appear to be cases on point. In <em>Amitin, </em>the court construed the instrument creating the \u201cprivate road\u201d as not benefiting plaintiffs land. <em>Reutner </em>basically involved the construction of structures below the surface of the easement area and a temporary obstruction of the surface of the easement area during construction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
