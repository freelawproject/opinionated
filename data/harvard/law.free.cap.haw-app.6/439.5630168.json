(Haleakala) and Thomas Thayer (Thayer) (collectively Appellees). We agree with Matsushita and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">On July 28, 1979, Haleakala delivered construction materials loaded on a trailer to Thayer\u2019s lot in Kula, Maui. While assisting Thayer in unloading the trailer, Matsushita allegedly was injured when construction material fell from the trailer upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">On June 27, 1980, Matsushita sued defendant Container Home Supply, Inc. (Container) alleging that Container had \u201cnegligently packaged, shipped, distributed, and sold\u201d the construction materials.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On November 3, 1981, Matsushita filed an amended complaint naming Haleakala and Thayer as additional defendants.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">On September 15, 1982, Judge James H. Wakatsuki entered an \u201cOrder Granting Motion for Summary Judgment\u201d which stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjSZ\">The Court finds that Section 294-36, Hawaii Revised Statutes is applicable, and further finds that there being no payments of no-fault or optional benefits benefits [sic];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-8\">IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that Defendant [sic] THOMAS THAYER and HALEAKALA TRANSPORTATION AND WAREHOUSING, INC.\u2019s Motions for Summary Judgment be and are hereby granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">In the interim, in 1981, on the ground that the trailer involved in the accident was a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d within the meaning of HRS \u00a7 294-2(8),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Matsushita sought no-fault benefits from Haleakala\u2019s insurer, First Insurance Company of Hawaii, Inc. (First Insurance). First Insurance denied him such benefits, and the insurance commissioner\u2019s decision<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was in favor of the insurer. Upon Matsushita\u2019s appeal to the circuit court in Civil No. 70849, the court entered a judgment on September 7, 1982, reversing the commissioner and holding that Matsushita was entitled to no-fault benefits. By its memorandum opinion of October 3, 1983, the supreme court affirmed. <em>Matsushita </em>v. <em>First Insurance Co. of Hawaii, </em>66 Haw. 675 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">On December 14, 1983, Matsushita settled the case against Container.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Relying on the final judgment in Civil No. 70849 Matsushita, on January 17, 1984, moved for reconsideration of Judge Wakatsuki\u2019s September 15, 1982 order granting summary judgment to Haleakala and Thayer (1982 Order). On February 13, 1984, Judge Philip T. Chun denied the motion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Thereafter, the case remained dormant for nearly a year. On January 10, 1985, Matsushita filed Civil No. 85-0015(1) in the Second Circuit Court against Haleakala and Thayer alleging claims arising from the same July 28, 1979 accident. At the September 10, 1985 hearing on Thayer\u2019s motion to strike the statement of readiness in Civil No. 85-0015(1), Second Circuit Judge E. John McConnell suggested that Matsushita file another motion for reconsideration in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">On October 2, 1985, following Judge McConnell\u2019s suggestion, Matsushita filed his second motion for reconsideration of the 1982 Order pursuant to Rule 60(b), Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) (1981). An accompanying memorandum stated that on \u201cApril 18, 1984, [Matsushita] received no-fault benefits in excess of the threashold [sic] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>as provided in Haw. Rev. Stat. Chapter 294.\u201d Judge Chun again denied the motion, and Matsushita appealed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">In <em>Wong </em>v. <em>City &amp; County, </em>66 Haw. 389, 395, 665 P.2d 157, 162 (1983), the supreme court cautioned that \u201c[a] judge should generally be hesitant to modify, vacate or overrule a prior interlocutory order of another judge who sits in the same court.\u201d Although the order denying Matsushita\u2019s October 2, 1985 motion for reconsideration (second motion) does not specify the reason for the denial, Matsushita\u2019s opening brief speculates <em>Wong </em>may have deterred Judge Chun from reconsidering Judge Wakatsuki\u2019s 1982 Order.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\"><em>Wong </em>does not preclude the modification of a prior ruling of another court of equal and concurrent jurisdiction in all instances. Modification will not be an abuse of discretion if <em>\u201ccogent reasons </em>support the second court\u2019s action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>66 Haw. at 396, 665 P.2d at 162 (emphasis in original). <em>See also Gallimore </em>v. <em>Missouri Pacific Railroad Co., </em>635 F.2d 1165 (5th Cir. 1981); <em>Greyhound Computer Corp., Inc. </em>v. <em>International Business Machines Corp., </em>559 F.2d 488 (9th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1040, 98 S. Ct. 782, 54 L. Ed. 2d 790 (1978); <em>In re Airport Car Rental Antitrust Litigation, </em>521 F. Supp. 568 (N.D. Cal. 1981), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>693 F.2d 84 (9th Cir. 1982), <em>cert. denied sub nom., Budget Rent-A-Car of Washington-Oregon, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hertz Corp., </em>462 U.S. 1133, 103 S. Ct. 3114, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1368 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Here, after a lengthy delay, Haleakala\u2019s insurer paid no-fault benefits to Matsushita on April 18, 1984. This fact, disclosed in Matsushita\u2019s second motion, constituted a \u201ccogent reason\u201d to permit Judge Chun to modify the 1982 Order if the law supported such action.</p>\n<p id=\"AyC\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Thayer construes HRS \u00a7 294-36(b) to mean that (1) the two-year statute of limitations begins to run from the date of a motor vehicle accident and (2) the running of the statute will be tolled and a new two-year period retriggered only if, within the two-year period from the date of the accident, \u201cpayments for no-fault benefits or optional additional benefits [are] made[.]\u201d Haleakala then argues that (1) the statutory language is ambiguous since it is \u201csusceptible to more than one interpretation\u201d and (2) legislative intent favors Thayer\u2019s construction. We do not agree with Appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">An elementary statutory construction precept is \u201cthat \u2018where the language of the law in question is plain and unambiguous, construction by [the] court is inappropriate and [the court\u2019s] duty is only to give effect to the law according to its plain and obvious meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Strouss </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>66 Haw. 32, 50, 657 P.2d 1004, 1016 (1982) (quoting <em>In re Hawaiian Telephone Company, </em>61 Haw. 572, 577-78, 608 P.2d 383, 387 (1980)). And we have stated that \u201cthe rule which allows departure from a literal construction of an unambiguous statute should be applied only in special or egregious situations.\u201d <em>Mabe </em>v. <em>Real Estate Commission, 4 </em>Haw. App. 552, 554, 670 P.2d 459, 461 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">In our view, the language of HRS \u00a7 294-36(b) is plain and unambiguous. It clearly provides that the limitations period is the later of (I) two years after the date of the accident or (2) two years after the date of the <em>last </em>payment of no-fault or optional additional benefits. HRS \u00a7 294-36(b)(2) contains no requirement that the payment of no-fault or optional additional payments must commence within the two-year period. We find no special or egregious situation requiring departure from a literal construction of HRS \u00a7 294-36(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">Appellees assert that the case of <em>Wiegand </em>v. <em>Allstate Insurance Companies, </em>68 Haw. __, 706 P.2d 16 (1985), requires the statutory construction they urge upon us. However, <em>Wiegand </em>involved the construction of HRS \u00a7 294-36(a) and the word \u201csuit\u201d therein being susceptible to more than one interpretation rendered the statutory language ambiguous. Here, HRS \u00a7 294-36(b) is unambiguous. Moreover, in <em>Wiegand, </em>the choice of initiating an arbitration proceeding was in the hands of the injured, while here, the power of paying or withholding payments of no-fault benefits remained with the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">We also note that the recent case of <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Nakaoka, </em>68 Haw. __, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>722 P.2d 1028 (1986), holds that \u201cmeeting the threshold requirement is an essential condition and element of [plaintiffs] cause of action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at __, 722 P.2d at 1031. If Appellees\u2019statutory construction is correct and the insurer withholds payment of no-fault benefits for more than two years from the date of the accident, the injured person will be unfairly denied the right of a tort claim because of his inability to meet the threshold requirement<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> within the two-year period. We cannot believe that the legislature intended this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">We hold that the two-year statute of limitations began to run on April 18, 1984, the date of last payment of no-fault benefits to Matsushita. Consequently, we conclude that the lower court abused its discretion in denying the second motion for reconsideration of the 1982 Order made pursuant to Rule 60(b), HRCP.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Judge Chun should have granted the second motion and modified the 1982 Order by denying Appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">We will <em>sua sponte </em>discuss the pending Second Circuit Civil No. 85-0015(1). In his \u201cStatement of Related Proceedings\u201d Matsushita states that in Civil No. 85-0015(1), he \u201cseeks damages sustained as a result of the negligence of Haleakala and Thayer in respect to the same incident which gives rise to this appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">Our supreme court has stated that \u201cwhere the party is the same in a pending suit, and the cause is the same and the relief is the same, a good plea in abatement lies.\u201d <em>Shelton Engineering Contractors, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Hawaiian Pacific Industries, Inc., </em>51 Haw. 242, 249, 456 P.2d 222, 226 1969). <em>See also Yee Hop </em>v. <em>Nakuina, </em>25 Haw. 205 (1919); <em>Oahu Lumber &amp; Building Co. </em>v. <em>Ah Yok, </em>11 Haw. 416 (1898). The common law plea in abatement has been abolished by Rule 7(c), HRCP (1981). However, abatement as a defense may be raised by a motion for dismissal. <em>See, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number><em>Shelton Engineering Contractors, Ltd., supra.</em></p>\n<attorneys id=\"AeDX\"><em>Lawrence L.
