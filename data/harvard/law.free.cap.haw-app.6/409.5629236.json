Judgment and sentence were entered on May 30, 1985. We find no error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Defendant offered a manslaughter instruction which included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-8\">The burden is upon the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant was not acting under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-9\">Therefore, if you find that the Defendant was acting under extreme mental or emotional disturbance as described above, you must find the Defendant guilty of the lesser included offense of manslaughter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">The court refused the quoted portions of the instruction over Defendant\u2019s objection. The balance of the instruction, tracking HRS \u00a7 707-702(2) (1976), the manslaughter statute,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was given by the trial court. Both parties agree that when the defendant in a murder trial raises the manslaughter defense, the State has the burden of proving that Defendant\u2019s actions were not influenced by extreme mental or emotional disturbance.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-11\">Although Defendant attempted to raise the defense in this case, our careful review of the record convinces us that the evidence does not support the manslaughter defense and he was not entitled to an HRS \u00a7 707-702(2) manslaughter instruction. Therefore, the trial court did not err in denying his requested burden of proof instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-12\">There is no evidence that Defendant was \u201cexposed to an extremely unusual and overwhelming stress; and . . . [had] an extreme emotional reaction to it, as a result of which there [was] a loss of self-control and [his] reason [was] overborne by intense feelings, such as passion, anger, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>distress, grief, excessive agitation or other similar emotions.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Dumlao, </em>6 Haw. App. __, __, 715 P.2d 822, 829 (1986) (quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Shelton, </em>88 Misc. 2d 136, 149, 385 N.Y.S.2d 708, 717 (1976)). Moreover, if Defendant did suffer from an extreme mental or emotional disturbance at the time of the offense, there is nothing in the record to indicate a reasonable explanation for his mental or emotional state. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Dumlao, supra, </em>we held that the defendant was entitled to the manslaughter instruction where he presented expert testimony<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and his own testimony to show a reasonable explanation for his mental state. Here, there was none and the manslaughter defense was not available to Defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">The record shows that for several months prior to the incident Defendant was subject to a delusion that he was being invited by the victim to make love to her. Also, he was angry because the victim had pointed an air rifle at him and told him never to come on her property again. When Defendant left home on the night of the incident, he told his companions he was \u201cgoing to a barbecue.\u201d After the incident, he told a jail cellmate he went to the victim\u2019s residence to ask her to go to Guam with him. When she refused, he hit her. Even in the light most favorable to Defendant, the evidence does not indicate the state of mind upon which the murder charge is reduced to manslaughter. There is no evidence to show that he suffered extreme mental or emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-8\">Malice and heat of passion cannot coexist. The mere fact of passion on the part of the slayer will not reduce the crime from murder to voluntary manslaughter where he entertained a previous purpose to kill, unless it is made to appear that such purpose was abandoned before the homicidal act was committed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">40 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Homicide </em>\u00a7 56 (1968) (footnotes omitted). There is no evidence that Defendant\u2019s purpose was abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqk\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Defendant was sentenced under HRS \u00a7 706-606(b) (Supp. 1984)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to life with the possibility of parole for the murder conviction. Upon the State\u2019s motion, the trial court sentenced Defendant as a multiple offender to an extended term of ten years on his criminal property damage conviction, in accordance with HRS \u00a7\u00a7 706-661(3) (1976) and -662(4) (Supp. 1984),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and ordered that the ten-year sentence be served <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>consecutive to the life imprisonment term, under the authority of HRS \u00a7 706-668 (Supp. 1984).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">U nder the original provisions of H RS \u00a7 706-606(b) (1976) relating to the authorized sentence for murder in cases not requiring sentence under \u00a7 706-606(a) because of aggravating circumstances, the trial courts had the discretion to sentence a defendant to imprisonment for twenty years, or for life with possibility of parole. In 1981 the legislature amended \u00a7 706-606(b) to eliminate the twenty year sentence. Act 27, \u00a7 1, 1981 Haw. Sess. Laws 46. Defendant contends that the amended statute imposes an extended term for all persons sentenced under \u00a7 706-606(b) and, citing I Model Penal Code (MPC) \u00a7 7.06(1) (Official Draft and Revised Comments 1985) which states that only one extended term can be imposed in any sentencing, asserts that the trial court could not impose another extended term for the criminal property damage conviction and could not make that extended term run consecutive to the life term. He asserts that the \u201cextended term\u201d of life imprisonment establishes the ceiling for cumulating sentences for his offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The simple answer to Defendant is that our penal code, HRS Title 37 (1976), does not contain the provision of the MPC cited by him. His argument that the present sentence for murder under HRS \u00a7 706-606(b) is an extended term within the meaning of our penal code is without merit. The extended term authorized under the penal code to be imposed by a sentencing judge is a sentence that enlarges the ordinary sentence for any given offense. In amending HRS \u00a7 706-606(b), the legislature did not provide for judicial enlargement of the prison term for murder, but merely provided for a longer ordinary term. Finally, contrary to Defendant\u2019s argument, HRS \u00a7 706-668 allows, without limitation, the sentencing judge discretion to impose consecutive sentences whenever he or she is imposing multiple sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ABE\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number><em>Elvis R.
