JJ.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b135-13\">OPINION OF THE COURT BY</p>\n<author id=\"AbD\">BURNS, C.J.</author>\n<p id=\"b135-14\">Defendant Leslie Doi appeals the trial court\u2019s refusal of his request that the jury be allowed to consider the offense of assault in the third degree as an included or related offense of robbery in the first degree.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-15\">Doi was charged with violating Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 708-840(1)(b)(i) (Supp. 1984). It provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-16\">Robbery in the first degree. (1) A person commits the offense of robbery in the first degree if, in the course of committing theft:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-17\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-18\">(b) He is armed with a dangerous instrument and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>(i) He uses force against the person of anyone present with intent to overcome that person\u2019s physical resistance or physical power of resistance[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Doi contends that the trial court erroneously refused to give Defendant\u2019s Supplemental Requested Instruction No. 1 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-7\">If you find that the State has not proven the offense of Robbery in the First Degree, you may consider the lesser charge of Assault in the Third Degree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-8\">There are two material elements to the offense of Assault in the Third Degree, each of which must be proven by the State beyond a reasonable doubt. The elements are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-9\">1. That the Defendants, LESLIE DOI and MICHAEL ANTHONY RAMIREZ, caused bodily injury to RAYMOND MANNING;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-10\">2. That they did so intentionally, knowingly or recklessly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">In this case, the offenses of robbery first and second required a finding that Doi or his accomplice used force against Manning. As defined in Doi\u2019s proposed instruction, the offense of assault third required a finding that Doi or his accomplice inflicted bodily injury on Manning.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-12\">HRS \u00a7 701-109(4) (1976) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-13\">A defendant may be convicted of an offense included in an offense charged in the indictment or the information. An offense is so included when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-14\">(a) It is established by proof of the same or less than all the facts required to establish the commission of the offense charged; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-15\">(b) It consists of an attempt to commit the offense charged or to commit an offense otherwise included therein; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-16\">(c) It differs from the offense charged only in the respect that a less serious injury or risk of injury to the same person, property, or public interest or a different state of mind indicating lesser degree of culpability suffices to establish its commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-17\">Under HRS \u00a7 701-109(4), an offense whose material elements include the infliction of bodily injury is not included within an offense whose material elements include the use of force but not the infliction of bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-18\">Alternatively, Doi contends that the jury should have been allowed to consider the offense of assault third as a \u201clesser related\u201d offense. <em>See People v. Geiger, </em>35 Cal.3d 510, 674 P.2d 1303, 199 Cal. Rptr. 45 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>(1984).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We disagree for two reasons: 1) Hawaii\u2019s statutory definition of an included offense is already more expansive than the traditional definition;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 2) In our view, the question of whether the definition of an included offense should be expanded beyond HRS \u00a7 701-109(4)\u2019s definition is a matter for legislative, not judicial, action. <em>See Bissen </em>v. <em>Fujii, </em>51 Haw. 636, 466 P.2d 429 (1970).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A_K\"><em>Elvis Pila-Patea, </em>Deputy Public Defender <em>(Susan Barr, </em>Deputy Public Defender on the brief) for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AKr\"><em>Peter M.
