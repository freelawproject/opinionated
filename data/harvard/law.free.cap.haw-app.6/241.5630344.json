We hold the court erred in denying Kapuni\u2019s motion and in not allowing her to assert her rights as grantee. We also hold that the judgment is void as to all defendants who were not personally served or who did not appear. We do so under the plain error rule. The judgment is not void as to those defendants who were personally served or who did appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">On February 2,1979, Hustace filed a complaint to quiet title, naming as defendants Gregory P. Kapuni (Gregory), Julia Kapuni Sato (Julia), Leilani R. Tolentino (Leilani) (children of Kapuni and her husband, Panila, who had died), Kapuni, and John Doe 1 to John Doe 100. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>lower court authorized service by publication on the Doe defendants. After Hustace named additional defendants in an amended complaint,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a second order was entered authorizing service by publication on those defendants. Gregory, Julia, Leilani, and Kapuni filed answers and counterclaims. On July 25, 1980, default was entered against all other defendants for failure to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Kapuni\u2019s counterclaim asserted that she was the rightful owner of a life tenancy in the kuleanas and that Hustace\u2019s occupation was permissive.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On May 11, 1983, the trial court heard Hustace\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment on the counterclaims. At that hearing, the trial court allowed counterclaimants up to October 1, 1983, within which to produce a genealogy establishing their claim to the kuleanas. They failed to do so and on October 25, 1983, the trial court entered its order granting Hustace\u2019s partial summary judgment motion and dismissing the counterclaims.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">On November 23, 1983, Kapuni obtained a quitclaim deed from Josephine Flores (Flores) to her interest in one of the kuleanas, L.C.A. No. 8106 to Haina.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On Decemberl, 1983, Kapuni obtained a quitclaim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>deed from John Goss (Goss) for his interest in the other kuleana, L.C.A. No. 4092 to Kaluna.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Based on these deeds, Kapuni moved the trial court to declare that she had an interest in the property and to reinstate her counterclaim or, in the alternative, to set aside the default entered against Flores and Goss as heirs of Mrs. Poo John (John) and Rebecca H. Hitchcock (Hitchcock), respectively. On December 22, 1983, the trial court denied Kapuni\u2019s motion, but allowed her to participate at trial by cross-examining Hustace\u2019s witnesses and calling her own witnesses \u201cfor appeal purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">After a bench trial, the trial court concluded that Hustace had established title to the kuleanas through adverse possession by actual, open, visible, notorious, hostile and continuous possession of the kuleana for at least ten years.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Kapuni timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">KAPUNI\u2019S STANDING TO APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">Hustace argues that Kapuni has standing to appeal only the partial summary judgment on her counterclaim because she is not aggrieved by the final judgment. The argument is without merit, since final judgment encompasses the partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">Hustace also contends that Kapuni has no standing under the deeds of Flores and Goss, because their interests, if any, were so minuscule as not to give her, as a practical matter, an appealable stake. Hustace cites no authority for the proposition that an appealable interest must be a substantial one, and we reject that argument. <em>See Ala Moana Boat Owners\u2019 Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>State, </em>50 Haw. 156, 434 P.2d 516 (1967). Moreover, we do not believe, particularly in land cases, that standing to appeal is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>dependent upon the magnitude of one\u2019s claim. <em>See Hana Ranch </em>v. <em>Kanakaole, </em>1 Haw. App. 573, 623 P.2d 885 (1981).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\">It behooves the court in the pursuit of justice on behalf of all the parties not to be over nice in the application of modern, technical, legal concepts in determining standing in [quiet title] cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-6\"><em>Id. </em>1 Haw. App. at 576, 623 P.2d at 887; <em>accord, City and County of Honolulu </em>v. <em>Bennett, 2 </em>Haw. App. 180, 627 P.2d 1136 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Under the quitclaim deeds from Flores and Goss, Kapuni acquired whatever interest they may have had in the kuleanas. <em>See Christian </em>v. <em>Waialua Agricultural Co., </em>35 Haw. 352 (1940); <em>see generally, </em>6 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Assignments </em>\u00a7 102 <em>et seq. </em>(1963); 23 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Deeds </em>\u00a7 339 (1983). In our view, this included their right to move to set aside the default on the ground of lack of personal jurisdiction and assert a claim of title to the kuleanas.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">Hustace also argues that Kapuni is not entitled to relief because even though her motion to reinstate her claim or set aside the defaults was denied, she fully participated in the trial. We do not find the argument persuasive. Her participation in the trial does not deprive her of a right to complain about the result, or the denial of her motion. Furthermore, the court specifically stated that it was allowing Kapuni to participate in the trial \u201cfor appeal purposes.\u201d Hustace made no objection to that action below and cannot be heard to complain now. Moreover, the record indicates that her participation was only in asserting her claim in her own right. She did not present, nor did the court consider, her claim as grantee of Flores and Goss. As a result of the default their interests were not litigated below, nor were they argued on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">Based on the above, we hold that Kapuni has standing to appeal the judgment in her own right and as the assignee of Flores and Goss.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">KAPUNI\u2019S MOTION TO SET ASIDE DEFAULTS</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">Kapuni asserts the lower court erred in denying her motion to set aside the defaults entered against Flores and Goss.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Service on Flores and Goss, as unknown defendants, was made by publication, pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 669-3 (1976)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and \u00a7\u00a7 634-23(1) and (2) (1976).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The original complaint named as defendants Gregory, Julia, Leilani, Kapuni, and Doe Defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>dants 1 to 100. Subsequently, Hustace obtained a title search of the kuleanas and on April 25, 1979, filed an ex parte motion to amend the complaint to add certain named defendants, among them being the heirs of John and Hitchcock, who were Flores\u2019 and Goss\u2019 alleged predecessors in interest. Hustace was authorized by the trial court\u2019s order to serve by publication \u201cdefendants who are unknown or do not reside within the State of Hawaii or cannot for any reason be served with process within the State.\u201d The published notice was addressed to, among others, \u201cREBECCA HOWARD HITCHCOCK and her heirs\u201d and \u201cMRS. POO JOHN and her heirs.\u201d On July 25, 1980, the lower court entered default against all non-answering defendants, including the heirs of Hitchcock and John. We hold that the lower court\u2019s authorization for service by publication was improvidently granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Under \u00a7 634-23(1), a defendant in a civil action may be joined as an unknown defendant \u201cas provided by the rules of court.\u201d Rule 17(d)(1), Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) (1984), requires that the plaintiff in such case set forth in a pleading \u201cwith specificity all actions already undertaken in a diligent and good-faith effort to ascertain the person\u2019s full name and identity.\u201d Hustace did not comply with the rule, either in his complaint or the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Similarly, \u00a7 634-23(2) requires that an affidavit, filed in support of a request for service by publication, \u201cshall set forth facts based upon the personal knowledge of the affiant concerning the methods, means, and attempts made to locate and effect personal service on the defendant and any other pertinent facts.\u201d The affidavits filed by Hustace\u2019s attorney with both the original and amended complaints are utterly devoid of any specificity regarding the efforts made to determine the names of the heirs of John and Hitchcock.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>It is axiomatic that service of process is a fundamental requirement of due process of law, <em>see Calasa </em>v. <em>Greenwell, 2 </em>Haw. App. 395, 633 P.2d 553 (1981), and personal service is preferred to constructive service by publication. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Murphy, 55 </em>Haw. 34, 514 P.2d 865 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Constructive service of process may only be utilized where authorized by statute, <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Murphy, supra; In Re Vockrodt, </em>50 Haw. 201, 436 P.2d 752 (1968), and the law requires strict compliance with such statutes. <em>Murphy, supra; Calasa v. Greenwell, supra.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-7\">The test [of whether substituted service is authorized], however, is not whether it was in fact possible to effect service in a given case, but whether the complainant reasonably employed knowledge at his command, made diligent inquiry, and exerted an honest and conscientious effort appropriate to the circumstances, to acquire the information necessary to enable him to effect personal service on the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-8\"><em>Murphy, 55 </em>Haw. at 36, 514 P.2d at 867 (quoting <em>McDaniel </em>v. <em>McElvy, </em>91 Fla. 770, 779-780, 108 So. 820, 830-831 (1926)).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">Diligence is a relative term and each case must be determined upon its own circumstances. <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>117 Utah 417, 217 P.2d 373 (1950). However, \u201c[affidavits devoid of averments of facts showing that due diligence was exercised to make service have consistently been held to be insufficient.]\u201d <em>Batte </em>v. <em>Bandy, </em>165 Cal. App. 2d 527, 534, 332 P.2d 439, 443 (1958).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> And it has been held that, even where the statute may be satisfied by the bare allegation of due diligence, the requirement of the exercise of diligence and good faith cannot be foregone. <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Doherty, </em>53 N.M. 280, 206 P.2d 1145 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">In <em>Bomford v. Socony Mobil Oil Co., </em>440 P.2d 713 (Okla. 1968), the court pointed out that some primary sources of information as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>identification and address of a defendant are tax rolls, deed records, judicial and other official records, and that secondary sources may include a telephone directory, or a city directory, or some other similar information base. Where it appears that such sources have been exhausted, the trial court\u2019s determination of due diligence will be treated on appeal like any other factual determination.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>440 P.2d 718-719.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">In the instant case, not only did Hustace have the <em>Bomford </em>sources of information available but we take judicial notice, Rule 201, Hawaii Rules of Evidence (1980), that a brief visit to the State Archives would have provided Hustace or counsel with the following sources of genealogical information: State library, Bishop Museum, churches, circuit and supreme courts, Mission House, Hawaii Sugar Planter\u2019s Association, Department of Health, Department of Immigration and Naturalization, and the State Archives itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Hustace\u2019s attorney\u2019s affidavit failed to aver any facts showing that due diligence was exercised, averring only the conclusory language of the statute. Additionally, there is nothing in the record to indicate that the trial court was presented with any evidence of the efforts used to locate the heirs of John or Hitchcock. <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Doherty, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Moreover, the record shows that an attempt to locate the heirs of John or Hitchcock would not have presented such a monumental task. Hustace\u2019s title search indicates the titles to L.C.A. Nos. 8106 and 4209 came down in unbroken lines to John and Hitchcock, respectively. Only their heirs had to be found. Within three or four weeks from the time Alicia Kalahiki,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Kapuni\u2019s witness, was asked to find any heirs of John and Hitchcock, she was able to identify Flores and Goss. In this connection, we take judicial notice of the fact that Moloka'i is a small island <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>whose population in 1980 was 6,049,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and that the majority of Moloka\u2018i\u2019s residents are part-Hawaiian,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> who have lived there a long time, know each other well, and have deep knowledge of each other\u2019s ancestral roots.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Moreover, it should be noted that attached to Kapuni\u2019s motion to set aside the defaults as to Flores and Goss is Goss\u2019 affidavit, together with attachments indicating that in 1976 Goss met and talked to Maria on Moloka\u2019i. He informed her directly that he was a descendant of Rebecca Hitchcock. At that time, Goss was a Honolulu resident who participated in a church gathering at Kaluaaha, near the kuleanas. Maria allowed Goss and others to travel to the grave of his ancestors \u201cthrough property we were told she owned.\u201d Maria had direct knowledge of Goss\u2019 existence and his whereabouts. We reject Maria\u2019s argument that there is no evidence that Maria communicated this knowledge to her husband, Harold. According to the exhibits attached to Goss\u2019 affidavit that event was a historic one for Kaluaaha and received wide notoriety. It is inconceivable that Maria did not talk to Harold about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">The ease by which the heirs could have been identified is not the test of the sufficiency of Hustace\u2019s affidavit, <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Murphy, supra; </em>however, it points out the absence of due diligence in this case. \u201cDue diligence must be tailored to fit the circumstances of each case. It is that diligence which is appropriate to accomplish the end sought and which is reasonably calculated to do so.\u201d <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>117 Utah at 228, 217 P.2d at 379 (concurring opinion of Wolfe, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">We hold that in any action to establish title through adverse possession the claimant should be held to strict compliance with the statutory provisions regarding notice.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Affidavits should specify the sources the affiant consulted in his efforts to locate and effect personal service on the defendant or defendants. The adverse claimant should not be allowed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>rely on a bald statement that diligent inquiry was made. The consequences of quiet title actions are so severe that to have one\u2019s interest in land summarily taken away without an opportunity to respond is in violation of due process requirements<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and our sense of fairness and justice. Protection against violation of due process requires vigilance against defective notice. Strict adherence to the statute is mandatory. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Murphy, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">On the basis of the above discussion, we hold that the trial court erred in authorizing service by publication against the heirs of Hitchcock and John, and the judgment is void as to their interests. \u201cIt is established that, where orders for publication of summons are void by reason of the insufficiency of the affidavits therefor, defaults and default judgments entered and rendered on service made pursuant thereto are likewise <em>void on their face, </em>and should be set aside.\u201d <em>Batte v. Bandy, </em>165 Cal. App. 3d at 536, 332 P.2d at 445 (emphasis added); <em>Cavin Memorial Corp. </em>v. <em>Regua, </em>5 Cal. App. 3d 345, 357, 85 Cal. Rptr. 107, 113 (1970); <em>see also Murphy </em>v. <em>Murphy, supra. </em>Moreover, deprivation of property solely on the basis of substituted service in adverse possession actions is constitutionally deficient in situations where, with the use of due diligence, actual notice is possible. <em>Louthan </em>v. <em>Amoco Production Co., 652 </em>P.2d 308, 310 (Okla. App. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Lest interested persons believe that \u00f3ur holding is too strict and would cause undue effort and expense, we invite their attention to the concurring opinion of Wolfe, J., in <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Ross, supra.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-7\">Many times the value of the property involved is small but the work involved in an honest attempt to discover the address of the defendant, if living, or if dead, the names of the heirs, is considerable and from a monetary standpoint the effort cannot be rewarded by the compensation it deserves because the traffic will not bear the charge conscientious service deserves. Such conscientious service partly unrewarded is one of the services the legal profession must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>contribute. When the property is valuable and clearing the title is a prerequisite to its mortgagability or construction of valuable buildings there is usually more money to pay for the search. There is a bedrock of reasonable diligence under the circumstances of any case which must be reached but in cases where the property involved is quite valuable, the plaintiff will want to make efforts well beyond the bare minimum required to obtain the judicial approval of the affidavit of due diligence. The test in any case is not utter diligence but reasonable or due diligence for no one should take the risk of a bare minimum because it would not be known what the bare minimum would be which would satisfy the judge. For the judge himself would not only want to satisfy himself but be satisfied that this court on appeal would conclude that he had shown proper judgment, and if the case never reached this court, it would be somewhat embarrassing if after publication had been ordered and judgment on constructive service rendered, the owner should appear and show that he had received no notice of the action but that his address could have easily been ascertained had a trifle of ingenuity been exercised as a part of diligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-6\"><em>Id. </em>117 Utah at 428-29, 217 P.2d at 379.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">. Finally, we do not intend by this opinion to open a \u201cpandora\u2019s box\u201d and allow everyone whose title to land may have long ago been lost in a case where service was made by publication, to now attack that judgment. In <em>Giles </em>v. <em>Adobe Royalty, Inc., </em>235 Kan. 758, 684 P.2d 406 (1984), the Kansas supreme court held that modern concepts of due process would not apply retrospectively, because such action would have widespread and devastating effect on divorces and land titles. Those same concerns prompt us to hold here that our decision is applicable prospectively only. <em>See </em>Comment, <em>Constitutional Law: Notice by Publication - Modern Standards of Due Process Not Retroactively Applied, </em>24 Washburn L.J. 639 (Winter 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">The judgment is vacated as to all defendants who were, not personally served or who did not appear, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings as to them. On remand, Hustace will be required to take further \u201cgood faith\u201d steps to determine and locate the heirs of John and Hitchcock and to serve them personally. In this regard, Hustace has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>been helped by the fact that Kapuni\u2019s attorney\u2019s tenacity has uncovered Flores and Goss, and other potential heirs. In the event such further heirs cannot be found or cannot be personally served, Plaintiff may then apply to the trial court for authorization to make substituted service. The affidavit in support of the request to make substituted service must conform to the requirements set forth in this opinion.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AoK\"><em>Alan T. Murakami (Melody K.

We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>\u201c[A] motion for summary judgment should be granted only \u2018where, from the record, there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and movants clearly demonstrate they should prevail as a matter of law.\u2019\u201d <em>Kang v. Charles Pankow Associates, </em>5 Haw. App. 1, 5, 675 P.2d 803, 806 (1984) (quoting <em>Hulsman </em>v. <em>Hemmeter Development Corp., </em>65 Haw. 58, 61, 647 P.2d 713, 716 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"Aqe\">In this case, in order for Kapuni to prevail on her counterclaim, she first had to establish good title to the property either by deed or intestate succession. She was given time to establish title, but was unable to do so. She was not entitled to a denial of the motion merely on the hope of developing such evidence at trial. <em>Waimea Falls Park, Inc. </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>6 Haw. App. __, 712 P.2d 1136 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"Af6\">In the briefs and at oral argument, Kapuni argued only the merits of her own claim. On the basis of the record, it does not appear that the trial court could have awarded title to the kuleanas to Kapuni in her own right <em>and </em>as assignee, since the evidence in the case does not show a split in the titles to the kuleanas. Under the circumstances of the case, either Kapuni owned the legal title or Flores and Goss, and others, did. The denial of her motion precluded her from asserting her claim as grantee of Flores and Goss. This opinion affirming the summary judgment precludes her from further litigating any claim in her own right.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b266-10\">HRS \u00a7 669-3 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-11\">Notice by publication or registered mail.
