A probate proceeding<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was commenced below on November 14, 1980, when Edwin Y.H. Chinn (Chinn), Decedent\u2019s uncle, was appointed special administrator of Decedent\u2019s estate on an <em>ex parte </em>basis. Thereafter, as special administrator, Chinn filed a diversity action against American Airlines and McDonnell in the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Appellants intervened in this proceeding and on June 15, 1983, American Airlines filed a \u201cPetition to Vacate Probate\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on grounds that Decedent was not domiciled in Hawaii at the time of death. McDonnell joined in American Airlines\u2019 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">On October 28, 1983, Walter C. K. Chun and Sau Chun Wong Chun (collectively Chuns), Decedent\u2019s parents, filed a \u201cPetition for Adjudication of Intestacy and Appointment of Personal Representative without Priority.\u201d The petition alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that Decedent \u201cwas domiciled in the City and County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii.\u201d The petition was set to be heard on December 16, 1983, and notice of the hearing was published in a Honolulu newspaper as required by law. However, no notice was served on American Airlines and McDonnell by mail or otherwise. On the hearing date, no one appeared to object to the petition. Despite the pending \u201cMotion to Revoke Probate,\u201d on January 9, 1984, the circuit court entered its \u201cOrder of Intestacy, Determination of Heirs and Appointment of Personal Representative\u201d (Order of Intestacy), which, <em>inter alia, </em>found that Decedent was domiciled in Hawaii at the time of death and appointed Chinn as the personal representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">On March 8, 1984, Chinn, the Chuns, and Yen Chun, Decedent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>sister,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> filed a \u201cPetition for Order Declaring Hawaii to be Decedent\u2019s Domicile.\u201d On May 2, 1985, the circuit court entered its \u201cFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order\u201d (May 2, 1985 Order) denying Appellants\u2019 \u201cPetition to Revoke Probate\u201d and granting the \u201cPetition for Order Declaring Hawaii to be Decedent\u2019s Domicile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Appellants first filed their \u201cApplication for Interlocutory Appeal\u201d on May 17, 1985, and then their \u201cRequest for Rule 54(b) Certification of Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order filed on May 2, 1985\u201d on May 23, 1985. On June 27, 1985, the circuit court filed its \u201cOrder Granting Request for Rule 54(b) Certification of Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order filed on May 2, 1985 and Denying Application for Interlocutory Appeal.\u201d Appellants\u2019 appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">Appellees assert that the May 2, 1985 Order was an appealable final order from which Appellants were required to file a notice of appeal within 30 days under Rule4(a)( 1), Hawaii Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) (1985). They argue that Appellants\u2019 notice of appeal filed on July 26, 1985, came too late. If Appellees\u2019 reasoning is correct, Appellants are foreclosed from an appellate review of the domicile issue hotly contested below. However, we do not agree with Appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">Although the final and appealable judgment, decree, or order is usually the final decision in a case, in some cases a judgment, decree or order, which does not conclude all matters in the proceeding, is considered final and appealable. <em>See TBS Pacific, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tamura, </em>5 Haw. App. 222, 686 P.2d 37 (1984), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>December 14, 1984. Thus, for example, a \u201cjudgment of foreclosure of mortgage or other lien and sale of foreclosed property is final, although it contains a direction to commissioners to make a report of sale and to bring the proceeds into court for an order regarding their disposition.\u201d <em>MDG Supply, Inc. </em>v. <em>Diversified Investments, Inc., </em>51 Haw. 375, 380, 463 P.2d 525, 528 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>(1969). <em>See also Powers </em>v. <em>Ellis, 55 </em>Haw. 414, 520 P.2d 431 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">We hold that, like a judgment or decree of foreclosure, an order of formal probate of will or an order of intestacy entered in a formal testacy proceeding is an appealable final order. The order determines \u201cthe decedent\u2019s domicile at death, his heirs, his state of testacy, who shall serve as personal representative and whether or not informal proceedings may be maintained.\u201d Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 560:3-409 (1976).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, the order \u201cfinally determines the merits of the controversy [if any, concerning the decedent\u2019s domicile, heirs, etc.], and subsequent proceedings are simply incidents to its enforcement.\u201d <em>MDG Supply, Inc. </em>v. <em>Diversified Investments, Inc., </em>51 Haw. at 380, 463 P.2d at 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">The provisions in HRS \u00a7\u00a7 560:3-412 and 3-413 (1976) support our holding. Those sections provide in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-7\">\u00a7 560:3-412 Formal testacy proceedings; effect of order; vacation. <em>Subject to appeal </em>and subject to vacation as provided herein and in section 560:3-413, <em>a formal testacy order </em>under sections 560:3-409 to 560:3-411, including an order that the decedent left no valid will and determining heirs, <em>is final as to all persons with respect to all issues </em>concerning the decedent\u2019s estate that the court considered or might have considered incident to its rendition relevant to the question of whether the decedent left a valid will, and to the determination of heirs[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-9\">\u00a7 560:3-413 Formal testacy proceedings; vacation of order for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>other cause. For good cause shown, an order in a formal testacy proceeding may be modified or vacated <em>within the time allowedfor appeal.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">(Emphasis added.) The language of finality appears in \u00a7 3-412. \u201c[T]he time allowed for appeal\u201d in \u00a7 3-413 refers to the formal testacy order sought to be modified or vacated, which under Rule 4(a)(1), HRAP, would be 30 days from the filing of such order. <em>See In re Estate of Corbett, </em>203 Neb. 392, 279 N.W.2d 89 (1979). The reading of those two sections together convinces us that a formal testacy order under HRS \u00a7 560:3-409 is an appealable final order. <em>See Matter of Estate of Decker, </em>194 Colo. 143, 570 P.2d 832 (1977) (order of probate is \u201ca final appeal-able order\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">We hold, however, that the Order of Intestacy filed on January 9, 1984, in this case was not an appealable final order because it was a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">Regarding decedents\u2019 estates, the applicability of the Hawaii Uniform Probate Code is limited to \u201cestates of decedents . . . domiciled in this State[.]\u201d HRS \u00a7 560:1-301 (1976). HRS \u00a7 560:3-409 requires the court \u201cafter any hearing that may be necessary... [to] determine... the decedent\u2019s domicile at death[.]\u201d Thus, the determination of domicile is a statutory prerequisite for a formal testacy order under HRS \u00a7 560:3-409.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">Here, Appellants\u2019 \u201cPetition to Vacate Probate,\u201d which disputed Decedent\u2019s alleged Hawaii domicile, was pending. The statute required the court to conduct a hearing and properly determine Decedent\u2019s domicile. Absent a determination based on proper notice and a full hearing, the Order of Intestacy was, in essence, an <em>ex parte </em>order and a nullity. An entry of an order of intestacy was proper only after the filing of the May 2, 1985 Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">Therefore, the May 2, 1985 Order itself was interlocutory and not an appealable final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-13\">We hold that the Rule 54(b), Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) (1981), certification was an improper means of cloaking the May 2, 1985 Order with finality.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ab3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number><em>Jerold Matayoshi (Burnham H.

Probate proceedings involve procedures and forms different from those set forth in the HRCP. <em>See </em>J. Conrad, <em>Hawaii Probate Sourcebook </em>(1st ed. 1985); Hawaii Institute of Continuing Legal Education, <em>Hawaii Probate Manual </em>(2d ed. 1979). Although the various steps necessary to the administration of decedents\u2019 estates are civil as distinguished from criminal matters, \u201cthey are [not] civil in the sense that the procedure by which ordinary civil suits must be heard and determined is applicable to them.\u201d <em>Estate of Mansbridge, 29 </em>Haw. 73, 77 (1926). Thus, the failure to amend Rule 81(a)(1) to include HRS Chapter 560 was an oversight and does not change the intent of the HRCP to exclude probate proceedings from their applicability.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Moreover, even if the HRCP were applicable in this case, Rule 54(b), HRCP, applies only in a case involving multiple claims or multiple parties and where at least one claim has been fully adjudicated as to at least one party. <em>See </em>C. Wright, A. Miller and M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil <em>2d </em>\u00a7 2656 (1983). The sole \u201cclaim\u201d in this proceeding is the settlement of Decedent\u2019s estate. That \u201cclaim\u201d has not been fully adjudicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Accordingly, the certification of the June 27,1985 Order under Rule 54(b), HRCP, was improper, and we lack appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Aqa\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number><em>Richard E.
