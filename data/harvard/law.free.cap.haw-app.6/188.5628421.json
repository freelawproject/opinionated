(Thacker), and Barbara Thompson (Thompson).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-17\">The issue is whether Thacker and Thompson are entitled as a matter of law to a judgment that they are not liable to Buyer for the tort of negligent misrepresentation. We answer no and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>Viewed most favorably to Buyer,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the relevant facts are as follows:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The property which is the subject of this appeal is a parcel of leasehold land located at 4157 Black Point Road, Honolulu, Hawaii (the \u201cProperty\u201d). The Property has a residence on it and extends in a rough triangular shape to a point overlooking the sea. Sometime prior to June 1, 1978, Thacker and Thompson, a broker employed by Thacker, obtained a listing for the sale of the Property from the sellers. Thacker and Thompson advertised it for sale describing it as containing approximately 25,308 square feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">On May 31, 1978, Buyer made a written offer to purchase the Property by way of a Hawaii Association of Realtors 1971 Standard Form Deposit, Receipt, Offer and Acceptance (DROA). The sellers counter offered, and Buyer accepted on June 3, 1978. The DROA set September 8, 1978 as the closing date but authorized the sellers\u2019 broker to delay the closing for 30 days. It specified that the Property is \u201capproximately 25,308 sq. ft[.]\u201d It required sellers \u201cto show visible staking of boundaries or have property staked by surveyor\u201d and to furnish Buyer a licensed abstractor\u2019s \u201cCertificate of Title showing good title to the property or the interest to be conveyed vested in Buyer.\u201d If seller failed to deliver title as specified, Buyer at his option could terminate the agreement and have his deposits returned to him. It provided that \u201c[tjhis transaction shall be processed and closed in escrow by Bank of Hawaii.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Prior to Buyer\u2019s offer and again prior to Buyer\u2019s acceptance of the counter offer, Thompson represented to Buyer and Buyer\u2019s broker. Penny Bradley,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that the Ewa boundary of the sellers\u2019 Property was located along the hollow-tile wall; that there were no encroachments on the Property; and that the total area of the Property contained approximately 25,308 square feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Prior to the Buyer\u2019s acceptance of the counter offer, Thompson conducted a preliminary investigation with respect to the title to and boundaries of the Property and discovered no encroachments. How<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>ever, she had notice that the Policy of Title Insurance, dated May 9, 1977, obtained by the sellers when they purchased the Property, specifically excluded coverage for loss or damage caused by the \u201c[ljocation of the seaward boundary in accordance with the laws of the State of Hawaii[.]\u201d Nevertheless, she did not inform Buyer, a California resident, of this boundary problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">When the boundary survey was completed on September 13, 1978, it was discovered that the hollow-tile wall along the Ewa boundary encroached a total of 701 square feet upon the adjacent property. The survey also revealed that the Black Point Association swimming pool fence encroached upon the seaward corner of the Ewa boundary of the Property to the extent of 80 square feet. Thereafter, the sellers and Thompson represented to Buyer that the encroachment problems would be corrected and that good title to the 25,308 square feet would be conveyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">However, these encroachment problems could not be remedied unless the location of the seaward boundary of the Property, which was disputed by the State of Hawaii under <em>In re Application of Ashford, </em>50 Haw. 314, 440 P.2d 76 (1968), was adjusted resulting in a loss of approximately 3,800 square feet from the Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">On December 13, 1978, Buyer rescinded the DROA and subsequently filed this action against sellers, Thacker, Thompson, and one other named defendant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The complaint alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that Thacker and Thompson negligently failed prior to advertising the Property for sale to investigate the status of its title, its true area, and the existence of encroachments affecting it, and negligently made misrepresentations to Buyer regarding the Property. It prayed for unspecified special and general damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">In <em>Shaffer </em>v. <em>Earl Thacker Co., Ltd., </em>3 Haw. App. 81, 641 P.2d 983 (1982), we reversed the summary judgment in favor of sellers, Thacker, and Thompson. Upon remand, the lower court concluded that Thacker and Thompson did not owe to the Buyer the tort duties which Buyer claims they breached and again issued a summary judgment in their favor. On October 24, 1984, pursuant to Rule 54(b), Hawaii Rules of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>Civil Procedure (HRCP) (1981), a final judgment was entered, and Buyer\u2019s timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">The material elements of the tort of negligent misrepresentation are described in the Restatement (Second) of Torts (1977) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-5\">\u00a7 552. Information Negligently Supplied for the Guidance of Others</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-6\">(1) One who, in the course of his business, profession or employment, or in any other transaction in which he has a pecuniary interest, supplies false information for the guidance of others in their business transactions, is subject to liability for pecuniary loss caused to them by their justifiable reliance upon the information, if he fails to exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating the information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-7\">(2) Except as stated in Subsection (3), the liability stated in Subsection (1) is limited to loss suffered</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-8\">(a) by the person or one of a limited group of persons for whose benefit and guidance he intends to supply the information or knows that the recipient intends to supply it; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-9\">(b) through reliance upon it in a transaction that he intends the information to influence or knows that the recipient so intends or in a substantially similar transaction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-10\">(3) The liability of one who is under a public duty to give the information extends to loss suffered by any of the class of persons for whose benefit the duty is created, in any of the transactions in which it is intended to protect them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-11\">\u00a7 552A. Contributory Negligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-12\">The recipient of a negligent misrepresentation is barred from recovery for pecuniary loss suffered in reliance upon it if he is negligent in so relying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-13\">\u00a7 552B. Damages for Negligent Misrepresentation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-14\">(1) The damages recoverable for a negligent misrepresentation are those necessary to compensate the plaintiff for the pecuniary loss to him of which the misrepresentation is a legal cause, including</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-15\">(a) the difference between the value of what he has received in the transaction and its purchase price or other value given for it; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-16\">(b) pecuniary loss suffered otherwise as a consequence of the plaintiffs reliance upon the misrepresentation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>(2) the damages recoverable for a negligent misrepresentation do not include the benefit of the plaintiffs contract with the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Here, Buyer alleged a \u00a7 552 negligent misrepresentation rather than a \u00a7 525 fraudulent misrepresentation<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or a \u00a7 552C innocent misrepresentation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">The tort of negligent misrepresentation was recognized by the Hawaii Supreme Court in <em>Chun </em>v. <em>Park, </em>51 Haw. 462, 462 P.2d 905 (1969) (title company retained by seller owes to buyer a duty of reasonable care in conducting and preparing a title search despite a lack of privity). We know of no valid reason why this tort should not apply to real estate brokers representing the sellers of residential real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">We find additional support for our holding in Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 467-14 (1976 &amp; Supp. 1984) governing the licensing and conduct of real estate brokers and salesmen, which provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-9\">Revocation and suspension of licenses. The real estate commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>sion may revoke any license issued hereunder, or suspend the right of the licensee to use the license, for any of the following causes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-6\">(2) Making any misrepresentation concerning any real estate transaction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-7\">(3) Making any false promises concerning any real estate transaction of a character likely to mislead another;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-8\">(4) Pursuing a continued and flagrant course of misrepresentation, or making of false premises through advertising or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">Similarly, \u00a7 16-99-3 of the Real Estate Commission Rules (1984) which have been adopted by the Real Estate Commission to clarify and implement HRS chapter 467 provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-10\"><em>Conduct, </em>(a) To fully protect the general public in its real estate transactions, every licensee shall conduct business in accordance with this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-11\">(b) The licensee shall protect the public against fraud, misrepresentation, or unethical practices in the real estate field. The licensee shall endeavor to eliminate any practices in the community which could be damaging to the public or to the dignity and integrity of the real estate profession. The licensee shall assist the commission in its efforts to regulate the practices of brokers and salesmen in this State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-12\">(c) The licensee shall ascertain and disclose all pertinent facts concerning every property for which the licensee accepts the agency, so that the licensee may fulfill its obligation to avoid error, misrepresentation, or concealment of pertinent facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-13\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-14\">(e) The licensee shall recommend that title be examined, survey be conducted, or legal counsel be obtained when the interest of either party requires it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-15\">Under Rule 56(c), HRCP (1981), Thacker and Thompson are not entitled to summary judgment unless the evidence in the record demonstrates as a matter of law that they are not liable to Buyer for the tort of negligent misrepresentation. Upon a thorough review of the record, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>conclude that the record does not demonstrate their entitlement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The alleged fact that the Buyer was a sophisticated buyer and was represented by his own broker is relevant to the factual issues of Buyer\u2019s justifiable reliance and contributory negligence but does not exonerate Thacker and Thompson from liability.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AmP2\"><em>Steven K.S.
