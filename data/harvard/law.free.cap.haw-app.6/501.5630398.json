Miura (Defendant) with the offense of driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor, plaintiff State of Hawaii (State) appeals from the district court\u2019s \u201cOrder Granting in Part Motion to Suppress Evidence.\u201d Defendant contends the order was not appealable under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 641-13(7) (Supp. 1984) and this court lacks appellate jurisdiction. We agree and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>. After a not guilty plea, Defendant filed a \u201cMotion to Suppress Evidence of Driving Under Influence of Intoxicating Liquor.\u201d The motion sought to suppress \u201cas evidence any and all statements, test results, declarations, documents or observations of defendant made <em>as a result of an illegal search or seizure </em>in violation of defendant\u2019s rights under the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section Four and Section Eight of the Hawaii State Constitution[.]\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">At the commencement of the hearing on the motion, the State made an oral motion in limine \u201cto have the court make a determination in respect to the qualification of Mr. Milton Chang,\u201d an operator/supervisor of breath testing instruments with the Honolulu Police Department. The State made an offer of proof \u201cas to Mr. Chang\u2019s qualifications.\u201d No witness testified at the hearing. In its \u201cOrder Granting in Part Motion to Suppress Evidence\u201d (Order),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the district court concluded that since Mr. Chang had not been properly \u201crecertified\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 11-111-8 of Chapter 111 of Title 11 of the Hawaii Administrative Rules, he \u201ccannot testify on the subject of the operation, care or maintenance of the intoxilyzer machine\u201d and ordered the suppression of \u201cthe State\u2019s evidence as to Intoxilyzer Test results[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">We start with the precept that \u201cthe prosecutor has no right to appellate review in criminal cases absent clear statutory authority.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>5 Haw. App. 357, 358, 692 P.2d 1171, 1172 (1984). <em>See also State </em>v. <em>Bikle, </em>60 Haw. 576, 592 P.2d 832 (1979); <em>State v. Johnson, </em>50 Haw. 525, 445 P.2d 36 (1968). HRS \u00a7 641-13 (1976 &amp; 1984 Supp.) specifies the instances wherein the State may appeal in criminal cases. The State asserts the instant appeal is proper under HRS \u00a7 641-13(7) which authorizes an appeal \u201c[f]rom a pre-trial order granting a motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>for the suppression of evidence[.]\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In our view, however, the Order appealed from is really an order denying the State\u2019s oral motion in limine rather than an order granting Defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The State relies on the literal wording of the Order which states that \u201cDefendant\u2019s Motion to Suppress Evidence is granted in part,\u201d and contends its appeal falls within the scope of HRS \u00a7 641-13(7). We construe the State\u2019s justification of the Order to be that (1) its motion in limine directed to Mr. Chang\u2019s qualifications to testify regarding the intoxilyzer was necessitated by Defendant\u2019s motion which was partially to suppress the intoxilyzer test results and (2) therefore the motion in limine was part and parcel of Defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. The record, however, does not support the State\u2019s contention and purported justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Defendant\u2019s motion unequivocally alleged that the evidence sought to be suppressed, including the \u201ctest results,\u201d were obtained \u201cas a result of an illegal search or seizure in violation of defendant\u2019s [constitutional] rights[.]\u201d Defendant did not deviate from this stance at the hearing on the motion when his counsel stated to the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">The Motion to Suppress I filed is based upon the fact that there were [sic] improper, was not enough evidence to show a stop of Defendant\u2019s vehicle in this matter. And two, that there was not enough evidence to ask the Defendant to step out of the vehicle in order to further examine the Defendant before giving him the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>breathilyzer [sic] examination.</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"A-L\"><em>Ellen P. Godsey, </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, for plaintiff-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Aa9\">\n<em>Winston Mirikitani (Law Offices of Winston Mirikitani, of counsel) for defendant-appellee.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Transcript at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Consequently, the issue at the hearing was the suppression of evidence on constitutional grounds. The question was not Mr. Chang\u2019s competency to testify regarding the intoxilyzer test results injected into the hearing by the State\u2019s motion in limine. The district court should have summarily ruled the State\u2019s motion to be out of order and proceeded to hear the merits of Defendant\u2019s motion. Rather, the court proceeded to hear the State\u2019s motion. Therefore, in essence, the Order was one denying the State\u2019s motion in limine rather than a granting in part of Defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">Moreover, the State\u2019s motion was improper. A motion in limine is defined as \u201ca procedural device which requests a pretrial order enjoining opposing counsel from using certain prejudicial evidence in front of a jury at a later trial.\u201d Rothblatt &amp; Leroy, <em>The Motion in Limine in Criminal Trials: A Technique for the Pretrial Exclusion of Prejudicial Evidence, </em>60 Ky. L. J., 611, 613 (1972). <em>See also </em>Gamble, <em>The Motion in Limine: A Pretrial Procedure That Has Come of Age, </em>33 Ala. L. Rev. 1 (1981); Annot., 63 A.L.R.3d 311 (1975). Here, the State\u2019s motion sought the district court\u2019s declaration that Mr. Chang was competent to testify rather than precluding the admission of prejudicial evidence by Defendant. Also, since the case was to be tried without a jury,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> an in limine motion was unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">We hold that the State\u2019s appeal was not from a HRS \u00a7 641-13(7) pre-trial order granting a motion for the suppression of evidence and we lack appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b522-8\">Article I, section 7, rather than sections 4 and 8, of the Hawaii State Constitution deals with searches and seizures.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b522-9\">The State prepared the \u201cOrder Granting in Part Motion to Suppress Evidence.\" Defendant\u2019s counsel approved the order as to form with the following reservation: Defendant reserves all objections of record and objects to the form and substances of this ORDER including (1) caption Motion to Suppress Evidence (2) Findings of Fact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b522-10\">In <em>State v.
