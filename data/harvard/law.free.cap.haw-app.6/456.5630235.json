(HIG) contends that the lower court erred in awarding summary judgment to Plaintiffs Florence H. Doi (Florence) and her husband Donald I. Doi (Donald) (when appropriate hereinafter Florence and Donald will be referred to as Plaintiffs), and denying its motion for summary judgment. We vacate the judgment and remand with instructions to enter judgment for HIG.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-14\">On July 10, 1980, Florence was driving one of four automobiles owned by Plaintiffs and insured by HIG under one automobile insurance policy providing uninsured motorist coverage in the amount of $25,000 per automobile. Florence was seriously injured in a collision with another automobile driven by Aquamarine Pahio (Pahio). Pahio\u2019s automobile was covered by an insurance policy providing maximum liability coverage of $25,000 for all damages that she was legally obli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>gated to pay for bodily injury sustained by any one person. Pahio\u2019s policy met the requirements of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 294-10(a)(1) (1976) (amended 1980).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, Pahio\u2019s policy also complied with HRS \u00a7 287-7 (1985),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On October 18, 1982, Florence sued Pahio for damages arising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>from injuries she suffered in the collision (Civil No. 73868). Donald joined the suit, claiming loss of consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Thereafter, claiming that the damages flowing from Florence\u2019s injuries would exceed Pahio\u2019s $25,000 policy limit, and, consequently, Donald\u2019s loss of consortium claim would be uncompensated, Plaintiffs demanded that HIG indemnify them for their damages in excess of $25,000, under the uninsured motorist provision of their policy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> They asserted that their policy covered them to the extent of $25,000 for each of their automobiles and they were entitled to $100,000 less Pahio\u2019s liability coverage, under <em>Yamamoto </em>v. <em>Premier Insurance Co., </em>4 Haw. App. 429, 668 P.2d 42 (1983). The record does not indicate any response from HIG.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">After a bench trial in Civil No. 73868, Florence and Donald were awarded damages as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">\n<em>FLORENCE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ATHg\">medical/rehabilitative costs $ 24,610.58</p>\n<p id=\"AHP\">lost wages 22,203.28</p>\n<p id=\"A42\">general damages 65,000.00</p>\n<p id=\"AAD\">total $111,813.86</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>\n<em>DONALD</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">loss of consortium $ 15,000.00</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Plaintiffs renewed their demand on HIG for uninsured motorist coverage. The demand was rejected and on February 27,1985, Plaintiffs filed the instant action for a declaratory judgment establishing the rights, duties, and liabilities of the parties under the insurance contract, and for compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">Both parties filed motions for summary judgment on the issue of coverage. Plaintiffs argued that under <em>Yamamoto </em>they were entitled to separate uninsured motorist coverage for each of their covered automobiles less than $25,000 recovered from Pahio. HIG disputed coverage on the basis that (1) Pahio was not uninsured, and (2) <em>Yamamoto </em>was contrary to our statutes regarding automobile insurance coverage for bodily injury and uninsured motorists, and contrary to <em>Palisbo </em>v. <em>Hawaiian Insurance &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>57 Haw. 10, 547 P.2d 1350 (1976). The trial court denied HIG\u2019s motion and granted Plaintiffs\u2019 motion, holding Plaintiffs were entitled to uninsured motorist coverage pursuant to <em>Yamamoto. </em>HIG\u2019s motion for reconsideration was denied, and a Rule 54(b), Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (1981), certification was entered on December 3, 1985. HIG appeals, contending that it should have been awarded summary judgment rather than Plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">The facts are undisputed and the only question is which party was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Cos., </em>68 Haw. __, 708 P.2d 129 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">Plaintiffs policy required HIG to pay all sums which they were legally entitled to recover as damages from the owner or operator of an \u201cuninsured highway vehicle.\u201d The coverage was offered by HIG and acquired by Plaintiffs pursuant to HRS \u00a7 431-448 (1976). (See footnote 4.) The statute does not define \u201cuninsured motorist;\u201d however, Plaintiffs\u2019 policy defines an \u201cuninsured highway vehicle\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-12\">(a) a highway vehicle with respect to the ownership, maintenance or use of which there is, in at least the amounts specified by the financial responsibility law of the state in which the insured highway vehicle is principally garaged, no bodily injury liability bond or insurance policy applicable at the time of the accident with respect to any person or organization legally responsible for the use of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>vehicle, or with respect to which there is a bodily injury liability bond or insurance policy applicable at the time of the accident but the company writing the same denies coverage thereunder or is or becomes insolvent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">but the term \u201cuninsured highway vehicle\u201d shall not include: (i) an insured highway vehicle[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">H1G argues that since Pahio\u2019s liability coverage satisfied the requirements of HRS \u00a7 294-10(a) and, therefore, the requirements of the financial responsibility law, hers was not an uninsured highway vehicle and Pahio wus not an uninsured motorist under Plaintiffs\u2019 policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">Plaintiffs do not argue that Pahio\u2019s liability coverage does not meet the statutory requirements. However, citing <em>Yamamoto </em>v. <em>Premier Insurance Co., supra, </em>they argue that Pahio was \u201cuninsured\u201d because Donald\u2019s independent loss of consortium judgment has not been satisfied, and cannot be satisfied, because Florence\u2019s judgment exceeded the limits of Pahio\u2019s liability insurance coverage. In essence, Plaintiffs argue that Pahio was \u201cunderinsured\u201d pursuant to <em>Yamamoto. </em>HIG argues that <em>Yamamoto </em>was erroneously decided. The dispute requires us to re-examine <em>Yamamoto.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">In <em>Yamamoto, </em>Mrs. Yamamoto joined in her husband\u2019s suit for damages for personal injuries arising out of an automobile accident and sought compensation for her loss of consortium. The action was against the tortfeasor and Premier Insurance Co., the Yamamotos\u2019 insurer, whom the Yamamotos alleged wrongfully denied them uninsured motorist coverage benefits. We held that under <em>Palisbo </em>v. <em>Hawaiian Insurance and Guaranty Co., supra,</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>there was a \u201cdiscernible theory\u201d by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>which Mrs. Yamamoto could recover under her uninsured motorist coverage and that summary judgment in favor of Premier was improvidently granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">We held in <em>Yamamoto </em>that Mrs. Yamamoto\u2019s loss of consortium claim, although derived from Mr. Yamamoto\u2019s personal injuries, \u201cis a claim for damages independent and separate from the spouse\u2019s claim for damages.\u201d <em>Id. 4 </em>Haw. App. at 435, 668 P.2d at 48. Based on <em>Palisbo, </em>we reasoned that, since both Mr. and Mrs. Yamamoto had independent claims against the tortfeasor, if their combined entitlement exceeded the minimum coverage required to be maintained by the tortfeasor under the financial responsibility law, then the tortfeasor was uninsured as to both Mr. and Mrs. Yamamoto and they were entitled to recover against their insurer under their uninsured motorist coverage. <em>Yamamoto, 4 </em>Haw. App. at 435, 668 P.2d at 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">HIG contends that <em>Yamamoto </em>was erroneously decided, because we did not consider the effect of HRS chapter 294 on derivative claims such as loss of consortium. We note that the arguments made by HIG here were not made by Premier in <em>Yamamoto </em>and the statute\u2019s effect on derivative claims or on <em>Palisbo </em>was not considered by us.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">HIG argues that (1) Pahio\u2019s policy met the minimum requirements of HRS \u00a7 294-10(a)(1) and provided coverage for \u201call damages\u201d arising out of the \u201caccidental harm\u201d suffered by Florence; and (2) since Donald did not suffer accidental harm, he had no claim for damages except one, such as consortium, derived from Florence\u2019s accidental harm. HIG concludes, therefore, that the words \u201call damages\u201d in HRS \u00a7 294-10(a)(1) must be held to include damages suffered by both the injured spouse and the deprived spouse. Since Pahio\u2019s policy provided the requisite statutory coverage, HIG asserts that she cannot be considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>uninsured, even though Donald cannot recover his damages for loss of. consortium. HIG\u2019s argument requires us to examine the status of a loss of consortium claim under chapter 294.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">HRS \u00a7 294-6(a) sets forth the limitation on tort liability, which is the bedrock of chapter 294. At the time of the collision in the instant case, \u00a7 294-6(a) provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-7\">Abolition of tort liability, (a) Tort liability of the owner, operator, or user of an insured motor vehicle, or the operator or user of an uninsured motor vehicle who operates or uses such vehicle without reason to believe it to be an uninsured motor vehicle, with respect to accidental harm arising from motor vehicle accidents occurring in this State, is abolished, except as to the following persons or their personal representatives, or legal guardians, and in the following circumstances:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-8\">(1) Death occurs to such person in such a motor vehicle accident; or injury occurs to such person which consists, in whole or in part, in a significant permanent loss of use of a part or function of the body; or injury occurs to such person which consists of a permanent and serious disfigurement which results in subjection of the injured person to mental or emotional suffering;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-9\">(2) Injury occurs to such person in a motor vehicle accident in which the amount paid or accrued exceeds the medical-rehabilitative limit established in section 294-10(b) for expenses provided in section 294-2(10)(A) and (B);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-10\">(3) Injury occurs to such person in such an accident and as a result of such injury the aggregate limit of no-fault benefits outlined in section 294-2(10) payable to such person are exhausted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">Act 166, \u00a7 4, 1977 Haw. Sess. Laws 333, 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">HRS \u00a7 294-6(a) does not specifically abolish a loss of consortium claim. It clearly abolishes tort liability \u201cwith respect to accidental harm arising from motor vehicle accidents\u201d except in the instances set forth there. The plain language of the statute would seem to abolish derivative claims where the person suffering \u201caccidental harm\u201d does not meet the threshold requirements, since they can only arise from the accidental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>harm suffered by the injured person. The effect of \u00a7 294-6 on derivative claims is unclear and the question has not been addressed by our appellate courts. However, it has been addressed by courts of other jurisdictions, and we look to those cases for guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Starting with the proposition that no-fault automobile insurance statutes are in derogation of common-law principles of tort liability, other jurisdictions have narrowly construed such statutes and held that they should not be held to have abolished the common law claim for loss of consortium. However, those cases hold that the no-fault laws require that, loss of consortium claims, since they remain derivative, can only be asserted in accordance with the procedures governing the \u201csource action,\u201d i.e., the action of the injured spouse. Thus, in <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>81 Misc. 2d 414, 365 N.Y.S.2d 756 (1975), the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-8\">Such derivative causes of action as those in negligence arising from the husband-wife and parent-child relationships are firmly grounded in law and there appears no basis whatsoever for any conclusion that by the enactment of article 18 they have been abrogated by implication. Indeed, the only basis for such an implication would have to be the fact that the new act contains no explicit reference to derivative causes of action; but these are so deeply rooted in the law that the more reasonable implication to be drawn from the omission is that they are left untouched, <em>except </em>as the new act may alter the substantive and procedural aspects of the main or source cause of action from which the husband\u2019s or parent\u2019s action is derived and upon which the viability of the husband\u2019s or parent\u2019s cause of action is completely dependent. Thus, as the existence and survival of the derivative action must be determined by reference to the source action, so the procedural status of the derivative action must be tested by that of the source action, if the dictates of orderly procedure are to be followed and the duplicative steps and effort and at least minor confusion involved in pursuing common-law damages in the source action and first-party benefits in respect of the derivative claim are to be avoided.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-9\"><em>Id. </em>81 Misc. 2d at 415-16, 365 N.Y.S.2d at 758 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">In <em>Cotton </em>v. <em>Minter, </em>469 F. Supp. 199 (E.D. Mich. 1979), the court noted that Michigan\u2019s no-fault law was developed to alleviate problems <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>in the automobile tort system consisting of \u201clong payment delays, an inequitable payment structure, high legal costs and an overburdened court system.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 200-01. In considering whether the Michigan statute abolished consortium claims, the court construed the statute with regard to its purpose and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\">The purpose of no-fault will be as well served by declining to abolish consortium as by abolishing it. No-fault\u2019s purpose was to litigate only cases where there are serious elements of noneconomic loss and bar those where such losses are small. Abolishing consortium would exclude no cases, and allowing it would not open the door to additional cases. In each case the test whether suit may be brought is: Has there been \u201cinjury\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 500.3135(1)?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">The following cases have also held that the right to assert the loss of consor un claim remains derivative and may only be asserted where the injured spouse has met the threshold requirement of the statute: <em>Faulkner </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>367 So.2d 214 (Fla. 1979); <em>McDaniel </em>v. <em>Prysi, </em>432 So.2d 174 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1983); <em>Rusinek </em>v. <em>Schultz, Snyder &amp; Stelle Lumber Co., </em>411 Mich. 502, 309 N.W.2d 163 (1981); <em>Zagari v. Gralka, </em>264 Pa. Super. 239, 399 A.2d 755 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">Our supreme court, too, has held that statutes in derogation of the common law must be strictly construed and, where it does not appear that there was a legislative purpose in the statute to supersede the common law, the common law applies. <em>Burns International Security Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Transportation, </em>66 Haw. 607, 671 P.2d 446 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">In enacting HRS chapter 294, the legislative purpose was to reform the existing system of reparations for damages arising from motor vehicle accidents in order</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-11\">to provide motor vehicle accident victims assured, adequate and prompt reparation for certain economic losses without regard to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>fault. The clear objectives of the law are to: (1) institute insurance reform in order to (a) expedite the settling of all claims, (b) create a system of reparations for injuries and loss arising from motor vehicle accidents, (c) compensate these damages without regard to fault, and (d) modify tort liability for these accidents; and (2) to reduce the cost of motor vehicle insurance by establishing a uniform system of motor vehicle insurance.

Cos., </em>68 Haw. at __, 708 P.2d at 134 (1985), and to partially abolish tort liability for such accidents, <em>Barcena </em>v. <em>Hawaiian Insurance and Guaranty Co., Ltd., </em>67 Haw. 97, 102, 678 P.2d 1082, 1086 (1984). In <em>Weigand </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>68 Haw. __, at __, 706 P.2d 16, at 19 (1985), the supreme court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-12\">The no-fault law has been analogized to the workers\u2019 compensation law. <em>Joshua </em>v. <em>MTL, </em>65 Hawaii 623, 631, 656 P.2d 736, 741 (1982). As with the workers\u2019 compensation law, the no-fault law represents a socially enforced bargain where both parties give up some rights in exchange for other benefits. <em>See Hun </em>v. <em>Center Properties, </em>63 Hawaii 273, 276, 626 P.2d 182, 185 (1981). <em>The injured party relinquishes the right to sue for large amounts of general damages[.] </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-13\">We perceive no clear legislative intent or purpose in chapter 294 to supersede the common law and abolish derivative claims such as loss of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>consortium arising from bodily injuries suffered by one\u2019s spouse in an automobile accident. Therefore, derivative claims resulting from injuries arising from automobile accidents are not abolished by HRS \u00a7 294-6. However, the assertion of such claims must meet the threshold requirements of \u00a7 294-6. It follows that such derivative claims are not independent to the extent that they may be asserted without regard to the nature or extent of the injuries to the person suffering accidental harm. Our decision in <em>Yamamoto </em>caused confusion by emphasizing the independent nature of the loss of consortium claim. We reconsider <em>Yamamoto </em>now in the light of the above discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">In <em>Yamamoto </em>we held that a loss of consortium claim is an independent claim. Although the modern trend of tort law is to consider loss of consortium as an injury to the deprived spouse giving rise to a separate and independent action for damages, <em>see generally, </em>Prosser, <em>Torts </em>\u00a7 125 (5th ed. 1984); <em>see also </em>Annot., 36 A.L.R. 3d 900 (1971); <em>Lantis </em>v. <em>Condon, </em>95 Cal. App. 3d 152, 157 Cal. Rptr. 22 (1979); <em>Christie </em>v. <em>Maxwell, </em>40 Wash. App. 40, 696 P.2d 1256 (1985), nevertheless, it remains a derivative claim dependent for its viability upon the personal injury to one\u2019s spouse. Certainly in assessing damages for loss of consortium the deprived spouse\u2019s claim is considered separately, although necessarily with reference to the injured spouse\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">We did not hold in <em>Yamamoto </em>that Mrs. Yamamoto\u2019s consortium claim was independent in the sense that she could bring suit for damages even if Mr. Yamamoto could not. We did hold, however, that her claim was independent for purposes of determining whether her recovery would affect the status of the tortfeasor as an uninsured motorist. However, as stated earlier, the interrelation among HRS \u00a7\u00a7 431-448, 287-7, 294-6(a), -10 and the common law right to sue for loss of consortium did not enter into our decision in <em>Yamamoto. </em>On the basis of that interrelation, we now overrule <em>Yamamoto.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">Under \u00a7 287-7, an automobile insurance liability policy must provide coverage for \u201call damages arising out of accidental harm sustained by any one person as a result of any one accident,\u201d as required by \u00a7 294-10(a)(1). Since a loss of consortium claim is derivative only, such damages as may have been sustained by the deprived spouse necessarily arise out of the injury to the injured spouse.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ASL\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number><em>John T Komeiji (Bert T. Kobayashi </em>and <em>Randall Y. Yamamoto </em>with him on the briefs; <em>Kobayashi, Watanabe, Sugita &amp; Kawashima </em>of counsel) for defendant-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Ahk\"><em>Walter K. Horie </em>for plaintiffs-appellees.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Consequently, we construe the phrase \u201call damages\u201d in \u00a7 294-10(a)(1) to include loss of consortium damages, and hold that where a tortfeasor\u2019s automobile liability insurance policy meets the requirements of \u00a7 294-10(a)(l), the tortfeasor is not an uninsured motorist, notwithstanding the fact that the spouse of a person injured in an automobile accident is unable to recover his or her loss of consortium damages from the tortfeasor\u2019s policy because the injured spouse\u2019s damages exceed the limits of the tortfeasor\u2019s policy. In such circumstances, the injured parties\u2019 automobile insurer is not liable to compensate them under their uninsured motorist coverage.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> To hold that loss of consortium damages do not arise from the injured person\u2019s accidental harm would result either in abolishing such claims or creating a cause of action independent of the threshold requirements.
