Plaintiffs Francis Kau and Douglas Wada (collectively Plaintiffs) seek reversal of the judgment on procedural grounds and on the merits. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-21\">The following facts are not in dispute. The City, a municipal corporation, maintains and operates the Ala Wai Golf Course which is open <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>to the public. Around 2:30 a.m. on May 27,1980, Plaintiffs and Stephen Kanda (Kanda) were at the golf course waiting to obtain an early tee-off time. While they were in the club house lanai area, they witnessed Harry Kapu, Wayne Kama, and Warren Kama burglarize the starter\u2019s office and flee. Warren Kama returned and forced Plaintiffs and Kanda to walk to the ninth hole where they were ordered to lie down on their stomachs. They were then repeatedly stabbed with a pocket knife and robbed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">On April 23, 1981, Plaintiffs sued the City alleging negligence by its failure</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">to provide adequate security measures ... adequate security guards . .. and ... adequate lighting to insure the safety of the public while on the premises of ALA WAI GOLF COURSE, when [the City] knew that its failure to provide such measures would expose the public to danger.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Record, Vol. I at 9-10. The City answered denying liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">A jury trial commenced on September 17, 1984. The following day, after all parties had presented their opening statements, the City moved for a directed verdict.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Construing the oral motion as one for summary judgment, the trial court granted it over Plaintiffs objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">On October 10, 1984, the City filed a written motion for summary judgment. On October 24, 1984, Plaintiffs filed a memorandum in opposition to the motion with 24 annexed exhibits consisting of portions of transcripts of the September 18, 1984 court proceedings and depositions of different witnesses, request for admissions, and answers to interrogatories. A hearing on the motion was held on October 31, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>1984.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On December 3, 1984, orders granting the motion and the judgments were filed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Citing <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commission, </em>50 Haw. 169, 434 P.2d 312 (1967), Plaintiffs contend that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to dispose of the case by summary judgment since the 10-day notice requirement of Rule 56(c), Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) (1981),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> had not been met. We hold that, even if the granting of the oral motion may have been improper, the granting of the written motion met the requirements of Rule 56(c), HRCP.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">In <em>Clarke </em>the court had granted summary judgment <em>sua sponte </em>without giving opposing counsel an opportunity to be heard. The supreme court held that a trial court may not grant summary judgment \u201cwithout notice and without a hearing on the matter contrary to provisions of Rule 56.\u201d <em>Clarke, </em>50 Haw. at 171, 434 P.2d at 313. However, violation of the notice requirement does not automatically result in a reversal. <em>Clarke's </em>progeny holds that <em>\u201cabsent a showing of harm, </em>the failure of the trial court to comply with the requirement of ten days\u2019 notice of hearing set forth in H.R.C.P. Rule 56(c) is not reversible error.\u201d <em>Jensen </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>53 Haw. 201, 202, 491 P.2d 547, 548 (1971) (emphasis added). <em>See also Shelton Engineering Contractors, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Hawaiian Pacific Industries, Inc., </em>51 Haw. 242, 456 P.2d 222 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">The record indicates that Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate prejudice or harm as a result of the court\u2019s action. Granted, the City\u2019s September 18, 1984 oral motion failed to give Plaintiffs the required Rule 56(c) 10-day notice of hearing. However, the City\u2019s October 10, 1984 written motion gave Plaintiffs proper notice. Plaintiffs did file a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>memorandum and other papers in opposition to the motion and had an opportunity to be heard. Thus, Plaintiffs were not prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Accordingly, we hold that the summary judgment is not reversible on procedural grounds.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">11.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">In granting the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the trial court reasoned that, viewing the evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, as a matter of law (1) the City could not have reasonably foreseen the criminal acts of assault and robbery on the golf course by third parties and (2) the criminal conduct of the third parties was the superseding legal cause of Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. Plaintiffs argue, however, that the issue of reasonable foreseeability was one of fact determinable by the jury and, consequently, summary judgment was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">The recent case of <em>Wolsk </em>v. <em>State, </em>68 Haw. __, 711 P.2d 1300 (1986), compels our affirmance. As an inferior tribunal, this court is obligated \u201cto adhere to the decision\u201d of the \u201ccourt of the last resort[.]\u201d <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Ariyoshi, </em>65 Haw. 641, 653, 658 P.2d 287, 297 (1982) (quoting <em>Kapiolani Estate </em>v. <em>Atcherley, </em>21 Haw. 441, 454 (1913)).</p>\n<p id=\"AMz\">In <em>Wolsk, </em>unknown assailants brutally attacked two campers in a state park, resulting in the death of a camper and severe injury to the other. In affirming the trial court\u2019s summary judgment for the State, the supreme court held that the \u201cState owed no duty to warn or protect [the two campers] from the criminal conduct of unidentified third persons at [a State] Park[,]\u201d <em>Wolsk, </em>slip op. at 7, on the basis that \u201cno special relationship duty existed requiring the State to warn or protect [the two campers].\u201d <em>Id. </em>slip op. at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">The supreme court stated the general rule that the \u201cState owes a duty to exercise reasonable care and warn park users about dangerous condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>tions which are not known or reasonably discoverable by persons of ordinary intelligence[,]\u201d <em>Id. </em>slip op. at 3, but that the \u201cState is not liable for dangerous conditions not under its control.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court also quoted Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 314(A) and 315 (1965)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and declared that \u201c[i]n the absence of a special relationship, State is not liable to plaintiffs harmed by the criminal conduct of unknown third persons on State property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>slip op. at 4. Despite Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 314(A)(3) which specifies the relationship between \u201c[a] possessor of land who holds it open to the public\u201d and \u201cmembers of the public who enter in response to his invitation\u201d as a special one, the court found \u201cno special relationship duty\u201d under the facts in Wolsk.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>The basis of the court\u2019s reluctance to find a special relationship duty under the facts in <em>Wolsk </em>was that \u201cthe third persons who harmed [the two campers]... were never alleged to be under [the] State\u2019s control[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>slip op. at 6.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AxH\"><em>Sharon On Leng (Melvin Y. Agena </em>with her on the briefs; <em>Turk &amp; Agena, Attorneys at Law, A Law Corporation, </em>of counsel) for plaintiffs-appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AsE\"><em>James R. Aiona, Jr. </em>Deputy Corporation Counsel, City and County of Honolulu, for defendant-appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Likewise, in the case at bar, the City, a municipality, is not liable for dangerous conditions not under its control, <em>Seibel </em>v. <em>City and County, </em>61 Haw. 253, 602 P.2d 532 (1979), and Plaintiffs never alleged that the three perpetrators of the criminal acts on the City\u2019s golf course were under the control of the City. Consequently, as in <em>Wolsk, </em>the City had no special relationship duty to protect Plaintiffs from the criminal acts of third persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b391-10\">Harry Kapu, Wayne Kama, and Warren Kama were apprehended and admitted the burglary, stabbing, and robbery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b391-11\">The City\u2019s motion followed a chamber conference with the presiding judge, Honorable Richard Y.C. Au, and counsel for both parties present. Plaintiffs allege that during this conference \u201cJudge Au indicated that he would entertain a Motion for Summary Judgment from [the City] which would dismiss all of [Plaintiffs\u2019] claims.\u201d Opening Brief at 30. Judge Au \u201cdispute[d], unalterably\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of what occurred at the conference. Transcript of Oct. 31,1984 Proceedings at 7. The City\u2019s counsel\u2019s recollection was that the \u201cCourt did not tell us to file a motion. The Court inquired if we were prepared to make a motion, which we said that we were prepared and had been prepared to make all along[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23. No court reporter was present to record the statements made at the conference.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b392-10\">On October 31, 1984, the court also held hearings on Plaintiffs\u2019\u201cMotion for Disqualification of Judge\u201d filed on October 17, 1984, and \u201cMotion Compelling Settlement of Order and Judgment\u201d on the oral motion for summary judgment, filed on October 22, 1984. The court denied the former motion and granted the latter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b392-11\">The trial court filed two separate orders and judgments \u2014 one for the September 18, 1984 oral motion for summary judgment and the other for the October 10, 1984 written motion for summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b392-12\">Rule 56(c), Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) (1981), provides in part: \u201cThe motion shall be served at least 10 days before the time fixed for the hearing.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b393-12\">After the filing of the written motion for summary judgment. Plaintiffs moved to disqualify Judge Au from the case. Plaintiffs assert on appeal that the court\u2019s granting of the written motion was error since the motion to disqualify should have been granted. We disagree. The affidavits accompanying the motion to disqualify were legally insufficient. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Iaea, </em>55 Haw. 80, 515 P.2d 1250 (1973). Also, we cannot determine the truth or falsity of the allegations in the affidavits as to what Judge Au said at the chamber conference since no court reporter was present. <em>See </em>note 2 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b393-13\">Plaintiffs\u2019 assertions of other procedural errors are without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 314A and 315 (1965) read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-7\">\u00a7 314A.

In <em>Hulsman, Namauu, Freitas, </em>and <em>Seibei, </em>the victims of the criminal acts of third persons were not injured or killed on land possessed by the State or the City and County and held open to the public. In <em>Ajirogi, </em>the criminal act (operating a stolen car at an excessive speed on the wrong side of a roadway, while fleeing from the scene of a burglary, and crashing into a car occupied by the victims) occurred on presumably a public roadway, but the issues there involved the duty of the State under Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 319 (1965) while in charge of a person having dangerous propensities and foreseeability, rather than special relationship duty.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<p id=\"b395-9\">CONCURRING OPINION BY</p>\n<author id=\"A8X\">BURNS, C.J.</author>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">I agree with Part I of the majority opinion. Regarding Part II, I concur. However, I would have reached that result even if <em>Wolsk </em>v. <em>State, </em>68 Haw. __, 711 P.2d 1300 (1986), did not require affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">\u201cIn general, anyone who does an affirmative act is under a duty to others to exercise the care of a reasonable man to protect them against an <em>unreasonable risk </em>of harm to them arising out of the act. The duties of one who merely omits to act are more restricted, and in general are confined to situations where there is a special relation between the actor and the other which gives rise to the duty.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 302 comment a (1965) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">The relation between a possessor of land who holds it open to the public and members of the public who enter in response to his invitation is a special relation. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 314A(3) (1965). In Hawaii, the relation between a possessor of land and all persons reasonably anticipated to be on the premises is a special relation. <em>See Pickard </em>v. <em>City &amp; County, </em>51 Haw. 134, 452 P.2d 445 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-13\">In my view, the question of the existence of a duty involves four elements:</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>1. Is defendant a possessor of the premises upon which plaintiff was injured?</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">2. Is plaintiff a person reasonably anticipated to be on the premises?</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">3. Did defendant foresee or anticipate or should defendant have foreseen or anticipated in ample time to avert injury that there was an <em>unreasonable risk </em>of that kind of physical harm to the victim?<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">4. Is it in the public interest to impose a duty?</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">The possessor\u2019s duty is to protect persons reasonably anticipated to be on the premises against the <em>unreasonable risk </em>of physical harm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In other words, the possessor has no duty to protect such persons where he neither knows nor should know in ample time to avert the harm of an <em>unreasonable risk </em>of physical harm to them. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 314A comments e and f (1965). Moreover, when deciding whether there was a duty, the situation must be viewed as it existed before the physical harm occurred, not with 20-20 hindsight. <em>Schlegel </em>v. <em>Knoll, </em>427 S.W.2d 480 (Mo. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">Thus, a reasonable explanation for the result in <em>Wolsk, supra, </em>is that as a matter of law the State did not owe a duty to the campers because it neither knew nor should have known in ample time to avert the harm of an <em>unreasonable risk </em>that the campers would be brutally attacked by unknown assailants. Likewise, in this case, the City did not owe a duty to the golfers because it neither knew nor should have known in ample time to avert the harm of an <em>unreasonable risk </em>that the golfers would be brutally attacked by Kapu and robbed by the Kamas.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">As noted in <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Branch, </em>45 Haw. 128, 136, 363 P.2d 969, 975 (1961), \u201c\u2018[tjhere is normally no reason to anticipate wilful wrongdoing of others. ... In exceptional situations even wilfully wrongful acts of others are normal and expectable.\u2019 Bohlen, <em>Studies in the Law of Torts, </em>(1926), pp. 504, 505.\u201d In my view, neither <em>Wolsk, supra, </em>nor this case involved exceptional situations.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b396-12\">In my view, questions with respect to foreseeability are more appropriately allocable to the issue of whether the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty rather than to the issue of causation. <em>See </em>Annot., 100 A.L.R.2d 942 (1965). The Hawaii Supreme Court has not taken a consistent position on this issue. <em>Compare Hulsman </em>v. <em>Hemmeter Development Corp., </em>65 Haw. 58, 647 P.2d 713 (1982), with <em>McKenna </em>v. <em>Volkswagenwerk, </em>57 Haw. 460, 558 P.2d 1018 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b396-13\"><em>See </em>57 Am.
