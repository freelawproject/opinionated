(UIIA) from a summary judgment in favor of defendant Bank of Honolulu (Bank). The crucial legal question in the case is whether the sellers or the purchaser of all of the shares of stock of UIIA\u2019s parent corporation. Federated Insurance Agency, Inc. (Federated), which had been pledged by the sellers to Bank, had the right to vote those shares. We hold that because the record discloses a genuine issue of material fact determinative of the legal question, the lower court erred in granting the summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b243-13\">A. <em>Pre-Complaint Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b243-14\">The following facts are not in dispute. In 1974, Paul I. Brown (Brown) and other investors incorporated Federated, a general insurance agency. On February 11, 1977, as Federated\u2019s president, Brown entered into an agreement to acquire UIIA, another general insurance agency. Subsequently, Federated\u2019s board of directors ratified the agreement and authorized Brown to negotiate a loan from Bank to finance the acquisition. Brown successfully negotiated a 90% United States Small Business Administration (SBA) guaranteed loan of $330,000 with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">On March 14, 1977, Bank, Federated, and Federated shareholders Brown, Richard H. Arimizu (Arimizu), Charles E. McGee (McGee), and Arthur E. Harris (Harris) executed various documents regarding the $330,000 loan.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The documents included collateral pledge agreements whereby Federated, as borrower, pledged 100% of the acquired shares of UIIA stock and the Federated shareholders, as guarantors, pledged their respective shares of Federated stock, constituting 100% thereof, to Bank to secure the $330,000 loan. The certificates evidencing the ownership of all 3,180 shares of UIIA stock and all 2,000 shares of Federated stock, indorsed in blank by the respective owners, were delivered to Bank. Each collateral pledge agreement included, <em>inter alia, </em>the following provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-7\">6. VOTING RIGHTS. For the term of this agreement Pledgor shall have the right, where applicable, to vote securities on all corporate questions, but, at Pledgee\u2019s request, Pledgor shall execute due and timely proxies in favor of Pledgee for this purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-9\">13. NO TRANSFER OF PLEDGOR\u2019S INTEREST. Pledgor shall not in any way sell, transfer, diminish, or encumber its interest in said collateral, and any attempt to so sell, transfer, diminish, or encumber shall be invalid and without effect, and shall constitute a default hereunder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">Unbeknownst to Bank, on December 5, 1980, Brown, Arimizu, and Harris (collectively Sellers)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> executed a \u201cStock Purchase Agreement\u201d (Purchase Agreement) with Robert J. Keller (Keller). The Purchase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>Agreement provided for the acquisition by Keller or his nominee, Imperial Holdings, Inc. (Purchaser),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> from Sellers of (1) \u201call of the capital stock, issued and outstanding, of Federated,\u201d which owned 100% of the issued and outstanding stock of UIIA, and (2) the capital stock of three other related corporations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The consideration was $20.00 and the assumption by Purchaser of a $25,000 debt of Sellers to UIIA. The Purchase Agreement expressly subordinated the sale to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-5\">[t]he rights of the Bank of Honolulu with respect to the stock of Federated and UIIA which is pledged to said bank under a Small Business Administration loan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">On February 25, 1981, the closing of the sale occurred. At that time, each Seller signed a blank stock power form. Subsequently, on a date undisclosed in the record, Purchaser installed its set of directors and officers for Federated and UIIA thereby replacing the Sellers\u2019 set.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">In December 1981, Bank learned of the sale of the Federated stock to Purchaser and that Brown was no longer a director and officer of Federated and UIIA. On December 18, 1981, Bank gave written notice to Keller and Federated that (1) Federated was in default of the loan because of a number of reasons including the sale of the Federated stock which violated the collateral pledge agreements, (2) the entire balance of the loan was being accelerated, and (3) $228,000 of UIIA\u2019s checking account at Bank was being frozen until the matter was resolved.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">On December 30, 1981, in response to Bank\u2019s suggestion, Sellers and McGee met in Bank\u2019s boardroom with Bank\u2019s representatives and attorneys and an SB A representative. In chronological sequence, special meetings of Federated\u2019s stockholders, its directors, UIIA\u2019s stock<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>holders, and its directors were held. The minutes of those meetings indicate the occurrence of the following: (1) Sellers and McGee,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as Federated stockholders, removed the current directors and elected Sellers as the new directors; (2) the new Federated directors removed the current officers and elected Brown and Arimizu as the new officers; (3) UIIA\u2019s current directors were removed and Sellers were elected as the new directors; (4) the new UIIA directors removed the current officers and elected Brown and Arimizu as the new officers and authorized Brown to pay off Federated\u2019s loan to Bank; and (5) at each meeting Bank\u2019s freezing of UIIA\u2019s checking account was \u201cratified, confirmed and approved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">UIIA\u2019s new officers, Brown and Arimizu, then signed three checks made payable to Bank and drawn on the account with Bank. The three checks were made out for (1) $213,709.97 to pay off Federated\u2019s loan to Bank, (2) $5,000 for attorney\u2019s fees, and (3) $25,086.29, the balance of UIIA\u2019s account, for future attorney\u2019s fees and costs associated with Federated\u2019s loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Mop-up actions then commenced. Meetings of Federated and UIIA\u2019s stockholders and directors were held and the new Federated and UIIA directors and officers were removed and the previous directors and officers reinstated. All of the foregoing actions on December 30, 1981, were accomplished in about two and one-half hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">B. <em>Post-Complaint Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">On January 21, 1982, UIIA filed a four-count complaint against Bank alleging (1) wrongful appropriation of UIIA\u2019s checking account, (2) wrongful dishonoring of checks drawn on the account by UIIA, (3) wrongful conversion of UIIA funds, and (4) \u201cknowing, willful, intentional, malicious, and in conscious and/or reckless disregard of the rights of [UIIA].\u201d UIIA sought injunctive relief, general and punitive damages, costs, interest, and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">On April 18, 1983, the circuit court granted Bank\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Thereafter, UIIA timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>On April 29, 1985, Mario R. Ramil,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Receiver of Financial Security Insurance Company, Limited (FSIC) (Receiver), filed an application for leave to intervene on appeal. Receiver alleged that as FSIC\u2019s \u201csister corporation,\u201d UIIA mainly sold FSIC insurance policies, that UIIA collected the premiums due on FSIC insurance policies and held them in bank accounts before remitting them to FSIC, and that the funds in UIIA\u2019s checking account paid over to Bank on December 30, 1981, did not belong to UIIA but were being held in trust for FSIC. Despite Bank\u2019s objection, on May 10, 1985, the supreme court permitted Receiver to intervene and directed the parties to file position briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">In his position brief, Receiver asserts that (1) as between UIIA and Bank, the former should prevail, (2) even if Bank prevails over UIIA, Receiver has the superior claim to the funds over Bank or UIIA, and (3) the case should be remanded to the trial court for further proceedings and factual findings regarding Receiver\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">II. RIGHT TO VOTE FEDERATED STOCK</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Bank effected the repayment of its loan to Federated on December 30, 1981, by having Sellers vote the Federated shares of stock and thereby authorize the use of UIIA\u2019s assets for such purpose.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> UIIA contends that Sellers had no right to vote the Federated stock after they had sold and transferred their entire interest in the stock. Bank argues, however, that because Purchaser never took \u201cdelivery\u201d of the Federated stock, it did not acquire the rights as a Federated stockholder and Sellers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>retained the voting rights which they lawfully exercised on December 30, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">We hold that the evidence in the record is insufficient to determine whether Sellers or Purchaser had the voting rights to the Federated stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">A. <em>Applicable Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">We must initially determine what law is applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">Ostensibly, Article 8 of the Hawaii Uniform Commercial Code, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7\u00a7 490:8-101, <em>et seq., </em>dealing with investment securities, is the applicable law. However, citing <em>Zamore </em>v. <em>Whitten, </em>395 A.2d 435 (Me. 1978), UIIA claims the Federated stock is not a \u201csecurity\u201d within the meaning of HRS \u00a7 490:8-102(1)(a) (1976)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and, consequently, Article 8 is not applicable. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">In <em>Zamore, </em>the court held that capital stock in a close family business was not of a type \u201c \u2018commonly dealt in upon securities exchanges or markets\u2019\u201d nor \u201ccommonly recognized ... as a medium for investment[,]\u201d 395 A.2d at 441, as required by Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) \u00a7 8-102(1)(a)(ii). UIIA argues that Federated is a closely held corporation and likewise doesn\u2019t meet the HRS \u00a7 490:8-102(1)(a)(ii) test.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">We do not choose to follow <em>Zamore. </em>The wording of UCC \u00a7 8-102(1)(a)(ii) remains virtually the same in its 1977 revision. The 1977 Official Comment to UCC \u00a7 8-102 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-12\">Interests such as the stock of closely-held corporations, although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>they are not actually traded upon securities exchanges, are intended to be included within the definitions of both certificated and uncertificated securities by the inclusion of interests \u201cof a type\u201d commonly traded in those markets.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">2A U.L.A. 221 (Supp. 1985). Wewillfollow other jurisdictions that have adopted this construction. <em>See Katz </em>v. <em>Abrams, </em>549 F. Supp. 668 (E.D. Pa. 1982) (construing Pennsylvania statute); <em>Wamser v. Bamberger, </em>101 Wis.2d 637, 305 N.W.2d 158 (1981); <em>Gross </em>v. <em>Vogel, </em>81 A.D.2d 576, 437 N.Y.S.2d 431 (1981) (citing <em>Pantel </em>v. <em>Becker, </em>89 Misc. 2d 239, 391 N.Y.S.2d 325 (1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Accordingly, we hold that the Federated stock is a \u201csecurity\u201d within the meaning of H RS \u00a7 490:8-102( 1 )(a) and the applicable law is Article 8 of the Hawaii UCC, as supplemented by Hawaii\u2019s corporation and other laws dealing with corporate stock and stockholders. <em>See </em>15A Am. Jur. 2d <em>Commercial Code </em>\u00a7 73 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">B. <em>Pledgee vis-a-vis Purchaser</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">A pledge of capital stock is a secured transaction governed by Article 9 of Hawaii UCC, HRS \u00a7\u00a7 490:9-101, <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Thus, as pledgee of the Federated stock, Bank\u2019s rights were governed by the provisions of the collateral pledge agreements and Article 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">Paragraph 13 of the pledge agreements precluded and invalidated any sale of the pledged Federated stock and made such sale a default of the underlying loan. However, the sale of the Federated stock by Sellers to Purchaser could not be a nullity because HRS \u00a7490:9-311 (1976) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-10\">The debtor\u2019s rights in collateral may be voluntarily or involuntarily transferred (by way of sale, creation of a security interest, attachment, levy, garnishment or other judicial process) notwithstanding a provision in the security agreement prohibiting any transfer or making the transfer constitute a default.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>Although HRS \u00a7 490:9-311 permits a debtor to sell and transfer his interest in collateral, it \u201cdoes <em>not </em>serve to avoid a contract provision making an unconsented transfer of the collateral a default.\u201d <em>Brummund </em>v. <em>First National Bank of Clovis, </em>99 N.M. 221, 223, 656 P.2d 884, 886 (1983) (emphasis in original). <em>See also Poydan, Inc. </em>v. <em>Agia Kiriaki, Inc., </em>130 N.J. Super. 141, 325 A.2d 838 (1974), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>139 N.J. Super. 365, 354 A.2d 99 (1976). Thus, Bank rightfully could and did accelerate the entire balance of the underlying loan.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thereafter, Bank had the right to sell the pledged Federated stock in accordance with paragraph 11 of the pledge agreements and HRS \u00a7 490:9-504 (1976 and Supp. 1984). However, it did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">C. <em>Sellers vis-a-vis Purchaser</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">Bank contends (1) Purchaser never took delivery of the Federated stock as required by HRS \u00a7 490:8-301 (1976);<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (2) Purchaser therefore never acquired legal title to the stock; and (3) consequently, Sellers retained the voting rights of the stock. Bank\u2019s reasoning is flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">Hawaii UCC Article 8 \u201cmay be likened ... to a negotiable instru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>ments law dealing with securities.\u201d Comments to HRS \u00a7 490:8-101. \u201cIts basic purpose is to endow instruments within its scope with the attributes of negotiability.\u201d 15A Am. Jur. 2d <em>Commercial Code </em>\u00a7 73 at 522 (1976). Thus, the Article 8 sections dealing with transfer of securities generally involve \u201cthe legal title only and [do] not embrace the broad field of equitable rights and interests and the methods of their transfer.\u201d <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Zimring, </em>284 So.2d 233, 235 (Fla. App. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Consequently, \u201c[a]s between transferor and transferee, it seems to be the rule that transfer of title may take place though there is no delivery of the certificates themselves, nor endorsement of them, nor transfer of them on the books of the corporation, and even though the sale be by parol.\u201d <em>Estate of Bridges v. Mosebrook, </em>662 S.W.2d 116, 120 (Tex. App. 1983) (quoting <em>Greenspun v. Greenspun, </em>194 S.W.2d 134, 137 (Tex. Civ. App.), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>145 Tex. 374, 198 S.W.2d 82 (1946)). As between a transferor and a transferee, an unregistered transfer gives the transferee a \u201cperfect equitable title.\u201d 12 W. Fletcher, <em>Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations </em>\u00a7 5497 at 436 (rev. perm. ed. 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Accordingly, contrary to Bank\u2019s assertion, upon the February 25, 1981 closing of the Agreement, Purchaser acquired Sellers\u2019 interest in the Federated stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">D. <em>Issuer vis-a-vis Purchaser</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Generally, the registered owner of stock as shown on the issuer corporation\u2019s books is entitled to vote the stock. <em>Canario </em>v. <em>Serrao, </em>11 Haw. 277 (1898).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> HRS \u00a7 490:8-207(1) (1976) provides that prior to the registration of a transfer of a security, the issuer \u201cmay treat the registered owner as the person exclusively entitled to vote[.]\u201d Bank argues that because, at best, Purchaser acquired an equitable, but not the legal, interest in the Federated stock, Sellers, rather than Purchaser, had the right to vote the stock.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>However, Comment 3 to HRS \u00a7 490:8-207 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">This section does not operate to determine who is finally entitled to exercise voting and other rights or to receive payments and distributions. The parties are still free to incorporate their own arrangements as to these matters in seller-purchaser agreements which will be definitive as between them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">In <em>In re Wallace A. Erickson &amp; Co., </em>44 B.R. 163, 166 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 1984), the court stated that \u201cvoting rights in stock may be determined by factors other than <em>pro forma </em>record ownership of stock,\u201d and held that the equitable owner had the right to vote the stock. <em>See also McLaney </em>v. <em>Fortune Operating Co., </em>84 Nev. 491, 444 P.2d 505 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">The crucial factual question here is whether Sellers sold and transferred to Purchaser all of their interest in the Federated stock, including the voting rights, or whether Sellers retained those rights pending the liquidation of Bank\u2019s loan. The resolution of this issue will resolve the question whether Sellers or Purchaser had the right to vote the Federated stock on December 30, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">Unfortunately, the Purchase Agreement is silent concerning the voting rights. Therefore, whether the voting rights were transferred or retained by Sellers is dependent upon the intent of the parties to be gleaned from other evidence in the record. <em>Urban Research Studies &amp; Development, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Teruya &amp; Sons, Ltd., </em>3 Haw. App. 5, 639 P.2d 1115 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">Viewing the evidence and the reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to UIIA, <em>Kang </em>v. <em>Charles Pankow Associates, </em>5 Haw. App. 1, 675 P.2d 803 (1984), there exists a genuine issue of material fact as to Sellers\u2019 and Purchaser\u2019s intention. In the pledge agreements, Sellers retained the right to vote the pledged stock subject to the execution of proxies in favor of Bank upon its request. In the Purchase Agreement, Sellers agreed that at the closing Purchasers will acquire \u201cfull title\u201d to the pledged Federated stock. In his deposition, Harris testified to his belief that upon transferring his stock to Pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>chaser, he would no longer be a Federated stockholder.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> From the foregoing, it is not unreasonable to infer that Sellers intended to sell and transfer their entire interest in the Federated stock, including the voting rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">E. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The granting of summary judgment is proper only when, based on the record, there are no genuine issues of material fact and the movant clearly demonstrates he is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. <em>Hulsman </em>v. <em>Hemmeter Development Corp., </em>65 Haw. 58, 647 P.2d 713 (1982); <em>Soukop </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>6 Haw. App. __, 709 P.2d 109 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Here, the merits of the case turn on whether Sellers had the right to vote the Federated stock, for if Sellers had no such right, their actions on December 30,1981, regarding the affairs of Federated and UIIA would have been invalid, null and void. The determination of this question hinges on whether Sellers intended to transfer or retain the voting rights when the pledged Federated shares were sold and transferred to Purchaser. As discussed above, there exists a genuine dispute on this factual issue and, consequently, Bank has not demonstrated that it is entitled to a summary judgment.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A35I\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number><em>James P.
