The plaintiff was originally found to be ineligible for unemployment benefits by a department of employment security certifying officer, and by the department\u2019s appeal tribunal on the grounds that the plaintiff had voluntarily left his employment without good cause attributable to the employer. Following the commissioner\u2019s refusal to reopen the tribunal hearing, plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court <em>(Goode, </em>J.), which upheld the commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>Plaintiff now challenges the court\u2019s findings of fact and rulings of law, and contends especially that the court\u2019s refusal to grant him unemployment benefits results from an incorrect interpretation of the Department of Employment Security\u2019s regulation No. 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">The plaintiff operated a sanding machine at the Fimbel Door Corporation, a manufacturer of garage doors in Nashua. He did not report to work after April 2,1974, because of an illness which required hospitalization from April 22 to May 1. Plaintiff\u2019s supervisors at Fimbel initially decided to hold his job for him, and temporarily filled the position with workers from other parts of the factory.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Business improved in May so that a full-time worker was required in the plaintiff\u2019s position. The supervisors, unable to determine how long plaintiff would be out, decided to terminate his employment and to fill his position with another worker, effective May 13. Plaintiff was probably mailed a termination notice on or about that date. Plaintiff testified that he was unaware that he had been terminated until late in June 1974 when he brought to the plant a doctor\u2019s note certifying that he was able to return to work on July 8. At that time no jobs were available, and he applied for unemployment benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s eligibility for unemployment compensation is governed by RSA ch. 282 and regulation No. 21. RSA 282:4 A(l) states that \u201c[a]n individual shall be disqualified for benefits . . . [if] [h]e left his work voluntarily without good cause in accordance with rules and regulations of the commissioner.\u201d Regulation No. 21, entitled \u201cVoluntary Quit Without Good Cause,\u201d establishes the conditions under which an RSA 282:4 A(l) disqualification occurs. A \u201cvoluntary quit\u201d makes the individual ineligible if he leaves for a reason which is not attributable to the employer. The relevant portion of the regulation states that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-8\">[t]he reason for his becoming unemployed shall be deemed attributable to the employer if the employer is unable to return him to his job or to comparable work due solely to a reduction in force involving such work or other economic conditions; and provided the individual exercised all his rights, or did all those things which a reasonably prudent person would have done, to continue the employee-employer relationship or the possibility of reemployment, for and during the period he was so unable to work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">Plaintiff\u2019s appeal raises two issues involving regulation No. 21. The first concerns whether the plaintiff \u201cdid all those things which a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>reasonably prudent person would have done to continue the employee-employer relationship\u201d as is required to establish eligibility. The second issue involves the interpretation of the phrase \u201cother economic conditions.\u201d Plaintiff argues that the phrase should be construed to include increases as well as decreases in business that account for the inability of the employer to return the plaintiff to his job or comparable work. Plaintiff\u2019s employer terminated his employment because, with an increase in production in May, it could no longer fill his position with temporary workers. When plaintiff was ready to return to work his former position was held by his replacement and there was no other position available.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">The parties do not question that the plaintiff did not request a formal leave of absence. The factual dispute involves whether he kept his supervisors sufficiently informed of the reason for his absence and when he would return to work so as to reasonably \u201ccontinue the employee-employer relationship.\u201d There was evidence that the employer could not reach anyone at a telephone number left by the plaintiff. In early May the defendant\u2019s superintendent called the office of plaintiff\u2019s doctor for information as to when he would be able to return to work, and testified that \u201cI could get nothing from the doctor. All he could say was it would be an indefinite time, several weeks more. ...\u201d The plaintiff however testified to some efforts to keep the employer informed. Nonetheless, on the record as a whole, we are convinced the trial court properly found and ruled that the plaintiff did not meet this condition of regulation No. 21 which is essential to make the termination of the employee-employer relation a \u201cquit\u201d for a reason attributable to the employer. <em>See Howley v. State, </em>107 N.H. 180, 219 A.2d 450 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">In view of the result reached, we need not consider the issue of what \u201cother economic conditions\u201d which may prevent an employer from returning an employee to his job, after being out sick, would constitute a quit attributable to the employer within the provisions of regulation No. 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b748-7\">BROCK, J., did not sit; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
