A trial by jury resulted in a verdict of guilty. During the course of the trial, the defendant seasonably excepted to the denials of his motions for a directed verdict of acquittal, and for the exclusion of certain photographic evidence. All questions of law raised were reserved and transferred by <em>Johnson, </em>J. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-17\"> Defendant\u2019s first contention is that the State failed to offer sufficient proof to permit a jury to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. \u201cOn motions . . . for a directed verdict. . . , the evidence must be construed most favorably to the State.\u201d <em>State v. Breest, </em>116 N.H. 734, 741, 367 A.2d 1320, 1326 (1976). An examination of the transcript discloses ample circumstantial evidence from which the jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. \u201cThe fact that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>evidence was circumstantial does not impair the verdict.\u201d <em>State v. Collins, </em>117 N.H. 198, 199, 371, A.2d 1154, 1155 (1977). The denial <em>of </em>the motion for a directed verdict of acquittal was therefore proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Defendant\u2019s second contention is that the court erred in admitting into evidence color slides depicting injuries to the sixteen-month-old victim. He admits that under \u201cnormal circumstances\u201d the admission or exclusion of photographs into evidence is in the discretion of the trial court. He claims, however, that the slides\u2019 probative value is outweighed by their inflammatory effect. We do not find any abuse of discretion and hold that the court could properly find, in its sound exercise of discretion, that the probative value of the slides outweighed the possible prejudice.
