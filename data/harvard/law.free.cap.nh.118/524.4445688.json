He was tried by the court and convicted in the superior court and a fine of $30 was imposed. He appealed to this court and petitioned that because he was without funds that a transcript of the testimony at his trial be supplied by the county. After a hearing, the court found that defendant was financially unable to pay for the transcript but found that the appeal is frivolous and that because speeding is a violation only, he was not entitled to a free transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-17\"> Speeding is a violation, RSA 262-A:2 and RSA 262-A:54, and not a crime. RSA 651:2 IV. Defendant is not therefore entitled as a matter of right to a free transcript and, in view of the finding that the appeal is frivolous, there was no abuse of discretion in the denial of the petition. <em>See United States v.
