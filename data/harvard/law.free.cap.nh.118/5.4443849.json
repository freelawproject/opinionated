On July 3, 1973, the State filed a second petition for an order of contempt and the court issued an order permitting inspection of defendant\u2019s facility by the department of health and welfare. On October 10, 1973, after hearing, the defendant was again found in contempt of the August 15 order and committed to jail for fifteen days. After seven days in jail the defendant was ordered released on his motion to be purged of contempt. In early November 1973, a motion for rehearing requesting \u201can adjudication of the question of what use of his facility will be permitted by the Court\u201d was filed accompanied by an offer of proof. On November 7, 1973, the court ruled that \u201con its face this motion requires no action by this Court.\u201d On October 6, 1976, another petition for contempt, the subject of the present proceedings, was filed by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">On April 15, 1977, after hearing, the Superior Court <em>(Mullavey, </em>J.) found the defendant in contempt of court for a third time \u201cin that he continued his business operations in violation of the Court\u2019s orders dated August 15,1972, and November 9,1973.\u201d A thirty-day jail sentence was imposed. Defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-11\">The defendant\u2019s contention is that there is \u201can essential lack of evidence sufficient to carry the State\u2019s burden of proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>beyond a reasonable doubt. . . .\u201d We agree that in criminal con-tempts the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was in violation of the court order. <em>State v. Linsky, </em>117 N.H. 866, 379 A.2d 813 (1977). The credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given to the evidence is a question to be resolved by the trial court. <em>Sullivan v. Chapman, </em>117 N.H. 1060, 381 A.2d 749 (1977). A review of the record reveals evidence to support the findings made and the verdict entered by the court must therefore stand. <em>Wilson v. Came, </em>117 N.H. 1020, 381 A.2d 32 (1977); <em>Wheelen v. Robinson, </em>117 N.H. 1032, 381 A.2d 742 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-3\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b43-4\">Lampe\u00f3n, J., did not sit.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
