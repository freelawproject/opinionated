The plaintiff brought suit in Rockingham County Superior Court late in December 1973 by a writ returnable on the first Tuesday of January 1974. Service of the writ was made at the abode of Mrs. Lowry and her husband, now deceased, and she had actual knowledge of the suit prior to the return date. Robert E. Lowry appeared pro se and admitted signing the note himself and forging his wife\u2019s signature. Mrs. Lowry failed to appear and a default was entered against her on January 15, 1974. Mr. Lowry died in May 1974. In February 1975, there was correspondence between the plaintiff\u2019s counsel and counsel retained by the defendant, in the course of which her counsel told the bank that \u201cif you want to proceed against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>her, you are welcome to do so.\u201d The plaintiff then requested judgment, which was entered in April 1975 in the amount of $1,269.13. On June 24, 1975, the plaintiff brought suit on the judgment in order to attach the defendant\u2019s land and collect the amount due. Plaintiff\u2019s verdict in the second suit was entered on February 3,1978. At no time during the second proceeding did the defendant or her counsel seek to reopen the 1975 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">On February 10, 1978, the defendant filed a motion to strike the default and requested a full trial on the merits. The motion was granted, without a hearing, on February 13,1978, by <em>Goode, </em>J. The plaintiff filed a timely objection to the motion to strike the default, and filed a motion to set aside the order striking the default. The latter motion was denied on March 15, 1978, subject to the plaintiff\u2019s exception, and all questions of law were reserved and transferred to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\"> \u201cItisthe invariable rule that one who would seek cancellation of an instrument procured by fraud must take steps to that end within a reasonable time after discovering that the fraud has been committed\u201d or be barred by laches. <em>O \u2019Grady v. Deery, </em>94 N.H. 5, 7, 45 A.2d 295, 296 (1946). The forgery that the defendant wishes to assert as a defense was within her knowledge as early as January 1974, and her husband\u2019s statement that she offers as evidence was a matter of public record in this case in 1974. Having chosen for more than four years not to assert the defense, the defendant and her counsel cannot now use the forgery as grounds for reopening the judgment. <em>See, e.g., Cloutier v. Epping Water &amp; Sewer Comm'n, </em>116 N.H. 276, 278, 360 A.2d 892, 894 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">This case lay dormant for nearly three years after the defendant\u2019s counsel told the plaintiff that it was free to proceed against the defendant. It is essential that there be some point at which decisions become final so that parties can place reliance on them. <em>Bricker v. Sceva Speare Mem. Hospital, </em>115 N.H. 709, 711, 350 A.2d 623, 625 (1975); see RSA 526:4.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-8\">On these facts it was an abuse of discretion for the trial court to grant the defendant\u2019s motion to strike the default judgment, and to deny the plaintiff\u2019s motion to strike the preceding order.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-9\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained; judgment for the plaintiff is reinstated. Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b955-10\">Douglas, J., did not sit.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
