Appeal of this decision under RSA 367:34 resulted in a Master\u2019s <em>(Robert A. Carignan, </em>Esq.) recommendation of affirmance. <em>Batchelder, </em>J., approved the master\u2019s recommendation. He reserved and transferred the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-11\">In May 1972 Henry Patenaude, a land developer, asked the Meredith Planning Board to approve his plan for subdivision of a one-hundred-acre tract. The plan divided the tract into three sections with eleven lots in section I, thirty-one lots in section II, and seven lots in section III. A twenty-acre portion, consisting of land from both sections II and III, was reserved for common recreational use. A portion of section I, lots No. 1 through 4, fronted on Fish Cove of Lake Winnipesaukee. The board inspected the tract and disapproved the plan. According to the minutes of the board\u2019s May 9 meeting, section III so exceeds the regulation minimum as to be unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-12\">RSA 36:21 (Supp. 1977) authorizes planning boards to require open spaces of \u201cadequate\u201d proportion and parks of Nreasonable\u201d size in subdivisions. In using indefinite words such as \u201cadequate\u201d and \u201creasonable,\u201d the legislature gave the boards discretion in deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>mining the size of recreational areas in subdivisions. <em>See </em>1A C. Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 21.16 (4th ed. 1972); <em>cf. New Hampshire Dep't of Revenue Adm. v. PELRB, </em>117 N.H. 976, 380 A.2d 1085 (1977). But this discretion is limited. In exercising their statutory discretion, regulating boards must take relevant factors into account, <em>see Bedford Bank v. State, </em>116 N.H. 649, 652, 365 A.2d 734, 736 (1976), and must take care that no arbitrary or unreasonable restraint is imposed on the exercise o f rights in private property. <em>Antonelli Const. Inc. v. Milstead, </em>34 N.J. Super. 449, 458, 112 A.2d 608, 613 (1955); <em>see Robbins Auto Parts, Inc. v. City of Laconia, </em>117 N.H. 235, 237, 371 A.2d 1167, 1169 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-3\">There is evidence in the record from which the master could conclude that the Meredith Planning Board\u2019s disapproval of Patenaude\u2019s plan was reasonable. The testimony was uncontroverted that the twenty acres devoted to recreational use in sections II and III were unsuitably steep and relatively inaccessible to those owning lots in the subdivision. There is also evidence that the board\u2019s soil map showed that lots No. 1 through 4 were of a soil type unsuitable for development. Significant portions of lots No. 1 through 4 were wetland. Finally, the record suggests that the contested area is a wildlife habitat. The board was concerned that the land\u2019s development would be inconsistent with that part of the town\u2019s comprehensive plan that calls for preservation of natural features and maintenance of wildlife areas. We cannot say that the board did not reach a reasonable decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\"> Patenaude\u2019s second challenge is that the board violated RSA 36:23 (Supp. 1977). That statute states that \u201c[i]n case of disapproval of any plat submitted, the ground for such disapproval shall be adequately stated upon the records of the planning board.\u201d Patenaude interprets \u201crecords\u201d to refer only to the minutes of board meetings and argues that the reason for disapproval given in the minutes, that the stakes defining the lots were in wetland areas, was not adequate. Although planning boards should fully discuss reasons for plan disapproval in board meeting minutes, we are persuaded that the legislature\u2019s use of the term \u201crecords\u201d is significant. The legislature does not treat \u201crecords\u201d as synonymous with \u201cminutes.\u201d <em>Compare </em>RSA 91-A.-2 <em>with </em>91-A:5. Read as a whole, RSA 36:23 (Supp. 1977) evinces a legislative intent that the subdivider receive written reasons for disapproval and that a written record of the board\u2019s reasons would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>exist so that a reviewing authority could hold the board accountable. <em>Cf. Foote v. State Personnel Common, </em>116 N.H. 145, 355 A.2d 412 (1976). <em>See generally </em>1 F. Cooper, State Administrative Law 421-31 (1965). Letters from planning boards notifying developers of reasons for plan disapproval serve the legislative intent. Thus we hold that such letters are \u201crecords\u201d within the meaning of RSA 36:23 (Supp. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">We also believe that the letter and the minutes, taken together, furnished Patenaude with adequate reasons. In using the term \u201cadequate,\u201d the legislature gave the board discretion, <em>see </em>1A C. Sands, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 21.16, and recognized that sufficient reasons in one case might be insufficient in another. <em>See </em>1 F. Cooper, <em>supra </em>at 33. Here members of the board were aware that Patenaude knew of the wet and unstable nature of the lots in question. In informing the developer that the land was unsuitable for building purposes, that the land was partially wetlands, and that development was inconsistent with both the comprehensive plan and board regulations, the board did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">The developer next argues that the board has no power to disapprove a subdivision plan when lot sizes in the plan conform to zoning requirements. RSA 36:21 (Supp. 1977) specifically empowers planning boards to regulate subdivisions to provide for \u201cthe harmonious development of the municipality and its environs\u201d and for \u201copen spaces of adequate proportions.\u201d The board may also ensure that \u201cland indicated on plats submitted shall be of such character that it can be used for building purposes without danger to health. . . .\u201d The statute further provides that the board\u2019s regulations \u201cmay include provisions which will tend to create conditions favorable to health, safety, convenience, or prosperity.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-7\">Statutes like RSA 36:19-29, regulating the subdivision of land seek to promote the orderly and planned growth of relatively undeveloped areas within a municipality. . . . Planless growth and haphazard development accentuate municipal problems in the demand for streets, water and sanitary services which have a direct relation to traffic, safety and health.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-8\"><em>Blevens v. Manchester, </em>103 N.H. 284, 286, 170 A.2d 121, 122 (1961). In the exercise of the power conferred by RSA 36:13 \u2014 15 and :21 <em>as amended, </em>(Supp. 1977), Meredith has commendably developed and published a comprehensive plan for growth. <em>See generally </em>Office of Comprehensive Planning of the State of New Hampshire, The Land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>Book (1976). Comprehensive planning with a solid scientific, statistical basis is the key element in land use regulation in New Hampshire. <em>See </em>Gilrain, <em>Recent Developments in Land Use Regulation, </em>19 N.H.B.J. 257, at 266-67 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">A planning board must consider current as well as anticipated realities. Whether a proposed plan conforms to zoning requirements is but one current issue. <em>See </em>Note, <em>Land Subdivision Control, </em>65 Harv. L. Rev. 1226, 1227 (1952). In the present case the board properly looked beyond the issue of zoning compliance and considered both the community\u2019s future need of open recreational space and the current and future fitness of the land for building purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Patenaude also challenges the board\u2019s disapproval of his 1976 plan because that rejection was \u201cbased on shifting reasons of inadequate lot size, unsuitable soils, and preservation of natural features.\u201d He argues that a reasonable person could not have known what action to take to comply with the board\u2019s requirements; therefore, the board\u2019s procedure violated due process. As we read the record, this argument is not based on the facts. The master found that \u201cthe plaintiff had early warning of the potential use the defendant board would allow him to make of the shoreline.\u201d The evidence supports this finding. The board informed Patenaude that lots No. 1 through 4 of section I were to be used only as \u201copen space.\u201d Nonetheless, both the plaintiff\u2019s later plans called for building on those lots. Although the board gave no reason for its disapproval of the 1976 plan, we find no violation of due process. Planning boards need not reiterate their reasons for disapproval of a resubmitted plan that contains the same fundamental defect that proved fatal to the original plan. <em>See generally </em>2 K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7\u00a7 16.12-13 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\"> The developer\u2019s penultimate argument is that in passings on the 1976 plan, the board illegally considered a letter from the United States Department of Agriculture discussing the general unfitness of the Fish Cove area for development. He claims that he had no opportunity to rebut the letter and objects to the procedure on due process grounds. However, not all procedural irregularities require a reviewing court to set asjde an administrative decision; material prejudice to the complaining party must be shown. <em>E.g., Denton v. Secretary of Air Force, </em>483 F.2d 21, 28 (9th <em>Cir. 1973); cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1146 (1974); <em>NLRB v. Selwyn Shoe Mfg. Corp., </em>428 F.2d 217, 224 (8th Cir. 1970); <em>see Legislative Utility </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number><em>Consumer's Council v. PUC, </em>118 N.H. 93, 101, 383 A.2d 89, 93 (1978). Here there is no showing that the letter affected the board\u2019s decision. The 1976 Patenaude plan contained the same defect that doomed previous submissions; it called for development of lots No. 1 through 4. The developer argues that-the master erroneously admitted the letter, which he claims was inadmissible hearsay. The planning board consulted with the Department of Agriculture, fulfilling its duty to consult with public agencies and officials concerning development. RSA 36:10. As evidence supporting the grounds upon which the board made its decision, the letter was properly considered by the master. RSA 36:34 II, III (Supp. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Finally, Patenaude argues that the board\u2019s requirement that lots No. 1 through 4 remain undeveloped amounts to an unconstitutional taking. This position is grounded on two assertions: the developer suggests that the requirement is \u201cconfiscatory\u201d and that it forces him to make improvements on the property unnecessary to ameliorate difficulties caused by the subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\"> The \u201cconfiscatory\u201d argument derives from the master\u2019s ruling that \u201cDefendant\u2019s requirement that Plaintiff keep the shore parcel along with the 20 acre parcel as open space is confiscatory.\u201d <em>East Neck Estates Ltd. v. Luchsinger, </em>61 Misc. 2d 619, 305 N.Y.S.2d 922 (Sup. Ct. 1969). But a master\u2019s ruling of law does not bind this court. <em>See Asciolla v. Manter Oldsmobile-Pontiac, Inc., </em>117 N.H. 85, 89, 370 A.2d 270, 273 (1977). Here the master\u2019s ruling is clearly incorrect. Even if <em>East Neck </em>stated the law in this jurisdiction, the requirement in dispute in the present case is not \u201cconfiscatory\u201d within the meaning of that case. A New York planning board required a subdivider to dedicate a parcel of beacRTroiitrw'orth~over one-third the total value of the tract to public use. That-parcel was suitable for the subdivider\u2019s proposed use \u2014 construction of beach homes. The court ruled the requirement \u2018\u2018confiscatory.\u2019-Neither of the grounds for the ruling in <em>East Neck </em>appears in the-present case. There is no showing of the value of the twenty-five acres relative to the value of the remaining acreage. Moreover, the evidence is that the four lots at issue here are not fit for the use intended by the subdivider.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">As the second half of his \u201ctaking\u201d argument^Patenaude relies on the general rule that when a planning board requires-an improvement as a condition of subdivision approval, the owner must be compensated unless the need for the improvement is necessitated by the subdivision. <em>Robbins Auto Parts, Inc. v. City of Laconia, </em>117 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>N.H. at 235, 371 A.2d at 1168; <em>KBW, Inc. v. </em>Bennington, 115 N.H. 392, 342 A.2d 653 (1975). We agree that the rule is applicable here; it makes no difference that in this case the board asks not that the developer improve a parcel of land but that he leave it unimproved. However, when an owner intends to develop his land in a manner that will result in a significant number of people forming a community on that land, adequate recreational space is a necessity. In requiring that lots No. 1 through 4 of section I be left as open space, the Meredith Planning Board clearly intends that those moving into the subdivision will have an adequate recreational area. Thus the limitation in use is necessitated by the subdivision itself and need not be compensated.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-3\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b659-4\">BROCK, J., did not sit; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
