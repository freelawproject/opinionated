The home is in an 0-1 zone, which under the Franklin zoning ordinance permits \u201caccessory uses\u201d that are \u201cincidental and subordinate to the principal use.\u201d The board of adjustment found that the hairdressing occupation was a home occupation but not an accessory use, and denied the plaintiff a use permit. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>On agreed facts, the Master <em>(Robert A. Carignan, </em>Esq.) denied the plaintiff relief. Her exception was reserved by <em>Mullavey, </em>J. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-3\">Section 608 of the ordinance defines \u201chome occupations\u201d as activities \u201csuch as\u201d art studios, dressmaking or teaching, and, if these occupations comply with certain other conditions of the section, requires that these home occupations be permitted as accessory uses. Both parties agree that the plaintiff\u2019s use will comply with the conditions of section 608; the use therefore must be permitted as an accessory use. The master\u2019s ruling denying the plaintiff relief is clearly incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-4\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
