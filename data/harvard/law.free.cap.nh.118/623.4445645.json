The plaintiff, Hilda G. Ahem, alleges that the defendant, Laconia Country Club, Inc., negligently maintained an unsafe workplace causing her husband to suffer work-related injuries on May 7, 1972. She seeks recovery of consequential damages and loss of consortium. The defendant filed a motion to dismiss relying on RSA 281:12 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, which was denied by the court. After this court\u2019s ruling in O<em>\u2019Keefe v. Associated Grocers, </em>117 N.H. 132, 370 A.2d 261 (1977), the defendant filed a second motion to dismiss; this motion was granted. Plaintiff seasonably excepted to the granting of the motion to dismiss. All questions of law were reserved and transferred by <em>Batchelder, </em>J.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">In 1971 (Laws 1971, 539:5), the legislature amended RSA 281:12 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law by adding this sentence: \u201cThe spouse of an employee entitled to benefits under this chapter shall have no right of action at common law against the employer ... to recover for consequential damages.\u201d In 1973 (Laws 1973, 481:3), the legislature replaced the phrase \u201cright of action at common law\u201d with the phrase \u201cdirect right of action\u201d so that the pertinent sentence reads: \u201cThe spouse of an employee entitled to benefits under this chapter shall have no direct right of action against the employer . . . to recover consequential damages.\u201d RSA 281:12. A woman\u2019s consortium action, which did not exist at common law, was created by statute in 1967. RSA 507:8-a.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The sole question presented is whether the legislature\u2019s 1971 amendment to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law bars this plaintiff\u2019s suit for loss of consortium which arose in 1972, when her action was one of statutory making, not one \u201cat common law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">It is well-established law that the intention of the legislature as expressed in the statute is the touchstone to its meaning. <em>Plymouth School Dist. v. State Bd. of Ed., </em>112 N.H. 74, 289 A.2d 73 (1972). Thus, we must look to the language of the statute itself as the prime determining factor in its interpretation. Where the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, the statute must be given effect according to its plain and obvious meaning. 82 C.J.S. <em>Statutes </em>\u00a7 322 (1953). The legislature must be presumed to know the meaning of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>words, and to have used the words of a statute advisedly. 73 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Statutes </em>\u00a7 196 (1974). Courts have no right to redraft legislation to make it conform to an intention not fairly expressed therein. <em>Trustees &amp;c. Academy v. Exeter, </em>92 N.H. 473, 478, 33 A.2d 665, 669 (1943); <em>R. A. Vachon &amp; Son, Inc. v. Concord, </em>112 N.H. 107, 113, 289 A.2d 646, 650 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">At the time of the injury to the plaintiff\u2019s husband, RSA 281:12 barred any \u201cright of action at common law\u201d which he had against the employer. This would include a husband\u2019s suit for loss of consortium. A wife\u2019s suit for loss of consortium was not an action at common law, but rather an action created by statute in 1967. Thus, the wife\u2019s action would not be barred. The language of the statute is clear and unambiguous. We are not inclined to hold that the legislature did not know the difference between a right of action created by common law and one enacted by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">The defendant, however, contends that it was the intent of the legislature to extinguish all forms of actions by spouses of employees. The defendant maintains the subsequent amendment in 1973, which replaced the words, \u201caction at common law,\u201d with the words, \u201cdirect rights of action\u201d, only corrected a technical error. Nevertheless, the question before us is not what the legislature ought to have done when it enacted this statute but what it did, as expressed in the words of the statute itself. <em>See State v. Cutting, </em>114 N.H. 200, 317 A.2d 553 (1974). Nor is it for this court to add terms to the statute that the legislature did not see fit to include. <em>Sigel v. Boston &amp; Maine R.R., </em>107 N.H. 8, 216 A.2d 794 (1966); 82 C.J.S. <em>Statutes </em>\u00a7 328 (1953). It is not our function to speculate upon any supposed intention not appropriately expressed in the act itself. Relief \u201cfrom its inappropriateness\u201d must be sought through further legislative action. <em>Trustees &amp;c. Academy v. Exeter, </em>92 N.H. 473, 478, 33 A.2d 665, 669 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">Finally, the defendant contends that <em>O\u2019Keefe v. Associated Grocers, </em>117 N.H. 132, 370 A.2d 261 (1977), bars the plaintiff\u2019s action. Because of the time element, <em>O\u2019Keefe </em>is distinguishable from the case at bar. <em>O\u2019Keefe </em>took place following the 1973 amendment to RSA 281:12 and therefore the plaintiff was clearly barred from recovery. The injury to the plaintiff\u2019s husband, however, occurred at the time the statute barred only an \u201caction at common law.\u201d As the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s cause of action was created by statute, the granting of the motion to dismiss was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained; remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b662-6\">BROCK, J., did not sit; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
