The defendant contends that the Master\u2019s <em>(Robert A. Carignan, </em>Esq.) findings and rulings were inconsistent with his report. We hold that there was no abuse of discretion and overrule the defendant\u2019s exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-18\">\u201cIn resolving this question we are mindful of the continuity of decisional law allocating broad discretion to the trial court in de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>termining matters of property settlement, alimony, and divorce.\u201d <em>Economides v. Economides, </em>116 N.H. 191, 193, 357 A.2d 871, 872 (1976). \u201cDefendant has the burden of showing that the orders were \u2018improper and unfair.\u2019 \u201d <em>Adams v. Adams, </em>117 N.H. 43, 44, 369 A.2d 196, 197 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">There is no transcript in this case, and a review of the record before us shows no inconsistency between findings and rulings and the report; further, there are revealed no errors of law. We therefore cannot say that the court abused its discretion with regard to the support order and the division of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b689-6\">DOUGLAS and BROCK, JJ., did not sit.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
