Hardwick, </em>Esq.) by decree entered <em>by Perkins, J.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b614-17\">Custody of a minor child was awarded to plaintiff who was also given the right to sole possession and occupancy of a real estate at 13 Asbury Street, Salem, until the child attained the age of eighteen or the plaintiff remarried, whichever event occurred first. The decree in paragraph 6 also provides that if the plaintiff \u201cpermits a man not her husband to reside with her at Asbury Street, her right of occupancy and possession shall immediately terminate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-18\"> Defendant thereafter moved that plaintiff\u2019s custody of the child and possession of the property be terminated and that he be given custody and possession because of a violation by plaintiff of the above paragraph 6. Another Master, <em>Nicholas G. Copadis, </em>recommended that the request for custody and occupancy be denied and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>that the property be sold. The recommendation was approved by <em>Cann, </em>J.; defendant\u2019s exceptions were transferred by <em>Mullavey, </em>J.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">The violation of paragraph 6 of the decree is now moot because plaintiff is not now in occupancy. The matter of custody was not mentioned in paragraph 6 arid, contrary to the contention of the defendant, a violation of paragraph 6 would not of itself entitle him to custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
