Defendant asserts that the superior court is without jurisdiction to issue an <em>ex parte </em>order allowing plaintiff to reclaim his personal property inasmuch as such an order circumvents the normal requirements of notice and hearing provided by the replevin statute. RSA ch. 536-A. <em>Flynn, </em>J., transferred the defendant\u2019s exception to the contempt order.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-15\">Although we look askance at such <em>ex parte </em>orders, the central issue before us is factually similar to the case of <em>Nottingham v. Cedar Waters, Inc., </em>118 N.H. 282, 385 A.2d 851 (1978), decided this day. Because the court apparently entered a criminal contempt penalty, a $300 fine (not clearly payable to the complainant), following an indirect civil contempt proceeding, the court\u2019s order is vacated and remanded for disposition in accordance with the principles stated in <em>Nottingham v. Cedar Waters, Inc. supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-16\">\n<em>Exception sustained; remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
