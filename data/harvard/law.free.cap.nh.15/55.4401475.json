They wont upon the northwest corner of a tract of land, part of the mortgaged premises, containing about fifty acres, where N. G.

N. G. Smith produced the assignment to himself from Henry Smith, but the witness was not certain that he then had the mortgage. They then went to the dwelling-house of the demandant, and N. G.

Gr. Smith, and to secure which the mortgage was made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-6\">The tenant then proposed to shoAv, by the testimony of aAvitness, that more than a year after the 30th of April, A. D. 1840, when N. Gr. Smith made his entry to foreclose the right to redeem, the witness advised the said Henry Smith that as the right to redeem had been foreclosed, he ought to deliver the notes to the demand-ant. To this evidence the counsel for the demandant objected, and it was ruled out by the court. The tenant then proposed to prove by Henry Smith that he delivered the notes to the demand-ant Avithout receiving the amount due thereon, and because he thought that it Avas his duty to deliver them to the demandant, Ayho Avas legally entitled to them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-7\">The counsel for the demandant objected to the Avitness, as interested on account of his liability upon his covenant in the deed to the tenant. The tenant then released the Avitness, and the demandant objected to his testimony, on two grounds : 1. Because a judgment in this suit against the tenant would estop the witness on account of the privity of estate betAveen them; and, 2. Because the witness could not explain the reason why the notes Avere delivered to the demandant, by proving that he acted under a mistake of the law. The court rejected the Avitness. It was admitted that the notes Avere delivered voluntarily by the said Henry Smith to the demandant, and the demandant admitted that only one payment, being the first due according to the tenor of the notes, had been made upon them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-8\">Upon this evidence the demandant contended; 1. That the deed from H. Smith to N. Q-. Smith, dated the 13th day of April, A. D. 1840, conveyed no interest Avhatever to the grantee in the land, because the mortgagee had never entered and taken possession of the land, either for the purpose of foreclosing or of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>taking the rents and profits ; and because the deed did not purport to assign the debt secured by the mortgage, nor had the notes ever been indorsed or delivered by the payee to N. G. Smith, nor had the debt been in any way assigned to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-5\">2. That although the sum of about $215.00 only had been paid by him upon the notes, still the production of them cancelled was evidence that they were surrendered upon some consideration valid between the parties; particularly when it appeared that Henry Smith, the payee, was the father of the demandant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-6\">8. That as the demandant had always remained in possession of the premises from the 14th day of April, A. D. 1836, the date of his deed from Henry Smith, to the 19th day of May, A. D. 1843, when he was ejected by the officer, by virtue of the proceedings under chapter 209 of the Revised Statutes, the entry by N. G. Smith was not a foreclosure of the mortgage, under the laws then in force, even if he had derived any title under his deed from Henry Smith, and such entry could not enure to the benefit of Henry Smith, as he never attorned to N. G. Smith, nor agreed to pay him rent, nor acknowledged himself to be his tenant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-7\">4. That the proceedings under ch. 209 of the Revised Statutes were so defective that no possession acquired by virtue thereof could be sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-8\">The demandant then offered evidence tending to show that about the first of July, A. D. 1841, Henry Smith, the father, brought the notes to the demandant, and delivered thorn to him, and requested him to take off his name from the notes, telling him that that was all he asked of him, and that this was all the claim lie had against him; that the demandant took them and was proceeding to bum them, when his father advised him not to do so, saying that he had better keep them, as there might be some trouble about them, and calling upon a person present to bear witness to the transaction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-9\">The tenant offered evidence that the demandant had said that he did not know how his father came to give him up the notes, and also that in October, 1842, he said that he did not own the land, and expected to leave the place in the spring.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>It appeared from the testimony of another witness for the tenant, that the demandant had said that he could hold the land, because N. Gr. Smith did not hold his title long enough to acquire a perfect title in himself, and on other occasions had said that he could hold the land because his father had given up the notes to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-5\">The tenant contended; 1. That the deed from Henry Smith, the mortgagor, to N. Gr. Smith, was a conveyance of the debt secured by the mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-6\">2. That N. Gr. Smith acquired a title to the land by foreclosing the right to redeem, and could thus convey a title to the said Henry Smith, who had conveyed to the tenant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-7\">3. That, as the notes had not been paid, even if the entry by N. Gr. Smith and the proceedings consequent thereon did not amount to a foreclosure of the mortgage, the mortgagee had a right of entry for condition broken, or to secure the rents and profits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-8\">4. That as the mortgagee had a right to the possession, it was sufficient if he actually acquired the possession, and it was immaterial whether the proceedings under ch. 209 of the Revised Statutes were or were not in due form.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-9\">5. That, having acquired the possession, he could convey to the tenant a valid title as against the demandant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-10\">A verdict was taken, by consent, for the demandant, subject to the opinion of the court; upon which judgment is to be rendered, or it is to be set aside and a new trial granted, according to the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b60-11\"><em>Leland, </em>for the tenant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqe\">The mortgage deed from this plaintiff to Henry Smith gave the seizin of the premises to him, with the right of entry at any time, to take the rents and profits till condition broken, and then the right of possession for the purpose of foreclosing. 1 N. <em>H. Rep. </em>169, <em>Brown </em>vs. <em>Cram.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-12\">Ry the assignment from Henry Smith to N. G. Smith, in consideration of $593.42, he granted, bargained, sold and transferred, assigned and set over, the said mortgaged premises. This conveyance is an alienation of the legal estate, and to enable the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>grantee to maintain an action for the recovery of the possession of the premises, and it is immaterial whether it is upon the back of the mortgage or in a separate deed. The possession taken by N. G. Smith under the conveyance is sufficient in law against the plaintiff, who is the mortgagor. He entered quietly and peaceably ; informed the plaintiff, who was then in possession, what he had done; to which he gave no answer, thereby approving of what was done. It is true, he kept in possession, but made no complaint, and acquiesced in what had been done.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-5\">By the plaintiff remaining in possession, acquiescing in what N. Gf. Smith had done, he must be considered in as tenant, and by making such entry N. Gf. Smith remained in the <em>\u201c </em>peaceable and continued actual possession,\u201d in a legal point of view. Before the year expired, N. G. Smith reassigned the same premises to Henry Smith, the original mortgagee, for a valuable consideration. This transferred all the interest of N. G. Smith in the premises back to the original mortgagee, and also all the rights and claims acquired in the possession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-6\">Whether the assignment from Henry Smith to N. G. Smith was valid or not, or whether the possession taken was such as the statute requires, or not, is immaterial, as the mortgagee, by the operation of the assignment, is placed where he originally stood as to the mortgage; and the possession acquired by virtue of the mortgage is good against the plaintiff, and he is estopped by his deed from maintaining any possessory action against the plaintiff or his assigns, till the debt is paid and the mortgage is discharged.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-7\">The proceedings by the justice, under the statute, ch. 209, put H. Smith into possession; and, whether these proceedings were regular or irregular, they are conclusive upon this plaintiff, and it is now too late to call their regularity in question. That should have been done by an appeal from the decision of the magistrate; and, as it was not done, it is a waiver of all irregularities and informalities. 5 <em>Mass. </em>97; 7 <em>Ditto </em>209; 6 N. <em>H.

G. Smith, then Henry Smith, being in possession as mortgagee by his conveyance to defendant, conveyed no other or greater interest than he had, which would operate only as an assignment of the mortgage; and it is immaterial whether the deed was by warranty, quitclaim, or assignment. The mode is of no consequence if it operated as a conveyance of the premises. It carried no other or greater interest as against this plaintiff than H. Smith had at the time. 15 <em>Mass. </em>233, <em>Warden </em>vs. <em>Adams; </em>4 <em>Pick.

Smith told him not to do it, but to keep them, \u201c as there might be trouble about themtherefore the facts do not warrant even a presumption that the mortgage was discharged, but otherwise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-9\">\u201c In the trial of a real action, brought by the assignee of a mortgage against a stranger in possession, the production by the tenant of the notes which the mortgage was given to secure, does not warrant a presumption that the mortgage has been discharged, where no discharge is shown, and where the facts of the case strongly tend to prove that the notes could not have been paid to any one who was a lawful holder thereof, and an assignee of the mortgage.\u201d 3 <em>Metcalf </em>224, <em>Crocker </em>vs. <em>Thompson ; </em>11 <em>Mass. </em>125-131, <em>Perkins </em>vs. <em>Pitts; </em>7 <em>N. </em>H.

They farther tend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>to show that they were given up through mistake. The case finds the notes were voluntarily given up, and that only the first payment due had been made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-5\">The result of the law upon those facts is, that the mortgage is not discharged, and remains in full force as a mortgage, or the title has become absolute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-6\">Hut the ruling of the court on the admissibility of the witness, to show that the notes were given up by the advice of the witness who acted as counsel for H.

His entry as against us is of no avail.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b64-5\">Gilchrist, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9\">The case finds that on the 14th day of April, 1836, the demandant\u2019s father conveyed to him the premises, and that he entered and took possession. On the same day the demandant mortgaged the premises to his father, to secure a debt, and on the 18th day of April, 1840, the father conveyed the premises to N. G. Smith, but did not deliver or transfer to him the notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The first question then is, whether N. G. Smith took any interest by virtue of this conveyance. In the case of <em>Bell </em>vs. <em>Morse, </em>6 <em>N. H. Rep. </em>210, it is said by the court that \u201c under certain circumstances a conveyance of the land by the mortgagee will pass the debt secured by the mortgage. But, there are certain cases in which a deed of the land by the mortgagee will pass nothing. Thus where a note is secured by a mortgage, if the mortgagee has transferred the note he cannot afterwards convey the land. And we are of opinion that it is not enough to show a deed from a mortgagee, in order to prove that the land passed, but it must be made to appear that the debt passed to the grantee. At least it must appear that the mortgagee had a right to transfer the debt to the grantee.\u201d From this last sentence it may perhaps be inferred that a mere conveyance of the land will pass the debt, provided the mortgagee has a right to transfer it. The remark of the late learned Chief Justice <em>Richardson, </em>who delivered the judgment of the court in Bell <em>vs. </em>Morse, was elicited by the fact that in that case no account whatever was given of the debt secured by the mortgage, and perhaps should hardly be considered even as an intimation of his opinion. That he had such a right in this instance appears from the case. It was in the month of April, 1840, that the mortgagee made his deed to N. G. Smith, and it was not until the month of July, 1841, that' he delivered the notes to the demandant. If, then, the position cited from the opinion in the case of Bell <em>vs. </em>Morse be correct, the deed to N. G. Smith transferred the debt secured by the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>mortgage. But that the deed did not have that effect appears from those decisions which determine that the interest of the mortgagee before foreclosure is a mere personal chattel, incident to the debt, and having no existence except in connection with it. If the mortgagee can convey an interest by deed, and still retain the ownership of the debt, then the interest in the land is not an incident to the debt, but is something which can be distinguished from, and which has an existence independent of, the debt. In such a state of things, the interest in the land can be conveyed to one person, while the property in the debt may belong to another. This result would be entirely inconsistent with the pxinciples recognized by this court in'various cases, the last of which is <em>Ellison </em>vs. <em>Daniels, </em>11 <em>N. H. Rep. </em>274. In that case the intimation in the case of Bell <em>vs. </em>Morse, on which we have been commenting, is adverted to, but it was not necessary to settle the point whether a deed of the land would convey the debt. It would rather seem to have boon the impression of the court, however, that it would not, and the case of <em>Aymar </em>vs. <em>Bill, </em>5 <em>Johns. Ch. </em>570, is cited as holding that a deed of the land would not have that effect. This is certainly the doctrine of <em>Aymar </em>vs. <em>Bill, </em>and the reason given for it is, because \u201c that would separate the debt and the pledge, the latter to reside in one person while the debt resided in another.\u201d But even without this authority, our opinion is that a conveyance of the land does not transfer the debt, because, so long as the mortgage is considered as an incident to the debt, it cannot pass without a transfer of the principal. Consequently in this case the mortgagee\u2019s deed of the 18th of April, 1840, conveyed no interest to N. G. Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The entry by N. G. Smith upon the premises was of no effect whatever. He had not the rights of the mortgagee, as has been stated; and even if he had had the interest in the debt, there was no foreclosure. He did not retain that actual peaceable possession which the statute contemplates, for the space of one year after his entry. <em>Rev. St., ch. </em>131, \u00a7 14. The demandant never attorned to him, nor recognized his title, nor assented to retain the possession as his tenant. N. G. Smith had no possession whatever. He did nothing but make an entry. His deed then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>to Henry Smith, of the 7th of November, 1840, conveyed to the mortgagee no farther title than he had before. There having been no foreclosure, the position of the mortgagee was not and could not be changed by any conveyance that N. Gr. Smith could make.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">It is contended that the proceedings against the demandant by the mortgagee, under ch. 209 of the Revised Statutes, were entirely nugatory. The objection is, that the writ of summons authorized by the 8th section of this chapter was not signed by the magistrate. The 5th section of ch. 182 enacts that writs issued by a justice of the peace \u201c shall be signed by him.\u201d The writ of summons in this case did not purport to be signed by the justice. The teste was in the form prescribed by the 10th section of ch. 182, \u201c Witness, David Thornton, esquire, the 6th day of May, 1843.\u201d But this is not sufficient. The 2d section of this chapter provides that writs issuing from the clerk\u2019s office of any court \u201c shall be signed by the clerk.\u201d A writ not signed by the clerk would undoubtedly be a void process, for it would be defective in a matter specially required by the statute. And for the same reason this writ of summons was invalid. But the point is now immaterial. It is now entirely unimportant that there was a defect in the proceedings before the magistrate, which might have been taken advantage of in some proper mode, perhaps by a motion to quash, or by a plea in abatement. The writ, valid or invalid, has answered its purpose. It has served as the foundation of a writ of possession, issued by the magistrate, and executed by the delivery of the possession of the demanded premises by the sheriff to Henry Smith, the mortgagee, on the 17th day of May, 1843. He, then, being in possession on the 21st day of June, 1843, by deed of warranty in the ordinary form, conveyed the premises to the tenant. He was then, if the notes had not been paid, a mortgagee in possession by virtue of a process issued by a court of competent jurisdiction. He had a right to retain the possession as against the mortgagor, and this right might be conveyed, so that his grantee would stand in his place, and would hold whatever right of possession was owned by his grantor.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>The question then arises whether the debt secured by the mortgage has been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The production of the notes by the mortgagor was <em>prim\u00e9 facie </em>evidence that they were paid. The tenant, however, proposed to prove by the mortgagee that they had not been paid. But he had conveyed to the tenant with warranty. The tenant then released the witness, and the demandant then contended, in the first place, that, notwithstanding the release, the witness was incompetent to testify, from interest, because if the demandant should recover in this suit against the tenant, his judgment would estop the witness, on account of the privity of estate between him and the tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">A judgment binds parties and privies by estoppel, and there is a privity of estate between the witness and the tenant, as the latter is the grantee of the former. But that is of no consequence in this case. The witness is, notwithstanding, disinterested. He stands indifferent in this suit, because, whoever may recover, he is not responsible. Since the release, he must be considered as having conveyed his interest without warranty ; and as that was the only ground for holding him interested, upon the execution of the release he became competent to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Can he testify to the facts to prove which he was introduced ? The demandant contends that the witness could not explain the reason why the notes were delivered to him, by proving that he acted under a mistake of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">It is settled that where money has been paid with a full knowledge of all the facts, or with the means of such knowledge, it cannot be recovered back on account of the payment having been made in ignorance of the law. <em>Peterborough </em>vs. <em>Lancaster, </em>[14 <em>N. H. Rep. </em>382.]</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">But the object of the tenant in this case was only to explain how the notes came into the possession of the demandant, and to rebut the presumption that he had them because he had paid them, or because the mortgagee had voluntarily given them to him without requiring them to be paid. Now it may be shown that a person has acted under an erroneous impression of his legal duties for the purpose of explaining acts which, withoxit such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>proof, would bear a different construction. The possession of the notes, for instance, was <em>prim\u00e1 fade </em>evidence that they had been paid, but it is no violation of the principle that money paid under a mistake of the law cannot be recovered back, to prove by tho mortgagee the reason why he surrendered them. Such evidence is merely explanatory. It has no connection with the principle above stated, but its competency depends upon its tendency to rebut the presumption of payment. Our opinion is, that the witness was competent, and also that he should have been permitted to testify to the facts to prove which he was called. It would then have been a question for the jury, whether the notes had or had not been paid. For the purpose of inquiring into this fact, the verdict must be set aside and there must be a</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\"><em>New </em>trial,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
