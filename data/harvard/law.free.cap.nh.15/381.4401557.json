James Seammon paid all the legacies bequeathed by the will, and so long as he lived performed all the duties required by the will. John Seammon, as executor of Leah Seammon, has a title acquired by the levy of an execution against David Lang, on the 13th day of October, 1839, to one sixth part in common and undivided of one of the tracts of land described in the writ, provided David Lang ever owned so much interest * in said land.

Lang, her son, descended to David Lang, the father of James, while the interest of Melinda, upon her decease under age and unmarried, descended to her mother, Leah, who conveyed it to David Lang, and the demandant now has David Lang\u2019s title in both portions of the land, by his deed from Benjamin Lang.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b384-6\">It is objected by the tenants\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b384-7\">I.

But his interest, by the express terms of the will, was an estate during his mother\u2019s widowhood only, with remainder by way of executory devise in two thirds to the daughters of the testator in fee, and in the other third to the heirs of John Scammon. <em>Bowers </em>vs. Porter, 4 <em>Pick. </em>198. The rule in Shelley\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>case lias never been applied to the case of an estate to one <em>pour auter vie, </em>with remainder to his heirs in tail, which is the nature of the estate here devised to James Scammon. This estate, upon the decease of the tenant <em>pour auler vie </em>during the life of the person for whose life the estate is to continue, his heirs take it, if at all, as special occupants, and not being an inheritance it cannot be entailed. <em>Doe </em>vs. <em>Luxton, </em>6 <em>T. R. </em>289 ; 1 <em>Hill. Abr. </em>43.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-5\">2. The devise by the testator of his \u201creal estate\u201d to his daughters gave them an estate in fee. <em>Davie </em>vs. <em>Stevens, Dougl. </em>321, 2. That an estate to the devisee and his heirs is an estate tail by implication, whenever as in this case there are subsequent expressions in the will showing an intention that the heirs of the body only of the devisee shall take, is clear upon authority. 4 <em>Kent\u2019s Com. </em>200, <em>(note;) </em>4 <em>Cruise </em>270, 274, 278, 281, 283; <em>Doe </em>vs. <em>Rivers, </em>7 <em>T.

Abr. </em>260, \u201c <em>Estate Tail\u201d ; Bowers </em>vs. <em>Porter, </em>4 <em>Pick. </em>198. Even, therefore, if the estate devised to James Scammon is an estate tail, as it may be according to the rule in Shelley\u2019s case, a remainder to the testator\u2019s daughters and to James Scammon\u2019s general heirs, could be well limited after it, either by <em>deed </em>or devise. 2 <em>Bl. Com. </em>164 ; 4 <em>Kent\u2019s Com. </em>198, 200.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-6\">3. If the estate devised to James Scammon were a fee simple, the devise over to the testator\u2019s daughters was good as an executory devise by which a fee might be limited upon a fee. 2 Hill. <em>Abr. </em>535 ; <em>Fearne on Rem. </em>90, 95, 318, 319; <em>Co.

The tenants contend that the charge of legacies', &amp;c. upon the estate devised to James Scammon, enlarges his estate to a fee simple.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-8\">1. But this rule of construction is never applied where both real and personal estate out of which the legacy may be paid, is given to the party charged with the payment. <em>Doe </em>vs. <em>Allen, </em>8 <em>T. R. </em>497 ; 5 <em>T. R. </em>558 ; 4 <em>Cruise </em>316, \u00a7 30 ; 8 <em>Johns. </em>141, <em>Jackson </em>vs. <em>Harris.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>2. Nor does it apply in any case where there is an express limitation of an estate less than a fee, but only where the devise is indeterminate, there being no words of limitation. The object of the rule is only to supply defects of expression. 6 <em>Johns. </em>192; 12 <em>Wend. </em>82; 1 <em>Pick. </em>318; <em>Bowers </em>vs. <em>Porter, </em>4 <em>Pick. </em>198; 9 <em>Mass. </em>165. Where the interest devised is limited by express and apt words, it is immaterial, in respect to the construction of the devise, whether the gift is advantageous to the devisee or otherwise. He may always at his pleasure refuse the devise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b386-5\">III. The tenants contend that Mrs. Bickford succeeds to Melinda\u2019s share of the property, either by descent or devise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b386-6\">1. We submit that this depends, not on the present statute regulating descents, but upon that passed February 3,1789. The present statute took effect January 1, 1823, and James Scammon died April 3,1819. At his decease Comfort Lang became entitled by the terms of the devise to a vested reversionary estate in fee in one third paid; .of the testator\u2019s lands. Or if, as the tenants conceive, the rule in Shelley\u2019s case is applicable here, then she became seized of a present estate in fee in one third part of that third of the lands which was not devised to Leah Scammon diming her widowhood, and entitled to a reversionary estate in fee in the other two third parts. 4 <em>Kent's Com. </em>202, 3 ; 1 <em>Salk. </em>232; <em>Chapin </em>vs. <em>Marvin, </em>12 <em>Wend. </em>538; <em>Fearne </em>329, 331. In whichever way her interest in the real estate may be regarded, it was- not in the power of the legislature by a law passed afterwards (1823) to change the tenor of this land for one less valuable or advantageous. Melinda\u2019s estate in the land, by this statute, if it applies here, was reduced to an estate descendible to her heirs in the descending line, or, in default of such heirs, to her brothers and sisters and their lineal heirs, which would be necessarily less valuable than an ordinary fee simple estate, to which she succeeded on the death of James Scammon. The proviso in the former act, providing for certain deviations from the general rules of descent, applied to intestate estates only.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b386-7\">2. The true construction of the present act does not establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>the tenant\u2019s position. We should advert to the law as it stood befoi'e the act. By the act of 1789, Melinda\u2019s share would have descended to her brothers and sisters ; if there wore none, to her mother, in exclusion of nephews and nieces. Wo contend that the present act changes the law in no particular except in admitting the heirs of deceased brothers and sisters to a share in the inheritance, and in extending the provision to the case of testate estates, and neither statute applies except where there are no surviving brothers or sisters. The intention was to prefer the brothers and sisters, but not the nephew's and nieces and more remote relations of the intestate, to the mother.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b387-5\">IV. The tenant objects to the conveyance from Leah Scammon to David Lang, that it is void because it attempts to create a.freehold estate to commence <em>in futuro.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b387-6\">1. But the deed is not open to this objection. It merely- provides that the grantee shall come into full possession at the grantor\u2019s death or marriage. ' The effect of the deed at farthest is that the grantor reserves a concurrent possession with the grantee during her life. Or it may be construed a covenant to ensure the possession to the grantee at Mrs. Scammon\u2019s death, notwithstanding any existing or supposed incumbrances. It is not a reservation of a life estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b387-7\">2. The deed is valid as a bargain and sale, or as a covenant to stand seized to the use of the grantee, and it may have this effect on account of the relation of the parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b387-8\">It is settled in Now-York that a freehold, to commence <em>in futuro, </em>may be conveyed by an instrument taking effect as a bargain and sale, overruling the cases to the contrary. 2 <em>Hill. Abr. </em>321; <em>Jackson </em>vs. <em>Dunsbagh, </em>1 <em>Johns. Cas. </em>94. The future use is supported by the seizin of the bargainor. 4 <em>Kent's Com. </em>299; <em>Chamberlain </em>vs. <em>Crane, </em>1 <em>N. H. Rep. </em>64; <em>Roe </em>vs. <em>Tranmer, </em>2 <em>Wils. </em>75.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b387-9\">There is a sufficient consideration for the deed to operate as a covenant to stand seized. 2 <em>Hill. Abr. </em>324. Such a conveyance has boon sustained in favor of remote relatives, as of a cousin five degrees removed; 4 <em>Cruise </em>98 ; 1 <em>Harris &amp; J. </em>527; in favor of the grantor\u2019s brother\u2019s wife; <em>Plowd. </em>300, <em>Sharring</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number><em>ton </em>vs. <em>Stratton; </em>and of the future wife of the grantor\u2019s son, <em>Bould </em>vs. Winston, 2 <em>Roll. Abr. </em>786 ; 4 <em>Dane's Abr. </em>220.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b388-5\">Christie, for the tenants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8V\">James Scammon had an indefeasible remainder in fee in that part of the estate devised to him, which wasmot defeated by the devise over. A fee is given, in terms, to him, \u201c his heirs and assigns,\u201d and a devise of <em>\u201c </em>the remainder of my real and personal estate\u201d is broad enough to carry the fee. The devisor is presumed to intend a devise beneficial to. the devisee; but according to the construction of the demandant, James would take nothing, and would be compelled to pay the debts and legacies. He thus would be a loser, unless the estate devised were a fee. 6 <em>Cruise </em>675 ; 6 <em>Cowen </em>441; 6 <em>Johns. </em>492. That a devise of land, charged with the payment of debts and legacies, will pass a fee, is well settled. <em>Com. Dig. Estate by Dev., (n) 4; 8 T. R. </em>1; <em>Cro, Eliz. </em>330 ; 5 <em>T. R. </em>558 ; 4 <em>East </em>496; 5 <em>East </em>97; 3 T. <em>R. </em>356 ; 18 <em>Johns. </em>31.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-6\">' If this be an unconditional fee, the devise over is void, because all the estate is disposed of. It may be either a fee determinable on the happening of the contingency mentioned in the will, or a fee tail male. And if the devise over is good, by way of executory devise, or as a contingent remainder, all Melinda\u2019s interest vested in her niece Jane, notwithstanding the argument of the demandant that the act of 1822 Cannot apply.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b388-7\">Gilchrist, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANt\">A series of judicial decisions extending through a long period of years, has settled the principles by which this case must be governed and the rules by which the will must be construed, the application of which is not very difficult.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">The testator devises to his wife \u201c the improvement and income of two thirds of all his lands so long as she remains his widow.\u201d She then holds two thirds of the lands during her widowhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">He then devises to James Scammon, \u201c his heirs and assigns, my workshop, with the land it stands on.\u201d This is an express devise in fee, unconnected with and independent of any condidition attached to the subsequent devise. He then proceeds: \u201c also I give him the improvement of all my real estate not oth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>erwise disposed of in this will, during the term of his mother\u2019s widowhood.\u201d The estate \u201c not otherwise disposed of\u201d was one third part of the testator\u2019s lands. He had given Mrs. Scammon the use of two thirds of his lands during her widowhood, and deducting the workshop and the land it stood upon, James would hold the remaining third during his mother\u2019s widowhood. Thus all his lands were disposed of so long as Mrs. Scammon should remain his widow. Thus far the will is free from any doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-3\">The next provision is the material one, and is that about which the controversy has arisen. It is as follows: <em>\u201c </em>I also give and bequeath to him, (James,) his heirs and assigns, all my real and personal estate not otherwise disposed of in this will, ho to come into possession at the decease or marriage of my wife, on condition of his paying all my just debts and the legacies herein ordered to be paid ; but if my said son James should die before he arrives to the age of twenty-seven years, and have no male issue, then it is my will that each of my daughters should have one third part of my real estate, and his heirs the other third part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">In this provision there are several clauses which require consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">James was to come into possession of the estate then undisposed of, at the death or marriage of Mrs. Scammon. The possession refers to Mrs. Scammon\u2019s two thirds, as he already had possession of one third. These words are referred to here for the purpose of remarking that they convey no future interest, the estate having already been devised to him by the words preceding those w'hich refer to the possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">But this remainder in fee is devised to him \u201c on condition of his paying all my just debts and the legacies herein ordered to be paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Now a fee is conveyed to James Scammon by this devise in three different modes. In the first place, the property is conveyed to \u201c him and his heirs.\u201d It needs no authorities at this day to show that these words convey the fee. Where there are no words of limitation, courts resort to other parts of the will in order to ascertain from them the intention of the testator, and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>fee is often held to be conveyed by implication, but this is done only to supply defects of expression. <em>Stevens </em>vs. <em>Winship, </em>1 <em>Pick. </em>326; <em>Lithgow </em>vs. Kavenagh, 9 <em>Mass. 165; Doe </em>vs. <em>Fyldes, Cowp. </em>841; <em>Tanner </em>vs. <em>Livingston, </em>12 <em>Wend. </em>95. Where a fee is devised by express terms, it is unnecessary to imply it. In the present case, there is a personal charge upon the devisee, and for that reason also he takes the fee. 4 <em>Kent </em>540 ; <em>Doe </em>vs. <em>Holmes, </em>8 <em>T. R. </em>1; <em>Van Alstyne </em>vs. <em>Spraker, </em>13 <em>Wend. </em>578 ; <em>Fox </em>vs. <em>Phelps, </em>17 <em>Wend. </em>393; <em>Jackson </em>vs. <em>Bull, </em>10 <em>Johns. </em>148. The reason for this is, that if the devisee did not take a fee, he might be a loser by paying the debts, and the testator is presumed to intend that his gift shall be beneficial to the devisee. <em>Leavitt </em>vs. <em>Wooster, </em>[14 <em>N. H. Rep. </em>550.]</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">A fee is also conveyed, because the testator has devised all his estate, and this expression is sufficient without words of limitation. <em>Fogg </em>vs. <em>Clark, </em>1 <em>N. H. Rep. </em>163 ; <em>Brown </em>vs. <em>Wood, </em>17 <em>Mass. </em>68 ; <em>Randall </em>vs. <em>Tuchin, </em>6 <em>Taunt. </em>410 ; <em>Cliffe </em>vs. <em>Gibbons, </em>2 <em>Lord Raym. </em>1324; <em>Grayson </em>vs. <em>Aikinson, </em>1 <em>Wilson </em>333 <em>; Hopewell </em>vs. <em>Ackland, </em>1 <em>Salk. </em>239 ; <em>Doe </em>vs. <em>Allen, </em>8 <em>T. R. </em>503 ; <em>Leavitt </em>vs. <em>Wooster, </em>[14 <em>N. H. Rep. </em>550.]</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">'The next inquiry relates to the effect of the limitation over to the daughters after the devise to James in fee. The will provides that \u201c if he should die before he arrives to the age of twenty-seven years, and have no male issue,\u201d then each of the daughters should have one third of the real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">In the construction of this limitation, the intention of the testator is undoubtedly, as has often been said, the pole star by which the court is to be guided. \u201c Notwithstanding, there has been for ages a system of legal construction established on the subject of devises, by which when a certain form of words is used, a construction is put upon that form, and adhered to for the sake of certainty.\u201d Lord <em>Mansfield, Pistol </em>vs. <em>Riccardson, </em>3 <em>Dougl. </em>361; <em>Parsons, </em>C. J., <em>Ide </em>vs. <em>Ide, </em>5 <em>Mass. </em>501; Lord <em>Kenyon, Doe </em>vs. <em>Wright, 8 T. R. </em>64.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">There are numerous authorities, that where there is a devise to a man and his heirs, but if he should die <em>without issue, </em>or <em>having no issue, or leaving no issue, </em>then over, that the first devisee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>takes an estate tail, with a contingent remainder to the subsequent devisee. The words, <em>without issue, </em>&amp;c. have been construed to mean an indefinite failure of issue, and the remainder over has been held void as an executory devise, because too remote, as tending to a perpetuity, for the descendants of the first taker might not become extinct for hundreds of years. See 4 <em>Kent </em>274; <em>Ide </em>vs. <em>Ide, </em>5 <em>Mass. </em>500 ; <em>Patterson </em>vs. <em>Ellis, </em>11 <em>Wend. </em>259 ; <em>Doe </em>vs. <em>Ellis, </em>9 <em>East </em>382; <em>Romilly </em>vs. <em>James, </em>6 <em>Taunt. </em>263; <em>Tenney </em>vs. <em>Agar, </em>12 <em>East </em>253 ; <em>Purefoy </em>vs. <em>Rogers, </em>2 <em>Saund. </em>380 ; <em>Doe </em>vs. <em>Morgan, </em>3 <em>T. R. </em>765. But see, also, <em>Hall </em>vs. <em>Chaffee, </em>[14 <em>N. H. Rep. </em>215.]</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">If the words importing a failure of issue are restrained to issue living at the death of the first taker, there is no question that the limitation over is good as an executory devise.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">One class of cases in which the words are clearly thus restrained, is where the death of the first devisee is confined to a given age; as is the case with this devisee, James Scammon, the limitation over being if he \u201c should die before he arrives to the age of twenty-seven years, and have no male issue.\u201d <em>Eastman </em>vs. <em>Baker, </em>1 <em>Taunt. </em>174; <em>Toovey </em>vs. <em>Bassett, </em>10 <em>Past </em>460; <em>Glover </em>vs. <em>Monckton, </em>3 <em>Bingh. </em>15.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">On another ground, also, the limitation over is valid. The expressions in the will show that the testator intended that the words, <em>have no male issue, </em>should refer to the state of things existing at the death of the devisee. If he should die without such issue, his heirs are to take one third part of the lands. Who his heirs might be must be determined upon his death. That, then, is the period to which the testator refers. It might indeed be said that the period for ascertaining who his heirs might be, was after all his descendants should become extinct. But this is not so obvious or so rational an exposition of the will as the other construction; for in order to adopt it, we must disregard the first class of heirs entirely, and the first period when the devisee can be said to have heirs, in a legal sense, although they answer all the requirements of the will. We think the testator intended the death of James Scammon, without issue living at the time of Ms death, and that the limitation over to the daughters is valid by way of executory devise.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>Upon the death of James Scammon, his daughter Jane, the wife of the tenant, took a fee in the property devised to her father, by the operation of the rule in Shelley\u2019s case, a freehold estate having been given him by the will, and the words, \u201c his heirs,\u201d being words of descent and not words of purchase. This share the tenant now holds in her right.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Comfort Scammon having married David Lang, her share descended upon her death to her son James, and at his death after his mother, it was inherited by his father, David Lang, as his next of kin, and the demandant now holds it by virtue of a conveyance from Lang.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">A question is made in the case as to the share of Melinda. She died under age, and unmarried, in the month of December, 1826. In order to ascertain who inherited her property, it will be necessary to examine our statutes regulating descent.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">By the act of July 2d, 1822, N. <em>H. Laws </em>351, <em>(Ed. of </em>1830,) it was provided, that an intestate estate should descend in equal shares among the children and their representatives, and if there were no children it should be inherited equally by the next of kin ; provided, however, that when any of the children of such intestate should die before the age of twenty-one years, and unmarried, or when any child of a person deceased testate should die before twenty-one years of age, and unmarried, <em>such deceased child\u2019s share in the estate </em>should, although its other parent be alive, be inherited by its surviving brothers and sisters, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">The act of February 3d, 1789, <em>N. H. Laws </em>207, (Ed. <em>of </em>1815,) contains no provision relating to the descent of a deceased child\u2019s share in a testate estate. This act was in force in the year 1817, when James Scammon died. It permitted an estate to be disposed of according to the will of the testator, but it did not prescribe \u25a0 the disposition of a share which a devisee might take under a will. Upon the death of her brother James, in 1819, Melinda took under the will by way of executory devise. If the act of 1789 had remained in force, the share or property of Melinda would not have been disposed of upon her death as <em>a share in her father\u2019s estate, </em>but would have gone as <em>her estate </em>to her next of kin. The fact that she derived her estate from her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>father would have no more effect upon its descent as her property, than its derivation from any other source, the will of a stranger for instance. In this State we never look to the source whence the estate was derived, to determine who shall inherit it, except in cases where the statute has made that circumstance material, and it is not made so in this instance. <em>Parker </em>vs. <em>Nims, </em>2 <em>N. H. Rep. </em>461. Melinda took as a purchaser under the will, and would have become a new stock of descent.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The act of 1822 had no retrospective operation so as to regulate the disposition of Hezeldah Scammon\u2019s estate, for that estate had already been settled, and all, the provisions of the will had been carried into effect before the passage of the act. The provisions of the statute had no relation to what once was, but which no longer remained, <em>a share in the estate. </em>Melinda\u2019s property had ceased to possess that quality, and was simply <em>her property, </em>her interest in the land as an executory devisee. Then being a purchaser, her property was not in a condition to be operated upon by the provision relative to shares in testate estates. The general provisions of the act of 1822, regulating the descent of intestate estates, furnished the rule for the disposition of her property at her death in 1826, she being the <em>stirps. </em>These provisions gave to the next of kin, precisely as the act of 1789 would have done, and her mother, as next of kin, took all her property by the operation of the general rule laid down in the statute, the case not falling within any of the exceptions. <em>McAfee </em>vs. <em>Gilmore, </em>4 <em>N. H. Rep. </em>391.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Melinda\u2019s property having thus been inherited by her mother, Mrs. Scammon, the latter conveyed all her interest in the estate to David Lang, in the month of February, 1828. The deed contained the following clause, \u201c he, the said Lang, to take full possession at my marriage or death,\u201d and was in consideration of \u201c one dollar and the love and good will I boar David Lang, as my son-in-law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">It was contended that this deed is void, as attempting to convey a freehold estate <em>in futuro. </em>The deed undoubtedly reserves an estate to the grantor during her life. This is its obvious construction, and the remainder after the expiration of the life estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>is all that the grantee took by the deed. There seems to be nn reason why it may not operate under the statute of uses, both as a deed of bargain and sale, and as a covenant to stand seized to the use of the grantee, by either of which modes a freehold <em>in futuro </em>will pass. In neither of them are any formal words required. So long ago as the time of <em>JLevinz </em>it was said, \u201c that the judges of late years have had more consideration of the substance, viz. the passing of the estate, than the shadow, viz. the manner of passing it.\u201d 3 <em>Levinz </em>372. There is a pecuniary consideration, which, however small, is sufficient in a deed of bargain and sale. The New-York decisions have settled there that this deed will pass a freehold <em>infutwo. Jackson </em>vs. <em>Staats, </em>11 <em>Johns. </em>337; <em>Jackson </em>vs. <em>Swart, </em>20 <em>Johns. </em>85; <em>Jackson </em>vs. <em>McKenny, </em>3 <em>Wend. </em>233; <em>Rogers </em>vs. <em>Eagle Fire Co., </em>9 <em>Wend. </em>611. And in two recent very acute and learned English treatises, <em>Cornish on Uses 44 wad Burton on Real Prop.,pl. </em>145, it is stated, and the authorities are cited, that a deed of bargain and sale will convey a freehold <em>in futuro.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">In the case of <em>Wallis </em>vs. <em>Wallis, </em>4 <em>Mass. </em>136, it is said that \u201c by a common law conveyance a freehold cannot be conveyed <em>in futuro,\u201d </em>but no reference is made to the fact that a deed of bargain and sale derives its effect from the statute of uses. In the case of <em>Welch </em>vs. <em>Foster, </em>12 <em>Mass. </em>96, it is held that such a deed will not pass a freehold <em>in futuro, </em>and also in <em>Parker </em>vs. <em>Nichols, </em>7 <em>Pick. </em>115. In this case it is said by Mr. Justice <em>Jackson </em>that the statute of uses, 27 <em>Henry </em>8, had not been adopted in Massachusetts. It has, however, been adopted in this State. <em>Chamberlain </em>vs. <em>Crane, </em>1 <em>N. H. R. </em>64; <em>New. Par. in Exeter </em>vs. <em>Odiorne, </em>1 <em>N. H. Rep. </em>237; <em>French </em>vs. <em>French, </em>3 <em>N. H. Rep. </em>234. The point is, however, so learnedly reasoned out by Mr. Chancellor <em>Walworth, </em>in the case of <em>Rogers </em>vs. <em>Eagle Fire Co., </em>9 <em>Wend. </em>625, 631, and the authorities so fully examined, showing that a freehold estate <em>in futwro </em>may be thus conveyed, that the references above made in our opinion authorize the position that the deed in this case has that operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Whether the deed can operate as a covenant to stand seized, depends on the question whether the consideration be sufficient. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>If it can operate as such a covenant, it will convey a freehold <em>in futuro, </em>upon all the authorities. The consideration is \u201c the love and good will I bear David Lang as my son-in-law.\u201d James, the son of Comfort and David Lang, and the grandson of Mrs. Scammon, had died before the date of this deed. There was no actual relationship then existing between Lang and Mrs. Scammon, but he had been the husband of the grantor\u2019s daughter, and the father of her grandson, both of whom wore then dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">In the ease of <em>Gale </em>vs. <em>Coburn, </em>18 <em>Pick. </em>897, the daughter of a grantor had married the grantee, but died before the date of the deed, leaving, however, two children, who were then living. A doubt was suggested whether, after the death of the wife, the consideration of marriage could be regarded as still subsisting. But it was unnecessary to decide the point, because there was a consanguinity between the grantor and his grandchildren, and <em>Shaw, </em>C. J., said that \u201c the grantor might well suppose that the most effectual mode of advancing his grandchildren was to vest the property in one, bound by every consideration of legal obligation, moral duty, and parental affection, to provide' for their maintenance, education and advancement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">If the above be a sufficient reason for holding the consideration to be sufficient, and the boundaries which exclude persons as too remote to be within its influence have never yet been defined, the consideration may be sufficient in the present case. That the grantee had been the husband and father of those nearly allied to her by ties of blood, and had bestowed on them the kindness and care which they would naturally call forth and require, would appeal as strongly to the feelings of the grantor as would the expectation of advantage to the grandchildren of the grantor in the case of <em>Gale </em>vs. <em>Coburn. </em>And there is good authority for going as far as this case requires. In <em>Sheppard\u2019s Touchstone </em>511, 512, it is said that if one, \u201c in consideration of nature, kindred, blood or marriage, covenant to stand seized to the use ox himself, his wife, or intended wife, children, brothers, sisters, cousins, or their wives, or intended wives, those are good considerations.\u201d If the intended wife of a man\u2019s cousin come within the consideration of marriage, the husband of a deceased daughter would seem to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>equally so, and in the absence of any authorities to the contrary we think the consideration in this case is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">David Lang having thus acquired a title to the property devised to Melinda, conveyed it to Benjamin Lang, who conveyed it to the demandant, and the latter is entitled to judgment for two thirds of the land, with the exception of the tract levied upon by John Scammon, as stated in the case, in relation to which no question is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">\n<em>Judgment for the demandant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
