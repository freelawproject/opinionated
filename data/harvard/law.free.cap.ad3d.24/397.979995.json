The plaintiff established his prima facie entitlement to summary judgment by presenting proof that he was walking within a crosswalk when he was struck by the defendants\u2019 vehicle and that he had looked for approaching traffic before he began to cross (see Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1151 [a]; <em>Zabusky v Cochran, </em>234 AD2d 542 [1996]; <em>Jermin v APA Truck Leasing Co., </em>237 AD2d 255 [1997]). Contrary to the defendants\u2019 contention, the Supreme Court properly considered the police accident report which contained Rakhman\u2019s admission immediately following the accident that he had observed the pedestrian in the intersection but was unable to stop in time (see <em>Grange v Jacobs, </em>11 AD3d 582 [2004]; <em>Guevara v Zaharakis, </em>303 AD2d 555 [2003]).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">In opposition, the defendants failed to raise a triable issue of fact. We find Rakhman\u2019s affidavit, in which he attested that the accident occurred in the middle of the block and that it was caused when the plaintiff walked into the side of his vehicle, to be a belated attempt to avoid the consequences of his earlier admission by raising a feigned issue which was insufficient to defeat the motion <em>(see id.; Fontana v Fortunoff, </em>246 AD2d 626 [1998]). Moreover, the defendants\u2019 purported need to conduct discovery did not warrant denial of the motion since they already had personal knowledge of the relevant facts <em>(see Niyazov v Bradford, </em>13 AD3d 501, 502 [2004]). Adams, J.P., S. Miller, Ritter and Lifson, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
