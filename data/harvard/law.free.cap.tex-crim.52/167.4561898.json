The order complained of is as follows: \u201cIt is ordered by the District Court of Fort Bend County that the case of the State v. Tom Banks, wherein the defendant stands charged with illegally carrying a pistol, that the same be transferred according to law to the - court of - county for trial by reason of the want of jurisdiction of the District Court.\u201d Questions of this character cannot be presented in motion in arrest of judgment, but must be raised in limine; that is, prior to the time appellant announces ready for trial, otherwise it comes too late. See Coker v. State, 7 Texas Crim. App., 83; Freedlander v. State, 7 Texas Crim. App., 204, and Bonner v. State, 38 Texas Crim. Rep., 599.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">The facts in this case show that defendant was at the house of Dave Botts on the night in question where a crowd had assembled and were engaged in dancing, and while there an altercation sprang up, and in the difficulty appellant pulled a pistol and fired upon one of the parties. Appellant, in his evidence, claims.that he had gone over to his father\u2019s house and got the pistol and started home with it, and that he met on the way Dave Botts, and went to his house, where there was a dance. The court, in his charge to the jury, told them that defendant had a right to go and get the pistol and carry it to his home, and that if he stopped on the route and diverted his course to engage in pleasure, then he would be guilty if the jury so believed. Appellant complains of the failure of the court to charge that if the jury believed that the defendant carried the pistol as alleged, but for the purpose alone of carrying the same home, then you will find the defendant not guilty. The court charged this, but added: \u201cBut if he stopped by the wayside and engaged in pleasure, then the same would be no defense.\u201d This, as we understand it, is the law of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-12\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-13\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b186-14\">Henderson, Judge, absent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
