S. O\u2019Neal, including the names of defendant\u2019s witnesses, R. H. C. Butler and Bud Lawrence, petitioning the sheriff of Smith County, Texas, to appoint the prosecuting witness, Jas. S. O\u2019Neal, deputy sheriff. The petition was signed some time in November or December, 1906. Defendant objected to the introduction of same for the reason that same was signed some seven or eight months prior to the trial of this cause, and the question at issue was the general reputation of the said O\u2019Neal for truth and veracity in the community in which he lived at the time of the trial of said cause, and not some seven or eight months prior to said time. Furthermore, said petition was only the individual opinions of the signers of said petition and not the opinion and reputation as expressed by the community at large, and was, therefore, inadmissible. The court overruled the objections and permitted the introduction of the petition; at least that part of it showing that the above witnesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>signed same. The bill, however, is approved with this explanation: \u201cThat defendant introduced T. H. C. Butler and Bud Lawrence as witnesses to impeach State\u2019s witness, O\u2019Neal, for truth and veracity, and covers some six or eight months of time prior to the alleged sale. And the county attorney then introduced a petition addressed to the sheriff of Smith County with witnesses Butler and Lawrence\u2019s names, and said petition stated that O\u2019Neal was well known to each of them, and he was a safe, reliable, truthful and honest man, and only Butler and Lawrence\u2019s names were allowed to be shown to the jury, as impeaching them or show their attitude, it being also shown that recently Butler had fallen out with O\u2019Neal and Lawrence was on defendant\u2019s liquor dealer\u2019s bond.\u201d Clearly under the explanation of the court the testimony was entirely admissible. These witnesses were brought in by appellant to impeach the prosecuting witness. In substance that shows a lack of verity in their statement, against appellant; all that contradicts their statements is entirely admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Appellant complained of the failure of the court to quash the venire. There is no bill presenting the matter and, therefore, same cannot be reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">We have carefully read the court\u2019s charge, and in our opinion it is a proper presentation of the law of this case. As far as applicable the special charges were covered by the main charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">Henderson, Judge, absent.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">[Motion for rehearing overruled without written opinion.\u2014Beporter.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
