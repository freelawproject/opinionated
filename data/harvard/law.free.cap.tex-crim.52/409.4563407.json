Bill of exceptions Ho. 3 shows before defendant pleaded to the indictment he suggested his right name was \u201cGeorge Popnoy,\u201d he having been indicted as \u201cGeorge Popinaw.\u201d On motion for a new trial when the above action of the court was complained of, the State had J. M. Spotts. and defendant\u2019s brother, sworn, and they testified as follows: J. M. Spotts, over appellant\u2019s objection, stated, \u201cI have known the defendant all my life. He was always called George Popenaugh; never heard him called anything else; have written his -name that way a number of times, but never wrote it that way at his dictation, and never heard him spell or pronounce his name.\u201d Defendant\u2019s brother testified that appellant\u2019s name was \u201cGeorge Popnoy.\u201d This is reversible error. The court should have complied with appellant\u2019s suggestion. The statute is mandatory. See Sinclair v. State, 34 Texas Crim. Rep., 453; Clark v. State, 45 Texas Crim. Rep., 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-16\">We do not deem it necessary to pass upon the other questions raised in this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-17\">For the error suggested, the judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-18\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
