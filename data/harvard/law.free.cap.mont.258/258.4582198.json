Michael Beasley appeals an order of the Eleventh Judicial District Court, Flathead County, granting summary judgment in favor of Semitool, Inc., Semitherm, Inc. and Raymon Thompson on his claim for wrongful discharge, breach of express and implied contract, and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-13\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in concluding that the Wrongful Discharge Act barred Beasley\u2019s contract claims for breach of express and implied contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-14\">While L. Michael Beasley (Beasley) was working as an electronics project engineer in Kentucky, an agent of Semitool, Inc. (Semitool) began employment negotiations with Beasley. Semitool, located in Kalispell, manufactures products in the electronics, memory disk and semiconductor industry. On June 3, 1986, Semitool offered Beasley the position of \u201cProduct Marketing Manager for Spray Acid Tool,\u201d which Beasley accepted eight days later. Beasley contends that Semi-tool\u2019s offer included oral promises of stock options, bonuses tied to sales increases and opportunities for advancement not specifically set forth in the letter offering him the position.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Beasley moved to Kalispell, began working for Semitool and received excellent job evaluations. In November of 1987, he was transferred to Semitherm, Inc. (Semitherm), a sister company of Semitool, to lead the development, marketing and production of a vertical diffusion furnace. He alleges that this transfer was accompanied by oral promises of raises, higher bonuses, and stock options. On January 28,1989, Beasley resigned from Semitherm, citing the company\u2019s failure to keep its compensation-related promises.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">On February 13, 1990, Beasley filed a complaint against Semi-tool, Semitherm and Raymon Thompson (collectively hereafter Semitool) for breach of express and implied contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and wrongful discharge. Semitool moved for summary judgment, arguing that the Montana Wrongful Discharge From Employment Act (Wrongful Discharge Act) provided Beasley\u2019s exclusive remedy and that he could prove no damages under the Wrongful Discharge Act. The District Court granted Semitool\u2019s motion, and entered judgment against Beasley. This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Initially, we note that Beasley was hired by a Texas firm at a significantly higher salary soon after his resignation from Semitherm. As a result, Beasley has abandoned his claim for wrongful discharge on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Did the District Court err in concluding that the Wrongful Discharge Act barred Beasley\u2019s contract claims for breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing?</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">In its order, the District Court first stated that Beasley\u2019s three claims for damages were based on the same facts and that the acts complained of occurred during the employment relationship. The court focused on \u00a7 39-2-913, MCA, of the Wrongful Discharge Act, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-8\">Preemption of common-law remedies. Except as provided in this part, no claim for discharge may arise from tort or express or implied contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">The District Court then determined that this provision of the Wrongful Discharge Act barred Beasley\u2019s contract claims. It concluded that Beasley would be unable to prevail on his complaint under any set of facts because his contract claims were barred as a matter of law and he could prove no damages under the Wrongful Discharge Act. Therefore, the District Court granted summary judgment for Semitool.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Our standard in reviewing a grant of summary judgment is the same as that initially utilized by the trial court. <em>McCracken v. City of Chinook </em>(1990), 242 Mont. 21, 24, 788 P.2d 892, 894. Summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings, depositions, and other documents on file demonstrate that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P. In its order, the District Court assumed the facts alleged by Beasley to be true and concluded, as a matter of law, that the Wrongful Discharge Act barred Beasley\u2019s contract claims. Therefore, we focus our initial inquiry on this legal conclusion. Our review of legal questions is plenary. See <em>Steer, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Revenue </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 470, 475, 803 P.2d 601, 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">Beasley agrees that the Wrongful Discharge Act is the exclusive remedy for claims arising from an employee\u2019s discharge and that no discharge claim thereunder can arise from tort or express or implied contract. He argues, however, that his contract claims arise from Semitool\u2019s failure to abide by its representations during his employment and, therefore, that his breach of contract and covenant claims occurred both prior to, and independent of, his resignation. On that basis, Beasley argues that his independent contract-based claims for damages are not affected or barred by the Wrongful Discharge Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">In interpreting statutes, including the Wrongful Discharge Act, we first look to the plain meaning of the words used. <em>Allison v. Jumping Horse Ranch, Inc. </em>(1992), 255 Mont. 410, _843 P.2d 753, 755, 49 St.Rep. 1039, 1040. To interpret a phrase within the plain meaning rule, the language used must be reasonably and logically interpreted, giving words their usual and ordinary meaning. <em>Allison, </em>843 P.2d at 755. Furthermore, it is the function of the courts to ascertain and declare what in terms or substance is contained in a statute; it is not our function to insert what has been omitted or omit what has been inserted. Section 1-2-101, MCA; <em>City of Bozeman v. Racicot </em>(1992), 253 Mont. 204, 208, 832 P.2d 767, 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">Turning to \u00a7 39-2-913, MCA, we must give effect to the entirety of the statute, which reads: \u201c[e]xcept as provided in this part, no claim for discharge may arise from tort or express or implied contract.\u201d The usual and ordinary meaning of \u201cclaim for discharge\u201d does not encompass any and all claims an employee may have against the employer, but only those claims for damages caused by an asserted wrongful discharge. The District Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 39-2-913, MCA, effectively omits the words \u201cfor discharge\u201d from that statute and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>results in a sweeping preemption of all other claims arising out of the employment relationship. This result disregards the stated purpose of the Wrongful Discharge Act, which is to set forth \u201ccertain rights and remedies with respect to <em>wrongful </em>discharge.\u201d Section 39-2-902, MCA (emphasis added). We conclude that \u00a7 39-2-913, MCA, bars claims for discharge arising from tort or implied or express contract, but does not bar all tort or contract claims merely because they arise in the employment context.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Semitool contends that because Beasley relied on the same set of facts for each cause of action in his complaint, he presented one claim and three alternative theories of recovery, two of which are barred by the Wrongful Discharge Act. It may be true that Beasley\u2019s complaint is not a model of artful pleading and that the manner in which it is structured creates confusion. Rather than specifying which factual allegations support each cause of action individually, Beasley sets forth all of his factual allegations at the beginning of the complaint; he then separately sets out his causes of action, essentially incorporating all of the factual allegations into each count. However, Beasley does aver his contract damages separately from the damages claimed for wrongful discharge. The complaint is sufficient to indicate Beasley\u2019s intent to plead the causes of action as separate and independent claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Further, Rules 8(a) and 18(a), M.R.Civ.R, specifically allow the joinder of alternative claims in a complaint. Mere joinder of alternative or inconsistent claims in a complaint does not require dismissal of an otherwise legitimate claim. <em>See Bozeman Deaconess Foundation v. Cowgill </em>(1963), 143 Mont. 98, 100, 387 P.2d 435, 436. Nor does the Wrongful Discharge Act limit a claimant\u2019s right to plead independent causes of action in conjunction with a claim under the Wrongful Discharge Act. We conclude that Beasley\u2019s reliance in his complaint on the same set of facts for his three causes of action does not require dismissal of the alleged independent contract-based claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Semitool further argues that <em>Dagel v. City of Great Falls </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 224, 819 P.2d 186, relied on by the District Court, requires the dismissal of Beasley\u2019s contract claims. It does not. <em>Dagel </em>did not concern, as does the case before us, the effect of the Wrongful Discharge Act on claims which are separate and independent from the claim of wrongful discharge. A close examination of the allegation in plaintiff\u2019s complaint on which we focused in <em>Dagel </em>illustrates the distinguishing characteristics between <em>Dagel </em>and the present case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>8. By reason of Plaintiff\u2019s satisfactory service and the performance of her duties, her employer\u2019s assurances, policies, and procedures, salary increases, and the absence of criticism of her performance, there was an implied promise by the City that Plaintiff\u2019s employment would not be terminated and she would not be discharged except for just cause. In terminating Plaintiff\u2019s employment as alleged, the City wrongfully, unreasonably and tortiously violated its implied promise and its duty implied in the employment relationship to deal fairly and in good faith with Plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">Bagel, 819 P.2d at 194. Clearly, <em>Bagel </em>sets forth a <em>tort </em>claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing relating to the plaintiff\u2019s discharge. The only conceivable contract-based claim found in the complaint in <em>Bagel </em>is the allegation regarding an \u201cimplied promise by the City that Plaintiff\u2019s employment would not be terminated. ...\u201d Most importantly, however, it is clear both the tort and implied contract claim in <em>Bagel </em>are completely and inextricably intertwined with and based on Dagel\u2019s termination and discharge. <em>Bagel </em>is simply inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">In sum, the Wrongful Discharge Act is the exclusive remedy for claims arising from an employee\u2019s wrongful discharge. Beasley\u2019s contract-based claims, taken as true solely for purposes of the issue before us, arise from Semitool\u2019s breach of his employment contract rather than from an alleged wrongful discharge. We hold that the District Court erred in granting summary judgment for Semitool on Beasley\u2019s contract-based claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Finally, Semitool argues that even if Beasley\u2019s remaining contract-based claims are not barred by the Wrongful Discharge Act, he did not present a prima facie case on those claims and, therefore, summary judgment is appropriate. Furthermore, Semitool argues that Beasley\u2019s allegations of oral representations concerning the employment contract are barred by the statute of frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">It is well settled that this Court will not address on appeal an issue not presented to the district court. <em>Wyman v. BuBray Land Realty </em>(1988), 231 Mont. 294, 299, 752 P.2d 196, 200. Before the District Court, Semitool argued only that the Wrongful Discharge Act barred Beasley\u2019s contract claims and that he had not suffered compensable damages under the Act; it did not present and, accordingly, the District Court did not address the additional issues now presented by Semitool. Having determined that the District Court\u2019s legal conclusion that the Wrongful Discharge Act barred Beasley\u2019s contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>claims was in error, we leave further consideration of the contract-based issues for the District Court on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b286-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, HUNT, HARRISON, McDONOUGH and WEBER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
