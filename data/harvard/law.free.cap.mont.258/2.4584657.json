Appellant Craig Lueck (Lueck) appeals from an order granting summary judgment in favor of respondent United Parcel Service (UPS) and dismissing his retaliatory discharge complaint. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-10\">UPS hired Lueck as a part time delivery driver on April 16, 1984. He joined the Teamsters Union shortly after he was hired. In June 1986, Lueck became a full time driver, driving a tractor-trailer combination on a \u201cswing run\u201d three nights and one day per week. After driving on this schedule for approximately twenty months, Lueck was given a new route in February 1988, from Glendive to Wolf Point on a regular schedule. Another driver, who had more seniority than Lueck, bid for and got Lueck\u2019s swing run.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-11\">UPS discontinued the Glendive-Wolf Point run after only one week, and Lueck went back to part time driving. Around May 1,1988, the driver who had taken Lueck\u2019s swing run took another position with UPS and Lueck took over the swing run again. By then, however, it had been changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-12\">The revised swing run followed a schedule Lueck describes as \u201cbizarre.\u201d It began at 1:00 p.m. on Sunday, when Lueck was scheduled to drive from Glendive to Billings, returning at approximately 2:00 a.m. on Monday morning. On Monday evening at 7:00 he was scheduled to drive to Bismarck, returning at approximately 8:00 on Tuesday morning. On Wednesday he was scheduled to begin driving at 6:45 a.m., returning at approximately 7:00 that evening, and on Thursday, he was scheduled to begin driving at 8:30 p.m., returning at 9:00 on Friday morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-13\">After his first week on this schedule Lueck complained about lack of sleep. He spoke to his supervisors on three separate occasions, indicating that he was having serious problems and was unable to sleep. On June 9,1988, Lueck reported to work at the UPS Center in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>Glendive and put on his uniform in preparation for leaving on the evening\u2019s run. At that point he \u201cflipped out,\u201d as he describes it, and went home without doing the run. His doctor prescribed anti-depressants and admitted him to Glendive Community Hospital for treatment over the weekend of June 11-12, 1988. He was then referred to the Eastern Montana Mental Health Center for outpatient counselling.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">Don LaPlante, a counselor at the mental health center, described Lueck\u2019s \u201cpresenting problem\u201d as a \u201cphysical/psychological adverse stress reaction to working swing shifts as a truck driver for UPS\u201d and recommended continuing anti-depressant medication as well as counselling. Lueck\u2019s family physician, Dr. J.E. Harkness, a Glendive osteopath, saw him in June 1988 and again on July 13, 1988, when he reported that although Lueck appeared to be considerably improved, \u201cit\u2019s unlikely that he will be able to go back into such a swing shift as it was a direct causal effect of his acute hysterical depression episodes.\u201d In fact, Lueck never returned to work for UPS.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">On July 25, 1988, Lueck filed a claim for compensation with the Montana Division of Workers\u2019 Compensation, stating that his \u201cdouble swing\u201d work schedule had disrupted his sleeping and eating patterns, leading to severe physical fatigue, loss of weight, ringing in the ears, dizziness, headaches, nervousness and insomnia. This claim was denied by UPS\u2019s insurer on August 24, 1988, on the grounds that Lueck\u2019s condition was not compensable under the 1987 Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Lueck never appealed the denial of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">Lueck also filed a claim under his credit disability insurance policy in July 1988. Dr. Harkness completed the required attending physician\u2019s statement on July 20, 1988, describing Lueck\u2019s current condition as \u201cacute anxiety \u2014 hysteria, stress reaction, depression\u201d and adding as a \u201cremark\u201d that Lueck \u201ccannot do that type of shift switch work again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">Lueck occasionally played guitar with a band on weekend nights during the spring of 1988, until he became ill in June. In October 1988 he again began playing with a band. On October 6, 1988, he filed a claim for disability benefits under a Teamsters Union insurance policy, but he never received any benefits because he had begun working in the band before the payments began. In connection with Lueck\u2019s Teamsters Union claim, Dr. Harkness completed a physician\u2019s statement indicating that October 11, 1988, was the \u201cdate patient able to return to work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">In November 1988, UPS learned that Lueck had started working again in a band, that he was not receiving benefits through the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>Teamsters Union, and that Dr. Harkness had approved his return to work on October 11, 1988. Joe Kriskovich, a Billings UPS manager, called Lueck at home on December 8,1988, to verify this information and to ask why he had not returned to work for UPS. Lueck explained that Dr. Harkness had said that he could not return to the swing shift schedule. Kriskovich told Lueck that UPS had nothing in its files to document this statement. Later on the same day, Lueck took a copy of the statement Dr. Harkness signed as attending physician on July 20, 1988, indicating that Lueck \u201ccannot do that type of shift switch work again,\u201d to his supervisor in Glendive, for delivery to Kriskovich the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">In the meantime, Kriskovich wrote Lueck a letter, dated December 8, 1988, telling him that he was no longer on authorized leave, that he was scheduled to return to work on Sunday, December 11, 1988, and that his employment at UPS \u201ccould be terminated\u201d if he did not return to work on December 11. Lueck did not communicate with UPS or return to work, and on December 12 he received a mailgram and a telegram from the UPS division manager in Billings, telling him that if he did not return to his regularly scheduled shift on Monday, December 12, his name would be removed from the employment records. Lueck again did not communicate with UPS or return to work, and on December 13 the division manager sent him an official separation letter terminating his UPS employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">Asked during his deposition why he ignored these messages from UPS, Lueck said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-6\">It was just inconceivable to me that they could have received this, that says I cannot return to the shift work and persist in calling me back to shift work without so much as checking with my doctor or having me checked out by a doctor to find out whether or not I am able to go back to work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">On December 8, 1989, Lueck filed a complaint in District Court alleging that UPS had discharged him because he had filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim, in violation of the retaliatory discharge provision in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, \u00a7 39-71-317(1), MCA, and that UPS had intentionally inflicted emotional distress by refusing to alter his work schedule in May 1988. In 1991 Lueck amended his complaint by adding a new cause of action under \u00a7 39-71-317(2), MCA, alleging that UPS had failed to give him preference for a position that became vacant within two years after the date of his injury, as the statute requires. The District Court granted summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>judgment on the amended complaint on May 14, 1992, after oral argument on January 14, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">The issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in granting summary judgment and dismissing Lueck\u2019s retaliatory discharge, preference, and emotional distress claims. We will address each of Lueck\u2019s claims separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">\n<em>The Retaliatory Discharge Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">Lueck contends that the District Court should not have dismissed his retaliatory discharge claim because the record contains sufficient facts from which a jury could infer that he was discharged for filing a workers\u2019 compensation claim. He relies on <em>Lingle v. Norge Division of Magic Chef Inc. </em>(1988), 486 U.S. 399, 108 S.Ct. 1877, 100 L.Ed.2d 410, for the proposition that employer motivation is a factual question and is not appropriate for summary judgment. In <em>Lingle, </em>however, the Supreme Court did not decide whether summary judgment was appropriate in a retaliatory discharge action. Instead, it held that the appellant\u2019s retaliatory discharge remedy under the Illinois Workers\u2019 Compensation Act was not preempted by Section 301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185(a). The relevant holding in <em>Lingle </em>follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-7\">[I]f the resolution of a state-law claim depends upon the meaning of a collective-bargaining agreement, the application of state law ... is pre-empted and federal labor-law principles ... must be employed to resolve the dispute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-8\"><em>Lingle, </em>486 U.S. at 405-406, 108 S.Ct at 1881. In the case before us as well, a decision on the merits of Lueck\u2019s retaliatory discharge claim can be made without reference to the collective bargaining agreement. See <em>Foster v. Albertsons, Inc. </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 117, 835 P.2d 720, 49 St.Rep. 638 (directed verdict based on \u00a7 301 preemption reversed, following <em>Lingle, </em>because appellant\u2019s wrongful discharge claim could be resolved without reference to the collective bargaining agreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-9\">Here, however, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of UPS, not because Lueck\u2019s claims were preempted by \u00a7 301 but because Lueck had failed to exhaust the remedies available to him under the collective bargaining agreement between his union and UPS. To support its argument that summary judgment was properly granted for this reason, UPS relies on <em>Brinkman v. State </em>(1986), 224 Mont. 238, 729 P.2d 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-10\">In <em>Brinkman, </em>we upheld the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for the respondents based on the state-employee appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>lant\u2019s failure to exhaust his contractual remedies under a collective bargaining agreement. To the extent that <em>Brinkman </em>is based on federal preemption under \u00a7 301, our holding there was overruled in <em>Foster, </em>835 P.2d at 725. But to the extent that <em>Brinkman </em>requires an employee subject to a collective bargaining agreement to exhaust his remedies under that agreement, it is not overruled. We hold, as we held in <em>Brinkman, </em>that union employees \u201cmust attempt use of the contract grievance procedure agreed upon by employer and union as the mode of redress,\u201d for a \u201ccontrary rale which would permit an ... employee to completely sidestep available grievance procedures in favor of a lawsuit has little to recommend it.\u201d 729 P.2d at 1305-1306. Accord, <em>Fellows v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>(1990), 224 Mont. 7, 795 P.2d 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">The collective bargaining agreement in effect between UPS and the Teamsters Union in 1988 provides in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-5\">The right to process and settle grievances is wholly, to the exclusion of any other means available, dependent upon the provisions of this Article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-6\">The Union and the Employer agree that there shall be no strike, picketing, lockout, tie-up, or legal proceedings without first using all possible means of a settlement, as provided for in this Supplement ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AP\">The agreement includes specific steps for a discharged employee to follow in settling the grievance over his discharge, and ultimately provides for binding arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">Lueck attempted to meet with the Teamsters Union representative in Billings in September 1988, but the union representative broke their appointment. Concluding that relying on the union was \u201cfruitless,\u201d Lueck did not attempt to contact the union or enlist its support after he was discharged in December 1988. Clearly, he did not attempt to use the grievance procedure in the collective bargaining agreement before he resorted to legal action in 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">Even if Lueck had gone through the prescribed grievance procedure, however, his retaliatory discharge claim would fail for lack of evidence. To prove retaliatory discharge under \u00a7 39-71-317, MCA, Lueck would have to show (1) that he was discharged and (2) that UPS\u2019s motive in discharging him was to retaliate for his filing a claim under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. UPS amply documented its efforts to persuade Lueck to return to work, which were justified by the information it had at the time. From UPS\u2019s point of view, Lueck simply abandoned his job without providing a coherent explanation and without filing a grievance after he was discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Summary judgment is appropriately granted where no genuine issue as to any material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P. The party moving for summary judgment has the initial burden of demonstrating that \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any fact deemed material in light of the substantive principles that entitle the movant to judgment as a matter <em>of law.\u201d Fleming v. Fleming Farms, Inc. </em>(1986), 221 Mont. 237, 241, 717 P.2d 1103, 1105-1106. Once the movant has met this burden, the party opposing the motion must show \u201cby present facts of a substantial nature that a material fact issue does exist. Mere conclusory or speculative statements are insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact.\u201d <em>Mayer Bros. v. Daniel Richard Jewelers, Inc. </em>(1986), 223 Mont. 397, 399, 726 P.2d 815, 817 (citations omitted); see also <em>First Security Bank of Bozeman v. Jones </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 301, 303, 794 P.2d 679, 681, and <em>Kenyon v. Stillwater County </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 142, 835 P.2d 742, 744.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">Lueck has provided no facts to show or even suggest that UPS fired him in December for filing a workers\u2019 compensation claim in July. Lueck must provide facts that support a reasonable inference that UPS\u2019s motive was retaliatory, as mere assertions of a retaliatory motive are not enough to defeat a motion for summary judgment. See <em>Kenyon, </em>835 P.2d at 745; <em>Foster v. Arcata Associates, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1985), 772 F.2d 1453, 1459.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Lueck implies that because UPS knew of Dr. Harkness\u2019 statement on Lueck\u2019s July 1988 credit disability claim form, it could have had no reason other than retaliation for firing him. He does not explain why UPS should have given that statement greater weight than Dr. Harkness\u2019 later statement on Lueck\u2019s October 1988 application for union benefits, which indicated that Lueck was able to work, or why UPS\u2019s failure to give the earlier statement greater weight is evidence that he was fired in retaliation for filing a workers\u2019 compensation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">We hold that the District Court concluded correctly that Lueck did not raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding UPS\u2019s motive for terminating his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">\n<em>The Preference Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">Section 39-71-317(2), MCA, provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-9\">When an injured worker is capable of returning to work within 2 years from the date of injury and has received a medical release to return to work, the worker must be given a preference over other applicants for a comparable position that becomes vacant if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>position is consistent with the worker\u2019s physical condition and vocational abilities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">In his amended complaint, Lueck alleged that when a vacancy occurred in Glendive in March 1989, UPS was required by this statute to prefer him for it. UPS, however, did not notify Lueck that the position was available.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">The District Court dismissed this claim on the grounds that (1) Lueck was not an injured worker under the definition in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, and (2) if he had been injured, he would have had to apply for the preference within two years after the injury. Lueck made no such application.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Under \u00a7 39-71-119, MCA, an \u201cinjury\u201d consists of <em>physical </em>harm to the body and is caused by an <em>accident, </em>which is defined as an \u201cunexpected traumatic incident or unusual strain\u201d that is caused by a specific event on a single day or during a single work shift. It does not include a physical or mental condition arising from emotional or mental stress. The District Court correctly decided that this statutory definition does not include Lueck\u2019s \u201cadverse stress reaction\u201d of June 9,1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">Lueck argues that his condition actually was an \u201coccupational disease,\u201d defined in \u00a7 39-72-102, MCA (1987), as \u201charm, damage or death as set forth in 39-71-119(1) arising out of or contracted in the course and scope of employment and caused by events occurring on more than a single day or work shift.\u201d Although the statute goes on to exclude conditions arising from emotional or mental stress, Lueck argues that his condition was caused by \u201cphysical disruption of his eating and sleeping schedule\u201d and therefore is not excluded. The District Court concluded correctly, however, that the term \u201cinjury\u201d in the preference statute, \u00a7 39-71-317(2), MCA, does not include occupational disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">Lueck contends that the District Court\u2019s reading of the preference statute is too narrow, and that it erred in ignoring the declaration of public policy in \u00a7 39-71-105(3), MCA (1987), which states that \u201can objective of the workers\u2019 compensation system is to return a worker to work as soon as possible after the worker has suffered a work-related injury or disease.\u201d UPS argues that this objective does not apply to an occupational disease, for there is no good reason to return a worker to a job that caused his disease. The District Court agreed, concluding correctly that the preference statute applies only to work-related injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-10\">We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of the law only for correctness. <em>Steer, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Revenue </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 470, 803 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>P.2d 601. Here, we conclude that the District Court correctly interpreted the preference statute as excluding Lueck\u2019s condition, and that UPS therefore was entitled to summary judgment on Lueck\u2019s preference claim, as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">\n<em>The Emotional Distress Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Lueck claims that as a result of UPS\u2019s refusal to alter his work schedule and as a result of his termination, he suffered severe emotional distress. His emotional distress was severe enough that he sought counselling and was on medication for several months.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">This Court has adopted the requirements for recovering damages for infliction of emotional distress that are set out in Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 46 comment j (1965). <em>First Bank (N.A.)-Billings v. Clark </em>(1989), 236 Mont. 195, 206, 771 P.2d 84, 91. The victim must show that the defendant\u2019s tortious conduct resulted either in physical or mental injury or in \u201ca substantial invasion of a legally protected interest,\u201d and that it \u201ccaused a significant impact,\u201d including emotional distress \u201cso severe that no reasonable person could be expected to endure it.\u201d <em>Clark, </em>771 P.2d at 91. Accord, <em>Doohan v. Bigfork School Dist. No. 38 </em>(1991), 247 Mont. 125, 805 P.2d 1354.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">The District Court concluded that UPS\u2019s actions did not approach the level of outrageousness needed to establish a prima facie case of intentional infliction of emotional distress. See <em>Frigon v. Morrison-Maierle, Inc. </em>(1988), 233 Mont. 113, 123, 760 P.2d 57, 64 (the defendant\u2019s conduct must be \u201cso outrageous ... as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">In the past we have characterized emotional distress as an element of damages rather than a distinct cause of action; see <em>Frigon, </em>760 P.2d at 63; <em>Shiplet v. First Security Bank </em>(1988), 234 Mont. 166, 171, 762 P.2d 242, 247. Even if considered only for the purpose of establishing damages, however, Lueck\u2019s deposition testimony demonstrates the absence of any genuine issue of material fact concerning the severity of his alleged emotional distress. UPS was entitled to summary judgment on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<judges id=\"b33-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES GRAY and McDonough concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b33-11\">JUSTICE HUNT</author>\n<p id=\"AQ\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-12\">I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
