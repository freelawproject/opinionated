We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-18\">Appellant Tara Minervino (Minervino) filed a complaint against the University of Montana (University) alleging that the University failed to protect her from an assault which occurred on its campus in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>Missoula, Montana. Filed in the Eighth Judicial District Court, the complaint asserts that venue is proper in Cascade County pursuant to \u00a7 25-2-126(3), MCA, because the University is a political subdivision which is located in Cascade County by virtue of offering classes and maintaining an office at Malmstrom Air Force Base.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-3\">The University moved for change of venue to the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County, relying on \u00a7 25-2-126(1), MCA. The District Court granted the University\u2019s motion. Minervino appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">Did the District Court err in granting the University\u2019s motion to change venue from Cascade County to Lewis and Clark County?</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The District Court determined that the University is the \u201cstate,\u201d rather than a \u201cpolitical subdivision,\u201d for venue purposes. On that basis, it considered the alternative venue locations contained in \u00a7 25-2-126(1), MCA, and concluded that venue was proper only in Missoula County, where the claim arose, or in Lewis and Clark County. The court granted the University\u2019s motion for change of venue to Lewis and Clark County.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Minervino argues first that venue for this action is properly in Cascade County pursuant to \u00a7 25-2-122(1), MCA, which provides that the proper place of trial for a tort action is the county in which the defendant resides at the start of the action. She asserts that because the University has a campus location in Cascade County, venue is proper there. The record reflects that Minervino did not present this argument to the District Court, relying there only on \u00a7 25-2-126(3), MCA, and a waiver estoppel theory. This Court will not consider issues or theories of the case raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Weaver v. Law Firm of Graybill, et al. </em>(1990), 246 Mont. 175, 180, 803 P.2d 1089, 1093.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Minervino\u2019s next contention is that the University is a \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d under \u00a7 25-2-126(3), MCA, rather than the \u201cstate\u201d under \u00a7 25-2-126(1), MCA. Therefore, she argues, since trial of an action against a political subdivision is proper in the county where the claim arose or where the political subdivision is located, the University\u2019s campus in Great Falls establishes proper venue in Cascade County. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Montana\u2019s venue statute for actions against the state or a political subdivision is \u00a7 25-2-126, MCA, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-9\">(1) The proper place of trial for an action against the state is in the county in which the claim arose or in Lewis and Clark County. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>an action brought by a resident of the state, the county of his residence is also a proper place of trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-4\">(3) The proper place of trial for an action against a political subdivision is in the county in which the claim arose or in any county where the political subdivision is located.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Resolution of the issue before us requires definition of the terms \u201cstate\u201d and \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d contained in subsections (1) and (3), respectively, of \u00a7 25-2-126, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">It is true, as Minervino asserts, that the Montana Code Annotated contains more than one statutory definition of each of these terms and that no statute specifically mandates that the definitions contained therein apply to the terms as used in \u00a7 25-2-126, MCA. It also is clear, however, that the venue provisions in subsections (1) and (3) of \u00a7 25-2-126, MCA, previously were codified at Title 2, Chapter 9 of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Prior to 1985, provisions substantively identical to those at issue here were found at \u00a7 2-9-312, MCA. That statute was amended (in nonsubstantive ways) and recodified as an integral part of Title 25, Chapter 2, part 1 pursuant to Section 18(2) of Chapter 432, Montana Session Laws, 1985. It was renumbered as \u00a7 25-2-126(1) and (3), MCA, by the Code Commissioner. Our function is to effectuate the intent of the legislature. <em>State ex rel. Roberts v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n </em>(1990), 242 Mont. 242, 246, 790 P.2d 489, 492. This clear legislative history mandates a conclusion that the definitions contained in Title 2, Chapter 9, apply to the terms used in \u00a7 25-2-126, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">Section 2-9-101(7), MCA, defines \u201cstate\u201d as \u201cthe state of Montana or any office, department, agency, authority, commission, board, institution, hospital, college, university, or other instrumentality thereof.\u201d \u201cPolitical subdivision\u201d is defined in \u00a7 2-9-101(5), MCA, to mean \u201cany county, city, municipal corporation, school district; special improvement district or taxing district, or any other political subdivision or public corporation.\u201d Applying these definitions to the issue before us, it is unequivocal that the University is the \u201cstate\u201d for \u00a7 25-2-126, MCA, purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">Minervino asserts that the University argued in <em>Kendall v. State </em>(1988), 231 Mont. 316, 752 P.2d 1091, that it is not the \u201cstate\u201d for venue purposes. As a result, she argues that the University has waived its right to contest venue on the basis that it <em>is </em>the \u201cstate,\u201d or that it is estopped from arguing contrary to its position in <em>Kendall.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Minervino cites to no authority in support of her waiver or estoppel theory regarding venue. In addition, estoppel theories \u2014 both judicial and equitable \u2014 rest on representations of facts. <em>See DeMers v. Roncor, Inc. </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 176, 814 P.2d 999; <em>Dagel v. City of Great Falls </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 224, 819 P.2d 186. Venue is not a question of fact; it is a question of law involving the application of venue statutes to pleaded facts. We conclude that the University is not precluded from asserting that it is the \u201cstate\u201d for venue purposes in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">Having concluded that the University is the \u201cstate\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 25-2-126(1), MCA, it remains only to apply that statute to the facts before us. Section 25-2-126(1), MCA, provides that venue for actions against the state \u2014 here, the University \u2014 is proper in one of three counties: 1) where the claim arose; 2) Lewis and Clark County; or 3) the county of plaintiff\u2019s residence if plaintiff is a Montana resident. Here, Minervino\u2019s claim did not arise in Cascade County; nor does she assert that she is or was a resident of Cascade County at any relevant time. Therefore, Cascade County is not an appropriate venue for this action under \u00a7 25-2-126, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">When an action is filed in an improper venue, \u201ca defendant may move for a change of place of trial to a designated county.\u201d Section 25-2-114, MCA. Pursuant to \u00a7 25-2-126(1), MCA, proper venues for Minervino\u2019s action are Missoula County, where the claim arose, or Lewis and Clark County. The University moved for change of venue to Lewis and Clark County, a proper venue under the statute. We hold that the District Court did not err in granting the University\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<judges id=\"b519-7\">JUSTICES HARRISON, HUNT, TRIEWEILER and WEBER.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
