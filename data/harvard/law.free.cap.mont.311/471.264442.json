He alleged that the defendants, including Julie Macek and Bill Bellusci, concealed exculpatory information from him during a prior criminal proceeding in violation of his right to due process. The Defendant Julie Macek and Defendants Bill Bellusci and the City of Great Falls (\u201cthe City\u201d) filed two separate motions for summary judgment. After strikingcertain exhibits filed by Hiebert in opposition to the motions, the motions were granted. Hiebert appeals from the District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of Defendants Bellusci and the City. We affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">\u00b62 There are two issues presented on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court correctly strike the exhibits submitted by</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">the plaintiff in opposition to summary judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err when it entered summary judgment as a matter of law in favor of Defendants Bellusci and the City?</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A_DQ\">\n<em>A. Hiebert\u2019s Prior Criminal Case.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">\u00b65 On July 27, 1996, Great Falls Police Officers Otto, Cameron and Cathel were dispatched to a disturbance at an apartment complex. The officers arrived at the complex and spoke with then-14-year-old Alaina Coles and her mother Sherry Coles, who told the officers that Curt Hiebert, a neighbor in the complex, assaulted Alaina.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">\u00b66 Otto and Cameron spoke with Alaina and Alaina told the officers that Hiebert, a neighbor and acquaintance of Sherry and Alaina, told Alaina and her cousin Darcie Bourne that he would take them to eat at Burger King sometime later that evening. Later that evening, Alaina and Darcie returned to Hiebert\u2019s apartment to take him up on his offer. Hiebert told Alaina that he needed to speak with her alone inside. Alaina went inside and sat down, and shortly after, the alleged assault occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">\u00b67 Cameron\u2019s report described the alleged physical contact and sexual assault as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-12\">Alaina also stated that Curt started talking to her sexually, saying things like \u201cI\u2019ve always liked the way you look\u201d. Alaina stated that <em>Curt then started rubbing her on the thighs and arms and forced her on to the bed. </em>Alaina stated that Curt had her by the arms and was on top of her saying \u201cEverything will be alright.\u201d Alaina stated that Curt then got off the bed and on his knees on the floor and had his head between her legs area. Alaina stated she tried to convince Curt that she did not want to have sex with him and that she had another boyfriend. <em>Curt continued to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number><em>rub her inner thigh and legs and then allowed her up at which time he hugged her and let her go. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">\u00b68 Otto\u2019s report describes the alleged physical contact in a slightly different, but consistent manner. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-5\">Alaina said they talked for a few minutes [and] then <em>Curt started rubbing her arm and then her thigh. </em>Alaina told us Curt never said what he wanted to do, but she felt uncomfortable and knew he was intending to try and come on to her. Alaina said Curt then grabbed her arms and knelt in front of her, trying to push her on her back. Alaina told him no several times and Curt just mimicked what she said. Finally, Curt let her up and Alaina said she moved near the door. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">\u00b69 After speaking with Alaina, Otto and Cameron spoke with Hiebert, who denied that an assault occurred. Police concluded after their initial investigation and interview with Alaina that there was probable cause to arrest Hiebert for felony sexual assault. Hiebert was arrested, and bail was set in the amount of $25,000, but Hiebert remained in jail until the charges were dismissed over , five months later on January 9, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">\u00b610 After the arrest, Detective Bill Bellusci interviewed Alaina on July 31,1996, to obtain a statement, and recorded the interview. In the transcript of the interview, Alaina described the alleged assault similarly to the previous reports:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-8\">\u201c[H]e told me to come sit next to hi[m], so I sat next to hi[m], about a foot away from him, I guess, and-then he started hugging on me and saying how much he couldn\u2019t resist me and everything and it kindda-I just wanted to get pretty much out of there and-so I said, well, we better go now and everything and he kept saying no, just a couple more minutes and then he knelt down in front of me and he kept saying \u2018sit down, sit down,\u2019 and I was already sitting down and he was trying to push me back and I was trying to stay up and finally I kept saying no, no, no, I can\u2019t do this .... [F]inally he let me up and he said, well, are you going to give me a hug-or something like that... so I gave him a hug \u2018cause I wanted to leave and then I walked out. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">In the interview with Bellusci, Alaina had the following to say about where she was touched:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-10\">[Q] Okay. Did he touch you anywhere?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-11\">[A] On my leg and on my arm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-12\">[Q] What did he touch you with?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-13\">[A] Just his hands.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>[Q] So he didn\u2019t touch your breast or your crotch area?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-4\">[A] No -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-5\">[Q] Did you ever tell anybody he had tried to do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">[A] Yeah, when I left, I told Alisha.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">[Q] What did you tell her-that he tried to do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-8\">[A] I said that he pinched me in there. And then I told her the rest of the story later but I was kindda mad.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-9\">[Q] You believe that he was trying to advance on you sexually? [A] yeah because he kept saying that it was hard to resist me and he told me before when he was drunk that he loved me and - he kept saying that he couldn\u2019t do anything with me because I was underage, I guess, so - and it would be statutory rape but - I wasn\u2019t going to do anything anyway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-10\">[Q] When he touched you on his leg, where did he touch you on the leg[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-11\">[A] On the thigh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-12\">[Q] Did you stop him from doing that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-13\">[A] How could I?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-14\">[Q] But I mean did you make an attempt to stop him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-15\">[A] Yeah, I kept saying don\u2019t - don\u2019t - just leave me alone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-16\">\u00b611 Bellusci completed the report and attached the transcript of the interview on August 7,1996, one day after Macek filed formal charges against Hiebert. In his deposition, Bellusci stated that he submitted the report to his supervisor, who signed it, but according to Macek\u2019s deposition, a copy of the report was not then sent to her office.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-17\">\u00b612 On September 19,1996, the clerk for the public defender made a discovery request from the prosecutor\u2019s office, which sought exculpatory material and witness lists. On October 8,1996, the District Court issued an Omnibus Hearing Order, which required similar disclosures from the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-18\">\u00b613 In October 1996, Eric Olson, Hiebert\u2019s defense attorney, hired a private defense investigator, Robert Hoxter, to interview Alaina about the alleged sexual assault. Hoxter interviewed Alaina on October 28, 1996, and during the interview Alaina described the physical contact during the alleged sexual assault differently than previous statements. Hoxter summarized Alaina\u2019s statements as follows in an affidavit prepared for Hiebert\u2019s defense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-19\">8. ... Jane said he began rubbing her leg. (At that point Jane pointed to the outside of her thigh to show me where Hiebert had touched her).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-20\">12.1 asked Jane if Hiebert ever touched any of her private parts. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Jane said, \u201cNo.\u201d She was asked to describe how she was sitting on the bed. She displayed a closed knee, upright position. I asked Jane if she ever parted her knees before or during the time Hiebert knelt in front of her. She said, \u201cNo.\u201d I demonstrated with my knees and Jane denied Hiebert ever opened or forced open her knees. She was again asked if he touched any of her private parts and she said, \u201cNo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">\u00b614 In late October, Olson learned from Bellusci of his interview with Alaina and requested a copy of the report and interview from Macek on November 4,1996. After two production requests and a court order, Olson received a copy of the transcript in late November.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">\u00b615 On November 26,1996, Hiebert moved to dismiss the charges for lack of probable cause. In support of his motion he submitted an affidavit from Hoxter and portions of the Hoxter interview and the Bellusci interview transcripts. Two days before the hearing for the motion to dismiss, on January 8, 1997, Macek moved to dismiss the charges, stating that \u201calthough probable cause existed to charge the defendant when it was charged, the victim later recanted and there is no longer probable cause to support the charges.\u201d The motion was granted January 9, 1997, and Hiebert was released from jail after approximately 166 days in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">\n<em>B. Hiebert\u2019s Current Civil Case.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">\u00b616 On June 9,1998, Hiebert filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against several defendants, including Bellusci and the City. Bellusci and the City moved for summary judgment on April 21,1999. Hiebert filed a brief opposing the motions for summary judgment on July 29,1999, and attached 24 exhibits with a personal affidavit of Jeff Lynch, Hiebert\u2019s attorney, swearing that the exhibits were accurate copies of items received during discovery and his own investigation. \u00b617 The 24 exhibits included Otto\u2019s and Cameron\u2019s police reports, documents filed in the criminal proceeding, an affidavit from Eric Olson regarding discovery materials he received from Macek, and other miscellaneous papers. Bellusci\u2019s police report and interview transcript were attached as Exhibit P. At least 6 of the 24 exhibits Hiebert attached were objected to by Bellusci and the City. They moved that they be stricken. These exhibits are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-8\">Exhibit M: A letter from Olson to Hoxter requesting that Hoxter interview Alaina;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-9\">Exhibit N: An unsigned \u201cattorney memorandum\u201d from Hoxter to Olson recounting the substance of his interview with Alaina;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVA\">Exhibit O: A transcript of Hoxter\u2019s interview with Alaina;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AW5_\">Exhibit R: A November 4, 1996, letter from Olson to Macek <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>requesting the Bellusci interview tape/transcript;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-4\">Exhibit T: An unsigned November 13,1996, letter from paralegal Sara Whirry to Bellusci requesting a copy of the interview tape; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-5\">Exhibit U: The Motion to Dismiss filed in Hiebert\u2019s criminal case by Olson.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">\u00b618 On October 28, 1999, Defendant Julie Macek also moved for summary judgment, which Hiebert opposed by written brief on December 14, 1999. She attached as an additional exhibit the deposition of Bellusci. The District Court judge consolidated the motions for summary judgment and to strike the exhibits and heard oral arguments on each matter. On December 12, 2000, the court granted the motion to strike the exhibits and gr\u00e1nted summary judgment in favor of Defendants Macek, the City, and Bellusci.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">\u00b619 We review a district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment de novo, and apply the same criteria considered by the district court, based on Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P. <em>State ex rel. Smartt v. Commission, </em>2002 MT 148, \u00b6 9, 310 Mont. 295, \u00b6 9, 50 P.3d 150, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">\u00b620 To prevail by summary judgment, the moving party must demonstrate an absence of any genuine issues of material fact and must also demonstrate that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Hadford v. Credit Bureau of Havre, Inc., </em>1998 MT 179, \u00b6 14, 289 Mont. 529, \u00b6 14, 962 P.2d 1198, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">\u00b621 If the moving party satisfies its burden of proof, the non-moving party must provide \u201cmaterial and substantial evidence, rather than mere conclusory or speculative statements, to raise a genuine issue of material fact.\u201d <em>Stuart v. First Sec. Bank, </em>2000 MT 309, \u00b6 16,302 Mont. 431, \u00b6 16, 15 P.3d 1198, \u00b6 16. \u201c[T]he non-moving party must set forth <em>specific facts </em>and cannot simply rely upon their pleadings, nor upon speculative, fanciful, or conclusory statements.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Hale </em>(1990), 246 Mont. 64, 67, 802 P.2d 1255, 1257. If the non-moving party fails to raise a genuine issue of material fact, the court must then determine whether summary judgment is appropriate as a matter of law based on the presented facts. <em>Scott v. Robson </em>(1979), 182 Mont. 528, 535, 597 P.2d 1150, 1154.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">\u00b622 We review a District Court\u2019s admission or exclusion of evidence for an abuse of discretion. <em>Busta v. Columbus Hosp. Corp. </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 342, 353, 916 P.2d 122, 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-12\">\u00b623 Generally, whether evidence is exculpatory evidence is a mixed question of law and fact. <em>Bowen v. Maynard </em>(10th Cir. 1986), 799 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>593, 610. However, when considering an alleged denial of due process, determining whether evidence is material is a question of law. <em>Sivak v. State </em>(Idaho 2000), 8 P.3d 636, 641.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">\u00b624 Did the District Court correctly strike the exhibits submitted by the plaintiff in opposition to summary judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">\u00b625 Before reaching the merits of this issue we must first reconcile the parties\u2019 conflicting claims regarding which of the 24 submitted exhibits were stricken. Hiebert contends that the district court improperly struck all of the exhibits, including, most importantly, the \u201cBellusci transcript.\u201d Hiebert concludes that the court excluded the Bellusci transcript, based in part on the following quote from the court order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APi\">Without Plaintiffs Exhibits M, N, O, R, T and U available for consideration by the Court, the Court concludes that there are no genuine issues of material fact presented and Defendants Bellusci\u2019s and the City\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment is well taken. <em>Without Alaina\u2019s statements available for consideration by the Court </em>in the context of this motion, it can not be concluded that any exclupatory [sic] evidence was withheld by these Defendants. If no exculpatory evidence was withheld, there is no claim against these Defendants .... [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Hiebert interprets the court\u2019s reference to \u201cAlaina\u2019s statements\u201d to mean that the court excluded all of Alaina\u2019s statements, including the one made to Bellusci.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">\u00b626 Bellusci and the City argue that Hiebert is confused and that they only objected to 6 of the 24 exhibits and that the district court properly excluded those 6 exhibits (Exhibits M, N, O, R, T, and U). Their brief notes that \u201cHiebert appears to misunderstand which documents the District Court disregarded. For example, he contends that the Bellusci interview should have been considered. However, the City did not object to, nor did the court disregard that document.\u201d (Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">\u00b627 It appears from the plain language of the District Court\u2019s order that only Exhibits M, N, O, R, T and U were stricken. We therefore limit our consideration to those exhibits. When considering these exhibits, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-10\">Defendants have objected that the exhibits, and specifically Exhibits M, N, O, R, T, and U should be stricken as hearsay .... The Plaintiff has responded that attorney Lynch\u2019s affidavit merely provides authenticity for the statements which are attached as exhibits. Upon review by the Court, it is clear that Plaintiff relies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>on the statements attached as exhibits to Lynch\u2019s affidavit to raise genuine issues of material fact. The specific statements relied on by the Plaintff [sic] are hearsay and are not admissible into evidence in the form that they are presented to the Court. As such the Court can not consider the facts contained in those hearsay statements for purposes of deciding the Motion for Summary Judgement. The City\u2019s and Bellusci\u2019s Motion to Strike is well taken. Plaintiffs have simply failed to get sworn statements directly from the witnesses they rely on.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">\u00b628 Hiebert contends that the District Court should have considered the six exhibits because Bellusci and the City introduced the same exhibits \u201cinto the record\u201d through Macek\u2019s deposition and that the District Court relied on the excluded documents in other portions of its summary judgment order. Hiebert also contends that the court erred by faffing to take judicial notice of the exhibits that were filed or pled in the prior criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">\u00b629  It is well-settled that during summary judgment proceedings, the parties must limit affidavits to evidence that would be otherwise admissible pursuant to the rules of evidence. Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P. Rule 56(e), M.R.Civ.P., provides four requirements for supporting affidavits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AL2\">Supporting and opposing affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein. Sworn or certified copies of all papers or parts thereof referred to in an affidavit shall be attached thereto or served therewith.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">\u00b630 Our past decisions have consistently applied the first admissibility requirement in Rule 56(e) that affidavits must be based upon \u201cpersonal knowledge,\u201d defined as: \u201c[kjnowledge gained through firsthand observation or experience, as distinguished from a belief based on what someone else has said.\u201d BLACK\u2019S Law DICTIONARY 877 (7th ed. 1999). We have previously held that \u201can attorney\u2019s affidavit \u2018is admissible only to prove facts that are within his personal knowledge and as to which he is competent to testify; an affidavit stating what the attorney believes or intends to prove at trial will be disregarded.\u2019 \u201d <em>Morales v. Tuomi </em>(1985), 214 Mont. 419, 424-25, 693 P.2d 532, 535 (quoting 10A Wright, Miller and Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2738 (1983)). We have also held that it is appropriate for a district court to strike statements in affidavits made without personal knowledge and based upon hearsay evidence. <em>Eberl v. Scofield </em>(1990), 244 Mont. 515, 519, 798 P.2d 536, 538; <em>see also Thornton v. Songstad </em>(1994), 263 Mont. 390, 398, 868 P.2d 633, 638 (\u201cclearly hearsay\u201d statements are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>inadmissible for summary judgment proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">\u00b631 We have extended the personal knowledge requirement to attached exhibits as well. <em>Disler v. Ford Motor Credit Co., </em>2000 MT 304, 302 Mont. 391, 15 P.3d 864. In <em>Disler, </em>we considered whether the district court erred when it excluded three loan documents attached to a brief opposing summary judgment that did not include any supporting affidavit or sworn discovery response. We excluded the three documents because \u201cwithout an affidavit or sworn discovery response of a Ford employee with personal knowledge of the genuineness, relevance and contents of the documents, the attachments to Ford\u2019s brief were little more than inadmissible hearsay.\u201d <em>Disler, </em>\u00b6 11, (citing <em>Eberl, </em>244 Mont, at 519, 798 P.2d at 538; <em>Thornton, </em>263 Mont, at 398, 868 P.2d at 638).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">\u00b632  Based on Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P., and our prior decisions, we conclude that the six challenged exhibits were properly stricken by the District Court because they did not set forth facts within the affiants\u2019 personal knowledge, nor was a foundation laid for their consideration based on any exception to the rule excluding hearsay evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">\u00b633 Hiebert contends that the exhibits should nevertheless be considered because the defendants made the exhibits part of the record through Macek\u2019s deposition testimony. However, the fact that exhibits are referred to during a deposition does not make them admissible. Macek did not claim any personal knowledge of the six exhibits, nor swear to their authenticity. Her testimony did not establish any foundation for admission of the exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">\u00b634  Finally, Hiebert contends that the District Court erred when it did not take judicial notice of Exhibit U pursuant to Rule 202, M.R.Evid. Exhibit U, a motion to dismiss in a prior criminal proceeding, is not a form of \u201claw\u201d cognizable pursuant to Rule 202(b)(l)-(11), M.R.Evid. In addition, notice of the \u201claw\u201d in the brief would have been unhelpful for summary judgment proceedings. Only judicial notice of the \u201cfacts\u201d in the brief would have been helpful. Hiebert does not, and could not, contend that judicial notice of the \u201cfacts\u201d asserted in Exhibit U was permissible. <em>See </em>Rule 201(b), M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">\u00b635 Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s exclusion of Plaintiff s Exhibits M, N, O, R, T, and U as inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">\u00b636 Did the District Court err when it entered summary judgment as a matter of law in favor of Defendants Bellusci and the City?</p>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">\u00b637 The District Court awarded summary judgment to Bellusci and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>the City for the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-4\">Without Plaintiffs Exhibits M, N, O, R, T and U available for consideration by the Court, the Court concludes that there are no genuine issues of material fact presented and Defendants Bellusci\u2019s and the City\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment is well taken. Without Alaina\u2019s statements available for consideration by the Court in the context of this motion, it can not be concluded that any exclupatory [sic] evidence was withheld by these Defendants. If no exculpatory evidence was withheld, there is no claim against these Defendants and they are entitled to dismissal of the claims against them as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">\u00b638 Hiebert claims that the Bellusci transcript creates a genuine issue of material fact while Bellusci and the City contend that it does not. Specifically, Bellusci and the City contend that Hiebert\u2019s due process claim depends entirely upon his contention that the Bellusci transcript is exculpatory and that Bellusci withheld the transcript from the prosecutor. They claim that Alaina\u2019s statements to Bellusci were neither exculpatory nor materially inconsistent with earlier statements given to other officers and that, therefore, failure to produce it did not violate due process, even if Alaina later told an inconsistent story to Hoxter.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">\u00b639  When considering the withholding of exculpatory evidence from the defense, we have recognized the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s holding that suppression of evidence by the prosecution \u201cviolates due process when the evidence is material to either guilt or punishment, regardless of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d <em>State v. Thompson, </em>2001 MT 119, \u00b6 31, 305 Mont. 342, \u00b6 31, 28 P.3d 1068, \u00b6 31 (citing <em>Brady v. Maryland </em>(1963), 373 U.S. 83, 86, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 1196-99, 10 L.Ed.2d 215). We have held that to show a <em>Brady </em>violation of a defendant\u2019s right of due process, three elements must be satisfied: \u201c(1) the evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused, either because it has exculpatory or impeachment value; (2) the evidence was willfully or inadvertently suppressed by the State; and (3) the suppression resulted in prejudice to the accused.\u201d <em>Kills on Top v. State, </em>2000 MT 340, \u00b6 23, 303 Mont. 164, \u00b6 23, 15 P.3d 422, \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">\u00b640 Generally, evidence favorable to the defendant is exculpatory, and the prosecution has a duty to disclose all favorable information to the defense. <em>Kills on Top, </em>\u00b6 23. To determine the exculpatory nature of the Bellusci statement, we need to consider the sexual assault statute pursuant to which he was charged. It provides: \u201c[a] person who knowingly subjects another person to <em>any sexual contact </em>without consent commits the offense of sexual assault.\u201d Section 45-5-502, MCA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>(emphasis added). \u201cSexual contact\u201d is defined as \u201ctouching of the <em>sexual or other intimate parts </em>of the person of another, directly or through clothing, in order to knowingly or purposely: (a) cause bodily injury to or humiliate, harass, or degrade another; or (b) arouse or gratify the sexual response or desire of either party.\u201d Section 45-2-101(66), MCA (emphasis added). We have noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-4\">[T]he policy behind our sexual assault statute is to criminalize and punish sexual or intimate impositions that do not involve penetration; but which express a societal concern for such impositions because they provoke outrage, disgust or shame in the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\">Use of the terms \u201csexual or other intimate parts\u201d indicates that the legislature did not intend to restrict the crime to a touching of the genitalia of either sex or a touching of a female\u2019s breast, but instead intended to give the terms <em>a broader application </em>....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-6\"><em>State v. Weese </em>(1980), 189 Mont. 464, 467-68, 616 P.2d 371, 373-74 (emphasis added). In <em>Weese, </em>we held that rubbing the belly and chest of a 9-year-old girl fits within the statutory definition. Similarly, we looked favorably upon interpretations from other jurisdictions which focus on the outrage, disgust or shame engendered in the victim, and separately held that the buttocks, hips, and chest of a 7-year-old girl fit within the definition of \u201cintimate parts.\u201d <em>Weese, </em>189 Mont, at 468, 616 P.2d at 374 (citing <em>Matter of David M. </em>(N.Y. 1978), 93 Misc.2d 545, 548; <em>Matter of Welfare of Adams </em>(Wash. 1979), 601 P.2d 995; <em>State v. Turner </em>(Or. 1978), 575 P.2d 1007).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">\u00b641 We conclude that Alaina\u2019s statements to Bellusci that Hiebert touched her on the thigh but that Hiebert did not touch her breasts or \u201ccrotch area\u201d were neither exculpatory nor a basis for impeachment in the complete context of her statement. It is clear from our application of the sexual assault statutes that it was not necessary to prove physical contact with breasts or genitalia (through clothing or otherwise). It is also clear from Otto\u2019s and Cameron\u2019s police reports that there was no indication or allegation that Hiebert touched Alaina\u2019s breasts or genitalia. The reports consistently indicated that Hiebert \u201crub[bed] her on the thighs and arms\u201d and \u201crub[bed] her inner thigh and legs,\u201d and that Hiebert \u201crub[bed] her arm and then her thigh.\u201d Alaina\u2019s statement to Bellusci that Hiebert touched her \u201con the thigh\u201d is not inconsistent with her statements to Otto and Cameron. Nor, considering the context in which it was reported and without more, was it exculpatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">\u00b642 We need not determine, however, whether contact with \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>thigh\u201d alone is sufficient to prove sexual assault because, in order to prove that he was denied due process, it was incumbent on Hiebert to demonstrate that the \u201cexculpatory\u201d evidence he claims to have been denied would have been material. \u201c[E]vidence is material <em>if there is a reasonable probability that the result would have been different </em>had the evidence been disclosed to the defense.\u201d <em>Kills on Top, </em>\u00b6 23 (emphasis added). Cumulative evidence is not considered material evidence. <em>See U.S. v. Marashi </em>(9th Cir. 1990), 913 F.2d 724, 732-733 (merely cumulative impeachment evidence does not satisfy the <em>Brady </em>materiality requirement). The materiality of evidence is a question of law. <em>Sivak, </em>8 P.3d at 641.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">\u00b643 Bellusci and the City have offered evidence that, even if facially exculpatory, the Bellusci statement was not material. They demonstrated that Bellusci\u2019s report was consistent with Otto\u2019s and Cameron\u2019s reports. They provided an affidavit by Otto who stated that when he asked Alaina to demonstrate where Hiebert touched her, \u201cShe responded by placing both hands on her upper, inner thighs.\u201d Alaina\u2019s statement to Bellusci that Hiebert touched her \u201con the thigh\u201d was consistent with her responses to Officers Otto and Cameron. Furthermore, Julie Macek, the prosecuting attorney, stated during her deposition that while she considered the Bellusci transcript when reducing and dropping the charges against Hiebert, it was the Hoxter interview that most influenced her decision to reduce or drop the charges against Hiebert. She stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-5\">I had a situation where in reviewing the file it appeared as though exactly what this girl said had occurred, which was a sexual assault had happened. However, I had to prove that beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury. I knew that when it comes to these types of cases if you have more than one version of the events then you have a potential problem in front of a jury because what happens is a good defense attorney gets a little kid on the stand and beats them over the head each time that they told the story even one iota different. In this case we had not just her initial statement to the officers, we had her tape recorded statement to Detective Bellusci, and more disturbing we had the statement to Mr. Hoxter. To me that was the more disturbing of the three statements. Not Bellusci. Bellusci was not the recantation I am talking about here. I am talking when she gets interviewed by Hoxter is when I think and believe we had a recantation problem.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfqU\">In addition, Macek stated that, due to her case load at that time, she had not had the opportunity to review Hiebert\u2019s file until Hiebert filed a motion to dismiss the charges. All of this evidence suggests that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Bellusci transcript would not have changed whether charges against Hiebert were dismissed or when Hiebert was released from jail. The Bellusci statement contained statements consistent with those provided to Otto and Cameron, provided no new evidence for the defense, and was cumulative. Otto\u2019s and Cameron\u2019s reports were sufficient to induce Olson to hire an investigator to assess the veracity of Alaina\u2019s statements. That person\u2019s investigation led to the critical exculpatory statements by Alaina. Bellusci\u2019s earlier disclosure of the statement taken by him would not have changed the outcome or timing of Hiebert\u2019s release from jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">\u00b644 While the Defendants have produced sufficient evidence that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law, Hiebert has not presented substantial evidence sufficient to create an issue of fact and thereby avoid summary judgment. Hiebert alleges that the Bellusci statement is exculpatory, yet fails to provide any evidence, other than speculation, that earlier disclosure would have led Macek to dismiss charges earlier. There is little doubt that Macek dropped the charges against Hiebert in light of the Hoxter interview and transcript. Accordingly, Hiebert cannot succeed, as a matter of law, based on the theory that Bellusci negligently suppressed exculpatory evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">\u00b645 [5] We have held that an \u201cintentional suppression of exculpatory evidence by the prosecution is a <em>per se </em>violation of due process.\u201d <em>State v. Baker, </em>2000 MT 235, \u00b6 15, 301 Mont. 323, \u00b6 15, 8 P.3d 817, \u00b6 15 (citing <em>State v. Brown, </em>1999 MT 133, \u00b6 24, 294 Mont. 509, \u00b6 24, 982 P.2d 468, \u00b6 24). However, Hiebert has similarly failed to demonstrate that Bellusci withheld the transcript intentionally. Bellusci stated in his deposition that he had submitted a copy of the report to his supervisor, and the report shows the supervisor\u2019s signature. Similarly, Bellusci testified that he had checked off the box on the police report that requests a copy be sent to the prosecutor. Hiebert has provided no evidence (other than speculative claims that Bellusci lied in his deposition and reports) to demonstrate that Bellusci intentionally withheld this information from the prosecution and/or defense. Speculation is insufficient to avoid summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">\u00b646 For these reasons we affirm the District Court\u2019s award of summary judgment in favor of Defendants Bellusci and the City.</p>\n<judges id=\"b504-7\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, NELSON, REGNIER and COTTER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
