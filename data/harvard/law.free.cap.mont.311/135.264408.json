Ray appeals from a Judgment of the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County. Gayle B. Nansel, Paul G. Bromenshenk, Darlene F. Bromenshenk, the Zimmerman Family Limited Partnership and John Does 1 through 10 (collectively, the \u201cDefendants\u201d) cross-appeal from the District Court\u2019s Memorandum and Order. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">\u00b62 The following issues are dispositive of this appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in concluding that Ray had failed to prove a prescriptive easement over the Bromenshenk Property?</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in concluding that Ray had failed to prove a prescriptive easement over the Zimmerman Property?</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court err in reducing the award of the Defendant\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees?</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">\u00b66 4. Did the District Court err in disallowing costs claimed by the Defendants?</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b158-12\">\u00b67 This dispute revolves around Ray\u2019s use of a wastewater ditch (the \u2018Wastewater Ditch\u201d) over the Defendants\u2019 properties in Yellowstone County, Montana. In November 1988, Ray acquired land (the \u201cRay Property\u201d) from William Deines and William Deines, Jr. (collectively, the \u201cDeines\u201d). The Deines still own property (the \u201cDeines Property\u201d) that abuts the southern boundary of the Ray Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-13\">\u00b68 The Zimmerman Family Limited Partnership owns property (the \u201cZimmerman Property\u2019) that is roughly to the southeast of the Ray Property. Their property borders the eastern edge of the Deines Property. They leased this property to John Zimmerman during the time encompassed by this dispute. Gayle B. Nansel, Paul G. Bromenshenk and Darlene Bromenshenk collectively own property (the \u201cBromenshenk Property\u201d) to the east of and adjacent to the Zimmerman Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-14\">\u00b69 Before Ray acquired his property, the Deines grew crops on the Ray Property from 1975 until approximately 1989. When irrigating these crops, the Deines created wastewater, which drained along the Wastewater Ditch. The ditch originated on the Ray Property, traveled along the northern edge of the Deines Property and then crossed the Zimmerman and Bromenshenk properties. It finally drained into a larger irrigation ditch on the Bromenshenk Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>\u00b610 Each year, after the Deines were finished irrigating, John Zimmerman would close the Wastewater Ditch during the first or second week of August. He would do this by plowing over the ditch on the Zimmerman Property. The following spring, the Deines would re-pull the ditch along substantially the same route. The Bromenshenks did not close the ditch across their property, so the Deines did not need to re-pull it each year. This arrangement was largely a matter of neighborly accommodation.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">\u00b611 When Ray began farming and irrigating his land, however, the relationship between John Zimmerman and Ray quickly eroded. Apparently John Zimmerman opened the Wastewater Ditch in 1990 and possibly again in 1991. In 1992, Ray pulled the Wastewater Ditch across the Zimmerman Property. To prevent a conflict with John Zimmerman, Ray asked an on-duty Yellowstone County Sheriff Deputy to accompany him while he pulled the ditch.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">\u00b612 On May 4, 1993, the Defendants\u2019 attorney sent Ray a letter revoking permission to use the Wastewater Ditch across the Zimmerman Property. Despite the letter, Gary Zemlicka, who was working at the direction of Ray, pulled the Wastewater Ditch across the Zimmerman Property in 1993. Ray ran wastewater across the ditch at least twice that year. Zemlicka also pulled the Wastewater Ditch across the Zimmerman Property in 1994 and 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">\u00b613 During this time, John Zimmerman confronted Zemlicka about pulling the Wastewater Ditch and informed him that Ray did not have permission to pull the ditch. Zemlicka occasionally discovered that someone had obstructed the culvert leading onto the Zimmerman Property. Each time Zemlicka discovered an obstruction, he or Ray would remove the obstruction and continue running water through the ditch.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">\u00b614 Ray again pulled the Wastewater Ditch across the Zimmerman Property in 1996. That August, John Zimmerman plugged the culvert leading onto the Zimmerman Property. As a result, Ray again called a Yellowstone County Deputy Sheriff. A deputy responded, but refused to intervene. He informed Ray and John Zimmerman that their dispute was a civil matter and that they should contact their attorneys. \u00b615 In September, Ray again attempted to flow water through the Wastewater Ditch. Because of the obstruction, however, the water flooded the Zimmerman Property. Upon seeing this, Paul Bromenshenk pulled a new ditch south into another wastewater ditch to avoid further flooding.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">\u00b616 On January 20, 2000, Ray sued the Defendants to quiet title to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>prescriptive easement across the Zimmerman and Bromenshenk Properties. Ray also claimed that the Defendants had obstructed the easement and sought damages, an injunction to restore the ditch and attorney\u2019s fees. The Defendants counterclaimed to quiet title to their properties and to obtain trespass damages and an injunction. Before trial, however, the parties agreed to dismiss their respective damages claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">\u00b617 The District Court held a trial on March 26 and 27,2001. On May 30,2001, the court held that Ray did not have a prescriptive easement across either the Zimmerman or Bromenshenk Properties. It also granted the Defendants an injunction restraining Ray from running wastewater across their lands and held that they were entitled to costs and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">\u00b618 The Defendants then filed a Memoranda of Costs &amp; Disbursements. Ray objected to the fees and costs claimed. The court held a hearing on July 13, 2001, and, on August 2, 2001, entered a judgment granting the Defendants certain costs and attorney\u2019s fees. Ray appealed the court\u2019s judgment and the Defendants cross-appealed the court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">\u00b619  We review the findings of a district court sitting without a jury to determine if the court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous. <em>See </em>Rule 52(a), M.R.Civ.P. A district court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous if substantial credible evidence does not support them, if the trial court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence or if a review of the record leaves this Court with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>See Guthrie v. Hardy, </em>2001 MT 122, \u00b6 24, 305 Mont. 367, \u00b6 24, 28 P.3d 467, \u00b6 24. Additionally, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party when determining whether substantial credible evidence supports the district court\u2019s findings. <em>See Guthrie, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">\u00b620 We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether those conclusions are correct. <em>See Guthrie, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">\u00b621 Did the District Court err in concluding that Ray had failed to prove a prescriptive easement over the Bromenshenk Property?</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">\u00b622  An easement is a nonpossessory interest in land that gives a person the right to use the land of another for a specific purpose. <em>See Ruana v. Grigonis </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 441, 447, 913 P.2d 1247, 1251; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number><em>Kuhlman v. Rivera </em>(1985), 216 Mont. 353, 358, 701 P.2d 982, 985. To establish a prescriptive easement, a claimant must establish open, notorious, continuous, uninterrupted, exclusive and adverse use for five years. <em>See </em>\u00a7 70-19-404, MCA; <em>Renner v. Nemitz, </em>2001 MT 202, \u00b6 13, 306 Mont. 292, \u00b6 13, 33 P.3d 255, \u00b6 13. The claimant must prove these elements by clear and convincing evidence. <em>See Renner, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"AWy\">\u00b623  We have consistently followed the rule that open, notorious, continuous, uninterrupted and exclusive use raises a presumption that the use was also adverse. <em>See Albert v. Hastetter, </em>2002 MT 123, \u00b6 20, 310 Mont. 82, \u00b6 20, 48 P.3d 749, \u00b6 20. A claimant\u2019s failure to prove any element for the full prescriptive period is fatal to the entire claim. <em>See Grimsley v. Estate of Spencer </em>(1983), 206 Mont. 184, 196, 670 P.2d 85, 91-92. Although its reasoning was wrong, the District Court correctly held that Ray\u2019s use of the Wastewater Ditch was not adverse during any period of his use.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">\u00b624 In reaching its conclusion, the court explained that Ray had entered upon the Bromenshenk Property no more than three times to maintain the Wastewater Ditch. Such use, the court reasoned, did not provide actual or presumed notice of a hostile claim of right. The District Court, therefore, concluded that Ray\u2019s use of the Wastewater Ditch over the Bromenshenk Property was not open, notorious and adverse during any period of his use.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">\u00b625 The court improperly focused on Ray\u2019s entry onto the Bromenshenk Property. Ray is not seeking an easement to walk across the Bromenshenk Property. He is seeking an easement to flow water through the Wastewater Ditch on the Bromenshenk Property. The proper focus, therefore, is whether Ray\u2019s efforts to drain wastewater through the ditch were open, notorious or adverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">\u00b626  Use is \u201copen and notorious\u201d when it gives the landowner actual knowledge of the claimed right, or is of such a character as to raise a presumption of notice. <em>See Albert, </em>\u00b6 21; <em>Hitshew v. Butte / Silver Bow County, </em>1999 MT 26, \u00b6 17, 293 Mont. 212, \u00b6 17, 974 P.2d 650, \u00b6 17. Furthermore, when deciding the issue of adverse use, the court must determine whether the owner of the servient estate produced clear and convincing evidence that the use was permissive. <em>See Albert, </em>\u00b6 28. Although the District Court erred in concluding that Ray\u2019s use was not open and notorious, it was correct in concluding that his use was not adverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">\u00b627 Paul Bromenshenk testified at trial that he was aware of the Wastewater Ditch running across his property. He was also aware that Ray ran water across the ditch. In particular, Paul Bromenshenk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-4\">Question: In your experience, who has used the wastewater ditch on the Zimmerman and Bromenshenk properties?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-5\">Answer: Who has ran water across that ditch? I know Bill Deines has, Jerry Ray, I guess, and Johnny [Zimmerman], And that\u2019s all to my knowledge that - yeah, that\u2019s all I know, yeah.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">\u00b628 Although Paul Bromenshenk clearly should have been aware of Ray\u2019s use of the ditch, Ray\u2019s use of the ditch was nevertheless permissive. While Ray did not abide by all of the conditions requested of him when using the Wastewater Ditch, the evidence is clear that Ray\u2019s use of the ditch remained permissive. Paul Bromenshenk testified that he never withdrew permission to run water through the Wastewater Ditch:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-7\">Question: Have the owners of the Bromenshenk Property ever withdrawn permission or refused to let Mr. Ray run wastewater across the Bromenshenk Property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-8\">Answer: No, we\u2019ve never even - up until this - until that - until we received the [complaint] in the mail, there was no contact or stopping or anything of wastewater on our property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">\u00b629 Ray also testified as to the permissive nature of his use:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-10\">Question: Did you ever personally or through an agent tell the Bromenshenks that you were using the ditch across their land under a claim of right and not by permission?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-11\">Answer: There was at least one time I had visited with Paul. Paul informed me that I wasn\u2019t the only one having trouble with John Zimmerman. This was a few years back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-12\">Question: Okay. But did you tell him -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-13\">Answer: And Paul informed me that I had a right to run my water. Got along pretty good. Bought some hay from him for several years. And that\u2019s all I can remember of a conversation like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-14\">Question: Did you tell him that you had a right - did you tell him you had a right and you were not using his ditch by permission? Answer: I don\u2019t recall that, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-15\">\u00b630  We will affirm a district court\u2019s ruling if the court reaches the correct result, even if it does so for the wrong reason. <em>See Eschenbacher v. Anderson, </em>2001 MT 206, \u00b6 40, 306 Mont. 321, \u00b6 40, 34 P.3d 87, \u00b6 40. While the District Court incorrectly focused on Ray\u2019s entry onto the Bromenshenk Property, the record supports its conclusion that Ray\u2019s use was not adverse. Thus, the court did not err in concluding that no prescriptive easement existed across the Bromenshenk Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">\u00b631 Did the District Court err in concluding that Ray had failed to prove a prescriptive easement over the Zimmerman Property?</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">\u00b632 The District Court held that Ray did not show by clear and convincing evidence that his use of the Wastewater Ditch across the Zimmerman Property was continuous and uninterrupted for the necessary five-year period. Although both parties point to several inconsistent findings made by the court, we need not concern ourselves with these discrepancies. For purposes of this appeal, determining whether Ray\u2019s use was continuous and uninterrupted is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"A-D\">\u00b633  For use \u201c[t]o be \u2018continuous and uninterrupted,\u2019 the use of a claimed right must not be abandoned by the user or interrupted by an act of the landowner.\u201d <em>Albert, </em>\u00b6 23. The court concluded that Ray\u2019s adverse use began in 1992. We agree. While Ray argues that the prescriptive period began at least as early as 1991, the evidence does not support that conclusion. Instead, Ray\u2019s testimony suggests that his use of the Zimmerman property was permissive in 1990 and 1991. Specifically, Ray testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-6\">Question: So he opened [the Wastewater Ditch] again in 1991 according to your letter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-7\">Answer: Might have been 1990.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-8\">Question: Well, there\u2019s two times there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-9\">Answer: (Reviewing document.) Okay. He must have tried to do it each time earlier in the season according to this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-10\">Question: But did you not testify that you opened it in 1991? Answer: Yes, and I did. Went right back and straightened up the ditch that he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-11\">Question: So twice you straightened up the ditch?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-12\">Answer: Probably more than twice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-13\">Question: So he probably plowed a ditch for you more than twice? Answer: He would have been plowing on the first time through, which would have been earlier in the year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-14\">\u00b634 The act of opening the Wastewater Ditch in 1990 and 1991 implies that John Zimmerman permitted Ray to use the Wastewater Ditch as part of the neighborly accommodation that began when the Deines farmed the Ray Property. Ray counters this conclusion by arguing that the court\u2019s own findings better support the alternate conclusion that the prescriptive period began as early as 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-15\">\u00b635  The court noted that Ray re-pulled and ran water through the Wastewater Ditch without asking permission. It also found that animosities existed between John Zimmerman and Ray during 1990 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>and 1991. The Defendants\u2019 attorney, however, sent Ray a letter that expressly noted the permissive nature of Ray\u2019s predecessors\u2019 use. While Ray may not have asked for permission to use the Wastewater Ditch, he cites no evidence that suggests that the Defendants withdrew permission to use the Wastewater Ditch before 1992. For these reasons, the District Court did not err in concluding that Ray\u2019s use of the Wastewater Ditch was not adverse in 1990 and 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">\u00b636 The question thus becomes whether John Zimmerman interrupted Ray\u2019s use within five years of 1992. Specifically, we must decide whether the court correctly held that John Zimmerman interrupted Ray\u2019s use in September 1996. We conclude that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">\u00b637 In August 1996, John Zimmerman plugged the culvert leading onto his property, thus blocking the ditch. Ray nevertheless attempted to use the Wastewater Ditch in September. When Ray began running water through the ditch, however, the blockage caused the Zimmerman Property to flood. Upon seeing the flooding, Paul Bromenshenk pulled a second wastewater ditch so that the water would not run onto their road. This evidence, the court concluded, indicated that the Wastewater Ditch no longer existed across the Zimmerman Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">\u00b638  What establishes continuous use depends on the nature and character of the claimed right; such use does not necessarily entail constant use. <em>See Hays v. De Atley </em>(1923), 65 Mont. 558, 564, 212 P. 296,298. All that the claimant must show regarding a ditch conveying water is that he used the ditch whenever he needed to do so. <em>See Te Selle v. Storey </em>(1957), 133 Mont. 1, 6, 319 P.2d 218, 220. Ray argues that any interruption in September occurred after the typical irrigation season and thus did not interrupt his normal use of the ditch. Ray nevertheless attempted to use the Wastewater Ditch in September 1996 to irrigate his crops for a third cutting of hay. John Zimmerman blocked this use.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">\u00b639  The District Court concluded that this blockage of the ditch resulted in an interruption of Ray\u2019s adverse use. Ray argues that the court\u2019s result, taken to its logical extreme, would require a claimant to continuously run water through a ditch to prevail on a prescriptive easement claim. John Zimmerman, however, did not block the ditch at a time when Ray was not using it. Instead, John Zimmerman blocked the ditch while Ray was irrigating his crops. Therefore, we conclude that the District Court did not err in concluding that Ray\u2019s use was not continuous and uninterrupted for the five-year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">\u00b640 Did the District Court abuse its discretion by awarding one-half of the attorney\u2019s fees claimed by the Defendants?</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">\u00b641 A district court has discretion in determining the reasonableness of attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See Carkeek v. Ayer </em>(1980), 188 Mont. 345, 347, 613 P.2d 1013, 1015. Absent an abuse of that discretion, we will not overturn such determinations. <em>See Carkeek, </em>188 Mont, at 347-48, 613 P.2d at 1015. We have explained a court\u2019s determination of the reasonableness of attorney\u2019s fees as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\">The determination of reasonable attorney's fees is not subject to precise calculation or a formulaic approach. We previously have stated that the following factors should be considered as guidelines in making such a determination: (1) the amount and character of services rendered; (2) the labor, time, and trouble involved; (3) the character and importance of the litigation in which the services were rendered; (4) the amount of money or the value of the property to be affected; (5) the professional skill and experience required; (6) the attorneys\u2019 character and standing in their profession; and (7) the result secured by the services of the attorneys. These factors are not exclusive, however, and district courts may consider other factors as well. Thus, the reasonableness of attorney\u2019s fees must be ascertained under the unique facts of each case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-7\"><em>Pankratz v. Teske, </em>2002 MT 112, \u00b6 22, 309 Mont. 499, \u00b6 22, 48 P.3d 30, \u00b6 22 (citing <em>Chamberlin v. Puckett Constr. </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 198, 205, 921 P.2d 1237, 1241-42 (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">\u00b642 The District Court concluded that \u00a7 70-17-112(5), MCA, entitled the Defendants to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. The Defendants submitted a claim of $1,133 for the Bromenshenk Defendants and $36,069.50 for the Zimmerman Defendants. After reviewing the case and the attorneys\u2019 role in it, the court decided to reduce the Defendants\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees by half.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">\u00b643 In reaching this conclusion, the court listed several factors on which it relied. The court first noted that lead counsel were relatively equal as to experience and standing within the legal community. Also, the Defendants\u2019 counsel rendered more than twice the time and services that Ray\u2019s counsel rendered, even though Ray had the \u201claboring oar to carry the burden of proof.\u201d The court next explained that neither party claimed money damages and that the matter required no greater professional skill or experience than a variety of other types of cases. It also observed that Ray was successful in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>proving many of the elements for a prescriptive easement. Furthermore, the court noted that the Defendants\u2019 witnesses at trial were somewhat repetitive and that the Defendants\u2019 attorneys duplicated some of their work. The court explained that, despite these findings, the Defendants\u2019 attorneys spent substantially more time on the matter than did Ray\u2019s attorney. Based on these reasons, the court decided to reduce the award of attorney\u2019s fees by half.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">\u00b644 The Defendants counter that the District Court mischaracterized the relevant evidence and factors when it reduced their attorneys fees. They contend that their attorney had to represent a multiple-party client regarding two pieces of property; they had a more difficult burden to carry; their case required calling multiple witnesses; they had a stronger motivation to vigorously defend their case than Ray had; and they ultimately prevailed in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">\u00b645 Balancing these various factors is the job of the District Court. <em>See Carkeek, </em>188 Mont, at 347-48, 613 P.2d at 1015. The Defendants undoubtedly feel that all these factors taken together deserve a higher award of attorney\u2019s fees. Weighing this various evidence, however, we do not conclude that the court exceeded its discretion by reducing the Defendants\u2019 requested fees by half.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">\u00b646 The Defendants also argue that a fifty percent reduction in attorneys fees was arbitrary. We disagree. We have held that a court must base an award of attorney\u2019s fees on some competent evidence. <em>See Krone v. McCann </em>(1983), 205 Mont. 190, 192, 666 P.2d 766,767; <em>Petritz v. Albertsons, Inc. </em>(1980), 187 Mont. 102, 110, 608 P.2d 1089, 1094. The district courts in both <em>Krone </em>and <em>Petriz </em>provided no rationale or evidentiary foundation for reaching their conclusions. The District Court in this case, however, did provide comparisons between counsel for Ray and the Defendants. Based on this comparison, the court decided to reduce the award of attorney\u2019s fees by half. While the Defendants may not like the result, the court had a basis for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">\u00b647  The District Court, therefore, did not abuse its discretion when it awarded the Defendants one-half of their requested attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">ISSUE FOUR</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">\u00b648 Did the District Court err in disallowing costs claimed by the Defendants?</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">\u00b649 Section 25-10-201(9), MCA, provides that a party may claim costs for \u201cother reasonable and necessary expenses as are taxable according to the course and practice of the court or by express provision of law.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>The Defendants argue that the District Court erred in disallowing costs for court reporter services, subpoena services and Westlaw computer research. They claim that these costs were necessary and that the court thus erred in not awarding them.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">\u00b650 We agree with the Defendants that the transcripts were necessary to prepare post-trial findings and conclusions as required by the District Court. Likewise, we conclude that the subpoena services were necessary to compel witnesses to attend trial. We disagree, however, that costs associated with Westlaw research were necessary. These costs may be common costs in modern law practice, but they primarily involve improving a law practice\u2019s efficiency. Therefore, the District Court could reasonably conclude that they were not necessary costs.</p>\n<p id=\"A_H\">\u00b651  For these reasons, we conclude that the District Court was correct in denying costs for Westlaw research, but erred in denying costs for transcript expenses and subpoena service fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">\u00b652 Affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b167-6\">JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON, TRIEWEILER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
