Upon motion by Respondent Tina Vanlaarhoven, the District Court dismissed Kevin\u2019s petition for lack of jurisdiction. Kevin appeals from the District Court\u2019s order of dismissal. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-12\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred when it dismissed Kevin\u2019s petition for dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b389-14\">\u00b63 On August 10, 1996, Kevin and Tina were married in Billings, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>Montana. The parties have four minor children. Throughout the marriage, the parties experienced difficulties in the relationship. Tina filed a petition for dissolution in approximately August of 2000 but later dismissed it in an effort toward reconciliation. A few months later, Kevin was charged with partner or family member assault for an incident which allegedly occurred on August 11, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">\u00b64 On March 18, 2001, Tina and the four children left Kevin and moved to LeGrande, Oregon. Pursuant to a petition filed by Tina, the Union County Circuit Court in Oregon, on June 29, 2001, determined that it had temporary emergency jurisdiction over the parties\u2019 minor children, entered a restraining order against Kevin, and awarded Tina residential custody of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">\u00b65 On August 23, 2001, Kevin filed a petition for dissolution and proposed parenting plan in the District Court. The District Court ordered Tina to show cause, at a hearing scheduled for September 19, 2001, why it should not adopt Kevin\u2019s proposed parenting plan. On September 14, 2001, Tina filed a motion to vacate the show cause hearing and dismiss Kevin\u2019s petition for dissolution. Tina\u2019s motion primarily argued that the District Court lacked jurisdiction over the matter as \u201c[t]he Oregon court has already determined that it has temporary emergency jurisdiction of the children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">\u00b66 Before Kevin had an opportunity to respond to Tina\u2019s motion, the District Court, on September 17,2001, vacated the show cause hearing and dismissed Kevin\u2019s petition for dissolution without explanation. On October 10, 2001, Kevin filed a notice of appeal from the District Court\u2019s order of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">\u00b67 We review a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>In re McGurran, </em>1999 MT 192, \u00b6 7, 295 Mont. 357, \u00b6 7, 983 P.2d 968, \u00b6 7. However, a district court\u2019s determination that it lacks jurisdiction over a matter is a conclusion of law which we review to determine whether the district court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>McGurran, </em>\u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">\u00b68 Did the District Court err when it dismissed Kevin\u2019s petition for dissolution?</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">\u00b69 Kevin asserts that the District Court \u201cwas confused over the matter of subject matter jurisdiction of custody, as compared to subject matter jurisdiction over the divorce action entirely.\u201d Kevin contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>that, at the time he filed his petition, Montana retained sole jurisdiction over the dissolution matter. As for the parenting issues, Kevin recognizes that Oregon asserted temporary emergency jurisdiction over the children. However, Kevin insists that this exercise of jurisdiction did not automatically prohibit Montana courts from entertaining parenting proceedings. Kevin claims that Montana has enacted a statutory procedure for courts to follow in situations such as this, discussed in greater detail below, which the District Court wholly ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">\u00b610 The District Court\u2019s order contains no explanation as to why it granted Tina\u2019s motion. The order of dismissal simply states that it granted the motion for \u201cgood cause appearing.\u201d We presume that the District Court dismissed the petition for the reasons set forth in Tina\u2019s motion, lack of jurisdiction and inconvenient forum, and will proceed with our analysis accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">\u00b611 Tina insists that the District Court did not have jurisdiction over the minor children, and, therefore, argues by implication that the District Court lacked jurisdiction over the dissolution. Tina also asserts \u201cthat the State of Montana, if it claims jurisdiction over the petition for dissolution, is an inconvenient forum as she and the minor children became Oregon residents when they moved to LeGrande, Oregon on or around March 18, 2001, and Oregon exercised jurisdiction of the minor children in June 2001.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">\u00b612 To simply assert that the District Court lacks \u201cjurisdiction\u201d over the matter does not accurately depict the twofold jurisdictional inquiry necessitated by this case. This case presents questions of jurisdiction over dissolution and parenting issues. However, the two analyses appear to have been intermingled in the District Corut. The District Court should have addressed the following two inquiries: (1) Did it have jurisdiction over the dissolution proceeding?; and (2) Did it have jurisdiction over the parenting issues implicated by the petition for dissolution? We will proceed to analyze each issue in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">\u00b613  Section 40-4-104(1), MCA, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-8\">The district court shall enter a decree of dissolution of marriage if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-9\">(a) the court finds that one of the parties, at the time the action was commenced, was domiciled in this state ... and that the domicile... has been maintained for 90 days preceding the making of the findings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">As indicated above, Kevin filed the petition for dissolution on August 23, 2001. No concurrent jurisdiction issue existed during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>dissolution proceedings as neither of the parties had commenced any other dissolution proceedings at that time. Further, Tina does not dispute that Kevin resided in Montana for the ninety days preceding August 23, 2001. Therefore, Kevin has satisfied the jurisdictional requirements of \u00a7 40-4-104(l)(a), MCA. Accordingly, the District Court erred when it concluded that it did not have jurisdiction over the parties\u2019 dissolution. However, jurisdiction over a dissolution of marriage does not necessarily confer jurisdiction over child custody issues involved therein. <em>In re Marriage </em>of Oltersdorf (1992), 256 Mont. 96, 98, 844 P.2d 778, 779. As such, we must now turn our attention to whether the District Court had jurisdiction over the parenting issues raised in the petition for dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">\u00b614 The provisions of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCC JA), \u00a7\u00a7 40-7-101 through 40-7-317, MCA, govern all child custody actions brought before the courts of Montana in which there is potential for jurisdictional conflict between multiple states. <em>In re Custody of N.G.H., </em>1998 MT 212, \u00b6 10, 290 Mont. 426, \u00b6 10, 963 P.2d 1275, \u00b6 10. Here, the parties agree that there is potential for jurisdictional conflict between Montana and Oregon over the parenting issues as Oregon exercised temporary emergency jurisdiction over the parties\u2019 children. Therefore, the UCCJA governs the jurisdictional analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">\u00b615 Section 40-7-20l(l)(a), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">Except as otherwise provided in 40-7-204, a court of this state has jurisdiction to make an initial child custody determination only if this state is the home state of the child on the date of the commencement of the proceeding or was the home state of the child within 6 months before th\u00e9 commencement of the proceeding and the child is absent from this state but a parent or person acting as a parent continues to live in this state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">The exception in the above statute refers to Montana\u2019s temporary emergency jurisdiction provision. As indicated above, the Oregon court entered a parenting order pursuant to its temporary emergency jurisdiction provision which is identical to \u00a7 40-7-204, MCA. <em>See </em>Or. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 109.751 (2001). In circumstances such as this, where one jurisdiction has exercised temporary emergency jurisdiction to address child custody issues and another jurisdiction is subsequently or simultaneously asked to adjudicate the same custodial issues,</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">\u00a7 40-7-204(4), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-9\">A court of this state that has been asked to make a child custody determination under this section, upon being informed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>that a child custody proceeding has been commenced in, or a child custody determination has been made by, a court of a state having jurisdiction under 40-7-201 through 40-7-203, shall immediately communicate with the other court. A court of this state that is exercising jurisdiction pursuant to 40-7-201 through 40-7-203, upon being informed that a child custody proceeding has been commenced in, or a child custody determination has been made by, a court of another state under a statute similar to this section, shall immediately communicate with the court of that state. The purpose of the communication is to resolve the emergency, to protect the safety of the parties and the child, and to determine a period for the duration of the temporary order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">\u00b616  Clearly, pursuant to \u00a7 40-7-204(4), MCA, Oregon\u2019s exercise of temporary emergency jurisdiction over the parties\u2019 children did not automatically divest the District Court of jurisdiction over the same parenting issues. Section 40-7-204(4), MCA, requires that a subsequent jurisdiction initiate communications with the preceding jurisdiction upon learning of the emergency proceedings. Although Kevin did not inform the District Court of the Oregon proceedings in his petition for dissolution or proposed parenting plan, Tina did notify the District Court of such proceedings in her motion to dismiss the petition. At that point, the District Court was obligated to contact the Union County Circuit Court in Oregon in regard to the potential jurisdictional conflict. The record reveals no indication that the District Court undertook such action. Therefore, to the extent the District Court declined to address the parenting issues in Kevin\u2019s petition because Oregon \u201chas already exercised jurisdiction of the minor children,\u201d it is reversed and remanded for proceedings in accordance with \u00a7 40-7-204(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">\u00b617 In the alternative, Tina argues that if the District Court had jurisdiction to make parenting determinations, it properly declined to exercise jurisdiction because Oregon is the more appropriate forum. In support of this proposition Tina references the children\u2019s current residential arrangements, their enrollment in Oregon schools, and their proximity to extended family in Oregon. Tina also contends that the alleged domestic violence which occurred in August of2000 should strongly mitigate against entertaining dissolution proceedings in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">\u00b618 Section 40-7-108, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-7\">Inconvenient forum. (1) A court of this state that has jurisdiction under this chapter to make a child custody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>determination may decline to exercise its jurisdiction at any time if it determines that it is an inconvenient forum under the circumstances and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum. The issue of inconvenient forum maybe raised upon the court\u2019s own motion, request of another court, or motion of a party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-4\">(2) Before determining whether it is an inconvenient forum, a court of this state shall consider whether it is appropriate that a court of another state exercise jurisdiction. For this purpose, the court shall allow the parties to submit information and shall consider all relevant factors ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The provision proceeds to list several factors for courts to consider in their deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">\u00b619  On September 14,2001, Tina did raise the inconvenient forum issue in her motion to dismiss Kevin\u2019s petition. The District Court granted Tina\u2019s motion on September 17,2001, without giving Kevin an opportunity to respond to the motion. Section 40-7-108, MCA, clearly provides that \u201cthe court shall allow the parties to submit information\u201d on inconvenient forum issues. Only after entertaining argument from the parties on the allegedly relevant factors should a district court make its \u201cinconvenient forum\u201d determination. Accordingly, to the extent the District Court dismissed Kevin\u2019s petition on inconvenient forum grounds, without providing him with an opportunity to submit argument, it is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">\u00b620 On appeal, Tina also maintains that Kevin\u2019s petition failed to comply with the procedural requirements of \u00a7 40-4-105(1), MCA, and, therefore, rendered the petition void ab initio. However, Tina did not present this argument to the District Court in her motion to dismiss. Therefore, we will not address this issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">\u00b621 In summary, to the extent the District Court concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the dissolution, it is reversed. As for its jurisdiction over the parenting issues, we reverse the District Court\u2019s dismissal and remand the matter for proceedings consistent with \u00a7\u00a7 40-7-108 and 40-7-204(4), MCA.</p>\n<judges id=\"b394-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER, TRIEWEILER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
