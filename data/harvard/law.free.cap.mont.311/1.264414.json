Ellis, d/b/a/Yellowstone Log Works (\u201cthe Ellises\u201d), on accounts owing. Subsequently, Aldrich filed a motion for summary judgment. Thereafter, the Ellises filed a motion to amend the pleadings. The District Court granted Aldrich partial summary judgment and denied the Ellises\u2019 motion to amend the pleadings. Following a hearing to determine damages, the District Court granted Aldrich judgment against the Ellises in the amount of $81,914.20. The Ellises appeal. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-10\">\u00b62 We restate the issues presented on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b23-11\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in concluding that Aldrich was entitled to charge and collect a late payment charge from the Ellises without a written agreement pursuant to \u00a7 31-1-501, MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b23-12\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in concluding that Aldrich\u2019s statements of account comply with the requirements of \u00a7 31-1-502, MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b23-13\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court err in denying Ellises\u2019 motion to amend the pleadings?</p>\n<p id=\"b23-14\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b23-15\">\u00b66 Aldrich is a lumber company with its principal place of business located in Billings, Montana. It has a branch location in Livingston, Montana. The Ellises are residents of Livingston and do business therein as Yellowstone Log Works.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-16\">\u00b67 In November 1996, Tanner Ellis filled out Aldrich\u2019s commercial credit application, as guarantor, in the name of Yellowstone Log Works. The credit application was approved by Aldrich on November 30, 1996. Subsequently, the Ellises opened three accounts and purchased materials from Aldrich on numerous occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-17\">\u00b68 On August 13, 1999, Aldrich filed a complaint in the District Court seeking judgment against the Ellises for the unpaid costs of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>materials provided to them in the amount of $67,370.94, with interest accruing thereon at the rate of 18% per annum. As litigation progressed, the District Court issued a Scheduling Order on October 5,1999, which provided that all amendments to the pleadings must be filed by October 25,1999, and all motions for summary judgment must be filed by February 4, 2000. Subsequently, Aldrich moved for summary judgment on January 3, 2001, alleging that a contractual relationship existed between the parties, and the Ellises breached that contractual relationship by failing to pay for the materials provided to them. The District Court held a hearing on Aldrich\u2019s motion on February 7, 2001. At the hearing, the Ellises moved to amend the pleadings to add a claim of usury. The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">\u00b69 On February 9, 2001, the Ellises filed a brief in opposition to summary judgment and a motion to amend the pleadings. Therein, the Ellises claimed Aldrich was not entitled to summary judgment because there was no written agreement between the parties providing for late payment charges as required by \u00a7 31-1-501, MCA. In addition, the Ellises alleged that Aldrich\u2019s statements of account did not comply with the requirements of \u00a7 3 l-l-502(l)(a), (e), and (f), MCA. The Ellises therefore argued Aldrich\u2019s motion for summary judgment should be denied and they should be allowed to amend the pleadings to add a claim for recovery of usurious interest pursuant to \u00a7 31-1-108, MCA. In their motion to amend the pleadings, the Ellises alleged Aldrich would not be prejudiced if they were permitted to amend the pleadings since a trial date had not been set and neither party had conducted discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">\u00b610 The District Court entered an Order on February 20, 2001, denying the Ellises\u2019 motion to amend the pleadings and granting Aldrich partial summary judgment. The court concluded that the Ellises\u2019 motion to amend the pleadings was untimely pursuant to its Scheduling Order. Additionally, the court concluded that a contractual relationship existed between the parties and the Ellises had breached that relationship by failing to pay amounts owing. The court further concluded that genuine issues of fact existed regarding damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">\u00b611 The court held a hearing to determine damages on April 23,2001. Thereafter, the court issued an Explanatory Comment Regarding Interest Rate on May 3, 2001, concluding that Aldrich was entitled to charge the Ellises <em>VA% </em>interest per month on all amounts due and owing over thirty days. On the same day, the District Court granted Aldrich judgment against the Ellises in the amount of $81,914.20, including 18% interest per annum on the principal amount. The Ellises appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\">\u00b612 We review a district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling de novo and employ the same Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., evaluation as applied by the district court. <em>Andrews v. Plum Creek Manufacturing, </em>2001 MT 94, \u00b6 5, 305 Mont. 194, \u00b6 5, 27 P.3d 426, \u00b6 5. Pursuant to Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., we apply the following inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-5\">The movant must demonstrate that no genuine issues of material fact exist. Once this has been accomplished, the burden then shifts to the non-moving party to prove, by more than mere denial and speculation, that a genuine issue does exist. Having determined that genuine issues of fact do not exist, the court must then determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We review the legal determinations made by a district court as to whether the court erred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b25-6\"><em>Bruner v. Yellowstone County </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 261, 264, 900 P.2d 901, 903 (citations omitted). We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to amend the pleadings for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Loomis v. Luraski, </em>2001 MT 223, \u00b6 24, 306 Mont. 478, \u00b6 24, 36 P.3d 862, \u00b6 24 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Af\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b25-8\">\u00b613 Did the District Court err in concluding that Aldrich was entitled to charge and collect a late payment charge from the Ellises without a written agreement pursuant to \u00a7 31-1-501, MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b25-9\">\u00b614 The Ellises argue that a retail seller who charges <em>VA% </em>interest per month on delinquent accounts must have a written agreement with the retail buyer to do so pursuant to \u00a7 31-1-501(1), MCA. Specifically, the Ellises contend that reference to \u00a7 31-1-202, MCA, in \u00a7 31-1-501(1), MCA, refers to the definition of \u201cretail seller\u201d stated in \u00a7 31-l-202(l)(p), MCA, which requires that a retail seller have a written agreement with the retail buyer. The Ellises assert that a written agreement does not exist between the parties, and thus Aldrich is not entitled to charge and collect a late payment fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-10\">\u00b615 Aldrich maintains the District Court correctly determined that a written agreement is not required to charge and collect a late payment charge on any accounts thirty days past due in the retail sales arena when the sale is not anticipated to be on an installment basis. Aldrich asserts that the Ellises are misconstruing and misinterpreting the meaning of the statutory language in \u00a7 31-1-501, MCA, and reference therein to \u00a7 31-1-202, MCA. Namely, Aldrich alleges that reference to \u00a7 31-1-202, MCA, in \u00a7 31-1-501(1), MCA, pertains solely to the</p>\n<p id=\"b26-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>definition of \u201cgoods\u201d as defined by \u00a7 31-l-202(l)(d), MCA. Aldrich further points out that \u00a7 31-l-202(l)(p), MCA, defines \u201cretail seller\u201d as \u201ca person who sells goods or furnishes services to a retail buyer in a written retail installment contract or written retail installment transaction.\u201d However, \u00a7 31-1-501(3), MCA, expressly states that the provisions of \u00a7 31-1-501, MCA, do not apply to retail installment contracts or retail charge account agreements regulated under Title 31, chapter 1, part 2. Aldrich thus claims \u00a7 31-l-202(l)(p), MCA, is inapplicable. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">\u00b616 Section 31-1-501, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-5\">Late payment charges-accounts receivable for merchandise sold at retail. (1) Notwithstanding 31-1-106 or 31-1-107, a person who sells <em>goods, as defined in 31-1-202, </em>at-retail to a retail buyer who promises to pay for such goods upon presentation of the bill therefor, may charge and collect a late payment charge not greater than <em>VA% </em>per month on all money due on all accounts from 30 days after the date on which the obligation of the buyer to pay is incurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-6\">(2) The late payment charge provided in this section may be charged only if at the time the obligation was incurred the seller did not intend to extend any credit beyond 30 days and any late payment of the obligation was unintended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-7\">(3) The provisions of this section <em>do not apply </em>to money due for intangible services, for services regulated by the public service commission, for real property, for health care services, or for <em>retail installment sales contracts or retail charge account agreements regulated under Title 31, chapter 1, part </em>2. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b26-8\">\u00b617 In interpreting a statute, we will \u201cascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein,\u201d and we will not \u201cinsert what has been omitted\u201d or \u201comit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. Therefore, we will first look to the plain meaning of the words contained in the statute. <em>See Gallatin County v. Montana Eighteenth Judicial District Court </em>(1997), 281 Mont. 33, 40, 930 P.2d 680, 685 (citation omitted). \u201cIn the search for plain meaning, The language used must be reasonably and logically interpreted, giving words their usual and ordinary meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Gallatin County, </em>281 Mont, at 40, 930 P.2d at 685 (quoting <em>In re Matter of McCabe </em>(1975), 168 Mont. 334, 339, 544 P.2d 825, 828). If the language is clear and unambiguous, we will not apply other rules of statutory construction. <em>See Clarke v. Massey </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 412, 416, 897 P.2d 1085, 1088.</p>\n<p id=\"AD\">\u00b618  Upon reviewing the plain meaning of the language contained in \u00a7 31-1-501, MCA, we conclude that reference to \u00a7 31-1-202, MCA, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>\u00a7 31-1-501(1), MCA, clearly pertains to the definition of \u201cgoods\u201d provided by \u00a7 31-l-202(l)(d), MCA. Further, to interpret \u00a7 31-1-501(1), MCA, as incorporating the definition of \u201cretail seller\u201d stated in \u00a7 31-1-202(l)(p), MCA, wouldrequire omitting the provisions of \u00a7 31-1-501(3), MCA, which provide that \u00a7 31-1-501, MCA, does not apply to \u201cretail installment sales contracts or retail charge account agreements regulated under Title 31, chapter 1, part 2.\u201d Consequently, the definition stated in \u00a7 31-l-202(l)(p), MCA, is inapplicable in interpreting \u00a7 31-1-501, MCA, as such definition incorporates the requirement of the existence of a \u201cretail installment contract or written retail installment transaction.\u201d Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in determining that \u00a7 31-1-501, MCA, does not require \u201ca contract in the retail sales arena where the sale is not anticipated to be on an installment basis\u201d since the plain meaning of the language contained in \u00a7 31-1-501, MCA, does not provide such requirement. We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 31-1-501, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">\u00b619 Did the District Court err in concluding that Aldrich\u2019s statements of account comply with \u00a7 31-1-502, MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">\u00b620 The Ellises contend that Aldrich\u2019s statements of account fail to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 31-l-502(l)(a), (e), and (f), MCA. First, the Ellises claim the statements fail to state that a late payment charge will be charged beginning thirty days from the date of purchase in compliance with \u00a7 31-l-502(l)(a), MCA. Next, the Ellises assert that the statements fail to state the interest being charged is simple interest in compliance with \u00a7 31-l-502(l)(e), MCA. Lastly, the Ellises maintain the statements fail to provide a legend stating that the buyer may at any time pay the total unpaid balance pursuant to \u00a7 31-1-502(l)(f), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">\u00b621 In response, Aldrich asserts it provided the Ellises statements on a monthly basis in compliance with the requirements of \u00a7 31-1-502(l)(a), (e), and (f), MCA. First, Aldrich contends its statements comply with \u00a7 31-l-502(l)(a), MCA, since the statements are computer generated and do not begin computing interest on purchases until thirty days from the date of purchase. Secondly, Aldrich claims the statements recite that past due accounts are subject to an annual percentage rate of 18%, which is calculated as simple interest through its computer billing system pursuant to the requirements of \u00a7 31-1-502(l)(e), MCA. Lastly, Aldrich alleges that \u201c[i]t is obvious and anticipated\u201d from the language of the statements that the buyer may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>and should pay the total unpaid balance in accordance with \u00a7 31-1-502(l)(f), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">\u00b622 Section 31-1-502, MCA, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-5\">Periodic statement to be furnished to debtor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-6\">(1) A seller may charge the late payment charge provided for in 31-1-501 <em>only </em>if he promptly supplies the buyer with a statement as of the end of each monthly period, or other regular period agreed upon by the seller and the buyer, in which there is any unpaid balance. Such statement <em>shall </em>recite the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-7\">(a) the percentage amount of the late payment charge that will be charged <em>beginning 30 days after the obligation is </em>incurred;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-8\">(b) the unpaid balance at the beginning or end of the period;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-9\">(c) an identification of any amounts debited to the buyer\u2019s account during the period;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-10\">(d) the payments made by the buyer to the seller during the period;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-11\">(e) the amount of the late payment charge and also the percentage <em>annual simple interest </em>equivalent of such amount; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-12\">(f) a <em>legend to the effect that the buyer may at any time pay the total unpaid balance.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-13\">(2) The items need not be stated in the sequence or order set forth in subsection (1). Additional items may be included to explain the computations made in determining the amount to be paid by the buyer. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-14\">\u00b623  A review of the plain meaning of the words contained in \u00a7 31-1-502(1), MCA, provides that the seller is mandatorily required to set forth the provisions listed in \u00a7 31-l-502(l)(a)-(f), MCA, in its monthly statements supplied to the buyer. Thus, if the statements Aldrich submitted to the Ellises fail to state any of the items listed within \u00a7 31-l-502(l)(a)-(f), MCA, it cannot charge a late payment fee of <em>V/2% </em>per month provided for in \u00a7 31-1-501, MCA, pursuant to \u00a7 31-1-502(1), MCA. After reviewing Aldrich\u2019s statements of account submitted into evidence, we conclude that the statements do not comply with the requirements of \u00a7 31-l-502(l)(a), (e), and (f), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-15\">\u00b624 Specifically, we conclude that the statements fail to state that a late payment charge will be incurred thirty days after purchase as required by \u00a7 31-l-502(l)(a), MCA. Instead, the statements provide that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-16\">Payable in full 10th of the month following date of purchase, past due 11th of month. Past due accounts are subject to a FINANCE CHARGE of <em>1V%% </em>per month of unpaid balance or an ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE OF 18% (OR A MINIMUM FINANCE <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>OF $0.50).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">Therefore, the terms of Aldrich\u2019s statement reflect that a late payment charge may actually be incurred prior to the expiration of the thirty day grace period provided by \u00a7 31-l-502(l)(a), MCA. By way of example only, a charge incurred on December 22 would be past due on January 11, less than thirty days after the charge was incurred, pursuant to the terms of Aldrich\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">\u00b625  In addition, we conclude that the statements fail to state the interest charged is simple interest pursuant to \u00a7 31-l-502(l)(e), MCA. Furthermore, we conclude that the statements fail to comply with \u00a731-l-502(l)(f), MCA, stating that the buyer may at any time pay the total unpaid balance. Consequently, we hold the District Court erred when it concluded that Aldrich\u2019s statements of account comply with \u00a7 31-1-502, MCA. Accordingly, we reverse the District Court\u2019s grant of partial summary judgment to Aldrich and remand this matter to the District Court for determination of the amounts due and owing to Aldrich by the Ellises.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">\u00b626 Did the District Court err in denying Ellises\u2019 motion to amend the pleadings?</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">\u00b627  We have repeatedly held that leave to amend should be freely given when justice so requires pursuant to Rule 15(a), M.R.Civ.P., unless the moving party is guilty of undue delay, bad faith, or dilatory motive. <em>See Loomis, </em>\u00b6 41 (citations omitted). Here, discovery had not been conducted and a trial date was not set. Further, we note that the District Court did not strictly comply with its Scheduling Order since it permitted Aldrich to file a motion for summary judgment approximately eleven months after the date it specified therein for filing such motions. Accordingly, in light of the District Court permitting Aldrich to file an untimely summary judgment motion, we conclude that it abused its discretion when it denied the Ellises\u2019 motion to amend the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-9\">\u00b628  Moreover, we point out that our reversal and remand of a matter opens anew all matters not settled by such decision. <em>See Story v. City of Bozeman </em>(1993), 259 Mont. 207, 230, 856 P.2d 202, 216 (citing <em>Mattock v. Goughner </em>(1893), 13 Mont. 300, 301, 34 P. 36, 36 and <em>Zavarelli v. Might </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 120, 125-126, 779 P.2d 489, 493). Therefore, in light of our determination that Aldrich\u2019s statements do not comply with the requirements of \u00a7 31-1-502, MCA, and remand, we conclude that the Ellises should be permitted to amend the pleadings and add a claim of usury.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>\u00b629 Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b30-4\">JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"A7\">JUSTICE RICE</author>\n<p id=\"AW\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">\u00b630 I concur with the Court\u2019s holdings on Issues One and Two, but dissent from the Court\u2019s holding on Issue Three.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">\u00b631 The Court in Issue Three reverses the District Court\u2019s denial of the Ellises\u2019 motion to amend their pleadings, which Ellises had requested 15 months after the amendment deadline, and permits them to add a new claim to the matter. I believe the Court has erred in so doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">\u00b632 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a party\u2019s motion for leave to amend the pleadings to determine whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>Trout v. Bennett </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 416, 830 P.2d 81. The district court is justified in denying a motion to amend for reasons \u201csuch as undue delay.\u201d <em>Lindey\u2019s v. Professional Consultants </em>(1990), 244 Mont. 238, 242, 797 P.2d 920, 923.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">\u00b633 The District Court noted the Ellises\u2019 substantial delay in deciding the issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-9\">The defendant[s] moved to amend the pleadings more than fifteen months after the time for amendments had passed. No reason was given why the defendants could not have complied with the scheduling order or why they waited until the day that the motion for summary judgment was being heard to file their motion to amend the pleadings. The defendant[s\u2019]motion to amend is untimely and is DENIED. [Capitalization in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b30-10\">I find no abuse of discretion in the District Court\u2019s denial on the grounds of untimeliness here, especially in light of the Ellises\u2019 failure to offer any justification for the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-11\">\u00b634 This Court has also ruled that \u201c[a]n opportunity to amend a pleading is not appropriate... when the party opposing the amendment would incur substantial prejudice as a result of the amendment.\u201d <em>Peuse v. Malkuch </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 221, 227, 911 P.2d 1153, 1156. As here, the defendants in <em>Peuse </em>moved to amend their pleadings after the plaintiff had moved for summary judgment. Noting the procedural posture of the case, and the defendants\u2019 delay, this Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-12\">If the amendments were allowed after the motion for summary judgment, Peuse would be unduly prejudiced since [Peuse\u2019s] motion was based on the original pleadings which remained unchanged for almost two years. Litigants should be allowed to change legal theories after a motion for summary judgment has been filed only in extraordinary cases. Therefore, the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>Court was within its discretion in denying the [defendants] leave to amend their answer, and we affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"An\"><em>Peuse, </em>275 Mont, at 228, 911 P.2d at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">\u00b635 The same result should be reached here. Although this matter is no longer before the District Court on a summary judgment motion, Aldrich will nonetheless be unduly prejudiced by reversal of the District Court on this issue. Pursuant to the Court\u2019s holding on Issue Two, this matter is being remanded for a recalculation of the amounts owing based upon claims which have already been litigated in the District Court and finally resolved by this Court on appeal. However, by allowing the Ellises to add a new claim and, presumably, for Aldrich to amend its pleadings to assert any defenses, the Court is re-opening the litigation, not simply to matters not settled by our decision, as it claims, but to a new claim not previously raised in the litigation. Thus, the Court is subjecting Aldrich to a claim which was previously and properly excluded from the proceedings. Re-opening the litigation for a new claim at this point, when the District Court did not abuse its discretion in previously denying the request, imposes substantial prejudice upon Aldrich.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">\u00b636 Finding substantial prejudice to Aldrich, and no abuse of discretion that would justify reversal of the District Court\u2019s denial of the motion to amend, I dissent from the Court\u2019s holding on Issue Three.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
