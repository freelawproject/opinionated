Contreras sued Sarah Fitzgerald in the Fourth Judicial District Court, Missoula County. Fitzgerald counterclaimed. The counterclaim is all that remains of the case. Both parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. On March 19, 2001, the Honorable John S. Henson granted Contreras\u2019 motion and denied Fitzgerald\u2019s motion. Fitzgerald appeals. We affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">\u00b62 The following issues are dispositive of this appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err when it concluded that Fitzgerald passed in a no-passing zone?</p>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err when it did not find Contreras negligent as a matter of law?</p>\n<p id=\"b279-12\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court err in finding that Fitzgerald\u2019s negligence exceeded the negligence that might be found on the part of Contreras?</p>\n<p id=\"b279-13\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b279-14\">\u00b66 On January 17,1999, Sarah Fitzgerald was driving the team van for the Glacier Nordic Junior Ski Team from Whitefish, Montana. She was returning from a competition in Idaho with her mother, Rhonda Fitzgerald, and six members of the ski team. They were traveling north on Highway 83 near Condon, Montana, when they found themselves behind a truck pulling snowmobiles.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-15\">\u00b67 When Fitzgerald came to a long, straight stretch of the highway, she attempted to pass the truck. As she came even with the pickup truck, she noticed Carmen Contreras\u2019vehicle approaching the highway from her left. Because Fitzgerald thought Contreras was approaching a stop sign, she continued traveling north in the southbound lane. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>roadway upon which Contreras was traveling, however, was not controlled by a stop sign, and she proceeded to turn into the southbound lane of Highway 83. The two vehicles collided head-on in the southbound lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">\u00b68 Approximately four-tenths of a mile before the scene of the accident, Fitzgerald had driven past a no-passing sign. The roadway was also marked with a double yellow line, which indicated a no-passing zone, but snow and gravel on the surface of the road made it difficult to see the markings. By her own admission, Fitzgerald had traveled this route approximately a hundred times before.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\u00b69 Contreras filed suit and Fitzgerald counterclaimed. All that remains of this matter is Fitzgerald\u2019s counterclaim. Both parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Contreras\u2019 motion asked the court to determine that Fitzgerald\u2019s negligence exceeded Contreras\u2019 as a matter of law, thus prohibiting any recovery on Fitzgerald\u2019s counterclaim. Fitzgerald\u2019s motion asked the court to find Contreras negligent as a matter of law. On March 19, 2001, the District Court granted Contreras\u2019 motion and denied Fitzgerald\u2019s motion. The court found, as a matter of law, that Fitzgerald was negligent and that her negligence exceeded any negligence that might be found on the part of Contreras. Fitzgerald appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">\u00b610 We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same evaluation under Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., as the district court. <em>See Vivier v. State Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>2001 MT 221, \u00b6 5, 306 Mont. 454, \u00b6 5, 35 P.3d 958, \u00b6 5; <em>Bruner v. Yellowstone County </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 261, 264, 900 P.2d 901, 903. In <em>Bruner, </em>we stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-8\">The movant must demonstrate that no genuine issues of material fact exist. Once this has been accomplished, the burden then shifts to the non-moving party to prove, by more than mere denial and speculation, that a genuine issue does exist. Having determined that genuine issues of fact do not exist, the court must then determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We review the legal determinations made by a district court as to whether the court erred. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEG\"><em>Bruner, </em>272 Mont, at 264-65, 900 P.2d at 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">\u00b611 Did the District Court err when it concluded that Fitzgerald had passed in a no-passing zone?</p>\n<p id=\"b281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>\u00b612  A vehicle may lawfully drive on the left half of a roadway when passing another vehicle only if the left side is clearly visible and free from oncoming traffic for a sufficient distance ahead. <em>See </em>\u00a7 61-8-325(1), MCA. In especially hazardous areas, however, the Department of Transportation may designate certain portions of the roadway as no-passing zones. <em>See </em>\u00a7 61-8-326(1), MCA. Where \u201csigns or markings on the roadway are in place and clearly visible to an ordinarily observant person, every driver of a vehicle shall obey the directions of those signs.\u201d Section 61-8-326(1), MCA. The District Court held that, because signs were posted and clearly visible, Fitzgerald passed in a no-passing zone. Fitzgerald contends, however, that road markings must be visible in addition to posted signs for a portion of roadway to be properly designated a no-passing zone. Since snow obscured the double yellow line, she argues that the portion of road in question was not a no-passing zone and that she could therefore lawfully pass under the requirements of \u00a7 61-8-325, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">\u00b613 Neither side disputes that no-passing signs were posted along the road. Also, both parties apparently agree that snow obscured the markings on the road. The dispute centers simply on whether both signs and markings must be in place and clearly visible in order to designate a no-passing zone under the plain language of \u00a7 61-8-326, MCA. Montana law defines no-passing zones as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-5\">No-passing zones. (1) The department of transportation may determine those portions of the highway where overtaking and passing or driving to the left of the roadway would be especially hazardous, and it may by appropriate signs <em>or </em>markings on the roadway indicate the beginning and end of these zones. When the signs <em>or </em>markings are in place and clearly visible to an ordinarily observant person, every driver of a vehicle shall obey the directions of those signs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-6\">(2) Where signs <em>or </em>markings are in place to define a no-passing zone as set forth in subsection (1) a driver may not drive on the left side of the roadway within the no-passing zone or on the left side of a pavement striping designed to mark the no-passing zone throughout its length. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Section 61-8-326, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">\u00b614 When we interpret a statute, our aim is \u201csimply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. Therefore, we determine legislative intent based on \u201cthe plain meaning of the language used by the Legislature.\u201d <em>In re R.L.S., </em>1999 MT 34, \u00b6 8, 293 Mont. 288, \u00b6 8, 977 P.2d 967, \u00b6 8. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>We must reasonably and logically interpret the statutory language, \u201cgiving words their usual and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Gallatin County v. District Court </em>(1997), 281 Mont. 33, 40, 930 P.2d 680, 685 (quoting <em>Werre v. David </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 376, 385, 913 P.2d 625, 631).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">\u00b615  Here, we agree with the District Court that \u00a7 61-8-326, MCA, does not require that both markings and signs be present to indicate a no-passing zone. The word \u201cor\u201d connotes a disjunctive particle, and it is used to express an alternative between two or more things. <em>See </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1095 (6th ed. 1990); <em>see also </em>American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 1271 (3d ed. 1996) (defining \u201cor\u201d as a conjunction used to denote an alternative). When a requirement contains a disjunctive, only one of the separately stated factors must exist. <em>See Meyer v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>2000 MT 323, \u00b6 17, 303 Mont. 1, \u00b6 17, 15 P.3d 899, \u00b6 17 (citing <em>American Family Mut. Ins. Co. v. Livengood, </em>1998 MT 329, \u00b6 16, 292 Mont. 244, \u00b6 16, 970 P.2d 1054, \u00b6 16). Therefore, we conclude from the plain language of \u00a7 61-8-326, MCA, that either signs or markings may designate a portion of road as a no-passing zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">\u00b616 Fitzgerald argues that requiring only signs to be visible is an unworkable standard because signs indicate the beginning of a no-passing zone but not the end. Requiring drivers to rely only on signs would mean that no-passing zones would effectively never end. Fitzgerald\u2019s interpretation, however, would render all roadways passing zones every time it snowed. The District Court noted these two choices as follows: \u201cFitzgerald essentially avers she may drive how and where she will because the road conditions are not optimal. When faced with such a dilemma, which is the safer, better choice: Pass or remain in your lane until it becomes clear that passing is both legal and safe?\u201d In Montana, where unfavorable weather conditions often exist in the winter, the belt and suspenders approach of requiring either signs or markings seems only logical to ensure that hazardous portions of the roadways remain properly marked as no-passing zones in adverse weather.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">\u00b617  Because \u00a7 61-8-326, MCA, clearly requires only that either signs or markings be present and visible, we conclude that the District Court did not err when it held that Fitzgerald passed in a no-passing zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">\u00b618 2. Did the District Court err when it did not find Contreras negligent as a matter of law?</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">\u00b619 A court may properly award summary judgment only when no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P; <em>Richardson v. Corvallis Pub. Sch. Dist. No. 1 </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 309, 311, 950 P.2d 748, 750 (citing <em>Wiley v. City of Glendive </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 213, 216, 900 P.2d 310, 312). Here, the District Court declined to grant Fitzgerald\u2019s motion for summary judgment. It held that whether Contreras was negligent was a question best left to the jury. Fitzgerald argues, however, that Contreras violated \u00a7\u00a7 61-8-341 &amp; -343, MCA, by failing to yield the right-of-way to Fitzgerald and is thus negligent as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">\u00b620  Section 61-8-341, MCA, provides that a vehicle entering a highway must yield the right of way to other vehicles that are approaching so closely that they constitute an immediate hazard. In turn, \u00a7 61-8-343, MCA, provides that a vehicle entering a highway \u201cshall yield the right-of-way to all vehicles approaching on said highway.\u201d A driver also cannot ignore obvious dangers by blindly relying on her right-of-way, but instead must maintain a proper lookout and use reasonable care. <em>See Roe v. Kornder-Owen </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 287, 291-92, 937 P.2d 39, 42. Only under extremely limited circumstances will a violation of a motor vehicle statute not constitute negligence as a matter of law. <em>See Craig v. Schell, </em>1999 MT 40, \u00b6 29, 293 Mont. 323, \u00b6 29, 975 P.2d 820, \u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">\u00b621 Fitzgerald maintains that by Contreras\u2019 own testimony, she admitted that Fitzgerald was approaching in the left lane with such closeness that Fitzgerald constituted an immediate hazard. Contreras\u2019 testimony included the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-6\">Question: And during that time I assume that since you were turning right you were also looking at the highway to your right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARq\">Contreras: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">Question: And as you did that, were these two vehicles that were approaching from your right still in your field of vision?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AnF\">Contreras: You mean could I see them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-8\">Question: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-9\">Contreras: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-10\">Question: And what did they do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-11\">Contreras: \u201cWhat did they do,\u201d as in where were they at?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azs\">Question: Yeah. You\u2019re watching them as you\u2019re taking your right-hand turn, pulling onto the highway. You\u2019re looking at these two vehicles. What did you see?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-12\">Contreras: At that point, when I started my turn, I saw that one vehicle was in my lane and one vehicle was in the other lane.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_P\">Fitzgerald contends that this shows that Contreras pulled directly into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>the path of Fitzgerald\u2019s oncoming car, with full knowledge that she was doing so. We can only conclude from this testimony, however, that Contreras saw Fitzgerald in the southbound lane when she started her turn. It is unclear if she saw Fitzgerald in the southbound lane before that. Contreras also went on to testify as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-4\">Question: All right. Did you feel that [Fitzgerald] had started the pass prior to you making the turn or after you making the turn?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASG\">Contreras: She -1 felt that she did it after I made the turn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Asg\">Question: Okay. And when you were making the right turn, did you feel comfortable or did you rely upon the fact that that was a no passing zone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-5\">Contreras: I did rely upon the fact that it was \u00e1 no passing zone, but I felt comfortable, you know, knowing that, too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-6\">Question: And when you looked, she was not passing at the time, the defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-7\">Contreras: Correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">\u00b622  When ruling on a motion for summary judgment, we should draw reasonable inferences from the evidence presented in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>See Spinier v. Allen, </em>1999 MT 160, \u00b6 16, 295 Mont. 139, \u00b6 16, 983 P.2d 348, \u00b6 16; <em>Montana Metal Bldgs., Inc. v. Shapiro </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 471, 474, 942 P.2d 694, 696. After reviewing the record, we remain uncertain about what occurred immediately preceding the accident. In particular, we cannot tell whether Fitzgerald had been traveling in the southbound lane for some time before Contreras pulled onto the highway, or whether Fitzgerald and Contreras pulled into the same lane simultaneously. How much time, if any, Contreras had to react and prevent the accident is unclear. A reasonable inference, however, is that Fitzgerald pulled into the southbound lane as Contreras was simultaneously pulling into the same lane. This may, or may not, be the case, but it is not our responsibility to decide. <em>See Hart-Anderson v. Hauck </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 444, 447, 781 P.2d 1116, 1118 (stating that it is not the job of the court to weigh conflicting evidence but the job of the trier of fact).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">\u00b623  \u201cSummary judgment is an extreme remedy and should never be substituted for trial if a material factual controversy exists.\u201d <em>Spinier, </em>\u00b6 16. Here, a material factual controversy remains concerning the collision. Therefore, we conclude that the District Court was correct in denying summary judgment on the issue of Contreras\u2019 negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b284-11\">\u00b624 3. Did the District Court err in finding that Fitzgerald\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>negligence exceeded the negligence that might be found on the part of Contreras?</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">\u00b625  Issues of comparative negligence are particularly difficult to resolve as a matter of law. <em>See Mead v. M.S.B., Inc. </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 465, 478, 872 P.2d 782, 790. Normally, the issue of contributory negligence and the degree of comparative negligence, if any, is an issue for the trier of fact to resolve, even if the opposing party is negligent as a matter of law. <em>See Pierce v. ALSO Architects, P.S. </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 97, 107, 890 P.2d 1254, 1260; <em>Okland v. </em>Wolf (1993), 258 Mont. 35, 42, 850 P.2d 302, 306-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">\u00b626 Here, the District Court granted Contreras\u2019 motion for summary judgment and concluded, as a matter of law, that Fitzgerald\u2019s negligence exceeded any negligence that the jury might find on the part of Contreras. Contreras maintains that this was the correct conclusion because of our holding in <em>Brohman v. State </em>(1988), 230 Mont. 198, 749 P.2d 67. According to Contreras, <em>Brohman </em>stands for the proposition that a driver who passes in a no-passing zone under poor roadway conditions and with limited ability to see or anticipate oncoming traffic bears the majority of the legal responsibility for his or her injuries as a matter of law, regardless of any negligence on the other driver\u2019s part. Contreras, however, misapplies our holding in <em>Brohman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">\u00b627 <em>Brohman </em>involved a driver, Brohman, who attempted to pass a slower moving vehicle while driving on intermittently snow packed roads. The portion of the highway on which Brohman attempted to pass contained a hump that prevented her from seeing oncoming traffic. As Brohman pulled into the left lane to pass, another vehicle, traveling in the opposite direction, crested the hump in the road. Neither driver could react quickly enough to avoid a head-on collision. As in the case before us, snow and ice obscured the no-passing markings on the roadway. <em>See Brohman, </em>230 Mont, at 199,749 P.2d at 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">\u00b628 Brohman sued the State alleging that it was negligent for careless and reckless design, construction and supervision of the highway. The district court granted the State\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment on the grounds that Brohman\u2019s negligence exceeded any negligence by the State. On appeal, we affirmed the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. Though we assumed negligence on the part of the State, we determined that reasonable minds must conclude that Brohman\u2019s negligence exceeded that of the State\u2019s. <em>See Brohman, </em>230 Mont, at 205, 749 P.2d at 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">\u00b629 While the circumstances surrounding the accidents in <em>Brohman </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>and the case before us are similar, the parties and their respective involvement in the collisions are quite different. In <em>Brohman, </em>the plaintiff sued the State for negligent design and maintenance of the highway. <em>See Brohman, </em>230 Mont, at 200, 749 P.2d at 69. The other driver\u2019s actions were never at issue. Here, however, it is the other driver involved in the accident that Contreras alleges was more negligent than she was as a matter of law. This presents a much different question of comparative negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">\u00b630 As we discussed above, we do not know whether Contreras was negligent, or even to what degree. Although we will infer some negligence on the part of Contreras when analyzing Contreras\u2019 motion for summary judgment, it is not clear from the evidence when the two cars pulled into the southbound lane in relation to each other. This determination is crucial in concluding which driver\u2019s negligence exceeded the other\u2019s. For example, we can imagine a situation where a jury could reasonably conclude from the evidence that, if Contreras knowingly turned directly into the path of Fitzgerald\u2019s oncoming car, Contreras\u2019 negligence would exceed that of Fitzgerald\u2019s. At the same time, a jury could reasonably conclude that Contreras is free from any negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">\u00b631  As we have discussed, the specific circumstances surrounding the accident remain unclear. It is sufficient to note that summary judgment is inappropriate when an issue of material fact remains. <em>See Pierce, </em>270 Mont, at 107, 890 P.2d at 1260. We thus conclude that the District Court erred in finding that Fitzgerald\u2019s negligence exceeded any negligence that may be found on the part of Contreras. Instead, this is a question that the court must submit to the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\u00b632 We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for a trial on Fitzgerald\u2019s counterclaim.</p>\n<judges id=\"b286-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b286-8\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER</author>\n<p id=\"AiF\">concurring and dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">\u00b633 I concur with the majority\u2019s conclusions that Carmen G. Contreras\u2019 negligence and the comparative negligence of the parties presented issues of fact which could not be decided by summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">\u00b634 I dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion that based on the undisputed facts in this case, the Counter-Plaintiff, Sarah Fitzgerald, made an illegal pass in a no-passing zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">\u00b635 The majority Opinion incompletely characterizes Fitzgerald\u2019s argument. It is true that she contends on appeal that \u00a7 61-8-326, MCA, required both markings and signs to indicate that the area where she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>operated her vehicle was a no-passirig zone. I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the requirement is stated in the alternative and that both signs and markings were not necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">\u00b636 However, Fitzgerald also argues on appeal that the markings were not clearly visible and that the one sign which was erected prior to the point of her collision with Contreras was not adequate to create a no-passing zone. With this argument I agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">\u00b637 Section 61-8-326, MCA, which is more fully set out in \u00b6 13 of the majority Opinion, states that no-passing zones may be established by the Department of Transportation through the use of either \u201csigns\u201d or \u201cmarkings on the roadway.\u201d However, subparagraph (1) of the statute also clearly requires that whether signs or markings are used, they must indicate \u201cthe beginning <em>and end </em>of these zones.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Subparagraph (2) limits the no-passing zone to situations where \u201csigns ... <em>define </em>a no-passing zone ....\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">\u00b638 It is significant that at all times referred to in \u00a7 61-8-326, MCA, \u201csigns\u201d are referred to in the plural. At no point does that statute suggest that one sign is an adequate alternative to markings on the roadway. The obvious reason is that one sign cannot mark the beginning \u201cand end\u201d of a passing zone and it does a driver such as Fitzgerald no good to know merely where the no-passing zone begins if she does not know (because the markings on the road were obscured) where the passing zone ends. For example, in this case, the collision occurred on a straight stretch of road with visibility for several miles. Other than for markings on the road or \u201csigns\u201d which clearly define the beginning and end of the no-passing zone, there was no way for Fitzgerald to know when the no-passing zone ended. Nor was there any apparent reason for her to assume she was in a no-passing zone at the time of her collision. According to the arguments made on appeal, the no-passing zone ended one-tenth of a mile later with no obvious reason for distinguishing that point on the road from where the collision occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">\u00b639 I would conclude that the point where Fitzgerald\u2019s collision with Contreras occurred, there were no markings on the road or \u201csigns\u201d which were clearly visible and sufficient to indicate the \u201cbeginning and end\u201d of the no-passing zone and that, therefore, Fitzgerald was not making an illegal pass at the time of her collision with Contreras. Whether she was otherwise negligent based on her common law duty to exercise reasonable care presented an issue of fact to be decided by the jury. Therefore, I would reverse the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Fitzgerald was negligent as a matter of law for passing in a no-passing zone and I dissent from the majority\u2019s failure to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>\u00b640 For these reasons, I concur in part and dissent in part from the majority Opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b288-4\">JUSTICE RICE</author>\n<p id=\"AUp\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">\u00b641 I concur with the Court\u2019s holdings on Issue 1 and Issue 2, but dissent from the holding on Issue 3. I agree with the District Court that Fitzgerald\u2019s negligence exceeded any negligence that might be found on the part of Contreras and would affirm the judgment entered herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">\u00b642 Although negligence is usually considered a question of fact to be resolved by trial, where reasonable minds cannot differ, negligence can be determined as a matter of law. <em>Pappas v. Midwest Motor Express, Inc. </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 347, 886 P.2d 918. In regard to causation, \u201cwhere the plaintiffs own negligence contributed to the accident or injury, proximate causation can be determined as a matter of law if the comparative negligence of the plaintiff exceeds the negligence of the defendant. ... This is so because if the plaintiffs own negligence exceeds the defendant\u2019s, the plaintiff could not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it was the defendant\u2019s negligence that proximately caused the injury.\u201d <em>Pappas, </em>268 Mont, at 351, 886 P.2d at 920 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">\u00b643 Driving on a highway she had traveled some 100 times previously, Fitzgerald drove by two clearly identifiable no-passing signs, initiated a pass in a no-passing zone without first observing anything indicating a resumption of the passing area, failed to properly account for the possibility of other vehicles entering the highway from intersecting roadways, executed the pass in road conditions poor enough that she could not identify highway markings, and' collided with Contreras \u25a0within the no-passing zone. In my view, \u201creasonable minds cannot differ\u201d that Fitzgerald\u2019s negligence exceeded any negligence which may be inferred on the part of Contreras, and constituted the proximate cause of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">\u00b644 Fitzgerald contends that Contreras violated \u00a7\u00a7 61-8-341 and 61-8-343, MCA, by failing to yield the right of way to Fitzgerald. Not explaining what \u201cright\u201d she could possibly have to be in the no-passing zone, Fitzgerald nonetheless claims that Contreras caused the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">\u00b645 The Court was faced with similar arguments in <em>Roe v. Kornder-Owen </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 287, 937 P.2d 39. There, Plaintiff Roe stopped at a stop sign and then proceeded into an intersection, where she collided with Defendant Kornder-Owen, who had advanced to the intersection while proceeding on a through street. Roe contended that Komder-Owen had negligently failed to maintain an adequate lookout <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>and yield the right of way after Roe had entered the intersection. The <em>Roe </em>Court, as the majority opinion notes, first explained that it was Komder-Owen\u2019s responsibility to not \u201cignore obvious dangers by blindly relying on her right-of-way ... but instead must maintain a proper lookout and use reasonable care.\u201d <em>Roe, </em>282 Mont, at 291-92,937 P.2d at 42 (citation omitted). However, the <em>Roe </em>Court went on to conclude:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-4\">However, the favored driver [Kornder-Owen] has the right to assume that the disfavored driver [Roe] will yield the right of way to her when the law so requires [citation omitted]. Therefore, it is not negligent for a motorist to fail to anticipate injury which can result only from a violation of law or duty by another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-5\">[W]e conclude that Kornder-Owen had the right to rely on Roe\u2019s compliance with \u00a7 61-8-341, MCA, and that she was not required to anticipate Roe\u2019s violation of that statute. Therefore, we hold as a matter of law that Roe was negligent for failing to comply with \u00a7 61-8-341, MCA, and that the predicate for imposition of a duty on Kornder-Owen to yield did not occur. To summarize, it was <em>Roe\u2019s </em>negligence, and <em>not </em>Kornder-Owen\u2019s, that caused the parties\u2019 collision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-6\"><em>Roe, </em>282 Mont, at 292, 937 P.2d at 42-43 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">\u00b646 Likewise, the predicate for imposition of the duty which Fitzgerald seeks to impose upon Contreras in this matter does not exist. Fitzgerald had no right to be in Contreras\u2019 pathway, and as in <em>Roe, </em>the law imposed no duty upon Contreras to anticipate Fitzgerald\u2019s violation of the statute that placed Fitzgerald there. Rather, Contreras had the right to rely on Fitzgerald\u2019s compliance with the statute. Furthermore, any negligence that could be inferred on the part of Contreras for failing to recognize that Fitzgerald was in her pathway when she turned onto the highway was clearly exceeded by the grossly negligent actions of Fitzgerald, detailed above. While courts must be careful about making such comparisons, the evidence here leaves no doubt in my mind that the District Court reached the correct conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">\u00b647 For these reasons, I would affirm the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
