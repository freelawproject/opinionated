We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">\u00b62 Appellant presents the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in its findings of fact regarding ownership of the equipment, and alteration or cancellation of the agreement?</p>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in its legal conclusion that Boustead was exonerated from liability under the leasing agreement?</p>\n<p id=\"b307-13\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b307-14\">\u00b65 Ace Leasing, Inc. (Ace), is a Montana corporation in the business of purchasing and leasing equipment to its customers for business purposes. Ace does not maintain an inventory of equipment, but rather, agrees to purchase equipment and thereafter to lease the equipment to its customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-15\">\u00b66 On April 13, 1998, Ace entered into an agreement entitled \u201ccommercial lease\u201d with Advantage Group, Inc., d/b/a Arma Coatings of Montana, a business operated by Tim O\u2019Neill (O\u2019Neill). The agreement provided that Ace would pay the supplier and retain title in equipment that O\u2019Neill would lease from Ace for use in his startup business applying coatings to truck beds, utility and horse trailers, boats and for other uses. The agreement also provided that O\u2019Neill would be responsible for ordering the equipment from the supplier \u201cfrom whom Lessor (Ace) is to purchase the equipment.\u201d The lease further provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-16\">It shall be Lessee\u2019s responsibility to order the specified equipment from the supplier and arrange for its installation. Lessee shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>provide to Lessor, at the time of ordering, a copy of the purchase order. Lessor shall pay the supplier upon delivery and/or installation of the equipment, provided that the Lessee and supplier have furnished the necessary information to complete the lease and/or security instruments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">\u00b67 Respondent, Mary Boustead (Boustead), became guarantor of the lease agreement, guaranteeing the performance of O\u2019Neill. Should O\u2019Neill fail to perform, the lease allowed Ace to proceed directly against Boustead without being first required to proceed against O\u2019Neill.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">\u00b68 Ace agreed to fund the lease in the amount of $45,000 and, under the terms of the agreement, O\u2019Neill was to make sixty monthly payments of $995 each, beginning May 15, 1998, equaling a total amount of $59,700. The estimated residual amount to be paid by O\u2019Neill at the end of the lease period if O\u2019Neill wished to own the equipment was $4,600.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">\u00b69 After entering into the agreement, Ace did not make direct payment to the supplier for the equipment ordered by O\u2019Neill, but rather, provided O\u2019Neill with a check in the amount of $45,000, which O\u2019Neill first deposited into his personal checking account and then transferred into a business account for Advantage Group. O\u2019Neill then purchased equipment with the funds, and also reimbursed himself for equipment that he had previously purchased with personal funds. As O\u2019Neill ordered and purchased the equipment directly from the suppliers, none of the purchase orders contained the name of Ace Leasing, Inc. Also, although the lease agreement provided the option for Ace to obtain a secured interest in the equipment, Ace did not exercise this option.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">\u00b610 O\u2019Neill\u2019s equipment did not arrive until approximately June 23, 1998, and he failed to make either the May or the June lease payments. Ace did not immediately demand payment in full after O\u2019Neill missed the May payment, but sent out a standard form letter to O\u2019Neill and to Boustead after the payment was more than ten days late, informing them that the payment had not been made and that it may have been overlooked. Ace subsequently contacted Boustead on or about June 22, 1998, informing her that neither the May nor the June payment had yet been made and that Ace was considering canceling the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">\u00b611 Ace then sent a letter dated June 25, 1998, to O\u2019Neill and Boustead stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-9\">Your lease... is now in default for lack of payments, and is hereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>canceled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-4\">Pursuant to option 10(a), demand is therefore made upon you to make immediate payment of all remaining lease payments and the residual payment, in the sum of $45,750.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\">In the event that you do not pay the stated sum by 7-6-98, Ace Leasing will take all legal steps to recover the equipment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">\u00b612 Neither O\u2019Neill nor Boustead made the payment as demanded. Rather, Ace and O\u2019Neill discussed the matter, and O\u2019Neill explained that the late payments were the result of the late arrival of the ordered equipment and that his business would soon be up and running. Ace then agreed to accept late payments and, on July 14, 1998, Ace accepted from O\u2019Neill an amount totaling three full payments plus late fees. Neither Ace nor O\u2019Neill informed Boustead that Ace had agreed to accept payments on the lease agreement subsequent to the cancellation letter. Boustead did not participate in or know that such discussions were taking place and did not know that O\u2019Neill would begin using the new equipment after the lease agreement had been canceled.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">\u00b613 Ace and O\u2019Neill continued discussions, and Ace again accepted a late payment on October 2, 1998, and another on October 23, 1998. Discussions continued through November, but O\u2019Neill was unable to make any further payments. Ace subsequently wrote to Boustead on December 14, 1998, informing her that O\u2019Neill had been consistently late making payments on the lease agreement and had only \u201cmade two payments since [Ace] canceled the lease in [its] June 25,1998 letter.\u201d Ace requested that Boustead pay off the lease by December 30, 1998, under her guarantor obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">\u00b614 Boustead refused to make payments on the lease as she believed that the cancellation letter and acceptance of late payments without her knowledge, as well as the method of purchasing the equipment, constituted a material change in the original agreement by Ace and a material change in her obligations as the guarantor of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"AWY\">\u00b615 Following a bench trial on May 30, 2000, the District Court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law determining that Boustead was exonerated as the guarantor pursuant to \u00a7 28-11-211, MCA, because of material changes in the agreement and material changes in Boustead\u2019s obligation as the guarantor. The District Court concluded that the cancellation letter and acceptance of late payments without Boustead\u2019s knowledge constituted a material alteration in the original agreement and in Boustead\u2019s obligation thereunder. The District Court also found that Boustead\u2019s risk was increased because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Ace did not have ownership of the equipment, finding that the transaction between Ace and O\u2019Neill constituted a loan rather than a lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">\u00b616 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous and gives due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses. Rule 52(a), M.R.Civ.P.; <em>Trifad Entertainment v. Anderson, </em>2001 MT 227, \u00b6 27, 306 Mont. 499, \u00b6 27, 36 P.3d 363, \u00b6 27 (citation omitted). In determining whether a court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous, we first review the record to see if the findings are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Trifad, </em>\u00b6 27. If the findings are supported by substantial evidence, we determine if the trial court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence. If substantial evidence exists and the effect of the evidence has not been misapprehended, this Court may nevertheless determine that a finding is clearly erroneous if a review of the record leaves the Court with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>Trifad, </em>\u00b6 27. The Court reviews conclusions of law to determine whether the trial judge\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Trifad, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">\u00b617 1. Did the District Court err in its findings of fact regarding ownership of the equipment, and alteration or cancellation of the agreement?</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">A. Ownership of the Equipment</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">\u00b618 The District Court found that O\u2019Neill owned the equipment rather than Ace, contrary to the express terms of the agreement. The District Court based this finding upon the agreed testimony of the parties that Ace did not purchase any equipment, but merely forwarded $45,000 in funds to O\u2019Neill, who then purchased the equipment in the name of bis company, Advantage Group. Additionally, no purchasing documents contained the name of Ace Leasing.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">\u00b619 Ace argues that the District Court erred regarding ownership for two reasons: the language of the lease agreement and the testimony of Boustead and O\u2019Neill. Ace notes that the lease language provides that \u201c[o]wnership of the equipment shall at all times remain in the Lessor, ... [and] the equipment is and shall remain the property of the Lessor until payment of the residual by Lessee.\u201d Ace argues that no evidence was offered to demonstrate otherwise. Ace further argues that O\u2019Neill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>and Boustead\u2019s testimony also supports the opposite finding-that Ace at all relevant times had and retained ownership of the equipment used in O\u2019Neill\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">\u00b620 Ace notes that O\u2019Neill asserted no ownership interest in the equipment, as evidenced by the following answers during cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-5\">Q. Whose equipment was it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">A. In what respect?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-7\">Q. Who owns it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-8\">A. Under the terms of the lease I would assume that it\u2019s A1 Geissler\u2019s [president of Ace Leasing, Inc.].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-9\">Q. Ace Leasing. So you simply wrote a check to purchase the equipment, but it was Ace Leasing\u2019s money; is that not correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATO\">A. Yes, for which I\u2019m indebted for it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-10\">Q. And you said some of the equipment you already had before you got any money from Ace Leasing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-11\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-12\">Q. You reimbursed yourself for that money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-13\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-14\">\u00b621 Ace also points to Boustead\u2019s cross-examination testimony wherein Boustead expressed no surprise that O\u2019Neill was not asserting ownership interest in the equipment. Ace claims that neither the testimony nor other evidence explained how title or ownership of the equipment could reside in anyone other than Ace, but rather, demonstrated agreement between the parties that Ace was indeed the owner of the equipment. Ace contends that if both parties agree that Ace owned the equipment, then the transaction was a lease rather than a loan, and Ace thus had the right to repossess the equipment if necessary. Therefore, Ace argues, it was clearly erroneous for the District Court to find that the equipment belonged to O\u2019Neill rather than Ace.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-15\">\u00b622 To support its finding that the equipment belonged to O\u2019Neill rather than Ace, the District Court had before it the testimony of A1 Geissler, O\u2019Neill, and Boustead, and the purchase orders reflecting payment by O\u2019Neill rather than Ace. Geissler, the president of Ace, testified that a reasonable person looking at the documentary evidence would conclude that the purchaser of the equipment was O\u2019Neill rather than Ace. O\u2019Neill testified consistently with Geissler:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-16\">Q. Was Ace Leasing, Inc.\u2019s name ever on any of the documents that could be ... that could be used as evidence of ownership of this equipment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>A. Other than the lease itself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-4\">Q. Other than this lease we\u2019re looking at. What about purchase orders?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-5\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">Q. What about invoices?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-7\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-8\">Q. What about canceled checks you used to pay for the equipment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-9\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-10\">Q. Whose name was on all of those documents that I\u2019ve just mentioned?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-11\">A. It would have been the Advantage Group, d/b/a Arma Coatings of Montana, probably my own signature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-12\">\u00b623 O\u2019Neill then testified that he received a check in the amount of $45,000 from Ace, and that, hypothetically, he could have used the money to purchase anything other than the business equipment. Further, the documentary evidence clearly demonstrates that O\u2019Neill used the money to purchase the business equipment in the name of his own company and personally signed the checks, purchase orders, and invoices. Ace\u2019s name appeared nowhere on any of the purchasing documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-13\">\u00b624 The purchase of the equipment in the instant matter is governed by \u00a7 30-2-101, et seq., MCA, Montana\u2019s statutory provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) covering transactions in goods. The transfer of title in goods is governed by \u00a7 30-2-401, et seq., MCA. Under this statutory framework, unless the agreement explicitly provides otherwise, the title of goods passes to the buyer at the \u201ctime and place\u201d at which the seller completes performance with reference to physical delivery of the goods. Section 30-2-401(2), MCA. As with many provisions under the UCC, the effect of the provisions can be varied by agreement between the parties. Section 30-1-102(3), MCA. We recognize, therefore, that parties can explicitly agree that title will pass in a manner other than that provided in \u00a7 30-2-401, et seq., MCA. \u00b625 In the instant matter, the agreement between Ace and O\u2019Neill did not explicitly provide an alternative method for the transfer of title different from the default provision passing title when seller completed performance by making physical delivery of the equipment. Arguably, the agreement implicitly provided an alternative method to transfer title from the seller to buyer by its provision that Ace would be the purchaser of the equipment subsequent to delivery and/or installation at O\u2019Neill\u2019s place of business and that Ace would retain ownership. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>This is reflected in the above quoted lease provision providing in part: \u201cLessor shall pay the supplier upon delivery and/or installation of the equipment, provided that the Lessee and supplier have furnished the necessary information to complete the lease and/or security instruments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">\u00b626 However, the question of whether the above lease provision \u201cexplicitly provides\u201d an alternative method to transfer title is immaterial as the facts establish that neither Ace nor O\u2019Neill\u2019s actions conformed to the pin-chase provision of the agreement. Thus, even if the agreement satisfied the \u201cexplicitly provides otherwise\u201d requirement to vary from the default UCC provisions, neither party acted in accordance with the agreement. Instead of Ace purchasing the equipment to effectuate transfer and receipt of title, O\u2019Neill purchased the equipment with a combination of his own funds and unfettered funds from Ace, thus defeating any explicit title transfer variance from the default provisions of the UCC. Consequently, as the purchaser, O\u2019Neill obtained title pursuant to \u00a7 30-2-401(2), MCA, upon the seller tendering delivery of the equipment to O\u2019Neill.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">\u00b627  The UCC defines \u201clease\u201d as a transfer of the right of possession and use of goods for a term in return for consideration. It defines \u201clessor\u201d as one who transfers the right of possession and use of goods under a lease. Sections 30-2A-103(j) and (p), MCA. A lessor cannot transfer the right of possession of property unless the lessor first has title to the property. As a consequence of Ace failing to obtain title by acting in conformance with the agreement, neither could Ace assume the role of lessor and, while retaining title and ownership, transfer to O\u2019Neill merely the right of possession and use of the equipment. Thus, absent the proper obtaining of title by Ace, the transaction effectively became a loan agreement between the parties with O\u2019Neill holding title to the equipment according to the default provisions of the UCC.</p>\n<p id=\"AkI\">\u00b628  We conclude, therefore, that under the foregoing law, the evidence presented to the District Court supports its finding that O\u2019Neill rather than Ace owned the equipment. Before it was substantial evidence, testimonial and documentary, that O\u2019Neill was the sole purchaser of the equipment in his own name, purchased with unfettered funds provided by Ace, contrary to the agreement\u2019s requirements that Ace would purchase the equipment by paying the supplier directly, retain title, and/or complete security instruments to protect its interest. Ace failed to comply with these requirements. We therefore hold that the District Court did not err in finding that O\u2019Neill owned the equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>B. Cancellation and Alteration of the Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">\u00b629 Ace argues that the District Court erred in concluding that its actions constituted an alteration of the lease agreement. The undisputed facts show that Ace sent, and O\u2019Neill and Boustead received, the June 25, 1998, cancellation letter, which stated unequivocally that the lease was in default for lack of payment and thereby canceled. The letter demanded payment in full by July 6,1998, or Ace would take all legal steps necessary to recover the equipment. It is also undisputed that Ace did not take any legal action when payment was not made by July 6, 1998. Rather, Ace entered into discussions with O\u2019Neill and agreed to accept a payment from O\u2019Neill on July 14, 1998, totaling three monthly payments under the lease agreement. Neither Ace nor O\u2019Neill informed Boustead prior to July 14 that Ace intended to accept late payments, nor was she informed that the lease agreement was no longer considered canceled by either Ace and O\u2019Neill. Ace again accepted a payment from O\u2019Neill in September and two more payments in October without Boustead\u2019s knowledge, and also continued discussions with O\u2019Neill into November regarding the possibility of future payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\u00b630 The District Court concluded that the foregoing undisputed facts, in addition to the circumstances surrounding the purchase of the equipment, constituted material alterations of Boustead\u2019s original obligation and material alterations in the original lease agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"Ap0\">\u00b631 Ace argues that this conclusion is error as no evidence was presented to demonstrate the existence of a new agreement subsequent to the June 25,1998, cancellation letter. Ace notes that no evidence was offered showing additional consideration or showing a valid and binding new agreement, nor did the evidence reveal additional terms or new parties or any different amounts owed. Ace contends that the evidence merely demonstrated an acceptance of late payments under the original agreement, a circumstance provided for within the lease agreement and an event that cannot be said to constitute the basis of a new agreement. Ace adds that any modification subsequent to the cancellation letter, even if it had indeed been agreed upon, would have been oral rather than written, and therefore invalid pursuant to \u00a7 28-2-1602, MCA, as an unexecuted oral agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">\u00b632 We agree with Ace that evidence of consideration, of additional parties, of different amounts, or of a written modification of the original agreement is lacking, and consequently, that there is no evidence of a new and valid agreement. We do not agree, however, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>the District Court lacked substantial evidence to conclude that the actions of Ace constituted a material alteration of the original lease agreement that could affect Boustead\u2019s interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">\u00b633  Clearly, Ace gave notice of cancellation of the original lease agreement, as evidenced in its June 25,1998, letter. After its deadline for paying off the lease had passed, Ace entered into discussions with O\u2019Neill, without the knowledge of Boustead, and agreed to continue accepting payments under the agreement. Further, as demonstrated earlier, Ace also failed to comply with the terms of the lease requiring it to purchase the equipment, retain ownership and/or secure its interest. Based on the foregoing, we hold that the District Court had substantial evidence to conclude that the actions of Ace constituted material alterations in the original lease agreement as affecting Boustead.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">\u00b634 2. Did the District Court err in its legal conclusion that Boustead was exonerated from liability under the leasing agreement?</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">\u00b635 Section 28-11-211, MCA (2001), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-7\">A guarantor is exonerated ... if by any act of the creditor without the consent of the guarantor the original obligation of the principal is altered in any respect or the remedies or rights of the creditor against the principal in respect thereto are in any way impaired or suspended.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">\u00b636 The District Court exonerated Boustead pursuant to the above statute, concluding that ownership of the equipment by O\u2019Neill, rather than Ace, as well as the notice of cancellation and acceptance of late payments, constituted material alterations of Boustead\u2019s original obligations, thereby increasing Boustead\u2019s risk beyond that which she originally agreed. In so concluding, the District Court relied on our language in <em>United States Building &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n v. Burns </em>(1931), 90 Mont. 402, 422, 4 P.2d 703, 708, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-9\">If the creditor without the consent of the surety does any act which, in contemplation of law, <em>alters the surety\u2019s liability, increases his risk, </em>or deprives him even for a moment of the right to pay the debt and assume the position of the creditor, or of his right to seek indemnity, the surety is thereby discharged and the fact that the surety may not have been actually injured is immaterial. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">\u00b637 The current version of \u00a7 28-11-211, MCA, was enacted in 1895 and has never been amended. In <em>Burns, </em>we discharged the obligations of a surety under a mortgage where the creditor and principal, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>the knowledge of the surety, altered the original mortgage agreement with a separate, valid agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">\u00b638 In so holding, we found persuasive the following language of the supreme court of South Dakota construing a statute identical to \u00a7 28-11-211, MCA: \u201cGenerally a surety is discharged if the creditor deprives him of any right which he would have against the principal, even though he be benefitted, whether such injury arises from some positive act, or omitting to do something which it was the duty of the creditor to perform.\u201d <em>Bums, </em>90 Mont, at 423,4 P.2d at 708-09 <em>(citing Hampe v. Manke </em>(1912), 28 S.D. 501, 507, 134 N.W. 60, 62 (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"Al6\">\u00b639 Ace argues that the manner of purchase of the equipment cannot be grounds for Boustead\u2019s exoneration since O\u2019Neill used the $45,000 for the intended equipment rather than expending it on improper expenditures, and because O\u2019Neill\u2019s testimony demonstrated that he did not feel free to sell the equipment. Therefore, Ace contends, its actions did not increase the risk to Boustead.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\u00b640 Ace further argues that mere delay in exercising its remedy for O\u2019Neill\u2019s default is not grounds for exoneration. Ace argues that it did nothing more than to begin exercising one of its remedies (cancellation), without carrying that remedy through to its conclusion until after accepting a number of late payments according to the original contract. Ace points to \u00a7 28-11-213, MCA, which provides that \u201c[m]ere delay on the part of a creditor to proceed against the principal or to enforce any other remedy does not exonerate a guarantor.\u201d Mere delay, Ace claims, formed part of the belief by the District Court that a new agreement had been formed and that Boustead should be exonerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">\u00b641 Finally, Ace contends that acceptance of the late payments constituted mitigation of damages after O\u2019Neill\u2019s default, an obligation placed upon Ace under Montana law requiring a non-defaulting party to act in such a manner so as not to unnecessarily enlarge damages caused by default.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">\u00b642 Based upon the above arguments, in addition to denying the formation of any subsequent valid agreement which altered the original, Ace argues that there was never a moment when Boustead lost the ability to pay the debt to Ace and assume the position of the creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">\u00b643 We agree that mere delay of the creditor in exercising its remedy is not grounds for exoneration and that Montana law requires mitigation after default. We further agree that no subsequent, valid agreement has been demonstrated and that Boustead could still have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>paid the debt and assumed the position of creditor. But such arguments miss the critical point here.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">\u00b644  Section 28-11-211, MCA, protects the remedies and rights of the guarantor against the principal, in this case the lessee, by preventing the creditor from impairing or suspending its own rights and remedies against the principal, thereby altering the risk agreed to by the guarantor. This is because a guarantor is in no better position and has no greater rights than that of the creditor. See <em>Burns, </em>90 Mont, at 422, 4 P.2d at 708; <em>Moore v. White </em>(Ok. 1979), 603 P.2d 1119, 1121. Thus, when a creditor impairs or suspends its own rights and remedies under an agreement, it also impairs or suspends the rights and remedies of the guarantor.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">\u00b645 In the instant case, Ace was to retain ownership of the equipment under the agreement and/or secure its interest, thereby retaining the right and remedy of non-judicial repossession of the equipment upon default. Because Ace did not retain ownership or properly secure the equipment, then neither could Boustead, by paying the debt and substituting herself as creditor, claim title or ownership of the equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">\u00b646  It is clear, therefore, that Ace impaired or suspended its rights and remedies against O\u2019Neill and, without Boustead\u2019s consent, impaired or suspended Boustead\u2019s rights as well. This is sufficient to exonerate Boustead as the guarantor pursuant to \u00a7 28-11-211, MCA, as it deprived Boustead of her rights and remedies as owner or a secured creditor upon her payment of the debt, a right provided to her under the agreement. Boustead, therefore, no longer retained the bargained-for means of preventing the loss she had guaranteed by way of non-judicial repossession of the equipment, thereby altering her liability and increasing her risk. \u201c[A] surety is discharged if the creditor deprives him of any right he would have against the principal ....\u201d <em>Burns, </em>90 Mont, at 423, 4 P.2d at 708. Boustead was so deprived herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">\u00b647  Statutory language must be construed according to its plain meaning and, if the language is clear and unambiguous, no further interpretation is required. <em>Infinity Ins. Co. v. Dodson, </em>2000 MT 287, \u00b6 46, 302 Mont. 209, \u00b6 46, 14 P.3d 487, \u00b6 46. Ace argues that the District Court erred in interpreting \u00a7 28-11-211, MCA, because no actions of Ace deprived Boustead of her ability to pay the debt and assume the position of creditor. We conclude that Ace\u2019s actions materially impaired Boustead\u2019s rights and remedies, and according to the statute\u2019s plain meaning, exonerated Boustead as the guarantor of the lease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">\u00b648 The decision of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b318-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON and COTTER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b318-6\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER</author>\n<p id=\"AOF\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">\u00b649 I dissent from the majority Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">\u00b650 The majority Opinion exalts form over substance to determine title to the leased property contrary to the written terms of the parties\u2019 contract and the testimony of the only two parties capable of claiming title. Based on the record, I would conclude that there was no material alteration to the parties\u2019 agreement nor were the guarantor\u2019s remedies impaired in violation of \u00a7 28-11-211, MCA. Therefore, I would conclude that the District Court erred and reverse the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">\u00b651 The parties agreed that Advantage Group would order equipment for which Ace Leasing would pay, that Ace Leasing would retain title to the equipment and that Advantage Group would make lease payments to Ace Leasing. The parties\u2019 agreement also provided that in the event payments were not made on schedule, Ace Leasing had certain remedies which it could but need not enforce and that if it did not enforce its right to declare the agreement in default, it would be entitled to a late charge of $15 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">\u00b652 Advantage Group did order equipment from the supplier and apparently, for convenience sake, paid for some of it. Ace then sent the money with which Advantage Group paid the balance due for the equipment and reimbursed itself for the amount it had previously paid. There is nothing about this arrangement that changed the parties\u2019 agreement that Ace would own the equipment. Tim O\u2019Neill, on behalf of Advantage, testified that Ace owned the equipment. A1 Geissler, on behalf of Ace Leasing, testified that Ace owned the equipment. The parties\u2019 contract provided that Ace owned the equipment and no one else was in a position to claim title to the equipment. There was no written document of title and there were no security documents pursuant to Article IX of the Uniform Commercial Code because there was nothing to secure. Ace owned the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">\u00b653 The only evidence relied on by the majority to affirm the District Court\u2019s finding that Advantage owned the property was the paperwork which resulted from transactions between Advantage and the suppliers from whom the property was purchased. However, invoices and bills of sale do not establish title. The contract between the parties and their stated intentions determine title.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>\u00b654 The majority notes in \u00b6 9 that Ace did not obtain a security interest in the property. However, that fact is of no significance. There was nothing to secure. It was always the parties\u2019 intention that Ace would own the property. The only departure from what was originally agreed upon was that instead of Ace paying the supplier directly, it forwarded the money to Advantage which then paid the supplier. The difference was merely a matter of form \u2014 not of substance. It was not a material alteration of the parties\u2019 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">\u00b655 The majority\u2019s discussion in \u00b6\u00b6 24 to 27 about the affect of the UCC on determination of title is a mere afterthought which was neither discussed by either party nor relied on by the District Court, and is an effort to justify the erroneous conclusion already reached by the majority. Furthermore, it was not previously discussed nor relied on for good reason. Section 30-2-401(2), MCA, has nothing to do with the arrangement between Ace and O\u2019Neill. Its purpose is to establish the respective rights of the seller and the buyer. Here there is no dispute between the seller and the buyer. The issue is \u201cwho was the buyer?\u201d The answer, based on the undisputed evidence, is that Ace was the buyer because by agreement between Ace and O\u2019Neill, Ace advanced money to buy the equipment which, pursuant to that agreement, it then owned. Everything else said on the subject is superfluous rhetoric to justify the majority\u2019s result.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">\u00b656 The only other basis for the District Court\u2019s decision was its finding that by accepting late payments from Advantage, Ace Leasing also altered the terms of its lease agreement and that that somehow was to Boustead\u2019s disadvantage. Apparently, the majority does not base its Opinion on that finding. However, it is worth noting that neither was that finding correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">\u00b657 The lease agreement provided in Paragraph 10 for Ace\u2019s remedies upon default by Advantage. Importantly, the agreement provided that \u201c[a]ny failure by Lessor to exercise any right set forth in this lease, or otherwise, shall not constitute a waiver of that right at any time.\u201d The contract clearly also anticipated that the lessor could decline to exercise its right to declare the contract in default and in the alternative do exactly what was done by Ace in this case. Paragraph 15 provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-7\">In the event Lessee fails to pay when due any part to the rent herein reserved, ... and the Lessor has not exercised any of its other rights pursuant to paragraph 10 within ten (10) days after the due date thereof, Lessee shall pay to the Lessor a late charge of fifteen (15) dollars for each month or part thereof for which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>rent or other sum shall be delinquent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">\u00b658 Not only was Ace in complete compliance with the original terms of the agreement when it chose not to exercise its right to terminate the contract for Advantage\u2019s late payment, it was to Boustead\u2019s advantage that Ace actually collected about $4,500 from Advantage. That was $4,500 that Boustead did not have to pay once Advantage was finally declared in default.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">\u00b659 Although I have no quarrel with the District Court\u2019s nor this Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 28-11-211, MCA, I would conclude that there have been no facts proven in this case which would warrant its application. I would conclude that there was no evidence that the original obligation of the principal was altered in any respect or that the remedies of the creditor were in any way impaired with regard to the original agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">\u00b660 Contrary to the majority Opinion, Ace did not agree to secure its ownership interest pursuant to Article IX of the Uniform Commercial Code. I do not know of any way it could have secured property that it already owned. Therefore, Boustead could not have been disadvantaged by its failure to do so and, contrary to the majority\u2019s conclusion, she remained at all times in the same position she bargained for when she signed the original guarantee agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">\u00b661 For these reasons, I dissent from the majority Opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
