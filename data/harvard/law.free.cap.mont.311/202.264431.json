Adams filed a petition for postconviction relief which raised ineffective assistance of counsel and a constitutional challenge to his enhanced sentence for the use of a dangerous weapon during the commission of the aggravated assault. The District Court denied Adams\u2019 petition and Adams appeals. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred when it denied Adams\u2019 petition for postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">\u00b63 On October 2,1998, the State charged Adams by information with attempted deliberate homicide, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-4-103, MCA; obscuring the identity of a machine, a misdemeanor, in violation of \u00a7 45-6-326, MCA; possession of a switchblade knife, a misdemeanor, in violation of \u00a7 45-8-331, MCA; criminal possession of dangerous drugs, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-9-102, MCA; and criminal possession of drug paraphernalia, a misdemeanor, in violation of \u00a7 45-10-103, MCA. With the aid of his court-appointed counsel, Adams pled not guilty to all of the charges on October 28,1998. On May 20,1999, Adams\u2019 counsel filed a motion to withdraw which the District Court subsequently granted. Adams agreed to waive his right to a speedy trial until substitute counsel could proceed. The District Court appointed substitute counsel for Adams in approximately June of1999.</p>\n<p id=\"AM\">\u00b64 The case proceeded to a jury trial on September 20, 1999. On September 21, 1999, the jury found Adams guilty of aggravated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>assault, a lesser included offense of attempted deliberate homicide; not guilty of obscuring the identity of a machine; guilty of possession of a switchblade knife; guilty of criminal possession of dangerous drugs; and guilty of criminal possession of drug paraphernalia. Following a sentencing hearing on December 1,1999, the District Court sentenced Adams to twenty years in the Montana State Prison for the aggravated assault conviction, five years in the Montana State Prison for the criminal possession of dangerous drugs conviction; six months in the Ravalli County Detention Center for the possession of a switchblade knife conviction; and six months in the Ravalli County Detention Center for the possession of drug paraphernalia conviction. Pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-221, MCA, the District Court sentenced Adams to an additional ten years in the Montana State Prison for using a \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d during the commission of the aggravated assault. The District Court ordered the sentences to run consecutively and precluded Adams from parole eligibility until he attained the age of sixty-five.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">\u00b65 On February 24,2000, Adams\u2019 attorney drafted a letter to Adams which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\">[U]pon reviewing your case, I do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for an appeal. If you still want to appeal your case you need to contact Mr. William Hooks of the state appellate defender office in Helena, Montana, who will review your case for any possible appellate issues. Also, you need to file any notice of your appeal to the Montana Supreme Court within ten days after you receive this copy of your judgement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">On March 1, 2000, Adams\u2019 counsel filed a motion entitled \u201cDefense Attorney\u2019s Motion to be Removed as Counsel of Record\u201d which insisted that \u201cno reasonable avenues of appeal\u201d existed. The District Court ordered Adams to respond to his attorney\u2019s motion within ten days of receiving service of the motion. Adams failed to respond to the motion and on March 29, 2000, the District Court removed Adams\u2019 attorney as counsel of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">\u00b66 On October 16, 2000, Adams, acting pro se, filed a petition for postconviction relief in the District Court. Adams\u2019 petition alleged ineffective assistance of his original court-appointed counsel due to that attorney\u2019s failure to file a motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial. Adams\u2019 petition also alleged ineffective assistance of his subsequently appointed trial counsel for (1) offering a lesser included instruction on aggravated assault to the jury and (2) failing to file an appeal to this Court following Adams\u2019 convictions. Finally, Adams\u2019 petition alleged that the District Court imposed the sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>enhancement for use of a dangerous weapon in violation of his constitutional rights. Therefore, Adams requested that the District Court set aside the aggravated assault conviction and sentence enhancement. On January 3, 2001, the District Court denied Adams\u2019 petition for postconviction relief. Adams appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">\u00b67 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for postconviction relief to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law are correct. <em>State v. Hanson, </em>1999 MT 226, \u00b6 9, 296 Mont. 82, \u00b6 9, 988 P.2d 299, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">\u00b68 Did the District Court err when it denied Adams\u2019 petition for postconviction relief?</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">\u00b69 Adams argues that \u00a7 46-8-103, MCA, clearly requires that appointed counsel continue representation until final judgment, which includes appellate review by this Court, unless counsel is relieved by court order. Adams recognizes that the District Court entered an order purporting to relieve his attorney of continued representation. However, Adams maintains that his attorney failed to comply with the mandatory statutory procedure for withdrawal from appointed representation. Therefore, Adams insists that the withdrawal was ineffective, and that his attorney was therefore obligated to pursue a direct appeal. He further contends that his attorney\u2019s failure to pursue a direct appeal constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. Consequently, Adams claims that he should not have been barred from raising the relevant issues for review in postconviction relief proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">\u00b610 The District Court cited \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA, and <em>Kills on Top v. State </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 32, 901 P.2d 1368, for the proposition that claims which could reasonably have been raised on direct appeal are procedurally barred from consideration in postconviction proceedings. The District Court noted that Adams had sixty days from the entry of judgment to file a direct appeal pursuant to Rule 5(b), M.R.App.P. The District Court determined that \u201cAdams failed to file an appeal to the Montana Supreme Court within the specified 60-day period, and furthermore, has offered the Court no reasons for his failure to do so.\u201d Therefore, the District Court concluded that Adams is \u201cbarred from making his claim for postconviction relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">\u00b611 We are aware of the principle contained in \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA, that \u201cgrounds for relief that were or could reasonably have been raised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>on direct appeal may not be raised, considered, or decided in a [postconviction relief] proceeding ....\u201d However, this principle must be observed in conjunction with a defendant\u2019s right to the effective assistance of counsel on a first appeal. <em>See Hans v. State </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 379, 408, 942 P.2d 674, 691-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">\u00b612 Section 46-8-103(1), MCA, governs the duration of appointed representation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">When counsel has been assigned, the assignment is effective until final judgment, including any proceeding upon direct appeal to the Montana supreme court, unless relieved by order of the court that assigned counsel or that has jurisdiction over the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Abq\">Section 46-8-103(2), MCA, is a codification of the <em>Anders v. California </em>(1967), 386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493, procedure which appointed counsel must undertake to withdraw from appellate representation. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">If counsel finds the defendant\u2019s case on appeal to be wholly frivolous, counsel shall advise the court of that fact and request permission to withdraw. The request to withdraw must be accompanied by a memorandum referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal. The defendant is entitled to receive a copy of counsel\u2019s memorandum and to file a reply with the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Section 46-8-103(2), MCA. In <em>State v. Rogers, </em>2001 MT 165, \u00b6 27, 306 Mont. 130, \u00b6 27, 32 P.3d 724, \u00b6 27, we stated that \u201c[fjollowing the <em>Anders </em>procedure protects a defendant\u2019s right to effective assistance of counsel on appeal.\u201d A logical extension of this statement is the converse notion, i.e., a failure to follow the <em>Anders </em>procedure frustrates the right to effective assistance of counsel on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">\u00b613 As indicated above, Adams\u2019 trial counsel filed a motion to withdraw on March 1, 2000. This same attorney also drafted a letter advising Adams to contact the Appellate Defender\u2019s Office in the event he wanted to pursue an appeal. On March 7, 2000, the District Court ordered Adams to respond to his attorney's motion. Adams failed to respond to the motion and the District Court removed Adams\u2019 attorney from the case on March 29, 2000. The State contends that Adams sufficiently understood the consequences of inaction and had ample opportunity to preserve his right to direct appeal. Since Adams failed to respond, the State insists that Adams voluntarily waived his right to appeal and is, thus, barred from raising the relevant issues in postconviction relief proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">\u00b614 The State admits that Adams\u2019 attorney \u201conly partially complied with the procedure set forth in \u00a7 46-8-103, in that his request to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>withdraw was not accompanied by a \u2018memorandum referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal.\u2019\u201d Nevertheless, the State attempts to justify this oversight with its notification and voluntary waiver position. We cannot accept the State\u2019s proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">\u00b615 We do not believe that Article II, Section 24, of the Montana Constitution and its supporting statutory and case law contemplate \u201cpartial compliance\u201d with those procedural safeguards designed to preserve a litigant\u2019s right to appeal and right to effective assistance of counsel on appeal. In fact, \u00a7 46-8-103(2), MCA, provides that appointed counsel \u201cmust\u201d include the requisite memorandum with his or her motion to withdraw. This compulsory language contains no ambiguity which might support the State\u2019s \u201cpartial compliance\u201d theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">\u00b616 The accompanying memorandum requirement in \u00a7 46-8-103(2), MCA, serves a vital function. It notifies prospective pro se litigants of potentially viable issues for appellate review. It also provides assistance to a court deliberating over the merit of a motion to withdraw from appellate representation. As we stated in <em>Rogers, </em>\u00b6 26, \u201ca defendant\u2019s right to appellate counsel must be safeguarded and allowing counsel to be the final judge of the merits of an appeal does not adequately safeguard this right.\u201d The State\u2019s \u201cpartial compliance\u201d proposition would effectively transfer the legal practitioner\u2019s statutory obligation to the untrained and unsuspecting pro se litigant. In light of the potential consequences, we believe this is too high a burden to place upon someone unfamiliar with the nuances of appellate procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">\u00b617  In short, Adams\u2019 attorney failed to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 46-8-103(2), MCA, and, therefore, could not effect a valid withdrawal. It follows that since Adams\u2019 counsel did not effect a valid withdrawal and did not file a notice of appeal on Adams\u2019 behalf, Adams\u2019 trial counsel failed to preserve Adams\u2019 right to appeal. Failure to preserve a defendant\u2019s right to appeal when he has requested notice be filed is error. <em>Rogers, </em>\u00b6 24. And when, but for counsel's deficient performance, defendant would have appealed, such error is prejudicial. <em>Rogers, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">\u00b618  The State argues that \u201cit cannot be said that, but for counsel\u2019s failure to file a memorandum, Adams would have appealed.\u201d With his petition for postconviction relief, Adams filed an \u201cAffidavit in Support of Petition for Postconviction Relief.\u201d In the affidavit, Adams states, \u201cAfter affiant was sentenced by this court, on or about December 1, 1999, affiant requested that [his attorney] appeal his conviction to the Montana Supreme Court and [his attorney] failed to do so.\u201d Further, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>on appeal, Adams contends that the letter from his attorney and the District Court\u2019s order which demanded a response to his attorney\u2019s motion contained conflicting information which led him to believe that his opportunity to file a notice of appeal had expired. We conclude that there is. sufficient evidence in the record to indicate that but for counsel\u2019s deficient performance, Adams would have filed an appeal. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court erred when it denied Adams\u2019 petition for postconviction relief as procedurally noncompliant. \u00b619 In <em>Hans, </em>283 Mont, at 410, 942 P.2d at 693, we held that all claims foreclosed from appeal because of counsel\u2019s abandonment on appeal may be raised in a postconviction petition. Therefore, the exclusionary language in \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA, does not apply to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">\u00b620 Generally, a postconviction relief procedure is civil in nature and there is no constitutional requirement that counsel be appointed. <em>State v. Bromgard </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 170,175, 948 P.2d 182,185. However, Adams would have been entitled to counsel on direct appeal and should not be precluded from such representation throughout the postconviction proceedings simply because his trial counsel failed to preserve his direct appeal. Section 46-8-101(3)(c), MCA, provides that a \u201cdefendant, if unable to employ counsel, is entitled to have counsel assigned if the interests of justice would be served by assignment.\u201d Here, in the interests of justice, we conclude that Adams is entitled to appointed counsel throughout the course of postconviction proceedings on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">\u00b621 Although the District Court determined that Adams\u2019 petition was procedurally barred, it proceeded to analyze the merits of the allegations contained therein. However, Adams did not have the benefit of counsel in preparing his petition for postconviction relief. Therefore, on remand, the District Court must consider anew, upon briefs filed by counsel, the substantive issues presented for review. \u00b622 In <em>Petition of Hans, </em>1998 MT 7, 288 Mont. 168, 958 P.2d 1175 <em>(Hans II), </em>a case procedurally similar to the one at bar, we delineated what substantive issues a party could present for review in postconviction proceedings in cases such as this. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">[I]n the future, a defendant whose counsel has abandoned his or her appeal should raise, in one petition for postconviction relief, the claim that counsel was ineffective in abandoning the appeal, all claims that could have been raised on direct appeal, <em>and </em>all claims that would normally be appropriate in a petition for postconviction relief, including challenges to the validity of the sentence under \u00a7 46-21-101, MCA, and other ineffective assistance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-4\"><em>Hans II, </em>\u00b6 19. However, in <em>Hans II, </em>we indicated that we had already ruled on the ineffective assistance allegation for abandoning the direct appeal. Therefore, on remand, Hans was given leave to raise two types of issues in his amended petition for postconviction relief: (1) those issues that could have been raised in a direct appeal but for counsel\u2019s abandonment of his appeal; and (2) those issues properly raised in a petition for postconviction relief that have not already been raised. <em>Hans II, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">\u00b623 As in <em>Hans II, </em>we have already ruled on Adams\u2019 allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to preserve his direct appeal. Accordingly, on remand, Adams is given leave to raise those direct appeal and postconviction relief issues delineated in <em>Hans II. </em>In summary, we reverse the District Court\u2019s judgment to the extent it concluded that Adams\u2019 petition for postconviction relief was procedurally barred. We remand this case for the appointment of counsel and for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b229-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, REGNIER and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
