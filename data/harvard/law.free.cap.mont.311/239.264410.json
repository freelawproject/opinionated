Reserving her right to appeal the suppression issue, Logan pled guilty to misdemeanor possession of dangerous drugs and the court entered judgment against her. Logan appeals. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">\u00b62 Logan states the issue on appeal as whether police officers violated her right to be free from unlawful search and seizure. We address only the narrow and dispositive question of whether exigent circumstances support the officers\u2019 warrantless search of her purse and the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">\u00b63 On the evening of November 8, 1998, Billings, Montana, police officer Jason Sery made a traffic stop of a white Camaro for failure to have the rear license plate illuminated-a misdemeanor under \u00a7\u00a7 61-9-204(3) and 61-9-511, MCA. Sery recognized the driver of the Camaro as Dennis Kubas, an individual with whom he had had previous dealings and who had a history of carrying weapons and of violence with police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">\u00b64 Because of Kubas\u2019 history, Sery called for backup and waited for a second officer to arrive before approaching the Camaro. According to Sery, the slats on the rear window of the Camaro prevented him from observing any movement within the car. When the second officer arrived, Sery obtained identification from Kubas and from passengers Richard Miller and Logan. Sery did not smell or observe any illegal drugs or drug paraphernalia; nor did he observe any behavior that led him to believe any of the vehicle\u2019s occupants were under the influence of drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">\u00b65 Sery returned to his patrol car and ran a check for outstanding warrants on all three occupants of the Camaro, learning that all three had past drug arrests and that an \u201cextreme officer caution\u201d alert was in effect for Kubas. Sery then specifically called for K-9 Officer Steve Feuerstein and his drug dog, Igor, to respond to the scene. Sery testified he called for the K-9 unit primarily for officer safety reasons-because there were three persons in the vehicle and only two officers present. The District Court subsequently found this testimony \u201cunpersuasive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">\u00b66 When Feuerstein and Igor arrived, Sery asked all three occupants to get out of the Camaro and, dining a pat-down search, the officers took a 3- to 4-inch hunting knife from Kubas. Sery testified that, after the pat-down, he wrote Kubas a citation for failing to have the rear license plate illuminated. At the same time, Feuerstein walked Igor around the outside of the Camaro.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>\u00b67 Igor \u201calerted\u201d to the passenger side door of the car by barking and scratching. Sery removed a purse from the back seat of the car-where Logan had been seated-and searched it, finding a \u201csnort tube\u201d and a bindle made of notebook paper. Igor was then allowed to enter the car, where he alerted to the center console between the front seats. There, Feuerstein found two more bindles of notebook paper containing a white powdery substance which tested positive for methamphetamine. Sery arrested Logan and the State of Montana subsequently charged her with felony possession of dangerous drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">\u00b68 Logan moved to suppress the evidence, arguing primarily that Sery did not have a particularized suspicion of the presence of drugs to support a canine sniff of the automobile. The State opposed the motion, and the District Court held an evidentiary hearing at which Sery and Feuerstein testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">\u00b69 The District Court entered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Order and Memorandum concluding Sery had a particularized suspicion supporting a stop of the Camaro for a traffic offense and that, on that basis, he was entitled to ask the driver for his driver\u2019s license, proof of insurance, and registration, and to ask the identities of the other occupants of the vehicle. The court further concluded an individual does not have an expectation of privacy in the air surrounding an automobile nor in the odors emanating therefrom, and that a canine sniff of an automobile is not an offensive intrusion or a search under either the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution or Article II, Sections 10 and 11 of the Montana Constitution. On those grounds, the District Court denied the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\u00b610 Logan filed a Motion to Reconsider matters she had raised briefly in her original motion to suppress and to which the State had responded: whether probable cause and exigent circumstances existed to support the warrantless search of the Camaro under the so-called automobile exception. On June 8,1999, the District Court entered its Amended Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Order and Memorandum. It concluded that a drug dog\u2019s \u201calert\u201d to the presence of drugs from outside a vehicle established the first prong of the automobile exception to the warrant requirement: probable cause to search the inside of the vehicle. It also concluded the second prong-the existence of exigent circumstances to support a warrantless search of the inside of the vehicle-had been established. In sum, the court concluded that, \u201c[u]nder the automobile exception, the contents of a vehicle may be searched, which includes [Logan\u2019s] purse.\u201d Shortly thereafter, Logan pled guilty to a reduced charge of misdemeanor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>possession of dangerous drugs, and the District Court entered judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\u00b611 Do exigent circumstances support the officers\u2019 warrantless search of Logan\u2019s purse and the car?</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">\u00b612 In reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress evidence, we determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its interpretation and application of the law are correct. <em>State v. Boyer, </em>2002 MT 33, \u00b6 7, 308 Mont. 276, \u00b6 7, 42 P.3d 771, \u00b6 7 (citation omitted). Here, Logan challenges-and our decision hinges upon-the District Court\u2019s interpretation and application of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">\u00b613 Both the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 11 of the Montana Constitution afford individuals the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. A search and seizure by the state without a warrant is presumed illegal and unreasonable. <em>Katz v. United States </em>(1967), 389 U.S. 347, 357, 88 S.Ct. 507, 514, 19 L.Ed.2d 576, 585. In addition, Article II, Section 10 of the Montana Constitution guarantees that the right of individual privacy shall not be infringed without a showing of compelling state interest. As a result, the category of warrantless searches which may be lawfully conducted under the Montana Constitution is narrower than the category of warrantless searches which may be conducted under the Fourth Amendment. <em>State v. Elison, </em>2000 MT 288, \u00b6 46, 302 Mont. 228, \u00b6 46, 14 P.3d 456, \u00b6 46.</p>\n<p id=\"ARc\">\u00b614  In <em>Elison, </em>\u00b6 54, we held there is no \u201cautomobile exception\u201d to the search warrant requirement under the Montana Constitution. Under the right to privacy guaranteed by Montana\u2019s Constitution, the mobility of an automobile-without more-is not sufficient to justify a warrantless search. <em>Elison, </em>\u00b6 57. In addition to particularized suspicion to support a stop of the vehicle, a warrantless search of an automobile requires probable cause and a generally applicable exception to the warrant requirement such as plain view search, a search incident to arrest, or exigent circumstances. <em>Elison, </em>\u00b6 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">\u00b615  We did not decide <em>Elison </em>until after the District Court\u2019s denial of Logan\u2019s motion to suppress in this case. However, <em>Elison </em>applies to all defendants whose cases were pending on direct appeal or not yet final when that decision was issued. <em>See State v. Waters, </em>1999 MT 229, \u00b6 21, 296 Mont. 101, \u00b6 21, 987 P.2d 1142, \u00b6 21 (citations omitted). Because Logan\u2019s case was not yet final when <em>Elison </em>was issued, she is entitled to application of that decision. Consequently, we hold the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>District Court\u2019s reliance on the \u201cautomobile exception\u201d is erroneous. That error is harmless, however, because the District Court also analyzed probable cause and exigent circumstances, and that two-pronged analysis remains applicable. <em>See Elison, </em>\u00b6 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">\u00b616 In this case, we begin with the last of the various issues raised: whether exigent circumstances support the officers\u2019 search of Logan\u2019s purse and the car. The parties agree this is the only generally applicable exception to the warrant requirement at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">\u00b617  Exigent circumstances are those that would cause a reasonable person to believe prompt action is necessary to prevent physical harm to police officers or other persons, the destruction of relevant evidence, the escape of the suspect, or some other consequence improperly frustrating legitimate law enforcement efforts. <em>Elison, </em>\u00b6 56 (citation omitted). \u201cThe State bears the heavy burden of showing the existence of exigent circumstances and can meet that burden only by demonstrating specific and articulable facts.\u201d <em>Elison, </em>\u00b6 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">\u00b618 The District Court concluded exigent circumstances existed in that none of the occupants of the Camaro were under arrest, Logan\u2019s purse was still inside the vehicle, there would have been a delay between obtaining a warrant and searching the vehicle, and it would have been impracticable to allow Logan to leave the scene without allowing her to take her purse. The court postulated that if the officers allowed Logan to re-enter the Camaro to get her purse, she would have had an opportunity to destroy evidence in her purse and in the vehicle\u2019s center console. According to the District Court, \u201c[t]his possible destruction of evidence provided the exigent circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">\u00b619 The testimony of Sery, the arresting officer, does not support the District Court\u2019s determination that exigent circumstances existed. After a series of related questions and answers, Logan\u2019s counsel asked Sery: \u201cSo there was nothing that you know of that prevented you from obtaining a search warrant?\u201d Sery responded: \u201cNot that I know of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aq2\">\u00b620  Sery\u2019s response is a far cry from the \u201cspecific and articulable facts\u201d required to establish the existence of exigent circumstances. <em>See Elison, </em>\u00b6 56. Indeed, it is tantamount to a concession that exigent circumstances were not present. We hold the State failed to meet its heavy burden of establishing that exigent circumstances justified the officers\u2019 failure to obtain a warrant before removing Logan\u2019s purse from the car and searching both it and the interior of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">\u00b621 Our decision herein is based solely on the absence of exigent circumstances. We need not-and expressly do not-address the other grounds on which this case was briefed and argued, including whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>particularized suspicion existed to call for Igor, whether Igor\u2019s sniffs of the Camaro constituted a search and whether probable cause existed for the officers to search the Camaro and the purse. Our rationale is that, even if the State\u2019s arguments prevailed on those issues, the officers\u2019 warrantless search of the car and Logan\u2019s purse would still fail to satisfy the warrant requirement because they were not justified by exigent circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">\u00b622  We hold the District Court erred in concluding exigent circumstances justified the officers\u2019 warrantless search of the purse and the car. As a result, we further hold the District Court erred in denying Logan\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\u00b623 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b265-6\">JUSTICES COTTER, TRIEWEILER, REGNIER, NELSON, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
