We affirm in part, reverse in part and remand for proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">\u00b62 The following issues are presented on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">\u00b63 (1) Was the evidence before the jury sufficient to sustain the convictions of sexual intercourse without consent?</p>\n<p id=\"b74-12\">\u00b64 (2) Was the evidence before the jury sufficient to sustain the convictions of sexual assault?</p>\n<p id=\"b74-13\">\u00b65 (3) Did the District Court err in admitting testimony regarding whether the victims believed Harold Lee Stevens\u2019 actions constituted a crime and their subsequent emotional distress?</p>\n<p id=\"b74-14\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"ALf\">\u00b66 Harold Lee Stevens (Stevens) operated- a massage business in Missoula, Montana. He advertised his business as HLS Massage, or \u201cHealing Life\u2019s Stress.\u201d Stevens performed massages on a massage table in a small room in which only his clients and he were present. Stevens displayed his massage training diploma and business license <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>in the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">\u00b67 After escorting his female clients to the massage room, Stevens would routinely hand them a sheet and step outside while they undressed. Some clients chose to fully undress while others would wear their undergarments. All would cover themselves with a sheet. Stevens would then knock on the door, ask the client if she was ready and, if so, he would enter the room. The lights in the massage room were low, and Stevens played soft music during the massage. Some clients covered their eyes with a small eye pillow. Stevens\u2019 clients testified at trial that they sought massages for relaxation, stress relief, or to treat their physical injuries or ailments.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">\u00b68 Prior to beginning the massage, Stevens typically asked his clients if there were any problem areas of the body upon which he should focus. Also, before or during the massage, Stevens sometimes requested that his clients tell him if he did anything they did not like. However, very little other conversation or \u201csmall talk\u201d occurred during the massage. The massage usually commenced with the clients lying on their stomachs, and then, at Stevens\u2019 request, they would turn over onto their backs for the remainder of the massage.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">\u00b69 On May 11,1999, the State filed an Information charging Stevens with three counts of sexual intercourse without consent, three counts of misdemeanor sexual assault and one count of witness tampering. Subsequently, the State filed an Amended Information charging five counts of sexual intercourse without consent, one count of attempted sexual intercourse without consent, five counts of misdemeanor sexual assault and one count of witness tampering. The case proceeded to trial on November 27, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">\u00b610 At Stevens\u2019 trial, Darlene testified that she sought a full-body massage from Stevens. She testified that she specifically told Stevens that she believed this entailed everything except her breasts and genitals. She admitted, however, that she did not remember making this statement to the police and a private investigator after the incident. After the first massage, Darlene felt comfortable with Stevens, and she made a second appointment for the next morning. The night before the second massage, Darlene took a Tylenol PM and was still \u201csleepy\u201d when she arrived for the massage.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">\u00b6 11 During the first part of this massage, while laying on her stomach, Darlene fell asleep. Although she woke up when Stevens asked her to turn over onto her back, she fell asleep again as Stevens continued. She awoke a second time when she felt the sensation of something inside her vagina. She opened her eyes and saw Stevens laying on top of her sucking on her breast. His fingers were inside of her vagina. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>Stevens had taken off his shirt and he had an erection. Darlene noticed that the sheet that had been covering her was set aside on a table. After a few seconds, when Darlene realized what was happening, she put her hand on Stevens\u2019 forehead and pushed him back. Upon her request, Stevens handed her a towel and left the room. After leaving, Darlene went to the emergency room and reported the incident to the police. The jury convicted Stevens of committing sexual intercourse without consent against Darlene.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">\u00b612 Erin testified that she received several massages from Stevens. She had confidence in Stevens, and she referred others to him. During her last massage with Stevens, she stated that she stayed awake while lying on her stomach. Although she was awake and aware of her surroundings, she was numb and almost asleep. After she turned over onto her back, she fell asleep, but awoke when Stevens moved to another section of the massage table. Erin was not concerned or uncomfortable when she first awoke. She stated that she was awake, but in a \u201ctotal relaxed state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">\u00b613 Soon thereafter Stevens started massaging Erin\u2019s breasts and nipples. She was aware of, and remembered, Stevens\u2019 actions and that Stevens did not threaten her. Nevertheless, Stevens\u2019 behavior surprised her and her body and mind \u201cfroze.\u201d Stevens put his hand inside Erin\u2019s underwear and rubbed her clitoris, penetrating the outer lips of her vagina. Stevens proceeded to lick her nipple, thigh and vagina. All of the touching lasted approximately 10 minutes. Erin stated that Stevens\u2019 actions made her feel \u201chorrible,\u201d but her mind and body were frozen and she was scared to do anything to stop him. The touching stopped after Stevens asked if what he was doing was okay, and Erin responded, \u201cno.\u201d At that point, Stevens got off of the table, quickly finished the massage and then left the room. As she was leaving, Stevens asked Erin if she wanted this type of behavior to happen again. Erin responded that she did not, but that she would return \u201cjust because [she] wanted to get out of there.\u201d Erin contacted the police a few hours later. The jury concluded Stevens committed sexual intercourse without consent against Erin.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">\u00b614 Jody testified that she received massages from Stevens for a sciatic nerve injury. She thought Stevens was very professional and thorough, and, over time, she increasingly trusted and felt comfortable with Stevens. She testified that during these massages she would not fall completely asleep, but she would be \u201cin a very far away place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AN\">\u00b615 At her last massage with Stevens, he proceeded with the massage as usual. Jody testified that during the massage, she fell into a deeply relaxed \u201cdream state\u201d or \u201csleep rem stage.\u201d She stated that she wore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>an eye pillow. At one point, Stevens, as was customary, asked Jody to inform him ifhe did something she did not like. Jody understood this question to mean that she should tell Stevens if he caused pain to a muscle during the massage.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">\u00b616 After Jody turned onto her back for the second portion of the massage, Stevens began to massage her breast area and her nipples. Jody stated that she was aware of the sensation of Stevens massaging her breasts, and she stopped breathing. Stevens then kissed her stomach, and she became \u201cglued to the table.\u201d She \u201ccame out of the dream state\u201d and Stevens was between her legs. Jody stated that Stevens proceeded to penetrate the outer lips of her vagina with his tongue. She also testified that, immediately after the incident, she was unsure if Stevens penetrated her vaginal canal.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">\u00b617 Although she was afraid, Jody did not respond to Stevens\u2019 actions initially in order to avoid confrontation with him and a possible further attack. After a few moments, Jody said, \u201cthis isn\u2019t a good idea,\u201d and Stevens stopped, jumped off of the massage table and apologized. Stevens finished the massage and left the room. Jody reported the incident to the police the next day. The jury convicted Stevens of sexual intercourse without consent against Jody.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">\u00b618 Jennifer testified that she received massages from Stevens on two occasions. During the first massage, Stevens was very professional, and she felt comfortable with him and began to trust him. As a result, she sought Stevens\u2019 services a second time. The second massage began with her lying on her back, and Stevens massaged her breasts for about ten minutes. He then massaged her pubic and buttocks areas without touching her vagina. She stated she did not agree with Stevens\u2019 actions and felt angry and disgusted with herself for not leaving, but she did not voice her concerns because she \u201cjust wanted out and wanted to go home where [she] felt safe.\u201d Jennifer reported the incident. The jury convicted Stevens of sexual assault against Jennifer.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq\">\u00b619 Elizabeth testified that she received massages from Stevens several times. She felt comfortable with Stevens, trusted him and entered a \u201crelaxed state\u201d while Stevens performed massages. During her last massage with Stevens, he asked Elizabeth to tell him ifhe did anything that made her uncomfortable. She thought the question was \u201ccompletely out of the ordinary\u201d and \u201calarming.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">\u00b620 Shortly thereafter, Stevens, breathing heavily, began rubbing and pinching Elizabeth\u2019s nipples. She felt Stevens\u2019 erect penis against her upper arm. Elizabeth stated Stevens\u2019 actions took her by surprise. Stevens then peeled back the sheet covering Elizabeth and pressed his hand on her pubic area and put his fingers between her legs without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>penetrating her vulva. Elizabeth, believing Stevens might rape her, lunged forward, picked up the sheet, covered herself and said, \u201cStop.\u201d Stevens stopped his actions and finished the neck and facial portion of the massage. Elizabeth testified that she knew she was alone in the building with Stevens and that no one would hear her if she cried out. She believed it would be unsafe to confront Stevens. Elizabeth promptly reported the incident. The jury convicted Stevens of sexually assaulting Elizabeth.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">\u00b621 Tahra testified that she received two massages from Stevens. After the first massage, Tahra felt comfortable with Stevens, and she returned for her first full-body massage. After approximately one hour, Stevens told Tahra to turn over and he removed the sheet covering her body, leaving her completely exposed. Stevens massaged her breasts in what she described as a \u201cgroping session.\u201d She stated that she trusted him and was not sure if the full-body massage was proceeding normally. Although she did not feel physically threatened by Stevens, she testified she felt \u201clike a deer in headlights,\u201d frozen, naked and vulnerable. Stevens stopped massaging Tahra\u2019s breast and, while massaging her legs, Tahra testified that his finger brushed her clitoris four or five times in rapid succession. At that point, Tahra said, \u201cThat\u2019s enough. I\u2019m done.\u201d Stevens responded, \u201cOkay,\u201d and abruptly left. The jury acquitted Stevens of sexual intercourse without consent, but the jury convicted him of sexual assault against Tahra.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">\u00b622 Stevens was acquitted of the six other counts that the State charged. Stevens appeals the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the convictions described above as well as the admission of portions of the victims\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">\u00b623 The Court reviews the sufficiency of evidence to support a conviction by viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution and then determining whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Haser, </em>2001 MT 6, \u00b6 18, 304 Mont. 63, \u00b6 18, 20 P.3d 100, \u00b6 18 (citing State <em>v. Berger, </em>1998 MT 170, \u00b6 25, 290 Mont. 78, \u00b6 25, 964 P.2d 725, \u00b6 25).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">\u00b624 We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Osborne, </em>1999 MT 149, \u00b6 14, 295 Mont. 54, \u00b6 14, 982 P.2d 1045, \u00b6 14. The district court has broad discretion to determine whether evidence is relevant and admissible. Absent a showing of an abuse of discretion, the trial court\u2019s determination will not be overturned. <em>Osborne, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">\u00b625 (1) Was the evidence before the jury sufficient to sustain the convictions of sexual intercourse without consent?</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">\u00b626 For purposes of our review, we note that the incident involving Darlene occurred on July 3,1996, and, thus, the 1995 versions of \u00a7\u00a7 45-5-503, 45-5-501(2), and 45-2-101(56), MCA, apply. As to the other sexual intercourse without consent incidents, the 1997 version of the statutes apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">\u00b627 Under \u00a7 45-5-503, MCA, a person commits the offense of sexual intercourse without consent if he or she \u201cknowingly has sexual intercourse without consent with another person.\u201d Stevens claims the State failed to prove the \u201cwithout consent\u201d element beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">\u00b628 In relevant part, the term \u201cwithout consent\u201d is defined in \u00a7 45-5-501, MCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-8\">(a) the victim is compelled to submit by force against himself or another; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-9\">(b) the victim is incapable of consent because he is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-10\">(i) mentally defective or incapacitated; [or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-11\">(ii) physically helpless ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-12\">\u00b629 In pertinent part, the term \u201cforce\u201d is defined in \u00a7 45-5-501(2), MCA, as the infliction, attempted infliction, or threatened infliction of bodily injury or the commission of a forcible felony by the offender.</p>\n<p id=\"As\">\u00b630 \u201cPhysically helpless\u201d means that a person is unconscious or is otherwise physically unable to communicate unwillingness to act. Section 45-2-101(56), MCA. The Commission Comments regarding the definition of \u201cphysically helpless\u201d state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-13\">This definition is used in conjunction with the new section describing when a person is deemed to be incapable of consenting to a sexual act. The term should he compared to other states of incapacity defined in the code such as \u201cmentally defective\u201d ... and \u201cmentally incapacitated\u201d.... Under this definition a person who is paralytic or drugged to unconsciousness is deemed helpless. The definition is taken directly from New York law as is much of the new Chapter 5 of Title 45 on sexual offenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-14\">\u00b631 Whether a victim is \u201cphysically helpless\u201d at any given moment is largely a question of fact for the jury to decide. <em>People v. Yankowitz </em>(1991), 564 N.Y.S.2d 488, 489 (citing <em>People v. Irving </em>(1989), 542 <em>N.Y.S.2d 693, 694; People v. Teicher </em>(N.Y. 1981), 422 N.E.2d 506, 511).</p>\n<p id=\"ATD\">\u00b632 Stevens argues that there is no evidence that Stevens used any force or the threat of force against the victims. Citing <em>Haser, </em>he contends that surprise and fear do not equate with force.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>\u00b633 Stevens also argues that there was no evidence of \u201cphysically helpless\u201d as set forth in \u00a7 45-2-101(56), MCA. He states that all of the victims in this case were completely rational, sober, awake and able to communicate and respond. Stevens relies upon three New York cases in which alleged victims of sexual intercourse without consent who could speak or verbally communicate in some way, such as the victims here, were not considered \u201cphysically helpless.\u201d <em>People v. Clyburn </em>(1995), 623 N.Y.S.2d 448 (victim afflicted with Huntington\u2019s Chorea who could speak not \u201cphysically helpless\u201d); <em>People v. Huurre </em>(1993), 603 N.Y.S.2d 179 (profoundly mentally retarded woman who could grunt and mumble not \u201cphysically helpless\u201d); and <em>People v. Morales </em>(1988), 528 N.Y.S.2d 286 (woman unable to move her arms or legs due to muscular dystrophy not \u201cphysically helpless\u201d since she could speak). \u00b634 Stevens also insists that, according to the plain language of the \u201cphysically helpless\u201d definition and the Commission Comments, \u201cphysically helpless\u201d does not equate to surprise, dream states, dozing or any other condition less than someone who is unconscious or paralytic. Stevens emphasizes that sleep is not part of the definition of \u201cphysically helpless.\u201d Citing <em>State v. Graves </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 451, 901 P.2d 549, Stevens argues that there is a difference between sleeping and being unconscious.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">\u00b635 Alternatively, Stevens contends that even if the victims were \u201cphysically helpless,\u201d there is no evidence that he knew they were \u201cunconscious or otherwise physically unable to communicate unwillingness to act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">\u00b636 In response, the State contends that the jury could have reasonably determined that it proved \u201cwithout consent\u201d beyond a reasonable doubt. It points out that, in addition to receiving the \u201cparalytic\u201d and \u201cdrugged\u201d examples of \u201cphysically helpless,\u201d the jury in this case was also instructed, without objection, that these were nonexclusive examples of \u201cphysically helpless.\u201d The State maintains that sleep is a temporary state of unconsciousness, and, therefore, the Court should now hold that sleep can constitute \u201cphysically helpless\u201d under \u00a7\u00a7 45-2-101 and 45-5-501(l)(b)(ii), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">\u00b637 The State goes on to argue that \u201cphysically helpless\u201d is not limited to victims who are sleeping or completely lack the mental or physical capacity to communicate. It insists that the \u201cphysically helpless\u201d definition is broad enough to include an individual who is, as a practical matter, physically unable or powerless to stop what is happening due to an induced physical condition and/or fear of bodily injury. In other words, the State claims a victim need not be literally unable to consent. The State emphasizes that it was within the jury\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"b81-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>province to determine whether the victims were \u201cphysically helpless\u201d and concludes that, in this case, the jury could have reasonably concluded that the sleepy and groggy condition Stevens induced was comparable to an involuntary drugged condition since the victims\u2019 ability to appreciate what was happening was markedly diminished. \u00b638 Up to this point, we have not directly addressed whether sleep constitutes \u201cphysically helpless\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7\u00a7 45-2-101and 45-5-501(1)(b)(ii), MCA. Indirectly, however, we have concluded that sleeping victims could not consent to sexual intercourse. In <em>State v. Lundblade </em>(1986), 221 Mont. 185, 717 P.2d 575, the victim testified that she was sound asleep and awoke to find the defendant performing oral sex on her. <em>Lundblade, </em>221 Mont, at 186-87, 717 P.2d at 576-77. The Defendant was convicted of sexual intercourse without consent. While we reversed his conviction after concluding that the State failed to prove the \u201cpenetration\u201d element of the offense, we held that a rational juror could have properly found that the element of lack of consent was proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Lundblade, </em>221 Mont, at 187, 717 P.2d at 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">\u00b639 In <em>Graves, </em>the victim \u201cpassed out\u201d on her bed after a night of drinking, and she was awakened when she felt the defendant penetrating her vagina. <em>Graves, </em>272 Mont, at 457,901 P.2d at 553. The defendant was convicted of sexual intercourse without consent. Similar to Stevens, the defendant in <em>Graves </em>argued that the Court had not held that a sleeping victim was \u201cphysically helpless\u201d and, in any event, the victim was not asleep during intercourse. <em>Graves, </em>272 Mont, at 456, 901 P.2d at 553. We held that a rational juror could have found the essential elements of sexual intercourse without consent beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Graves, </em>272 Mont, at 457-58, 901 P.2d at 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">\u00b640 Most recently, in <em>Haser, </em>a case in which sexual intercourse without consent was alleged against a professional photographer, we distinguished between victims who were sleeping and victims who were awake for purposes of determining whether a person was \u201cphysically helpless\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">Contrary to the State\u2019s argument, we conclude there is indeed a \u201clogical difference\u201d between Haser\u2019s sexual intercourse with the two victims and sexual intercourse with a sleeping or intoxicated victim. Namely, the victims here were awake and sober. Both were therefore conscious and physically capable of communicating an unwillingness to act, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 45-5-501(l)(b)(ii) and 45-2-101, MCA, which defines \u201cphysically helpless.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-7\"><em>Haser, </em>\u00b6 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">\u00b641 Montana derived its definition of \u201cphysically helpless\u201d from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>New York penal code. New York appellate courts construing the \u201cphysically helpless\u201d definition like Montana\u2019s have held that \u201c[i]t is well settled that the definition of physically helpless is broad enough to cover a sleeping victim.\u201d <em>People v. Sensourichanh, </em>737 N.Y.S.2d 670, 671-72 (citations omitted). This is the case whether the sleep is drug induced or normally achieved. <em>People v. Copp </em>(1996), 648 N.Y.S.2d 492, 493 (it is axiomatic that sleep is the antithesis of awareness and renders one unable to make a conscious choice whether the sleep is induced by drugs or normal processes).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">\u00b642 In the same vein, a Virginia court of appeals upheld a rape conviction after construing a \u201cphysically helpless\u201d definition similar to Montana\u2019s. <em>Woodward v. Commonwealth </em>(Va. Ct. App. 1991), 402 S.E.2d 244. It concluded that even if the sleeping victim had some sensory perception during an attack, it did not mean that she was not unconscious or \u201cphysically helpless.\u201d <em>Woodward, </em>402 S.E.2d at 245-46. The court reasoned that \u201ccommon experience tells us that sleep is not an all or nothing condition.\u201d <em>Woodward, </em>402 S.E.2d at 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">\u00b643  Upon reviewing our prior case law as well that of New York and Virginia, we now hold that a sleeping victim of sexual intercourse without consent is \u201cphysically helpless\u201d for purposes of \u00a7\u00a7 45-2-101 and 45-5-501(1)(b)(ii), MCA. The statutory definition of \u201cphysically helpless\u201d is broadly worded to encompass a person who is sleeping since such a person is temporarily unconscious or is otherwise physically unable to communicate unwillingness to act. In other words, a sleeping victim cannot consent to sexual intercourse. Whether a victim is indeed sleeping, and thus \u201cphysically helpless,\u201dis a fact, question for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">\u00b644 Here, Darlene testified that she took a Tylenol P.M. the night before her second massage with Stevens. She also testified that she fell asleep during the massage and awoke when she felt the sensation of something inside her vagina. Stevens admits that Darlene was asleep but argues that because she awoke when Stevens asked her to turn over onto her back, \u201cObviously, she was not in a very deep sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">\u00b645 Even if Darlene had some sensory perception during Stevens\u2019 acts, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we hold that any rational trier of fact could have found that Darlene was asleep, and thereby \u201cphysically helpless,\u201d when Stevens, admittedly, had sexual intercourse with her. Credible evidence in the record supports the jury\u2019s determination that Stevens had sexual intercourse without consent with Darlene, and we affirm Stevens\u2019 conviction with respect to Darlene.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">\u00b646 We cannot similarly conclude with respect to Jody and Erin. Jody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>testified that during her massage, she fell into a deeply relaxed \u201cdream state\u201d or \u201csleep rem stage,\u201d but she was aware of the sensation of Stevens massaging her breasts. At this point, she \u201cstopped breathing.\u201d When Stevens kissed her stomach, she stated that she became \u201cglued to the table.\u201d Erin testified that she was awake and aware of her surroundings, but she was numb and almost asleep. Although at one point she did fall asleep, she awoke and was in a \u201ctotal relaxed state.\u201d Erin testified that she was aware of, and remembered, Stevens\u2019 actions, and her body \u201cfroze\u201d out of fear.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">\u00b647 The State compares Jody\u2019s and Erin\u2019s circumstances to those in <em>Teicher. </em>In <em>Teicher, </em>the victim was heavily sedated by her dentist and in an \u201cextremely weakened condition\u201d in which she had little control over her body. <em>Teicher, </em>422 N.E.2d at 510. Here, Jody and Erin were not sedated and, although frightened, they had control over their bodies. As such, the State\u2019s reliance on <em>Teicher </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">\u00b648 The circumstances of this case resemble those in <em>Haser </em>where we rejected the State\u2019s argument that \u201clulling\u201d victims into a state of mind analogous to intoxication or sleep was sufficient to show \u201cphysically helpless.\u201d <em>See Haser, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 56, 59. Like the victims in <em>Haser, </em>Jody\u2019s and Erin\u2019s testimony indicates that they were awake and sober during Stevens\u2019 sexual acts. We are not at liberty to read into the already thoroughly defined statutory term \u201cincapable of consent\u201d such implicit notions as being \u201clulled\u201d into a \u201cdream state\u201d or \u201ctotal relaxed state.\u201d <em>See Haser, </em>\u00b6 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">\u00b649 Accordingly, we adhere to the distinction we drew in <em>Haser </em>between sexual intercourse with victims who are asleep versus victims who are awake, sober, and therefore conscious and otherwise physically capable of communicating unwillingness to act. The latter victims are not \u201cphysically helpless.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">\u00b650  Here, considering the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude that no rational trier of fact could have found that Jody and Erin were \u201cphysically helpless\u201d under \u00a7\u00a7 45-5-501(1)(b)(ii) and 45-2-101, MCA. While Jody and Erin were in a relaxed or dream state during their massages, there is simply no credible evidence in the record demonstrating that they were unconscious or otherwise physically unable to communicate unwillingness to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">\u00b651 We also conclude that Jody and Erin were not compelled to submit to Stevens\u2019 actions by \u201cforce\u201d as defined in \u00a7 45-5-501(2)(a), MCA. The State claims that the \u201cforce\u201d element was met in this case because the women, who were too frozen, frightened and \u201cphysically helpless\u201d to resist, experienced more than just a \u201ctrace of fear\u201d as in <em>Haser. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Admitting there was no direct evidence of a threat of bodily injury or rape, the State contends the threat was implicit in Stevens\u2019 sexually assaultive behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">\u00b652 While the State contends that Jody\u2019s and Erin\u2019s fear indicated that Stevens implicitly threatened them, there exists no evidence in the record that the victims\u2019 fear was a result of Stevens\u2019 infliction, attempted infliction or threatened infliction of bodily injury. As such, there was no \u201cforce.\u201d <em>Haser, </em>\u00b6 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">\u00b653  In sum, the State offered no evidence at Stevens\u2019 trial that Jody and Erin were incapable of consent due to \u201cforce\u201d or being \u201cphysically helpless.\u201d Accordingly, without such evidence, a rational trier of fact could not have found that the State proved the essential element \u201cwithout consent\u201d beyond a reasonable doubt. We therefore reverse that portion of the District Court\u2019s judgment determining that Stevens was guilty of the offense of sexual intercourse without consent with respect to Jody and Erin.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">\u00b654  However, on appeal, we may reduce the offense of which the appellant was convicted to a lesser included offense. Section 46-20-703(3), MCA. Whether sexual assault is a lesser included offense of sexual intercourse without consent has not been determined as a matter of law, and the issue is not before us now. Yet, in resolving prior appeals, we have assumed for the purposes of individual decisions that sexual assault is a lesser included offense. <em>State v. Black </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 329, 891 P.2d 1162; <em>State v. Sheppard </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 122, 890 P.2d 754; <em>State v. Ogle </em>(1992), 255 Mont. 246, 841 P.2d 1133; <em>State v. Sheppard </em>(1992), 253 Mont. 118, 832 P.2d 370; <em>Lundhlade, </em>221 Mont, at 188-89, 717 P.2d at 578.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">\u00b655 We recognize that the dissent in <em>Black </em>criticized this approach. It reasoned that if it was assumed that sexual assault was not a lesser included offense of sexual intercourse without consent, the defendant in <em>Black, </em>who was never charged with sexual assault and who was convicted in a bench trial, was not reasonably appraised of the charges against him in violation of his due process rights. <em>Black, </em>270 Mont, at 339-41, 891 P.2d at 1168-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">\u00b656 Here, unlike in <em>Black, </em>there is no question that Stevens was reasonably appraised of the sexual assault charges lodged against him. Stevens proposed a jury instruction, which the court gave without objection, stating that the crime of sexual intercourse \u201cnecessarily includes the lesser crime of sexual assault.\u201d It also stated that the jury could convict Stevens of sexual assault in the event that it was not satisfied that he was guilty of sexual intercourse without consent beyond a reasonable doubt. The verdict form was drafted in accordance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>with this instruction. Indeed, the jury reached a guilty verdict on the \u201clesser offense\u201d of sexual assault with respect to Tahra.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">\u00b657  Stevens clearly wanted the jury to have the option of convicting him of what he assumed was the lesser included offense of sexual assault. Accordingly, for the purposes of this decision, we will assume that sexual assault is a lesser included offense of sexual intercourse without consent. Based upon our discussion below, we hold that the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that, under \u00a7 45-5-502, MCA (1997), Stevens committed sexual assault against Jody and Erin. We therefore modify the District Court\u2019s judgment by reducing the offense of which Stevens was convicted to sexual assault pursuant to \u00a7 46-20-703(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">\u00b658 (2) Was the evidence before the jury sufficient to sustain the convictions of sexual assault?</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">\u00b659 A person who knowingly subjects another person to any sexual contact without consent commits the offense of sexual assault. Section 45-5-502(1), MCA (1997). At the time of the incidents in this case, sexual contact was defined as \u201cany touching of the sexual or other intimate parts of the person of another for the purpose of arousing or gratifying the sexual desire of either party.\u201d Section 45-2-101(65), MCA (1997). Unlike in the case of sexual intercourse without consent, the term \u201cwithout consent\u201d is undefined for purposes of sexual assault and, instead, has its ordinary meaning. <em>State v. Detonancour, </em>2001 MT 213, \u00b6 64, 306 Mont. 389, \u00b6 64, 34 P.3d 487, \u00b6 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">\u00b660 Stevens contends that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the sexual assault convictions. Stevens does not contest that \u201csexual contact\u201d was proven beyond a reasonable doubt. However, he argues that the State failed to prove Stevens \u201cknowingly acted without consent.\u201d Essentially, Stevens claims that since the victims in this case failed to \u201ccommunicate\u201d their dissatisfaction when he initiated sexual contact during the massage, he could not have possibly known that they did not find the contact \u201cagreeable.\u201d He also maintains no wrongdoing because when the victims asked him to stop, he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">\u00b661 Incredibly, Stevens analogizes the facts of this case to a dating scenario in which he describes a \u201cyoung man\u201d who, progressively, touches a \u201cyoung lady\u2019s\u201d back, thigh, breast and pubic region without objection. Stevens states that the young man should not later be charged with sexual assault because he should have known that the young lady did not want to be touched on the breast or pubic region. He asks, \u201cAre we willing to say the young man should go to jail because he was not a skilled enough mind reader? There is no difference between the young man and Stevens. The fact that Stevens <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>is a masseuse makes no difference because one\u2019s profession is not a factor in the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">\u00b662 The State insists that Stevens inappropriately and outlandishly characterizes obtaining a professional massage as a \u201cdate.\u201d The State maintains that while a dating person may anticipate sexual touching, Stevens\u2019 massage clients, with good reason, did not. Moreover, the State emphasizes that the victims\u2019 testimony that they \u201cfroze\u201d out of fear indicated they did not consent to Stevens\u2019 sexual contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">\u00b663 We agree. Analogizing a professional massage by a licensed massage therapist with dating is ludicrous. Elizabeth, Jennifer, Tahra, Jody and Erin were not Stevens\u2019 dates. They were his massage clients. Stevens\u2019 failure to recognize the difference between dating and providing a professional service to clients who trusted him is alarming. Obviously, Stevens, as a professional massage therapist, had no \u201cimplicit permission\u201d to sexually touch his clients until they told him to stop. The professional relationship defined the limits that Stevens\u2019 clients could expect, and they did not expect to be sexually touched during their massage. It does not take a \u201cskilled mind reader\u201d to realize this.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">\u00b664  Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we hold that any rational trier of fact could have found that Stevens knowingly subjected Jennifer, Elizabeth Tahra, Jody and Erin to sexual contact without consent. Credible evidence in the record supports this determination. Accordingly, the jury properly convicted Stevens of sexual assault against Jennifer, Elizabeth and Tahra. Also, pursuant to \u00a7 46-20-703(3), MCA, we conclude that Stevens committed sexual assault against Jody and Erin.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">\u00b665 (3) Did the District Court err in admitting testimony regarding whether the victims believed Stevens\u2019 actions constituted a crime and their subsequent emotional distress?</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">\u00b666 At trial, the State asked two witnesses, Darlene and Janice, whether they believed Stevens\u2019 conduct was illegal. Darlene testified that at the time of the incident, she felt Stevens had been unprofessional only, but eventually she felt his behavior was criminal. Janice stated, \u201cI don\u2019t know that I could say to you that I had sexual assault in my head, but I do think he did something that he did not have a right to do.\u201d Stevens objected on relevance grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">\u00b667 The State also questioned Darlene, over Stevens\u2019 relevance objections, about effects the incident has had on her personal relationships. She stated that her relationship with her husband was affected. The State asked Tahra whether she had been able to have a massage since the incident. Tahra responded that while she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>\u201creally leery\u201d at first, she eventually got another massage.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">\u00b668 Stevens contends that all of this testimony was irrelevant and designed to elicit passion and sympathy towards the victims and prejudice toward Stevens. He claims that whether the victims believed Stevens\u2019 actions constituted a crime, whether the victims\u2019 personal lives were affected and whether they were able to have subsequent massages did not tend to prove any fact of the case. He states that the irrelevant and highly prejudicial testimony biased the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">\u00b669 The State, on the other hand, argues the testimony was relevant because it tended to make the existence of a material fact, lack of consent, more probable than it would have been without the evidence. The State also points out that, at trial, Stevens only objected on relevance grounds and cannot on appeal bring a new claim that the testimony was more prejudicial than probative under Rule 403, M.R.Evid. In any event, the State insists that there is no reasonable likelihood that Stevens was prejudiced considering the strength of the evidence involving Darlene and considering Janice\u2019s and Tahra\u2019s equivocal answers to the State\u2019s questions and Stevens\u2019 acquittals with respect to Janice and Tahra.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">\u00b670  Relevant evidence means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence. Rule 401, M.R.Evid. Except as otherwise provided, all relevant evidence is admissible. Rule 402, M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">\u00b671  Here, we conclude that the testimony at issue was relevant and admissible under Rules 401 and 402, M.R.Evid. Whether Darlene and Janice contemporaneously thought that Stevens\u2019 actions were criminal or wrong tended to make the existence of a material element, \u201cwithout consent,\u201d more likely than without the evidence. Similarly, since sexual offenses commonly cause fear and distress, Darlene\u2019s and Tahra\u2019s subsequent fears tended to make the existence of lack of consent more probable than not.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">\u00b672 Bearing in mind that the district court has broad discretion to determine whether evidence is relevant and admissible, we hold that the District Court in this case did not abuse its discretion in admitting the challenged testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">\u00b673 We affirm in part and reverse in part and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b87-10\">JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b87-11\">JUSTICE RICE</author>\n<p id=\"ALfK\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-12\">\u00b674 I concur with the Court in affirming the conviction of sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>intercourse without consent with respect to Darlene and the convictions of sexual assault with respect to Jennifer, Elizabeth and Tahra. I further concur with the Court\u2019s holding on the evidentiary question in Issue 3. I dissent from the Court\u2019s reversal of the convictions of sexual intercourse without consent with respect to Jody and Erin, and therefore would not reach the issue of the lesser included offense in regard to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">\u00b675 The Court concludes that, under the statute, sexual intercourse with a sleeping victim is \u201cwithout consent,\u201d but that sexual intercourse with a victim in a \u201csleep-like\u201d state is not \u201cwithout consent.\u201d Thus, the Court affirms the conviction with respect to Darlene, to whom the Court ascribes sleep but with \u201csome sensory perception,\u201d but reverses the convictions with respect to Jody, who was in a deep \u201csleep rem stage,\u201d and Erin, who drifted in and out of sleep, and, as the Court notes, was \u201calmost asleep\u201d when violated. The Court thus ignores the admonition in <em>Woodward v. Commonwealth </em>(Va. Ct. App. 1991), 402 S.E.2d 244,246, that \u201ccommon experience tells us that sleep is not an all or nothing condition,\u201d which is painfully obvious here, and creates an artificial line at sleep\u2019s first moment that is neither realistic nor mandated by the statutes. Contrary to the Court\u2019s analysis, determining whether the victim was \u201cphysically helpless\u201d is not a question of \u201csleep vs. awake\u201d-terms which the statute does not mention-but rather, whether a rational jury could find that the victim was \u201cotherwise physically unable\u201d to refuse intercourse. I would find a rational jury could, and did, so conclude from the evidence presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">\u00b676 The Court\u2019s reliance on <em>State v. Haser, </em>2001 MT 6, 304 Mont. 63, 20 P.3d 100, is misplaced. The <em>Haser </em>Court properly rejected the State\u2019s argument that the victims there had been lulled into a state analogous to sleep or intoxication simply because the facts were to the contrary. The <em>Haser </em>victims were fully alert and participated in a photo shoot wherein they repeatedly responded to the photographer-defendant\u2019s instructions to change their pose. The instructions to change positions were accompanied by Haser\u2019s inappropriate sexual touching. In this case, there was no such \u201ceyes wide open\u201d participation by an alert victim. To the contrary, the victims here were reclined comfortably in a room with soft music playing, were deeply relaxed and had fallen into the above-described sleep-like conditions. I thus disagree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that the \u201ccircumstances of this case resemble those in <em>Haser\u201d </em>and find that the State\u2019s argument in this matter to be substantially more compelling than it was in <em>Haser.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>\u00b677 The circumstances in this case more closely resemble those in <em>State v. Lundblade </em>(1986), 221 Mont. 185, 717 P.2d 575, and <em>State v. Graves </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 451, 901 P.2d 549, where we upheld jury determinations that sexual intercourse with victims during their respective conditions of sleep and intoxication was \u201cwithout consent\u201d because of their physical helplessness. Further, as the Court here acknowledges, and endorses by affirming the conviction with respect to Darlene, even a sleeping victim with some sensory perception can be found to be \u201cphysically helpless.\u201d Consequently, the Court, instead .of attempting to apply a bright-line rxile to such variable states of consciousness, should recognize that whether a victim is \u201cotherwise physically unable\u201d to communicate her refusal is a matter of the victim\u2019s particular consciousness and is a factual question for the jury to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">\u00b678 Applying \u00a7 45-1-102(1), MCA, which, for purposes of penal statutes, sets aside the common law rule that statutes are to be strictly construed and requires penal provisions to be construed according to the fair import of their terms with a view to effect its object and to promote justice, I would reject the \u201chow deep must sleep be?\u201d quagmire adopted by the Court and allow juries to determine the victim\u2019s consciousness in accordance with the terms of the statute-whether the victim was \u201cotherwise physically unable\u201d to refuse-based upon the facts of each case. \u201cThe state of the victim\u2019s physical helplessness at any given moment is largely a question of fact....\u201d <em>People v. Teicher </em>(N.Y. 1981), 422 N.E.2d 506, 511. Viewing the evidence here in a light most favorable to the prosecution, I conclude that the jury rationally could have found the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, including physical helplessness, and would affirm the convictions of sexual intercourse without consent with respect to Jody and Erin.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
