We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>\u00b62 Gwen purports to raise three issues for our review. However, we will not restate the issues presented because the determinative issue in this case is whether we should dismiss Gwen\u2019s appeal for failure to comply with the Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">\u00b63 Gwen and Respondent Raymond Joseph McMahon (R.J.) were married in Hawaii on June 12,1991. Prior to the marriage, Gwen gave birth to three daughters, none of which were fathered by R.J. The District Court found that Gwen brought little to the marriage as compared to R. J.\u2019s substantial premarital assets. During the marriage, Gwen assisted R.J in the operation and management of his liquor and gaming establishment located in Billings, Montana. R.J. provided significant financial support to Gwen\u2019s children during the course of the parties\u2019 marriage. The parties received no financial contribution from the children\u2019s natural father.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">\u00b64 On November 16, 2000, R.J. filed a petition to dissolve his marriage to Gwen. The case proceeded to a non-jury trial on July 12, 2001. Both parties were represented by counsel at trial. Following a one-day trial, the District Court entered its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and decree of dissolution. The District Court itemized the premarital and marital assets and valued each asset accordingly. Pursuant to the District Court\u2019s property distribution, Gwen received the parties\u2019 1999 Jaguar, a certificate of deposit worth $20,000, a cash bond worth $10,000, some personal property, and a cash award of approximately $246,000. On August 29,2001, Gwen, appearing pro se, filed a notice of appeal \u201cfrom the District Court\u2019s Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Decree dated July 30,2001.\u201d On September 4, 2001, R.J. filed a notice of cross-appeal but has since dismissed the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">\u00b65 Gwen ostensibly submits three issues for our review which are difficult to comprehend and presented in contravention of the prescribed rules of appellate procedure. Gwen\u2019s brief alludes to libelous conduct, unscrupulous activity regarding trial court documents, false testimony, judicial bias, and erroneous calculation of marital assets. However, Gwen has failed to include citations to legal authority in support of her allegations and, instead, relies significantly on matters outside of the District Court record.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">\u00b66 Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P., requires that an appellant present a concise, cohesive argument which \u201ccontain[s] the contentions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>appellant with respect to the issues presented, and the reasons therefor, with citations to the authorities, statutes and pages of the record relied on.\u201d As stated above, Gwen\u2019s brief contains general contentions of impropriety but no citations to the record or supporting legal authority. This Court has repeatedly held that we will not consider unsupported issues or arguments. <em>In re Custody of Krause, </em>2001 MT 37, \u00b6 32, 304 Mont. 202, \u00b6 32, 19 P.3d 811, \u00b6 32. Similarly, this Court is under no obligation to locate authorities or formulate arguments for a party in support of positions taken on appeal. <em>In re B.P., </em>2001 MT 219, \u00b6 41, 306 Mont. 430, \u00b6 41, 35 P.3d 291, \u00b6 41. Failure to comply with Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P., is fatal to an appeal. <em>State v. Blackcrow, </em>1999 MT 44, \u00b6 33, 293 Mont. 374, \u00b6 33, 975 P.2d 1253, \u00b6 33. While dismissal is a harsh result, it is nonetheless necessary when the utter failure to comply with the rules of appellate procedure results in an appellate filing that can neither be comprehended by this Court or realistically responded to by the opposing party. <em>See City ofWhitefish v. Hansen </em>(1989), 237 Mont. 105, 771 P.2d 976.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">\u00b67  In the past, we have demonstrated that we are willing to make accommodations for pro se parties by relaxing those technical requirements which do not impact fundamental bases for appeal. However, a district court\u2019s decision is presumed correct and it is the appellant who bears the burden of establishing error by that court. <em>Matter of M.J.W., </em>1998 MT 142, \u00b6 18, 289 Mont. 232, \u00b6 18, 961 P.2d 105, \u00b6 18. Gwen simply has not met her burden in this regard. Accordingly, we hereby dismiss Gwen\u2019s appeal for failing to comply with the Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure and affirm the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b197-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES REGNIER, LEAPHART and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
