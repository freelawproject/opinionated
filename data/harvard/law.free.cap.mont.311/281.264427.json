We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">\u00b62 The following issue is dispositive of this appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in relying on Jackson\u2019s prior DUI convictions for sentence enhancement purposes?</p>\n<p id=\"b302-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b302-12\">\u00b64 On January 11, 2001, the State charged Jackson by Information with the felony offense of operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol or drugs (DUI), a fourth or subsequent offense. Jackson moved the District Court to dismiss the DUI charge. In doing so, he alleged that two of his three previous DUI convictions were invalid for sentence enhancement purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-13\">\u00b65 Jackson\u2019s first DUI conviction was in February 1990. In that matter, he signed a document that waived his right to counsel when he originally entered a plea of not guilty. Jackson later pled guilty and signed an Acknowledgment of Waiver of Rights By Plea of Guilty (the \u201cAcknowledgment of Waiver\u201d). In November 1993, the State charged Jackson with a second DUI offense. On that charge, Jackson had an attorney, went to trial and was found guilty. The State charged Jackson with his third DUI in November 1997. He did not have an attorney when he pled guilty in February 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-14\">\u00b66 On August 27, 2001, the District Court denied Jackson\u2019s Motion to Dismiss. Jackson then entered a conditional guilty plea, reserving the right to appeal. Jackson then appealed the court\u2019s Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-15\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b302-16\">\u00b67 Whether a prior conviction can be used to enhance a criminal sentence is a matter of law. <em>See State v. LaPier, </em>1998 MT 174, \u00b6 8, 289 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Mont. 392, \u00b6 8, 961 P.2d 1274, \u00b6 8. Our standard of review for a district court\u2019s conclusions of law is plenary and we must determine whether the court\u2019s conclusions are correct as a matter of law. <em>See State v. Okland </em>(1997) 283 Mont. 10, 14, 941 P.2d 431, 433. When reviewing a district court\u2019s findings of fact, we must determine whether those findings are clearly erroneous. <em>See Okland, </em>283 Mont, at 14, 941 P.2d at 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">\u00b68 Did the District Court err in relying on Jackson\u2019s prior DUI convictions for sentence enhancement purposes?</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">\u00b69  When a defendant collaterally attacks a prior conviction, a presumption of regularity attaches to the conviction. <em>See Okland, </em>283 Mont, at 18,941 P.2d at 436. The defendant, therefore, has the burden of producing direct evidence that the conviction was invalid. <em>See Okland, </em>283 Mont, at 18, 941 P.2d at 436. Once a defendant has made this showing, \u201cthe burden then shifts to the State to produce direct evidence and to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the prior conviction was not entered in violation of the defendant\u2019s rights.\u201d <em>Okland, </em>283 Mont, at 18, 941 P.2d at 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">\u00b610 On appeal, Jackson alleges that the State failed to meet its burden that his 1990 and 1998 DUI convictions were valid. He asserts that the Acknowledgment of Waiver he signed in 1990 did not include a waiver of the right to counsel. In addition, he claims that Judge Gallagher failed to demand a specific waiver of the right to counsel from him in 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">\u00b611  A defendant\u2019s failure to sign a waiver of rights form does not constitute reversible error. <em>See State v. Brown, </em>1999 MT 143, \u00b6 19,295 Mont. 5, \u00b6 19, 982 P.2d 1030, \u00b6 19. While the State must produce affirmative evidence of the constitutional validity of a defendant\u2019s prior conviction, there is no specific type of direct, affirmative evidence necessary for the state to produce. <em>See Brown, </em>\u00b6 20. Instead, the existence of a waiver of rights form is merely a factor we consider in the totality of the circumstances. <em>See Brown, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">\u00b612 The weight of the evidence and the credibility of witnesses are exclusively in the domain of the district court. <em>See State v. Couture, </em>1998 MT 137, \u00b6 17, 289 Mont. 215, \u00b6 17, 959 P.2d 948, \u00b6 17. Thus, when the evidence conflicts, the district court is in the best position to make the necessary inferences and determine which evidence is more persuasive. <em>See Couture, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">\u00b613 Here, Jackson signed a Waiver of Right to Attorney in 1990. By <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>signing this waiver, Jackson not only waived his right to an attorney but also agreed that he had been advised of his right to counsel. Furthermore, he testified at the May 10, 2001, hearing that he knew that he had a right to counsel when he pled guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">\u00b614 As for the 1998 DUI conviction, Jackson testified during direct examination that he did not remember whether Butte-Silver Bow City Court Judge Thomas Gallagher had advised him that he had the right to counsel. When asked on cross-examination whether he remembered Judge Gallagher telling him that he had the right to have an attorney, he answered \u201cYes.\u201d In addition, Judge Gallagher testified that during Jackson\u2019s appearance to plead guilty, he told Jackson that he had a right to have an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">\u00b615  When given a defendant\u2019s affidavit on the one hand and the State\u2019s proof on the other, the district court is in the best position to weigh that evidence. <em>See Couture, </em>\u00b6 18. Here, the State presented the District Court with sufficient proof for it to rely on Jackson\u2019s earlier DUI convictions in sentencing. Therefore, we conclude that the District Court did not err in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">\u00b616 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b304-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES LEAPHART, NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
