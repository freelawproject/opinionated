We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">\u00b62 The following issue is dispositive of this appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">\u00b63 Did the application for a search warrant provide sufficient probable cause for its issuance?</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b123-12\">\u00b64 On March 13,2001, Helena Police Officer Mark Ekola applied for a search warrant to search the residence of Rick and Penny Grams (collectively, the \u201cGrams\u201d). Approximately one month earlier, authorities arrested fourteen-year-old Z.D. for possession of marijuana. Z.D. told Officer Ekola that he had twice purchased marijuana from R.G., a fellow student at C.R. Anderson Middle School. On March 8, 2001, authorities cited twelve-year-old M.J., another middle school student, for distributing marijuana on school grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-13\">\u00b65 Officer Ekola interviewed M. J. in the presence of her mother. During the interview, M. J. told Officer Ekola that she also obtained the marijuana from R.G. M. J. said that R.G. obtained her marijuana from her father, Rick.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-14\">\u00b66 During his investigation, Officer Ekola learned that R.G. had held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>a slumber party on February 24, 2001, at the Grams\u2019 home. R.G.\u2019s middle school friends, A.E., B.C., S.P., A.R. and S.R., attended the party. All the girls were between the ages of twelve and thirteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">\u00b67 S.R. told Officer Ekola that R.G. took them into her father\u2019s bedroom, where she pointed out a file cabinet. R.G. removed a large freezer bag full of apparent marijuana from the top drawer of the cabinet. R.G. told S.R. that her father approved of her smoking marijuana and did not care if she went into his bedroom to obtain the marijuana. The girls attending the party told Officer Ekola that they smoked marijuana during that evening. Some of the youth told Officer Ekola that during the evening, Rick and Penny, and two unknown males, sat in the living room in front of the girls and smoked marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">\u00b68 Based on this information, Officer Ekola obtained a warrant to search the Grams\u2019 residence for marijuana and drug paraphernalia. On March 19, 2001, the State of Montana filed a complaint injustice court charging Rick and Penny with the following offenses: endangering the welfare of a child, a misdemeanor; criminal possession of dangerous drugs, a misdemeanor; and criminal possession of drug paraphernalia, a misdemeanor. The justice court conducted a bench trial on June 6, 2001. At the conclusion of trial, the State moved to dismiss the charge of endangering the welfare of a child, which the court granted. The court found both Rick and Penny guilty of criminal possession of dangerous drugs and criminal possession of drug paraphernalia. On June 19,2001, the court imposed sentence. Rick and Penny then filed a notice of appeal, and the justice court stayed their sentences pending the appeal to the District Court. \u00b69 The District Court set a scheduling conference for July 16, 2001. After the scheduling conference, the court set a jury trial for October 1, 2001. On August 30, 2001, Rick and Penny filed a motion to suppress all the evidence that law enforcement officers seized from their home. The Grams argued that probable cause did not support the search warrant. After hearing briefs on this matter, the District Court entered an order denying the Grams\u2019 motion to suppress. The Grams appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">\u00b610 When reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, we determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation and application of the law is correct. <em>See State v. Reesman, </em>2000 MT 243, \u00b6 18, 301 Mont. 408, \u00b6 18, 10 P.3d 83, \u00b6 18. In addition, our function as a reviewing court is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>ultimately to ensure that the lower court had a \u201csubstantial basis\u201d to determine that probable cause existed. <em>See Reesman, </em>\u00b6 19. In our review, we will pay great deference to a court\u2019s determination that probable cause existed and draw every reasonable inference possible to support that determination. <em>See Reesman, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">\u00b611 Did the application for a search warrant provide sufficient probable cause for its issuance?</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">\u00b612 The District Court held that the application for the search warrant provided sufficient legitimate information to uphold the validity of the search warrant. The court noted that the application contained two hearsay statements. In particular, M. J. stated that R.G. had told her that she obtains marijuana from her father and that R.G. told everyone that her father approves of her smoking marijuana. The court concluded that the statement by S.R. that R.G. took her and the other girls to Rick\u2019s bedroom and removed a large freezer bag of marijuana from the top drawer of his filing cabinet corroborated M. J.\u2019s statement. It also concluded that the statements of R.G.\u2019s friends that they smoked marijuana at a sleep-over party at the Grams\u2019 residence and that Rick and Penny smoked marijuana in front of them corroborated the statements about Rick approving of R.G. smoking marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">\u00b613 Rick and Penny disagree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that there was corroboration of the two hearsay statements. They maintain that the application did not show how S.R. could have personal knowledge that (1) the bedroom was Rick\u2019s, (2) M.J. removed the alleged freezer bag of marijuana from his filing cabinet and (3) the bag actually contained marijuana. The Grams also contend that, without independent law enforcement investigation of the hearsay statements, the girls\u2019 statements that they smoked marijuana all evening did not provide sufficient corroboration.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">\u00b614  In order for an application for a search warrant to be sufficient, it must state facts sufficient to show probable cause for the issuance of the warrant. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-5-221, MCA; <em>State v. Kuneff, </em>1998 MT 287, \u00b6 21, 291 Mont. 474, \u00b6 21, 970 P.2d 556, \u00b6 21. When deciding whether probable cause existed for issuance of a warrant, we follow the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test set forth in <em>Illinois v. Gates </em>(1983), 462 U.S. 213, 103 S. Ct. 2317, 76 L. Ed. 2d 527. <em>See State v. Crowder </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 169, 173, 810 P.2d 299, 302. Under this test, to determine whether a court should issue a search warrant, \u201cthe judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>evaluates the facts asserted within the four corners of the application and makes a practical, common-sense decision as to whether there is a fair probability that incriminating items will be found in the place to which entry is sought.\u201d <em>State v. Worrall, </em>1999 MT 55, \u00b6 28, 293 Mont. 439, \u00b6 28, 976 P.2d 968, \u00b6 28 (citing <em>State v. Sundberg </em>(1988), 235 Mont. 115, 119, 765 P.2d 736, 739).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">\u00b615 As a reviewing court, we too must look solely to the information given to the impartial magistrate and to the four corners of the search warrant application. <em>See Crowder, </em>248 Mont, at 173, 810 P.2d at 302 (citing <em>Sundberg, </em>235 Mont, at 121, 765 P.2d at 740). We will not review a search warrant application sentence by sentence, but, rather, we will examine the entire affidavit to determine whether the issuing magistrate had a substantial basis to conclude that probable cause existed. <em>See State v. Hulbert </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 317, 323, 877 P.2d 25, 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">\u00b616 Not all evidence in the application for the search warrant was hearsay. The application noted that five girls told law enforcement that they had smoked marijuana at the Grams\u2019 home and that the Grams smoked marijuana in front of them. This case turns on whether this testimony provided the magistrate sufficient probable cause to issue a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">\u00b617 We set forth a step-by-step analysis in <em>Reesman </em>for determining whether an informant\u2019s information is sufficient to establish probable cause. The initial question is whether the informants were anonymous. <em>See Reesman, </em>\u00b6 28. Here, the five girls, A.E., B.C., S.P., A.R. and S.R., who attended the slumber party are informants. None of them are anonymous, as all five spoke directly with law enforcement officers and the application in support of the search warrant identifies all five.</p>\n<p id=\"A9\">\u00b618 If the informants are not anonymous, as is the case here, we then turn to a second threshold question: \u201cis the informant\u2019s information based on his or her personal observation of the described criminal activity? In other words, is the basis of the information hearsay?\u201d <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6 29. A.E., B.C., S.P., A.R. and S.R. base their statements on personal observation; they admitted smoking marijuana at Rick\u2019s house and told law enforcement officers that Rick and Penny smoked marijuana in front of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">\u00b619  Because the girls\u2019 statements were based on first-hand evidence, the final question is whether the informant is a reliable source of such information. <em>See Reesman, </em>\u00b6 31. A magistrate can deem an informant reliable if: (1) an officer\u2019s application for a search warrant identifies an informant as a \u201cconfidential informant\u201d who has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>provided reliable and accurate information to law enforcement officers in the past; (2) the informant makes an unequivocal admission against interest; or (3) the informant was motivated by good citizenship and demonstrates a sufficient understanding of the circumstances under which the informant came to know the information. <em>See Reesman, </em>\u00b6 32-34. If the informant is deemed reliable under one of these three scenarios, then the police need not independently corroborate the informant\u2019s information. <em>See Reesman, </em>\u00b6 35. Here, the five girls admitted smoking marijuana, an illegal substance. These admissions constituted an unequivocal admission against their interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">\u00b620 For these reasons, we conclude that the girls\u2019 admissions that they smoked marijuana in the Grams\u2019 presence, while the Grams also smoked marijuana, in the Grams\u2019 home, provided sufficient probable cause to obtain a search warrant. Because these admissions constituted sufficient probable cause, we need not address the adequacy of the hearsay statements concerning admissions by M. J. \u00b621 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b127-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, TRIEWEILER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
