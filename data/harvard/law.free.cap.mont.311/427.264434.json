The District Court issued a preliminary injunction which prohibits FWP from interfering with Spoklie\u2019s sales of alternative livestock (elk) to third persons, even if the third persons subsequently shoot the elk at Spoklie\u2019s facility. FWP and Defendant-intervenors Sportsmen for I-143 and Montana Wildlife Federation (hereinafter \u201cSportsmen\u201d), moved to dissolve the preliminary injunction. The District Court denied that motion. FWP and Sportsmen appeal from the order denying the motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction. We reverse the order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the District Court\u2019s preliminary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>injunction interferes with FWP\u2019s enforcement of \u00a7 87-4-414(2), MCA, and is therefore prohibited by \u00a7 27-19-103(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-3\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AGT\">\u00b63 Plaintiff Robert Spoklie owns alternative livestock, including elk, located at Spoklie Elk Ranches in Sheridan County, and Spoklie Enterprises, LLC, in Flathead County. Spoklie is partial owner of both Spoklie Elk Ranches, which owns one alternative livestock license, and Spoklie Enterprises, which owns two licenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">\u00b64 On November 7,2000, voters passed 1-143, which \u201cprohibits] new game farms, prohibit[s] transfer of existing game farm licenses, and prohibit[s] shooting of game farm animals for a fee.\u201d The proponents of 1-143 stated in the voter pamphlet that 1-143 would \u201cstop the unethical captive shooting of penned big game animals, also known as \u2018canned hunts.\u2019 \u201d In addition, the proponents stated that further regulation of the game farm industry was necessary to reduce the health risks game farm livestock pose to other wildlife. 1-143 had a November 7, 2000, effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">\u00b65 FWP drafted new policies and procedures reflecting the 1-143 \u201cfee shooting\u201d amendments, and on December 28, 2000, FWP sent a letter to all alternative livestock licensees informing them of the new policies. Enclosed with that letter were copies of a letter stating FWP\u2019s \u201cpolicy decisions for the shooting and transfer issues,\u201d and a letter setting forth FWP\u2019s legal analysis in support of the new policy decisions. The \u201cpolicy decisions\u201d letter was a December 15,2000, letter from Patrick Graham, Director of FWP, to Duane Douglas, Chairman of the Alternative Livestock Advisory Council. The letter stated that, with the 1-143 amendments in effect:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-6\">Persons who acquire ownership in alternative livestock after November 7, 2000 are not permitted to dispatch their animals with a high-powered rifle, bow and arrow or crossbow. Only the licensee, principle [sic] manager or DYM (designated agent) is allowed to so dispatch alternative livestock that have had ownership transferred to persons other than an alternative livestock licensee after November 7, 2000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">The second letter was dated December 12, 2000, and was from Robert Lane, Chief Legal Counsel for FWP, to Pat Graham, Director of FWP. It set forth the following rationale:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-8\">The changes to 87-4-414(2) make it clear that a licensee is prohibited from permitting the shooting or harvesting of alternative livestock on a licensed facility when it is for a fee. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>is the interpretation of the FWP legal unit that after the effective date of the initiative the electorate intended to remove from the list of lawful activities that a person other than the licensee could engage in on an alternative livestock facility, the right to shoot or harvest game or alternative livestock with a bow and arrow, cross-bow or high powered rifle for a fee. Because of the difficulty in being able to establish whether or not a particular shooting or harvesting was or was not for a fee the only practical means of enforcing the prohibition is to limit the shooting of animals on alternative livestock facilities to the license owner or principal manager. This is in keeping with the policy of the Department established prior to passage of 1-143 that on an alternative livestock facility which was not licensed as a shooter facility that only the owner or principal manager was permitted to dispatch game or alternative livestock on that facility. The following scenario is provided to illustrate the scope of this interpretation. After the effective date of the initiative when a licensee sells an animal to a non-licensee whether or not there was any provision for \u2018boarding\u2019 the animal, part of the purchase price is presumed to be the use of the facility to shoot the animal. The game farm licensee cannot then allow the new owner to shoot the animal without violating the law. Therefore, restricting the killing of alternative livestock to the licensee or principal manager is a reasonable means of preventing a possible violation of 87-4-414(2). In this way the rights of the new owner are not impacted since the new owner of the animal can use the licensee or principal manager to dispatch the animal for them if they so desire. The only thing the new alternative livestock owner is losing is the experience of shooting, for a fee, the alternative livestock which is exactly the activity that persons other than an alternative livestock licensee can no longer engage in as a result of the initiative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">\u00b66 Spoklies filed a complaint in the District Court on September 28, 2001, in which they requested a temporary restraining order (TRO), a preliminary injunction, a permanent injunction, and declaratory judgment that FWP\u2019s new policies were not enforceable. Spoklies did not challenge the constitutionality of 1-143; rather, Spoklies claimed that FWP\u2019s policy decisions incorrectly interpreted the 1-143 \u201cfee shooting\u201d and license transfer provisions. Spoklies alleged that FWP\u2019s erroneous interpretation of 1-143 \u201cprevents Plaintiffs from legally selling their livestock to a bona fide purchaser who may desire to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>dispatch his or her newly acquired property at Plaintiffs\u2019 ranches.\u201d Spoklies complaint, as amended, claimed that their business was compliant with the codification of 1-143 at \u00a7 87-4-414(2), MCA, because they merely sold elk to third parties and that \u201c[o]nce the new owner takes legal possession of the animal, he or she can choose to field slaughter the animal if he or she so desires at the ranches or arrange for the transport of the live animal off the premises,\u201d but that \u201conce purchased, it is up to the buyer to arrange for the transportation of that animal from the ranch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-3\">\u00b67 Spoklies further claimed that FWP\u2019s enforcement or threat to enforce its new policy would cause irreparable injury because they would lose at least 13 pending sales, estimated at $71,000; they would lose approximately 70% of the gross revenue from farming and ranching operations; and, they would default on their loans and lose their ranch properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">\u00b68 The District Court granted a TRO on September 28, 2001, and sent notice to FWP. The TRO ordered FWP to \u201cimmediately cease, desist and restrain from initiating enforcement actions against Plaintiffs for selling their privately-owned alternative livestock to third parties who then seek to harvest their newly acquired property at Plaintiffs\u2019 facility and against the third parties who purchase the livestock....\u201d On October 4,2001, FWP moved to dissolve the TRO, and on October 5, 2001, FWP appeared at the show cause hearing and contended that \u00a7 27-19-103(4), MCA, prohibited enjoining enforcement of a statute for the public benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">\u00b69 On October 15, 2001, Sportsmen moved to intervene in the proceedings. Spoklies opposed that motion. On October 22, 2001, the District Court granted the preliminary injunction against FWP, continued the stay imposed by the TRO, and rejected FWP\u2019s motion to dissolve the TRO.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">\u00b610 On November 8,2001, Spoklies moved to amend its complaint and to certify the case as a class action. Spoklies later moved to request oral argument on this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">\u00b611 On November 27, 2001, the District Court denied Sportsmen\u2019s motion to intervene. We accepted supervisory control over the intervention issue, and permitted Sportsmen to intervene on February 19, 2002. That Opinion and Order is found at <em>Sportsmen For 1-143 v. Fifteenth Jud. Court, </em>2002 MT 18, 308 Mont. 189, 40 P.3d 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">\u00b612 On June 5, 2002, Sportsmen and FWP filed a joint motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction, contending the injunction was wrongfully issued as a matter of law in violation of \u00a7 27-19-103(4), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">\u00b613 On June 15, 2002, the District Court denied Spoklies\u2019 motion for oral argument for being untimely, granted Spoklies\u2019 motion for certifying a class action, and denied the joint motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction. The court concluded that the injunction did not enjoin FWP\u2019s enforcement of \u00a7 87-4-414, MCA, but that FWP\u2019s policy was inconsistent with the language of \u00a7 87-4-414(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">\u00b614 FWP and Sportsmen appeal that part of the order that denied the joint motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">\u00b615 Generally, when reviewing a district court\u2019s order granting or denying an injunction, we apply an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Hagener v. Wallace, </em>2002 MT 109, \u00b6 12, 309 Mont. 473, \u00b6 12, 47 P.3d 847, \u00b6 12. However, where \u201cthe district court bases its decision to grant such relief upon its interpretation of a statute, no discretion is involved and we review the district court\u2019s conclusion of law to determine whether it is correct.\u201d <em>Hagener, </em>\u00b6 12 (citing <em>M.H. v. Montana High School Ass\u2019n </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 123, 130, 929 P.2d 239, 243).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">\u00b616 Accordingly, we will review the District Court\u2019s conclusions of law and interpretation of \u00a7 87-4-414(2), MCA, for correctness. Where those conclusions are correct, \u201cwe will not interfere with the court\u2019s exercise of discretion unless there is a showing of manifest abuse of such discretion.\u201d <em>Mont. Tavern Ass\u2019n v. State, Dept. of Revenue, </em>224 Mont. 258, 263, 729 P.2d 1310, 1314 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">\u00b617 Preliminarily we must decide whether to consider the argument Spoklies raise for the first time on appeal, that FWP and Sportsmen failed to comply with the affidavit and hearing requirements for a motion to dissolve a preliminary injunction?</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">\u00b618 Spoklies contend that the District Court should be affirmed because FWP and Sportsmen failed to support their motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction with an affidavit as required by \u00a7 27-19-401, MCA, and that no hearing was held, as required by \u00a7 27-19-404, MCA. Sportsmen respond that Spoklies did not raise either of these issues in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-12\">\u00b619 We will not consider issues that are raised for the first time on appeal. <em>In re Marriage of Binsfield </em>(1995), 269 Mont. 336, 344, 888 P.2d 889, 894. Spoklies did not raise the affidavit or hearing issues before the District Court. Therefore, we decline to consider them on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-3\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">\u00b620 The issue on appeal is whether the District Court\u2019s preliminary injunction interferes with FWP\u2019s enforcement of \u00a7 87-4-414(2), MCA, and is therefore prohibited by \u00a7 27-19-103(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">\u00b621 The District Court concluded that the preliminary injunction did not interfere with the enforcement of \u00a7 87-4-414(2), MCA (as amended by 1-143). The District Court gave the following explanation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-6\">87-4-414MCAbans the \u201c...shootingof....alternativelivestock....for a fee...\u201d The Montana Fish, Wildlife, and Parks policy decision and interpretation of this statute goes far beyond the statutory language, saying, among other things, \u201cPersons who acquire ownership in alternative livestock after November 7,2000 are not permitted to dispatch their animals with a high powered rifle, bow and arrow, or crossbow.\u201d This interpretation interferes with the ordinary management of domesticated livestock and clearly goes far beyond the statutory prohibitions. If this interpretation were allowed to be used during the pendency of this action, the Plaintiffs would be irreparably harmed before the case was resolved ... When the Intervenors were petitioning the Supreme Court, they themselves argued \u201ca grant of a stay of further proceedings will not prejudice the plaintiffs since the District Court already enjoined the enforcement ofI-143\u201d. The Intervenors were wrong in their statement, in that the injunction did not restrict enforcement of 1-143 and the related statutes, it restricted \u201c...enforcement actions against Plaintiffs for selling their privately-owned alternative livestock to third parties who then seek to harvest their newly acquired property at Plaintiffs\u2019 facility and against third parties who purchase the livestock...\u201d It is not a restriction to enforcement of Section 87-4-414 MCA and the prohibition of shooting alternative livestock for a fee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">\u00b622 On appeal, Spoklies contend that the District Court\u2019s reasoning is sound and that the injunction does not interfere with the execution of \u00a7 87-4-414(2), MCA. FWP and Sportsmen, however, contend that the District Court erred as a matter of law when it refused to dissolve the preliminary injunction in spite of \u00a727-19-103(4), MCA, which prohibits injunctions \u201cto prevent the execution of a public statute by officers of the law for the public benefit ....\u201d Sportsmen suggest that Spoklies\u2019 planned sales are schemes to sell a \u201ccanned hunting experience,\u201d and FWP made similar claims before the court during the October 5,2001, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>show cause hearing. Accordingly, it is necessary that we consider the conduct at issue to consider whether it is prohibited by the language of \u00a7 87-4-414(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">\u00b623 The District Court entered the following injunction in the TRO:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AlO\">DEFENDANT IS HEREBY ORDERED to immediately cease, desist, and restrain from initiating enforcement actions against Plaintiffs for selling their privately-owned alternative livestock to third parties who then seek to harvest their newly acquired property at Plaintiffs facility and against the third parties who purchase the livestock ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">\u00b624 To determine whether the District Court\u2019s orders interfere with the enforcement of \u00a7 87-4-414(2), MCA, or other related statutes, we apply general rules of statutory construction. Section 1-2-101, MCA, provides that our duty \u201cis simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted. Where there are several provisions or particulars, such construction is, if possible, to be adopted as will give effect to all.\u201d This Court will reject a construction of a statute that would leave any part of the statute without effect. <em>Monteo v. Simonich </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 280, 287, 947 P.2d 1047, 1051 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">\u00b625 Section 87-4-414(2), MCA, with the 1-143 amendment italicized, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-7\">The licensee may acquire, breed, grow, keep, pursue, handle, harvest, use, sell, or dispose of the alternative livestock and their progeny in any quantity and at any time of year as long as the licensee complies with the requirements of this part, <em>except that the licensee may not allow the shooting of game animals or alternative livestock, as defined in 87-2-101 or 87-4-406, or of any exotic big game species for a fee or other remuneration on an alternative livestock facility.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Absent statutory definitions, the plain meaning of the words used in the statute controls. <em>Thomas Bros. v. Cargill, Inc. </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 105, 110, 915 P.2d 226, 229. An alternative livestock \u201cfacility\u201d is defined as \u201cperimeter fences and other enclosures that provide for the confinement, handling, and quarantine of alternative livestock.\u201d Section 87-4-406(5), MCA. \u201cFee\u201d is commonly understood as: \u201c[a] fixed sum charged, as by an institution or by law for a privilege.\u201d AMERICAN HERITAGE DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE 669 (3d ed. 1996). \u201cRemuneration\u201d in this context is commonly understood as: \u201c[sjomething, such as a payment, that remunerates.\u201d AMERICAN <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>HERITAGE DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE 1527. \u201cRemunerate\u201d is defined as: \u201cTo pay (a person) a suitable equivalent in return for goods provided, services rendered, or losses incurred; recompense. 2. To compensate for; make payment for.\u201d AMERICAN HERITAGE DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE 1527.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-3\">\u00b626 The language of \u00a7 87-4-414(2), MCA, as amended, provides a licensee with several clear options: he can sell his livestock; he can harvest (or shoot) his own livestock; or he can allow the livestock to be harvested by someone else-so long as it is not done on his premises for a fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">\u00b627 Spoklies argue, and the District Court agreed, that they are not getting a fee for the right to shoot elk at their facility. However, that contention is belied by the fact that Spoklies have alleged irreparable harm if the animals cannot be harvested (shot) by their clients on their premises. If the only charge is for the value of the animal, then the right to shoot it is inconsequential. If the right to shoot the animal on Spoklies\u2019 property is inconsequential, then they cannot meet the necessary test for a preliminary injunction. <em>See </em>\u00a7 27-19-201(2), MCA. \u00b628 From the facts alleged in Spoklies\u2019 complaint, it is difficult to understand how FWP\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 87-4-414(2), MCA, would eliminate most or all of their sales <em>unless </em>the fee or other remuneration is related to the privilege to shoot the \u201cnewly-purchased livestock.\u201d If the Spoklies\u2019 average elk price, $5,462, merely represents the actual market value of the average elk, then FWP\u2019s interpretation of the \u201cfee shooting\u201d provisions should not cause Spoklies to lose any of their current purchasers. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Spoklies\u2019 elk price accurately reflected the true value of the elk and that it excluded the value of shooting the elk, FWP\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 87-4-414(2), MCA, \u201cfee shooting\u201d prohibition should have no impact on its elk sales whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">\u00b629  Therefore, we conclude that the activity at issue in this case does constitute the type of activity prohibited by \u00a7 87-4-414(2), MCA, as amended by 1-143. Spoklies clearly consider the right of third persons to harvest elk at their facility an important part of the consideration they receive in exchange for the fees Spoklies are paid. That arrangement is exactly what is now prohibited by statute. Therefore, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s preliminary injunction does interfere with FWP\u2019s execution of \u00a7 87-4-414(2), MCA-a statute enacted for the public benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">\u00b630 We must next consider Spoklies\u2019 argument that the District Court may grant a preliminary injunction despite \u00a7 27-19-103(4), MCA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>where a party demonstrates irreparable injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">\u00b631 FWP and Sportsmen contend that our holding in <em>State ex rel. Freebourn v. Carroll </em>(1929), 85 Mont. 439, 279 P. 234, expressly precludes injunctions against public officials executing public statutes for the public welfare, unless there is a valid claim that the statute enforced was itself unconstitutional or invalid. FWP and Sportsmen do not challenge Spoklies\u2019 claim of irreparable harm but argue that injunctive relief would only be available if Spoklies claimed and sufficiently proved that \u00a7 87-4-414(2), MCA, as amended is unconstitutional or invalid. FWP and Sportsmen additionally note that there are several other cases pending in other forums, several of which do challenge the constitutionality of 1-143 and \u00a7 87-17-414(2), MCA, as amended. FWP and Sportsmen conclude that <em>Freebourn </em>expressly controls this situation, and request that we overrule, distinguish, or dismiss as dicta language <em>inNew Club Carlin v. City of Billings </em>(1989), 237 Mont. 194, 772 P.2d 303, to the extent that it suggests that a district court may enjoin the execution of a public statute where the plaintiff demonstrates irreparable injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">\u00b632 In <em>New Club Carlin, </em>the plaintiff, a bar operator, sought a preliminary injunction against the City of Billings and its police chief after police arrested several employees of the bar for nude dancing or permitting nude dancing in the bar. The District Court denied the bar\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction. On appeal we acknowledged \u00a7 27-19-103(4), MCA, but also noted two circumstances in which injunctions are permitted pursuant to \u00a7 27-19-201, MCA. We then stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">To overcome the Montana statute \u00a7 27-19-103(4), MCA, and well-settled case law that an injunction cannot be granted to prevent the execution of a public statute for the public benefit, [the bar] must show irreparable injury or a violation of constitutional rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-7\"><em>New Club Carlin, </em>237 Mont, at 196, 772 P.2d at 305 <em>(citing Freebourn] </em>2 AmJur.2nd <em>Injunctions </em>\u00a7 243). After reviewing the bar\u2019s claims, we concluded that the bar did not have standing for its constitutional challenge to the statute and that the bar\u2019s monetary damages claim did not demonstrate irreparable injury, and affirmed the District Court. The language relied on by Spoklies was not necessary to those conclusions and was, at best, dicta. However, lest there be future confusion, we take this opportunity to point out that it was also partially incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">\u00b633 Despite our citation to <em>Freebourn </em>for the cited language in <em>New </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number><em>Club Carlin, Freebourn </em>does not stand for the proposition that irreparable injury is sufficient to overcome \u00a7 27-19-103(4), MCA. In <em>Freebourn, </em>the plaintiff, a kennel club, sought to enjoin a county attorney from threatening to arrest the officers and agents of the club and seize the club\u2019s assets if they conducted races. The county attorney insisted that the races conducted at the club were in violation of Montana law, and that it was his duty to inform those persons of their violations of Montana law. The District Court entered a TRO against the county attorney, and on appeal we reversed that order. We recognized that a court of equity has no jurisdiction to enjoin criminal prosecutions. <em>Freebourn, </em>85 Mont, at 443, 279 P. at 235. We adopted the general principle that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-3\">[A] court of equity has no jurisdiction in matters merely criminal or immoral. It leaves the correction of these matters to the criminal courts. The rale which prevents a court of chancery from interfering with the administration of the criminal laws of the state is a wise one, founded upon sound principles of public policy. Any other would result in much confusion and embarrassment, in preserving peace and order and enforcing the police power of the state generally.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><em>Freebourn, </em>85 Mont, at 444, 279 P. at 235 (citing 10 Ruling Case Law 341, 342). We farther determined that \u201cwhether the manner in which the club is conducting its business constitutes a criminal offense is a question to be determined by the court sitting as a court of law in a criminal case, and not as a court of equity.\u201d <em>Freebourn, </em>85 Mont, at 444, 279 P. at 235 (citations omitted). We quoted <em>Shuman v. Gilbert </em>(Mass. 1918), 118 N.E. 254, 257, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-5\">\u201cSimply that one is in business, and may be injured in respect of his business by prosecution for an alleged crime, is no sufficient reason for asking a court of equity to ascertain in advance whether the business as conducted is in violation of a penal statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-6\"><em>Freebourn, </em>85 Mont, at 444-45, 279 P. at 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">\u00b634 In <em>Freebourn, </em>we did recognize an exception to the general rule, however, it did not involve an \u201cirreparable harm.\u201d We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-8\">The courts recognize an exception to the general rale when property rights are invaded by the threatened prosecution under a void statute. Hence equitable jurisdiction exists to restrain criminal prosecutions under unconstitutional or invalid statutes when necessary to safeguard property rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-9\"><em>Freebourn, </em>85 Mont, at 444, 279 P. at 235 (citing 32 C.J. 243, 279-280 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>(1923)). When we construed <em>Freebourn </em>in <em>New Club Carlin </em>to include irreparable harm as an exception to the statute, we ignored our previous citation in <em>Freebourn </em>to 32 C.J. 279-280 which also states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-4\">The general rule is that an injunction will not be granted to stay criminal or quasi criminal proceedings, whether the prosecution is for the violation of the common law or the infraction of statutes or municipal ordinances, nor to stay the enforcement of orders of a state commission. If the statute on which the prosecution is based is valid, the fact that the enforcement thereof would materially injure complainant\u2019s business or property constitutes no ground for equitable interference. <em>It is only where the statute or ordinance is unconstitutional or otherwise invalid and where in the attempt to enforce it there is a direct invasion of property rights resulting in irreparable injury that an injunction will issue to restrain the enforcement thereof Both of these elements are </em>indispensable....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">32 C.J. 279-280 (emphasis added). In <em>Freebourn, </em>we did not conclude that any statutory exceptions exist. We merely acknowledged a court-recognized exception to \u00a7 27-19-103(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">\u00b635  Since Spoklies have neither alleged nor demonstrated that I-143 or \u00a7 87-4-414(2), MCA, as amended is unconstitutional, we conclude that the District Court erred, as a matter of law, when it enjoined FWP\u2019s execution of \u00a7 87-4-414(2), MCA. We reverse the District Court\u2019s order that denied FWP\u2019s and Sportsmen\u2019s motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b458-7\">JUSTICES REGNIER, COTTER, NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
