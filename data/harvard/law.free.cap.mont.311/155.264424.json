We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-12\">\u00b62 The following issue is raised on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b176-13\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in concluding that Alan Ferrin\u2019s personal injuries were not caused by an accident resulting from the use of Carl Wajahuski\u2019s insured motor vehicle?</p>\n<p id=\"b176-14\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AqW\">\u00b64 The essential facts of this case are undisputed. In 1995, Farrel Ferrin (Ferrin) discussed purchasing Carl Wajahuski\u2019s (Wajahuski) .30/.30 caliber rifle for his son Alan Ferrin (Alan). At the time, Alan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>was 12 years old. As part of the purchasing process, the Ferrins and Wajahuski arranged a hunting trip so that Alan could hunt deer with the rifle. On October 22,1995, the Ferrins drove from their residence in Helena, Montana, to Wajahuski\u2019s mother\u2019s residence in Townsend, Montana. Upon the Ferrins\u2019 arrival, Wajahuski informed them that he had arranged a hunt on private land near Harlowton, Montana, and that they would travel together in Wajahuski\u2019s vehicle from Harlowton to the hunting site. Wajahuski owned a 1990 Ford Nissan pickup truck that was insured by State Farm Mutual Insurance Company (State Farm).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">\u00b65 Wajahuski drove his truck to Harlowton and the Ferrins traveled in their own vehicle. When Wajahuski and the Ferrins arrived in Harlowton, the Ferrins parked their vehicle and the parties rode together in Wajahuski\u2019s truck. Upon arriving at the property where they intended to hunt, they drove around in search of deer. Wajahuski eventually spotted some deer below a ridge, and he instructed the Ferrins to exit the truck and walk downhill while he and his mother circled behind in his truck in order to help load any deer that were shot or to pick up the Ferrins if they were unsuccessful. The deer were approximately 200 to 250 yards from the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">\u00b66 Alan carried Wajahuski\u2019s .30/.30 rifle. At the time, it was loaded with some ammunition that Wajahuski had personally reloaded and some factory-loaded ammunition. After walking about 25 to 50 yards, Alan raised the rifle and fired. He missed his first shot, and he ejected the shell and loaded another cartridge. As Alan fired a second shot, the rifle exploded and nearly severed one of his hands. Ferrin shouted for help and Wajahuski returned. The men loaded Alan into Wajahuski\u2019s vehicle and drove him to a hospital in Harlowton. Alan was subsequently flown by helicopter to Billings, Montana, for further treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">\u00b67 On December 14, 1999, Ferrin, individually and as parent and guardian of Alan, filed a complaint in the Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade Coirnty, alleging that Wajahuski was liable for Alan\u2019s injuries because he had negligently reloaded the round of ammunition which caused the rifle to explode in Alan\u2019s hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">\u00b68 On March 27, 2000, State Farm filed a declaratory judgment action in the First Judicial District Court. It contended that there was a controversy over whether its automobile insurance contract with Wajahuski provided liability coverage with respect to any claims for bodily injury asserted by Ferrin. Both State Farm and Ferrin filed motions for summary judgment on the issue of whether Alan\u2019s injuries were caused by an accident resulting from the use of Wajahuski\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">\u00b69 The District Court held that they were not, and it denied Ferrin\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granted State Farm\u2019s motion. Ferrin appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">\u00b610 Our standard of review in appeals from summary judgment rulings is <em>de novo, </em>and we apply the same Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., criteria as the district court. <em>Wendell v. State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co., </em>1999 MT 17, \u00b6 9, 293 Mont. 140, \u00b6 9, 974 P.2d 623, \u00b6 9 (citation omitted). Pursuantto Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P., summary judgement is appropriate if there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">\u00b611 The interpretation of an insurance contract is a question of law. <em>Pablo v. Moore, </em>2000 MT 48, \u00b6 12,298 Mont. 393, \u00b6 12, 995 P.2d 460, \u00b612 (citation omitted). This Court reviews a conclusion of law to determine whether it is correct. <em>Pablo, </em>\u00b6 12 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">\u00b612 Did the District Court err in concluding that Alan Ferrin\u2019s personal injuries were not caused by an accident resulting from the use of Carl Wajahuski\u2019s insured motor vehicle?</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">\u00b613 The insurance policy issued to Wajahuski by State Farm included the following provision:</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">We will:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-12\">1) Pay damages, including punitive or exemplary damages, which an insured becomes legally liable to pay because of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-13\">A. Bodily injury to others; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-14\">B. Damage to or destruction of property including loss of use Caused by accident resulting from the ownership,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-15\">maintenance, or use of your car;...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-16\">\u00b614 In <em>Wendell, </em>an uninsured motorist case, we concluded that the phrase \u201carising out of the use\u201d is ambiguous, and we adopted an expansive, fact-intensive test to determine whether injuries \u201carise out of the use\u201d of an uninsured vehicle. We held that, for purposes of uninsured motorist coverage, an insured\u2019s injuries \u201carise out of the use\u201d of an uninsured vehicle if the injuries originate from, or grow out of, or flow from the use of the uninsured vehicle. <em>Wendell, </em>\u00b6 54. The parties and the District Court applied the <em>Wendell </em>test in this case even though it is not an uninsured motorist case and even though a different insurance contract phrase is at issue: whether injuries were caused by an accident \u201cresulting from the use\u201d of a vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>\u00b615  We conclude that the <em>Wendell </em>test is applicable here. First, from the viewpoint of a consumer with average intelligence but not trained in the law or insurance business, the phrase \u201cresulting from the use\u201d is equally as ambiguous as the phrase \u201carising out of the use\u201d which we considered in <em>Wendell. </em>Like the phrase \u201carising out of the use,\u201d the phrase \u201cresulting from the use\u201d is reasonably subject to more than one interpretation. <em>See Wendell, </em>\u00b6 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">\u00b616  In interpreting an ambiguous phrase, we are guided by general principles regarding contract law as applied to insurance contracts. <em>Pablo, </em>\u00b6 17. If the terms of an insurance policy are ambiguous, obscure, or open to different constructions, we construe the terms in a light most favorable to the insured or other beneficiary, particularly if an ambiguous provision attempts to preclude the insurer\u2019s liability. <em>Pablo, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">\u00b617 While we considered the remedial purposes of uninsured motorist coverage in formulating the <em>Wendell </em>test, we conclude that the test need not be confined to cases involving only uninsured motorist coverage. The principles of construction governing ambiguous insurance contract terms and phrases remain the same whether the case involves an insured motorist or an uninsured motorist.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">\u00b618 Indeed, our <em>Wendell </em>decision cited other jurisdictions which have recognized that the reasoning with respect to uninsured motorist claims applies as well to other clauses in an insurance policy. In <em>Wendell, </em>we adopted the test set forth <em>in Insurance Co. of N. America v. Dorris </em>(Ga. App. 1982), 288 S.E.2d 856. <em>See Wendell, </em>\u00b6 54. In Norris, the Georgia Court of Appeals adopted the \"originate from, or grow out of, or flow from\u201d test from a case involving personal injury protection coverage-not uninsured motorist coverage. <em>See Dorris, </em>288 S.E.2d at 858 (quoting <em>Southeastern Fidelity Ins. Co. v. Stevens </em>(Ga. App. 1977), 236 S.E.2d 550, 551). The <em>Dorris </em>court reasoned that although the <em>Stevens </em>case involved personal injury protection coverage, its holding regarding the sufficiency of a causal connection between an injury and use of a vehicle was \u201cnonetheless relevant for purposes of contractual interpretation.\u201d <em>Dorris, </em>288 S.E.2d at 858.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">\u00b619 Additionally, in <em>Wendell </em>we discussed with approval <em>General Accident Ins. Co. of America v. Olivier </em>(R.I. 1990), 574 A.2d 1240. <em>Wendell, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 43-44. In <em>Olivier, </em>an uninsured motorist case, the Rhode Island Supreme Court concluded that the reasoning behind affording a broader meaning to the phrase \u201carise out of the use\u201d would likewise apply to the medical-payments portion of the insurance policy at issue. <em>Olivier, </em>574 A.2d at 1243.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>\u00b620  Accordingly, we hold that the expansive, fact-intensive test that we adopted in <em>Wendell </em>to determine whether injuries \u201carise out of the use\u201d of an uninsured vehicle is also applicable to determine whether bodily injury was caused by an accident \u201cresulting from the use\u201d of an insured vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">\u00b621 Ferrin contends that Alan\u2019s personal injuries were caused by an accident resulting from the use of Wajahuski\u2019s vehicle as set forth in Wajahuski\u2019s insurance policy and that State Farm is thus liable for the damages Alan suffered. He argues that the word \u201cuse\u201d as well as the phrase \u201cresulting from the use,\u201d are ambiguous and must be construed, under Montana law, against the insurer and in favor of the insured. Citing <em>Georgeson v. Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Ins. Co. </em>(D. Mont. 1998), 48 F.Supp.2d 1262, and <em>Fire Ins. Exchange v. Tibi </em>(D. Mont. 1995), 51 F.Supp.2d 1065, Ferrin claims that because the use of Wajahuski\u2019s vehicle was integrally related to Alan\u2019s activities and injuries at the time of the accident, Alan\u2019s injuries originated in, grew out of, or flowed from the use of Wajahuski\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">\u00b622 In <em>Tibi, </em>a rifle discharged inside a vehicle used for a guided antelope hunt when Tibi moved his personal belongings from the front seat of the vehicle to the back seat. <em>Tibi, </em>51 F.Supp.2d at 1068-69. A hunt participant standing outside near the vehicle was shot and injured. <em>Tibi, </em>51 F.Supp.2d at 1069. Tibi\u2019s insurance company filed a declaratory action alleging that its policy did not provide coverage to Tibi for the incident because the injuries sustained did not arise out of the use, loading or unloading of an insured vehicle. <em>Tibi, </em>51 F.Supp.2d at 1070. A Montana federal district court concluded that it was reasonable and foreseeable that weapons and other hunting gear would be placed in and moved during the course of a hunting trip. Because the injury occurred while a firearm and/or hunting gear were relocated in the vehicle so that Tibi could sit in the vehicle for the trip home, the court held that the requisite causal connection existed between the accident and the use of the vehicle. <em>Tibi, </em>51 F.Supp.2d at 1073.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">\u00b623 In <em>Georgeson, </em>a telecommunications employee was killed in a fall from a utility pole while stringing cable, one end of which was attached to a spool resting on a company truck\u2019s trailer. <em>Georgeson, </em>48 F.Supp.2d at 1263. Again, a question existed as to whether the accident was caused by the use of the uninsured vehicle. <em>Georgeson, </em>48 F.Supp.2d at 1265. A Montana federal district court held that because the company truck was used to transport cable to work sites and was used to raise and tension the cable as it was hung on utility poles, a causal connection existed between the underlying accident and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Georgeson\u2019s use of the company truck and trailer. <em>Georgeson, </em>48 F.Supp.2d at 1267-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">\u00b624 State Farm contends that Alan\u2019s personal injuries were not caused by an accident resulting from the use of Carl Wajahuski\u2019s insured motor vehicle. State Farm argues that although the <em>Wendell </em>test is expansive and fact-intensive, it requires that the connection between the use of the vehicle and the injury sustained be more than \u201cremote or tenuous.\u201d State Farm maintains that to conclude that Alan\u2019s injuries resulted from the use of Wajahuski\u2019s vehicle \u201cwould be to determine that liability coverage exists in any accident situation with the slightest connection to a vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">\u00b625 The District Court agreed and concluded that Alan\u2019s personal injuries were not caused by an accident resulting from the use of Carl Wajahuski\u2019s insured motor vehicle. The court reasoned that while it might have been reasonable and foreseeable that the rifle Alan was using would be placed in and moved about the vehicle as in <em>Tibi, </em>it was neither reasonable nor foreseeable that the firearm would contain allegedly negligently reloaded ammunition which would cause the gun to explode and injure Alan after he exited the vehicle and was 25-50 yards away from the vehicle when he fired the gun. We hold that the District Court reached the correct conclusion when it determined that this was not the type of accident which could reasonably be expected to occur as the result of using a vehicle for purposes of a hunting trip. Likewise, we hold that the District Court properly concluded that although the hunting party used Wajahuski\u2019s vehicle as part of their hunting trip, the use of the truck was not integrally related to the incidents surrounding the accident as was the vehicle in <em>Georgeson. </em>\u00b626 The other cases Ferrin cites are also inapposite. In each of them, the accidents in question would not have occurred without the use of the vehicle. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. v. McMichael </em>(Colo. 1995), 906 P.2d 92 (underinsured motorist coverage applied when employee\u2019s injuries arose out of his use of the company truck as a barricade and warning device); <em>Union Mutual Fire Ins. Co. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co. </em>(Me. 1987), 521 A.2d 308 (insurer liable for injuries incurred when removing loaded shotgun from automobile on hunting trip); <em>Commercial Casualty Ins. Co. v. Tri-State Transit Co. of Louisiana </em>(Miss. 1941), 1 So.2d 221 (insurer required to defend suit for death of bus passenger resulting from pneumonia allegedly contracted when bus broke down and passenger forced to walk in inclement weather); <em>State ex rel. Butte Brewing Co. v. District Court </em>(1940), 110 Mont. 250, 100 P.2d 932 (insurance policy covering the loading and unloading of an automobile covered injuries incurred during unloading of beer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>truck).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">\u00b627 Here, on the other hand, the accident with the rifle could have occurred without the use of Wajahuski\u2019s vehicle. As such, this is more akin to the circumstances of <em>Farmers Union Mutual Ins. Co. v. Blair </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 52, 817 P.2d 1156. In <em>Blair, </em>a passenger removed a loaded revolver from a friend\u2019s car, went into the house and, while removing the revolver from his pants, accidentally shot another man. <em>Blair, </em>250 Mont, at 53, 817 P.2d at 1157. The district court held that since the shooting accident occurred inside a house during a party after the passenger had left the car, the accident did not arise from the use of the vehicle. <em>Blair, </em>250 Mont, at 56-57, 817 P.2d at 1159.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">\u00b628  Here, as in <em>Blair, </em>the accident could have occurred in any location, regardless of where the rifle was stored or how the hunters reached their destination. The fact that the truck was used to transport the hunters and assist in the hunt simply provides no connection between the use of the truck and the explosion of the rifle. Had Alan walked to the hunt carrying the rifle or engaged in target practice in his backyard, the rifle still would have exploded.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">\u00b629 We hold that the District Com\u00ed; did hot err in concluding that Alan Ferrin\u2019s personal injuries were not caused by an accident resulting from the use of Carl Wajahuski\u2019s insured motor vehicle. Accordingly, State Farm was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">\u00b630 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b182-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, REGNIER and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
