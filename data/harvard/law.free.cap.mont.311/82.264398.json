Hevner appeals from an Order Granting Partial Summary Judgment and an Order Awarding Fees and Costs from the Eighteenth Judicial District Court, Gallatin County. We affirm and remand for a determination of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">\u00b62 The following issues are dispositive of this appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to Ponderosa Pines Ranch, Inc.?</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in awarding fees and costs under Rule 11 and \u00a7 37-61-421, MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">\u00b65 3. Should this Court award Ponderosa Pines Ranch, Inc., attorney\u2019s fees under Rule 32, M.R.App.P?</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">\u00b66 In the early 1970\u2019s, Ponderosa Pines R\u00e1nch, Inc. (\u201cPonderosa\u201d) acquired approximately 13,000 acres of land in Gallatin County, Montana. Ponderosa subdivided that property into around 1,000 lots. On May 18,1979, Ponderosa recorded a Declaration of Easements and Rights-of-Way (the \u201cDeclaration\u201d). In the Declaration, Ponderosa granted and reserved easements across and in favor of all lots within the development. The Declaration did not specify the location of any particular easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-12\">\u00b67 In 1985, Hevner purchased a lot in the development from Ponderosa. Hevner and Ponderosa executed a warranty deed, dated May 25, 1985, transferring the lot to Hevner. The deed incorporated the Declaration and its respective easements.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-13\">\u00b68 Beginning sometime around 1996, a dispute arose concerning the portion of Homestead Road that runs across Hevner\u2019s property. Hevner claims she made several attempts to stop others from using the road. During the summer of 2000, Hevner successfully blocked the Homestead Road by placing a fifth wheel trailer and some debris on the roadway.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-14\">\u00b69 Ponderosa then filed this action. In its complaint, Ponderosa alleged that it had an easement on Homestead Road. Ponderosa also sought monetary, injunctive and declaratory relief. On August 23, 2000, the court granted Ponderosa a preliminary injunction requiring Hevner not to interfere with Homestead Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-15\">\u00b610 Ponderosa then moved for partial summary judgment, arguing that it had an easement on Homestead Road by express reservation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>by implication and by prescription. It supported that motion with several affidavits and aerial photographs taken by the United States Department of Agriculture in 1979 and 1991. The court held a hearing regarding the motion for partial summary judgment on March 19, 2001. It then granted Ponderosa\u2019s motion on August 3, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">\u00b611 Following the court\u2019s order, Ponderosa moved for an award of fees and costs under Rule 11, M.R.Civ.P., and \u00a7 37-61-421, MCA. On September 19,2001, the court held a hearing regarding the motion for attorney\u2019s fees. The court then issued an Order Awarding Fees and Costs in favor of Ponderosa on October 4, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\u00b612 Hevner appealed both orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">\u00b613 We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same evaluation under Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., as the district court. <em>See Vivier v. State Dep\u2019t ofTransp., </em>2001 MT 221, \u00b6 5, 306 Mont. 454, \u00b6 5, 35 P.3d 958, \u00b6 5; <em>Bruner v. Yellowstone County </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 261, 264, 900 P.2d 901, 903. In <em>Bruner, </em>we stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-8\">The movant must demonstrate that no genuine issues of material fact exist. Once this has been accomplished, the burden then shifts to the non-moving party to prove, by more than mere denial and speculation, that a genuine issue does exist. Having determined that genuine issues of fact do not exist, the court must then determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We review the legal determinations made by a district court as to whether the court erred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-9\"><em>Bruner, </em>272 Mont, at 264-65, 900 P.2d at 903 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">\u00b614 When reviewing a district court\u2019s decision to impose Rule 11 sanctions, we use a combined standard: \u201cwhether the trial court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions constitute an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Madison Addition Architectural Comm. v. Youngwirth, </em>2000 MT 293, \u00b6 10,302 Mont. 302, \u00b6 10, 15 P.3d 1175,\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b105-12\">\u00b615 Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to Ponderosa Pines Ranch, Inc.?</p>\n<p id=\"b105-13\">\u00b616  An easement is a nonpossessory interest in land that gives a person the right to use the land of another for a specific purpose. <em>See Ruana v. Grigonis </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 441, 447, 913 P.2d 1247, 1251; <em>Kuhlman v. Rivera </em>(1985), 216 Mont. 353, 358, 701 P.2d 982, 985. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>person cannot create, grant or transfer an easement except by operation of law, by an instrument in writing or by prescription. <em>See Ruana, </em>275 Mont, at 447, 913 P.2d at 1251; <em>Wild River Adventures, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Sch. Dist. No. 8 </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 397, 400, 812 P.2d 344, 346. A person creates an easement by reservation through written documents of conveyance. <em>See Burleson v. Kinsey-Cartwright, </em>2000 MT 278, \u00b6 16, 302 Mont. 141, \u00b6 16, 13 P.3d 384, \u00b6 16. Where a document fails adequately to fix the location of an easement, a court may ascertain the location by use. <em>See </em>JON W. Bruce AND James W. Ely, The Law of Easements and Licenses in Land \u00a7 7:6, at 7-12 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">\u00b617 After reviewing the evidence presented by the parties, the District Court concluded that Homestead Road existed at the time of the Declaration and at the time Hevner bought the property from Ponderosa. Furthermore, the court held that the road was open and visible to Hevner. Any dispute about these facts, according to th\u00e9 court, were not genuine.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">\u00b618 Ponderosa presented the court with affidavits and physical evidence to demonstrate that Homestead Road existed across Hevner\u2019s property. Roberta Moche, the President of Ponderosa, testified by affidavit that a series of roads existed on the property when Ponderosa first began its development. These roads included Homestead Road. She also stated that Hevner and other individuals had used Homestead Road at will to access other property. This use had continued uninterrupted until 1999, when Hevner briefly blocked the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">\u00b619 Several disinterested witnesses also testified via affidavit. Mel Obrigewitch testified that he ran cattle around Hevner\u2019s property and had driven his truck up Homestead Road since 1978. Donna Buzdikian stated that she had used the road since 1976 for sightseeing and her husband used the road to haul grain. Art Koenes testified that he had hauled grain on Homestead Road since 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">\u00b620 Ponderosa also provided two aerial photographs to prove that the location of Homestead Road had not moved. The photographs were dated September 1,1979, and July 5,1991. The dates of these photos correspond to approximately six years before and after she bought the property, respectively. Ray Center, a licensed surveyor, testified that Homestead Road appeared in both aerial maps and in the same location as it presently runs across Hevner\u2019s property. Center also testified that no evidence existed on the ground that the road had existed in a different location.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">\u00b621 Hevner counters that the court failed to \u201cproperly authenticate\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>the aerial photographs but offers no statute or case law in support of this assertion. Instead, she simply argues that the photos do not label Hevner\u2019s lot, specify what area they depict or indicate from what altitude they were taken. Generally, deciding whether an adequate foundation exists for the admissibility of evidence is within the sound discretion of the district court. <em>See State v. Delaney, </em>1999 MT 317, \u00b6 14, 297 Mont. 263, \u00b6 14, 991 P.2d 461, \u00b6 14. The court makes this decision according to Rule 104(a), M.R.Evid. <em>See Delaney, </em>\u00b6 14. The rule states that \u201c[preliminary questions concerning ... the admissibility of evidence shall be determined by the court. In making its determination it is not bound by the rules of evidence except those with respect to privileges.\u201d Rule 104(a), M.R.Evid. A proponent satisfies the requirement of authentication by presenting evidence sufficient to satisfy a court\u2019s finding that \u201cthe matter in question is what its proponent claims.\u201d Rule 901(a), M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">\u00b622 Here, a certificate from the United States Department of Agriculture accompanied each photo stating that they were taken of Gallatin County, Montana. Center testified that the photos depicted Hevner\u2019s lot and surrounding property. On these bases, Ponderosa filed a motion asking the District Court to take judicial notice that the photos were true and accurate copies of aerial photographs of the relevant area. Hevner never opposed Ponderosa\u2019s motion. For these reasons, we conclude that the court properly took judicial notice of the photos\u2019 accuracy and accepted them as evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">\u00b623  Given the whole of this evidence, we conclude that Ponderosa demonstrated that Homestead Road existed in its present location at the time Hevner bought her lot. Having done so, the burden then shifted to Hevner to come forth with proof that Homestead Road did not exist. <em>See Bruner, </em>272 Mont, at 264, 900 P.2d at 903. She failed to do this.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">\u00b624 Hevner provided little to the District Court in support of her contention that Homestead Road had not existed when she purchased her property other than simple denials and speculation. Her primary argument is that the road did not exist at the time she purchased her lot. Her testimony, however, actually suggests that Homestead Road was open and visible at the time she acquired the property. When asked during cross-examination if any kind of roadway existed where Homestead Roadway was now located, Hevner answered that \u201c[tjhere was a couple of tire tracks.\u201d Hevner did explain later, during re-direct examination, that the tire tracks \u201ccould have been made by me.\u201d Nevertheless, Hevner\u2019s testimony regarding the roadway is, at best, a mere denial of its existence. Mere denials will not prevent an order for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>summary judgment. <em>See Bruner, </em>272 Mont, at 264, 900 P.2d at 903. \u00b625 Hevner also notes that neither the Certificate of Survey attached to her deed nor the Declaration show Homestead Road as laying across her property. She further observes that she was unable to find any other maps or records that depict Homestead Road. These failures to indicate Homestead Road, according to Hevner, prove that the road did not exist when she purchased the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">\u00b626 Ponderosa acknowledges that the Declaration did not show Homestead Road, but notes that the document was designed to establish which lands the existing easements burdened or benefitted. The Declaration was not designed to, and did not, list any individual easements. Instead, it simply noted that Ponderosa had not yet determined the location of the easements.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">\u00b627  Where, as here, an easement is reserved without designating a location, and a road exists at the time of the reservation, then a court will treat the road as the easement that the parties contemplated. <em>See Eureka Land Co. v. Watts </em>(Va. 1916), 89 S.E. 968, 969. \u201c[Pjarties are presumed to contract with reference to the condition of the property at the time of the sale, provided the marks are open and visible.\u201d <em>Godfrey v. Pilon </em>(1974), 165 Mont. 439, 445, 529 P.2d 1372, <em>1375 (citing Pioneer Mining Co. v. Bannack Gold Mining Co. </em>(1921), 60 Mont. 254, 263, 198 P. 748, 751. The key inquiry, therefore, is whether a passageway, even if only a couple of tire tracks, was open and visible. To this end, Hevner provided no proof that Homestead Road was not open and visible.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">\u00b628  Hevner argues that the court should allow her to cross-examine Ponderosa\u2019s affiants, particularly Center. While we agree that summary judgment is improper where the credibility of an affiant may be crucial to a decision of material fact, this is not such an instance. The aerial photos, of which the court took judicial notice, shows Homestead Road on Hevner\u2019s property both before and after she purchased the lot. Such evidence is not susceptible to cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">\u00b629  For these reasons, we conclude that the aerial photos established the absence of a genuine issue of material fact regarding the existence of Homestead Road in its present location prior to the time she purchased her property. Furthermore, her mere denials are insufficient to meet her burden of coming forward with evidence to establish that a genuine issue of material fact exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">\u00b630 Did the District Court err in awarding fees and costs under Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>11 and \u00a7 37-61-421, MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">\u00b631 Rule 11, M.R.Civ.P., requires that an attorney sign every pleading, motion or other paper he or she submits. The signature \u201cconstitutes a certificate by the signer... that to the best of the signer\u2019s knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry it is well grounded in fact.\u201d Rule 11, M.R.Civ.P. If an attorney fails to abide by this rule, the court \u201cshall impose ... an appropriate sanction, which may include an order to pay the other party or parties the amount of the reasonable expenses... including a reasonable attorned s fee.\u201d We give a district court broad discretion to decide whether the factual circumstances of a particular case amount to frivolous or abusive litigation tactics. <em>See Friends of the Wild Swan v. Department of Natural Resources &amp; Conservation, </em>2000 MT 209, \u00b6 58,301 Mont. 1, \u00b6 58, 6 P.3d 972, \u00b6 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\u00b632  The District Court found that Hevner\u2019s contention that Homestead Road did not exist in 1985 was not well grounded in fact. According to the court, the aerial photographs clearly showed that Homestead Road existed in \u201cexactly the same location in 1979 where it exists today.\u201d The court thus found that Hevner\u2019s arguments to the contrary amounted to \u2018\u201cunreasonably and vexatiously\u2019 multiplying the proceedings.\u201d It therefore awarded fees and costs to Ponderosa under Rule 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">\u00b633 We conclude that these findings are not clearly erroneous and that the District Court\u2019s conclusion that these facts constitute a Rule 11 violation is not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">\u00b634 Should this Court award Ponderosa Pines Ranch, Inc., attorney\u2019s fees under Rule 32, M.R.App.P?</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">\u00b635  We may award damages that we deem proper when an appeal is \u201ctaken without substantial or reasonable grounds.\u201d Rule 32, M.RApp.P.; <em>see also Grenz v. Fire &amp; Cas. of Conn., </em>2001 MT 8, \u00b6 18, 304 Mont. 83, \u00b6 18, 18 P.3d 994, \u00b6 18. The District Court concluded that Hevner\u2019s arguments concerning Homestead Road were not well grounded in fact. She now makes the same arguments in the present appeal despite photographs to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">\u00b636 We therefore award Ponderosa reasonable attorney's fees and costs associated with this appeal and remand for a determination of the amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-11\">\u00b637 Affirmed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b109-12\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, TRIEWEILER, NELSON, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
