Russette sought to introduce expert testimony at trial challenging the validity of a blood alcohol analysis performed by an Intoxilizer 5000. The District Court did not allow Russette\u2019s expert to testify and a jury subsequently convicted Russette of the offense. Russette appeals from the District Court\u2019s judgment, in part, on the grounds that it excluded the pertinent testimony in violation of the Montana Rules of Evidence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">\u00b62 On appeal, Russette presents three issues for review. However, for the reasons discussed below, we will address only the question of whether the District Court abused its discretion when it refused to allow Russette\u2019s expert to testify at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">\u00b63 At approximately 1:00 a.m. on September 10, 2000, Highway Patrol Officer Roger Hinckley observed a speeding vehicle, driven by Russette, and initiated a traffic stop. During the course of the stop, Officer Hinckley detected an odor of alcohol emanating from Russette\u2019s person. Russette admitted to consuming three beers within the preceding hour. Thus, Officer Hinckley proceeded to administer standardized field sobriety tests, i.e., the walk-and-tum test, the horizontal gaze nystagmus test, the one-leg-stand test, and the portable breath test. Based on the results of these tests, Officer Hinckley placed Russette under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol, a misdemeanor, in violation of \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA, and transported Russette to the Hill County Detention Center. At the Detention Center, Russette again performed the field sobriety tests and provided one breath sample for analysis by an Intoxilizer 5000. The Intoxilizer 5000 reported that Russette had a blood alcohol concentration of .176.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">\u00b64 Ultimately, Russette pled not guilty in the Justice Court to driving under the influence of alcohol and the case proceeded to a non-jury trial. On March 21,2001, following the non-jury trial, the Justice Court found Russette guilty of \u201cdriving with a BAC of .10 or greater,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>a misdemeanor, in violation of \u00a7 61-8-406, MCA. On March 28, 2001, Russette appealed the Justice Court\u2019s judgment to the Twelfth Judicial District Court and requested a trial by jury on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">\u00b65 On June 25, 2001, Russette notified the District Court that he intended to call Robert Christek as an expert witness. Christek, a chemistry professor at Montana State University Northern, was expected to testify that the Intoxilizer 5000 analysis constituted a \u201cscientific test.\u201d While Christek admitted that he had no specific knowledge regarding the operation of the Intoxilizer 5000, he intended to testify that a scientific test is not valid or reliable until at least two tests have been performed pursuant to the principles of the \u201cscientific method.\u201d The State argued that Christek\u2019s anticipated testimony was inadmissible because he had no specific knowledge regarding the Intoxilizer 5000 and, thus, his testimony would not help the jury to understand the evidence or determine a fact in issue. The District Court agreed with the State and, consequently, prohibited Christek from testifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">\u00b66 On July 25,2001, a jury found Russette guilty of \u201cdriving a motor vehicle on the ways of this state with a blood alcohol content of 0.10 or more,\u201d a misdemeanor, in violation of \u00a7 61-8-406, MCA. The District Court sentenced Russette to ten days in the Hill County Jail, all suspended with conditions, fined Russette $320.00, and suspended Russette\u2019s drivers\u2019 license. On August 3, 2001, Russette filed a notice of appeal from the District Court\u2019s sentence and judgment. Russette contends that the District Court erroneously prohibited Christek from testifying, in violation of Rule 702, M.R.Evid., and his constitutional rights to due process and to call witnesses on his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">\u00b67  The admissibility of evidence is left to the discretion of the district court judge. <em>State v. Lancione, </em>1998 MT 84, \u00b6 20, 288 Mont. 228, \u00b6 20, 956 P.2d 1358, \u00b6 20. This Court reviews a district court\u2019s evidentiary ruling to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>Lancione, </em>\u00b6 20. An abuse of discretion occurs when a district court acts arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason. <em>Ingraham v. State </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 481, 485, 945 P.2d 19, 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">\u00b68 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it refused to allow Russette\u2019s expert to testify at trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">\u00b69 Russette argues that as he \u201cstood trial for driving with a blood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>alcohol level of .10 or greater, the central issue was whether the scientific test which resulted in an alleged blood alcohol level of .176 was valid.\u201d Russette insists that Christek had specialized experience regarding the validity of scientific tests. Russette sought to inform the jury, through Christek\u2019s testimony, that when conducting a scientific test, one must perform at least two analyses to obtain a scientifically valid result. Russette theorized that the result obtained from the Intoxilizer 5000 was not scientifically valid as the State administered only one test. Russette admits that Christek possessed merely a \u201cgeneral understanding\u201d of the Intoxilizer 5000 and \u201cdoesn\u2019t know the interworkings of it.\u201d However, Russette contends that Christek\u2019s lack of familiarity with the Intoxilizer 5000 should have affected the weight and credibility of his testimony and not the admissibility of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">\u00b610 As indicated above, Russette attempted to call Christek as an expert witness at trial and the State objected. Accordingly, the District Court requested an offer of proof as to Christek\u2019s anticipated testimony. After listening to arguments from each party, the District Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-5\">The evidence is submitted under Rule, Chapter 7, probably Rule 703, that this gentleman is an expert witness. He\u2019s not here as a layman, and he is to give an opinion concerning the scientific method. The only relevance to this gentleman\u2019s opinion is [to] create an argument, which is you can create arguments by use of experts that the test was improperly done and that the results of said test are improper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-6\">In order to do that, the witness must have some foundation that this test was done improperly, that he has some familiarity with this machine, that he has some knowledge whereof he speaks, that he has knowledge of the facts that are in issue of this case, and that the test in this instance, in the opinion of the witness, based upon his knowledge, is either questionable or invalid and in his opinion the reliance of the jury on the test should be diminished because this is what we\u2019re talking about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-7\">[Y]ou are trying to establish that the State isn\u2019t doing this right, for reasons that you\u2019ve stated on the record, and in order to do that, you have to have somebody that knows whereof they speak that they are not doing this right, they have to know something about this machine and have to be able to, with the proper foundation, say this isn\u2019t a good test, and your witness can\u2019t do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-8\">... So I exclude the witness based upon the offer of proof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>\u00b611 Rule 702, M.R.Evid., governs the admissibility of expert testimony and provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-4\">If scientific,-technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The test for admissibility of expert testimony is whether the matter is sufficiently beyond common experience that the opinion of the expert will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. <em>Hulse v. State, Dept. of Justice, </em>1998 MT 108, \u00b6 48, 289 Mont. 1, \u00b6 48, 961 P.2d 75, \u00b6 48. Hence, in conducting an admissibility analysis, a district court must determine: (1) whether the subject matter of the testimony is one that requires expert testimony; and (2) whether the particular witness is qualified as an expert to give an opinion in the particular area on which he or she proposes to testify. <em>State v. Southern, </em>1999 MT 94, \u00b6 49, 294 Mont. 225, \u00b6 49, 980 P.2d 3, \u00b6 49. Rule 702, M.R.Evid., implicitly requires a foundation showing that the expert has special training or education and adequate knowledge on which to base an opinion. <em>Southern, </em>\u00b6 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">\u00b612 The District Court\u2019s oral admonition contained no reference to the first prong of the admissibility analysis articulated above. Instead, the District Court\u2019s rationale appears grounded in the qualification portion of the analysis. For purposes of this case, we presume that consideration of the mechanically analyzed breath sample was an appropriate subject matter for expert testimony and, therefore, will focus our attention on the second prong of the admissibility analysis. \u00b613 Russette argues that Christek\u2019s testimony was to \u201cpertain solely to the existence and meaning of the scientific method,\u201d i.e., the proposition that scientific validity requires multiple, corroborating analyses. Christek may well have received specialized training which would qualify him as an expert witness on matters within his area of expertise. Perhaps Christek had sufficient education and training to offer commentary on the intricacies of the scientific method. However, at some point, Christek would have had to apply his theories to the facts at hand to \u201cassist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or ... determine a fact in issue,\u201d as required by Rule 702, M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">\u00b614  The party presenting a witness as an expert must establish, to the satisfaction of the trial court, that the witness possesses the requisite knowledge, skill, experience, training, and education to testify as to the issue in question. <em>O\u2019Leyar v. Callender </em>(1992), 255 Mont. 277, 280-81, 843 P.2d 304, 306. According to Russette, Christek <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>sought to call into question the validity of the Intoxilizer 5000 analysis. Yet, by Russette\u2019s own admission, Christek lacked familiarity with the \u201cinterworkings\u201d of the Intoxilizer 5000. In short, Russette failed to lay any foundation which showed that Christek had adequate knowledge upon which to challenge the \u201cfact in issue,\u201d which was the validity of the Intoxilizer 5000 test result. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it precluded Christek from testifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">\u00b615 On appeal, Russette also maintains that the District Court violated his constitutional rights to due process and to call witnesses when it rejected the proffered testimony. However, Russette raises these issues for the first time on appeal. It is axiomatic that we will not address issues raised for the first time on appeal and, therefore, we decline to further address these assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">\u00b616 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b213-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES REGNIER, RICE and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
