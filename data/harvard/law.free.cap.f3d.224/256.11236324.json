Appellant contends that the District Court erred by sentencing him under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 because the Government did not prove the substance involved in his criminal offenses was crack cocaine. The court order declared: \u201cA certificate of appealability on the crack-enhancement is granted. It -is denied on all other issues.\u201d App. at 113a. The Government now moves for dismissal of this appeal on the grounds that the District Court erroneously issued the certificate of appealability because Cepero did not make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d as required under \u00a7 2253(c)(2) so as to invoke our limited power to review the denial of his \u00a7 2255 petition. We will grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-18\">In April 1997, Angel Cepero was indicted along with two co-defendants for conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute \u201ccocaine and more than 50 grams of cocaine base, a/k/a \u2018crack\u2019 cocaine\u201d in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a) and 846. The indictment listed the overt acts committed in furtherance of the conspiracy as the delivery and sale of \u201ccocaine base,\u201d but did not specifically mention \u201ccrack cocaine.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-19\">An assistant federal public defender was appointed as Cepero\u2019s counsel, and in June and July 1997 filed two pretrial motions, both of which referred to the substance at issue as \u201ccrack cocaine.\u201d Shortly thereafter, Cepero executed a plea agreement in which he agreed to plead guilty to the conspiracy count, which paragraph 1 identified as \u201cconspiracy to distribute more than 5 grams of cocaine base.\u201d In pertinent part, paragraph 1 stated also that the \u201cmaximum penalty for the offense is imprisonment for a period of 40 years [and] a fine of $2,000,000,\u201d which corresponds to the maximum penalties for crack cocaine under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(iii). Paragraph 9 of the plea agreement stipulated that his offense conduct \u201cinvolved no less than 35 but no more than 50 grams of cocaine base.\u201d Cepero and his public de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>fender reviewed and signed the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Three days later a guilty-plea hearing was held, during which the sentencing court, the prosecutor and the public defender all referred to the offense as involving either cocaine or cocaine base. The prosecutor noted the statutory range of penalties as being from five to 40 years and a maximum fine of $250,000, based on the agreement that Cepero\u2019s conduct involved 35 to 50 grams of cocaine base. The prosecutor summarized the Government\u2019s case and consistently referred to the drug transaction as involving cocaine or cocaine base. Cepero agreed that this was an accurate account of his involvement and pled guilty to the conspiracy charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The presentence report identified the substance at issue as \u201ccrack cocaine.\u201d The report concluded that Cepero\u2019s base offense level was 30, derived from U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 for offenses involving at least 35 grams but less than 50 grams of cocaine base. After a two point deduction for acceptance of responsibility, his offense level was 28, and his criminal history category was set at III, which resulted in a guideline range of 97 to 121 months. Neither the Government nor the defendant objected to the report. On November 2, 1997, Cepero was sentenced to 97 months imprisonment and he did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">On September 20, 1998, Cepero filed his pro se habeas petition in the District Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 and alleged <em>inter alia </em>that the Government failed to prove at sentencing that the substance in question was crack cocaine and not merely cocaine powder, which carries a lesser sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court denied his petition by memorandum order but granted him a certificate of appealability under \u00a7 2253(c) with respect to the \u201ccrack-enhancement\u201d issue \u2014 i.e., whether the Government adequately proved at sentencing that he had conspired to distribute crack cocaine. Cepero timely filed his notice of appeal and thereafter the Government moved to dismiss for want of subject-matter jurisdiction. We appointed counsel and referred the matter to a merits panel, to which both parties submitted briefs and argued their positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-13\">After argument, we granted rehearing <em>en banc </em>to decide whether the District Court erroneously granted Cepero a certificate of appealability under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c), as amended by the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996). We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions and apply a clearly erroneous standard to the court\u2019s factual findings. <em>Rios v. Wiley, </em>201 F.3d 257, 262 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-15\">Before the enactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), a petitioner in federal custody who was denied relief by a district court on a \u00a7 2255 petition could appeal to the court of appeals without obtaining a certificate of probable cause. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253 (1995) (pre-AEDPA language); <em>United States v. Eyer, </em>113 F.3d 470, 472 (3d Cir.1997). By contrast, a petitioner in state custody challenging his detention could not appeal the denial of his petition \u201cunless the justice or judge who rendered the order or a circuit justice or judge issuefd] a certificate of probable cause.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253 (1995) (pre-AEDPA language); <em>see Eyer, </em>113 F.3d at 472.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-16\">Section 102 of the Antiterrorist and Effective Death Penalty Act amended the jurisdictional dimension of \u00a7 2253 to provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>(c)(1) Unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability, an appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals from\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-4\">(A) the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding in which the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a State court; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-5\">(B) the final order in a proceeding under section 2255.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">(2) <em>A certificate of appealability may issue under paragraph (1) only if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-7\">(3) The certificate of appealability under paragraph (1) shall indicate which specific issue or issues satisfy the showing required by paragraph (2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(l)-(3) (as amended Apr. 24, 1996) (emphasis added). The AEDPA thus replaced certificates of probable cause with \u201ccertificates of appealability\u201d and required prisoners in federal custody to obtain certificates of appealability before appealing from the denial of their \u00a7 2255 petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">In our prior decisions interpreting the amended version of \u00a7 2253, we have held that, notwithstanding the ambiguous language of the statute which seems to empower only circuit court judges with the authority to grant certificates of appeala-bility, <em>see </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(1), the district court judge who denies the prisoner\u2019s habeas petition is also authorized to certify issues for appeal. <em>See Eyer, </em>113 F.3d at 472-473; <em>accord Lozada v. United States, </em>107 F.3d 1011, 1016 (2d Cir.1997) (\u201cWe therefore uphold the authority of district judges to issue [certificates of appealability], at least in section 2254 cases.\u201d); <em>United States v. Asrar, </em>108 F.3d 217, 218 (9th Cir.1997); <em>Lyons v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth., </em>105 F.3d 1063, 1066-1073 (6th Cir.1997); <em>Hunter v. United States, </em>101 F.3d 1565, 1573-1577 (11th Cir.1996) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">We recognize that several courts of appeals have passed on the question we decide today \u2014 whether we have jurisdiction under \u00a7 2253(c) to review the denial of a \u00a7 2255 petition where the Government challenges the validity of a certificate of appealability issued by a district court. In <em>United States v. Eyer, </em>we assumed jurisdiction to review the denial of a \u00a7 2255 petition notwithstanding the questioned validity of the certificate of appealability, but in that case the Government opposed only the power of the district court to issue certificates of appealability and took the position that, if the district court was authorized to certify issues for appeal under \u00a7 2253(c), then the case should be decided on the merits. We concluded that district court judges were authorized to issue certificates of appealability and thereafter assumed jurisdiction. Nevertheless we recognized the lingering question of whether the petitioner made a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AL4\">[Petitioner] raises questions ... involving issues of statutory construction. Therefore, it is possible that [he] does not raise an issue involving a constitutional right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-12\">Here [ ] we avoid the procedural point because the government .... took the position that if the district court is empowered to issue certificates of appeala-bility under section 2253(c)(1), we should decide this case on the merits. Thus, the determination of the meaning of \u201cconstitutional right\u201d in section 2253(c)(2) is not necessary to the disposition of this appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-13\">In reaching our result, we have not disregarded our practice of examining our jurisdiction before reaching the merits of an appeal, and we recognize the possibility that the procedural problems we have identified [i.e., petitioner\u2019s possible failure to raise issues implicating constitutional rights] could be considered jurisdictional. Instead, we are applying the settled principle that an ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>pellate court, confronted by a difficult jurisdictional or quasi-jurisdictional question, may forego its resolution if the merits of the appeal are, as here, straightforward and easily resolved in favor of the party or parties to whose benefit the objection to jurisdiction would redound.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><em>Eyer, </em>113 F.3d at 474 (internal 'quotation marks and citations omitted). This practice of exercising \u201chypothetical jurisdiction\u201d is neither new nor specific to certificates of appealability. <em>See generally Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment, </em>523 U.S. 83, 93-94, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998) (collecting cases). Nevertheless, in 1998 the Supreme Court largely rejected this custom. <em>See id. </em>at 94, 118 S.Ct. 1003. We recently discussed the Court\u2019s teachings in <em>Steel Co. </em>vis-a-vis our past exercise of hypothetical jurisdiction in <em>Eyer:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-5\">We recognize that the Supreme Court in <em>Steel Co. </em>[ ] disapproved the practice of a court of appeals, such as in <em>Eyer </em>[ ], avoiding difficult jurisdictional questions when a merits determination would favor the party who would benefit if it declined to exercise jurisdiction. But if we were to determine that we will not issue a certificate of appealability because [petitioner] has not demonstrated that he is entitled to one under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(3), then we would find that this court does not have jurisdiction to go forward in this appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-6\"><em>United States v. Williams, </em>158 F.3d 736, 741-742 (3d Cir.1998). We continue to recognize that the Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Steel Co. </em>stands for the proposition that an Article III court may not assume subject-matter jurisdiction to reach the merits of an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Several of our sister courts of appeals have reached the merits of prisoners\u2019 appeals from unsuccessful \u00a7 2255 petitions based on the reasoning that \u00a7 2253(c)(2) is not jurisdictional in nature. In <em>Young v. United States, </em>124 F.3d 794, 799 (7th Cir.1997), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>524 U.S. 928, 118 S.Ct. 2324, 141 L.Ed.2d 698 (1998), the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that an erroneously issued certificate of appeal-ability satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 2253(c)(2) regardless of whether it was properly issued, reasoning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-9\">The certificate is a screening device, helping to conserve judicial (and prose-cutorial) resources ... Once a certificate has issued, however, the case proceeds to briefing and decision; the resources have been invested. It is too late to narrow the issues or screen out weak claims. Perhaps a motion to dismiss an appeal on the ground that a certificate was improperly issued would serve some function. But once the briefs have been written and the case heard, there is little point in scrutinizing the certificate of appealability. An obligation to determine whether a certificate should have been issued, even if the parties do not present this issue for decision \u2014 a step entailed by the conclusion that a proper certificate is a jurisdictional requirement \u2014 would increase the complexity of appeals in collateral attacks and the judicial effort required to resolve them, the opposite of the legislative plan. So we proceed to the merits as the parties have presented them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reached the same conclusion and relied on the <em>Young </em>reasoning. <em>See United States v. Talk, </em>158 F.3d 1064, 1065 (10th Cir.1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 1164, 119 S.Ct. 1079, 143 L.Ed.2d 81 (1999). Similarly, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit adopted this reasoning in <em>Soto v. United States, </em>185 F.3d 48 (2d Cir.1999), emphasizing that \u201cthe certificate is a screening device\u201d and that it had previously intimated the same \u201cgate-keeping\u201d view of the certificate of appealability requirement in <em>Lozada v. United States, </em>107 F.3d 1011, 1015 (2d Cir.1997). It reasoned that \u201cdismissing an appeal after a certificate of appealability has already issued would be of little utility; installing this Court as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>gate keeper for the gate keeper would be redundant.\u201d <em>Soto, </em>185 F.3d at 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The difficulty that we have with the approach of our sister courts of appeals is that they fail to recognize the precise jurisprudential nature of a certificate of ap-pealability as defined in <em>Hohn v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 286, 118 S.Ct. 1969, 141 L.Ed.2d 242 (1998). The centerpiece of the reasoning of those courts is that a certificate is an administrative function, described as \u201ca screening device, helping to conserve judicial (and prosecutorial) resources.\u201d <em>Young, </em>124 F.3d at 799; <em>see Talk, </em>158 F.3d at 1065, 1068; <em>Soto, </em>185 F.3d at 52.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The question for decision in <em>Hohn </em>was \u201cwhether the Court has jurisdiction to review decisions of courts of appeals denying applications for certificate of appealability,\u201d 524 U.S. at 238-239, 118 S.Ct. 1969. To reach this question the Court first had to decide whether the issuance of a certificate of appealability by a court of appe\u00e1ls constituted a judicial function, rather than an administrative function, and was therefore subject to judicial review. The Court rejected the notion advanced by the respondent in the case before it, and explicit in the reasoning in <em>Young, Talk </em>and <em>Soto, </em>that a certificate of appealability is merely a screening device. To the contrary, the Court held that decisions regarding applications for certificates of appealability are not merely an administrative function of the courts. <em>Hohn, </em>524 U.S. at 245, 118 S.Ct. 1969. The teaching of <em>Hohn </em>is clear and unambiguous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-7\"><em>Decisions regarding applications for certificates of appealability, in contrast, are judicial in nature. </em>It is typical for both parties to enter appearances and to submit briefs at appropriate times and for the court of appeals to enter a judgment and to issue a mandate at the end of the proceedings, as happened here.... Construing the issuance of a certificate of appealability as an administrative function, moreover, would suggest an entity not wielding judicial power might review the decisions of an Article III court. In light of the constitutional questions which surround such an arrangement, <em>see Gordon [v. United States, </em>117 U.S. Appx. 697, 702, 704 (1864) ]; <em>Hayburn\u2019s Case, </em>2 Dall. 409, 1 L.Ed. 436 (1792), we should avoid any such implication.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-10\"><em>Hohn, </em>524 U.S. at 245-246, 118 S.Ct. 1969 (emphasis added). The Court then proceeded to analogize <em>Ex parte Quirin, </em>317 U.S. 1, 63 S.Ct. 2, 87 L.Ed. 3 (1942):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-O\">We held the request for leave [to appeal] constituted a case in the district court over which the court of appeals could assert jurisdiction, even though the district court had denied the request. We reasoned, \u201c[presentation of the petition for judicial action is the institution of a suit. Hence the denial of the district court of leave to file the petitions in these causes was the judicial determination of a case or controversy, reviewable on appeal to the Court of Appeals.\u201d 317 U.S., at 24 [63 S.Ct. 2].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-11\"><em>Hohn, </em>524 U.S. at 246, 118 S.Ct. 1969. The Court concluded by stating,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALz\">the circumstance that the question before the court is a preliminary issue, such as the denial of a certificate of appealability or venue, does not oust appellate courts of the jurisdiction to review a ruling on the matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 248, 118 S.Ct. 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-13\">In view of the explicit language of the Court, we must reject the analysis of our sister circuits and decline the notion that this court is bound by the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Court\u2019s issuance of a certificate of appeala-bility. The issuance of the certificate in the case before us is not merely an exercise of judicial gate-keeping, but rather, in the language of the Court, is \u201cthe judicial determination of a case or controversy, reviewable on appeal to the Court of Appeals.\u201d Ho<em>hn, </em>524 U.S. at 246, 118 S.Ct. 1969 (quoting <em>Quirin, </em>317 U.S. at 24, 63 S.Ct. 1). We now proceed into a review of the order granting the certificate of ap-pealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Our first task in our review is to address Section 102 of the Antiterrorist and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, which amended the jurisdictional dimension of \u00a7 2253:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">(c)(1) Unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability, an appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals from\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">(A) the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding in which the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a State court; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-8\">(B) the final order in a proceeding under section 2255.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-9\">(2) A certificate of appealability may issue under paragraph (1) only if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a <em>constitutional </em>right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-10\">(3) The certificate of appealability under paragraph (1) shall indicate which specific issue or issues satisfy the showing required by paragraph (2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1 )-(3) (emphasis added). It had been suggested that the use by Congress of the phrase \u201csubstantial showing of a denial of a <em>constitutional </em>right\u201d was inadvertent, inasmuch as it intended to codify the teachings of <em>Barefoot v. Estelle, </em>463 U.S. 880, 103 S.Ct. 3383, 77 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1983), a \u00a7 2254 ease in which the Court used the expression \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a <em>federal </em>right.\u201d 463 U.S. at 893, 103 S.Ct. 3383 (emphasis added). The denial of a federal right encompasses not only rights assured by the United States Constitution but also those based on federal statutes, including the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-13\">Cepero advances two basic arguments, either of which he claims requires us to reject the plain language of \u201cconstitutional right\u201d and hold that Congress intended the phrase to mean \u201cfederal right\u201d \u2014 first, that the amended version of \u00a7 2253(c) does not mean what it says, because Congress in the AEDPA intended to codify the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Barefoot, </em>which used the expression \u201cfederal right,\u201d but mistakenly amended the statute to apply to only those issues implicating the denial of a \u201cconstitutional right\u201d; second, that in <em>Peguero v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 23, 119 S.Ct. 961, 143 L.Ed.2d 18 (1999), the Court considered the merits of a \u00a7 2255 appeal that did not implicate a constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-14\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-15\">We are satisfied that the Court has recently made clear that the use of the phrase \u201cconstitutional right\u201d must be given effect. \u201cOur task is to interpret the statute as best we can, not to second-guess the wisdom of the congressional policy choice .... Congress chose the language that requires us to decide as we do, and Congress is free to change it.\u201d <em>Mansell v. Mansell, </em>490 U.S. 581, 594, 109 S.Ct. 2023, 104 L.Ed.2d 675 (1989) (citation omitted). In <em>Slack v.

Although the Court used the word \u201cfederal,\u201d an applicant seeking a certificate of probable cause to appeal a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2254 petition for a writ of habeas corpus must demonstrate a substantial showing of constitutional error underlying the state conviction. We have always read the <em>Barefoot </em>standard to require a habeas petitioner to make a substantial showing of the denial of a federal constitutional right. Indeed, in the context of federal habeas review of a conviction entered in state court, it is the only intelligible reading.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-10\"><em>Lennox v.

The first legislative report on this bill, House Bill 665, was introduced by the House Judiciary Committee on February 2, 1995. At that time the bill contained no language amending the review provisions of \u00a7 2253. The second legislative report on the bill was filed four days later, on February 6, and again did not purport to amend \u00a7 2253. On February 8, 1995, the House Judiciary Committee introduced House Report 104-23, which accompanied House Bill 728. The House Report on this bill contained the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-13\">Section 2253 of title 28, United States Code, is amended to read as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-14\">(c).... A certificate of probable cause may only issue if the petitioner has made a substantial showing of the denial of a <em>Federal </em>right....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-15\">Sec. 102, H.R. Report No. 104-23 (1995) (emphasis added). This Report included also a section entitled \u201cBackground and Need for the Legislation,\u201d which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMJ\">The bill also strengthens the certificate of probable cause requirement by providing (in proposed \u00a7 2253(c)) that a certificate may issue only on a substantial showing of the denial of a federal right. The bill thus enacts the standard of <em>Barefoot v. Estelle, </em>463 U.S. 880, 103 S.Ct. 3383, 77 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1983)....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4j_\">H.R. Report No. 104-23 (\u201cBackground and Need for the Legislation\u201d). In March 1995, the Senate and House of Representatives considered various versions of the bill, and on December 5 and 6 the House and Senate Judiciary Committees respectively issued their final reports on the proposed legislation, neither of which contained language amending \u00a7 2253.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-16\">On April 15, 1996, House Conference Report No. 104-518, accompanied by S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>735, was passed. Both the Conference Report and the accompanying bill contained language amending \u00a7 2258(c). The new bill substituted \u201ccertificates of appeal-ability\u201d for certificates of probable cause, and limited issuance of these certificates to situations where petitioners have made a \u201csubstantial showing of a denial of a <em>constitutional </em>right.\u201d (emphasis added). Neither the Conference Report nor the accompanying bill explained why the language of \u00a7 2253(c) referred to \u201cconstitutional\u201d and not \u201cfederal\u201d rights. Congress passed this version of the bill, known as the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), which the President signed into law on April 24, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Notwithstanding AEDPA\u2019s limited legislative history on this point, it is clear that Congress by amending \u00a7 2253 intended to codify in part the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Barefoot v. Estelle, </em>463 U.S. 880, 103 S.Ct. 3383, 77 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1983); <em>see </em>H.R. Report No. 104-23 (\u201cBackground and Need for the Legislation\u201d). In <em>Barefoot, </em>the Court granted certiorari to determine whether the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit erred in refusing to stay a state petitioner\u2019s death sentence under a \u00a7 2254 proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 888, 103 S.Ct. 3383. Reviewing the procedural actions of the court of appeals, the Court outlined the grounds for appealing the denial of a \u00a7 2254 petition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\"><em>First. </em>Congress established the requirement that a prisoner obtain a certificate of probable cause to appeal in order to prevent frivolous appeals from delaying the States\u2019 ability to impose sentences, including death sentences. The primary means of separating meritorious from frivolous appeals should be the decision to grant or withhold a certificate of probable cause.... We agree with the weight of opinion in the Courts of Appeals that a certificate of probable cause requires petitioner to make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of [a] federal right.\u201d <em>Stewart v. Beto, </em>454 F.2d 268, 270, n. 2 (5th Cir.1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>406 U.S. 925, 92 S.Ct. 1796, 32 L.Ed.2d 126 (1972).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-8\"><em>Barefoot, </em>463 U.S. at 893, 103 S.Ct. 3383 (alteration in original) (footnote omitted) <em>(citing Ramsey v. Hand, </em>309 F.2d 947, 948 (10th Cir.1962); and <em>Goode v. Wainwright, </em>670 F.2d 941 (11th Cir.1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">There is no doubt that the current version of \u00a7 2253(c)(2) codified the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Barefoot </em>that a petitioner must make a \u201csubstantial showing.\u201d Congress, however, made a significant change to the <em>Barefoot </em>standard, \u201csubstituting the word \u2018constitutional\u2019 for the word \u2018federal.\u2019\u201d <em>Slack, </em>120 S.Ct. at 1603. The term \u201cconstitutional right\u201d means something very different from the term \u201cfederal right,\u201d and because we must assume that Congress \u201cmeans in a statute what it says,\u201d <em>Connecticut Nat\u2019l Bank v. Germain, </em>503 U.S. 249, 254, 112 S.Ct. 1146, 117 L.Ed.2d 391 (1992), we give effect to the change.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">It must be emphasized that it makes no difference whether \u201cthe final order in a habeas corpus proceeding in which the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a State court\u201d described in \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A) emanates from a proceeding brought under \u00a7 2254 or \u00a7 2241(c)(3) (a prisoner in custody \u201cin violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States\u201d). Under either proceeding, a state prisoner must obtain a certificate of appealability \u2014 that is, \u201cmake a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d under \u00a7 2253(c)(2) \u2014 before appealing from any aspect of the state-ordered detention under \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A). <em>See Montez v. McKinna, </em>208 F.3d 862, 869 (10th Cir.2000) (\u201c[T]his court reads \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A) as applying whenever a state prisoner habeas petition relates to matters flowing from a state court detention order[, including challenges under \u00a7 2254 and \u00a7 2241.]\u201d). Federal prisoner appeals from \u00a7 2241 proceedings, however, are not governed by 2253\u2019s certificate of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>appealability requirement. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B) (applying the certif\u00edcate of appealability requirement to federal prisoner appeals from \u201cthe final order in a proceeding under section 2255\u201d); <em>see also Sugarman v. Pitzer, </em>170 F.3d 1145, 1146 (D.C.Cir.1999) (\u201cWe hold that a COA is not required for federal prisoner \u00a7 2241 appeals.\u201d); <em>Ojo v. INS, </em>106 F.3d 680, 681 (5th Cir.1997).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">This is not to suggest that Congress\u2019 amendment of \u00a7 2253(c)(2) was without problems. We confront the specter that Congress has now differentiated between the type of \u00a7 2255 petition that may be filed in district court and the type that may be appealed to this court. <em>Cf. United States v. Gordon, </em>172 F.3d 753, 754 (10th Cir.1999); <em>Young, </em>124 F.3d at 799. Section 2255 petitioners may allege and have adjudicated non-constitutional issues in district court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-5\">A prisoner in custody under sentence of a court established by Act of Congress claiming the right to be released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the <em>Constitution or laws </em>of the United States, or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack, may move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (emphasis added); <em>see Gordon, </em>172 F.3d at 754. However, the courts of appeals under the post-AEDPA version of \u00a7 2253(c)(2) have limited jurisdiction over unsuccessful \u00a7 2255 petitions. <em>Bohn, </em>524 U.S. at 240, 118 S.Ct. 1969; <em>see Young, </em>124 F.3d at 799 (\u201cIf the district court denies a [\u00a7 2255] petition based on a statutory issue, \u00a7 2253(c)(2) precludes an appeal.\u201d). To the <em>ad terrorem </em>argument that the defendant is thereby totally denied the opportunity to appeal nonconstitu-tional issues, the short answer is that Congress has indicated that these issues must be presented in the direct appeal from the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">We now address the argument that the Court <em>sub silentio </em>has already interpreted \u00a7 2253(c)(l)-(3) and has held that the phrase \u201cdenial of a constitutional right\u201d may be interpreted to embrace non-constitutional issues such as interpretation of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. <em>See Peguero v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 23, 119 S.Ct. 961, 143 L.Ed.2d 18 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">Although there is no discussion or reference made in the <em>Peguero </em>opinion that contemplates the precise issue presented here, Appellant here argues that the issue of jurisdiction under \u00a7 2253(c) was before the <em>Peguero </em>Court because the Government indirectly raised the issue in a footnote in its brief, when it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-12\">The government acquiesced in the granting of a certificate of appealability. [ ] In fact, however, the district court erred in issuing a certificate. A certificate of appealability may be issued \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (Suppl. II 1996), and the Rule 32 error on which the petitioner sought the certificate is not of constitutional dimension.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-13\">Brief for Respondent at *6 n. 5, <em>Peguero, </em>1998 WL 848085.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-14\">There are two answers to this contention. First, the footnote clearly states that the \u201cgovernment acquiesced in the granting of the certificate.\u201d Having acquiesced in the granting of the certificate in the court below, it may not be contended that the Government was raising a serious jurisdictional argument before the Supreme Court. Second, and much more funda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>mental, the Court consistently teaches that an opinion that does not refer to or substantially treat the jurisdictional argument does not have the strong bite of binding precedent. <em>See e.g., Pennhurst State Sch. &amp; Hosp. v. Halderman, </em>465 U.S. 89, 119, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">We are of the view that the teachings of <em>Peguero </em>do not address the precise issues presented in this case. There the Court did not have before it the issue of whether a certif\u00edcate of appealability could issue for other than a claim of constitutional right. Specifically, the first sentence of the Court\u2019s opinion stated the question for decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-5\">We granted certiorari to resolve a Circuit conflict over whether a district court\u2019s failure to advise a defendant of his right to appeal as required by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides a basis for collateral relief even when the defendant was aware of his right to appeal when the trial court omitted to give the advice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-6\"><em>Peguero, </em>526 U.S. at 24, 119 S.Ct. 961. That was the only issue before the court and the teachings of that case must be limited to the' precise issue decided. \u201c[W]hen questions of jurisdiction have been passed on in prior decisions <em>sub si-lentio, </em>this Court has never considered itself bound when a subsequent case finally brings the jurisdictional issue before us.\u201d <em>Pennhurst, </em>465 U.S. at 119, 104 S.Ct. 900 (quoting <em>Hagans v. Lavine, </em>415 U.S. 528, 533 n. 5, 94 S.Ct. 1372, 39 L.Ed.2d 577 (1974)); <em>see United States v. More, </em>7 U.S. (3 Cranch) 159, 172, 2 L.Ed. 397 (1805) (\u201cNo question was made, in that case, as to the jurisdiction. It passed <em>sub silentio, </em>and the court does not consider itself as bound by that case.\u201d) (Marshall, C.J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">In <em>Edelman v. Jordan, </em>415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974), the Court referred to a series of cases in which it reached the merits of challenges to federal welfare regulations brought by welfare recipients. In meeting for the first time whether the Eleventh Amendment precluded federal court jurisdiction to grant retroactive relief, the Court noted that it had previously decided the cases on the merits without meeting the question of jurisdiction. It referred also to <em>Shapiro v. Thompson, </em>394 U.S. 618, 89 S.Ct. 1322, 22 L.Ed.2d 600 (1969), where \u201cthe Eleventh Amendment objection to such retroactive relief was actually presented to this Court in a case which was orally argued.\u201d <em>Edelman, </em>415 U.S. at 670, 94 S.Ct. 1347. Significantly, the Court explained why <em>Shapiro </em>and three other cases decided by the Court on the merits could not be interpreted as <em>sub silentio </em>deciding the issue of jurisdiction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-9\">This Court, while affirming the judgment [in Shapiro], did not in its opinion refer to or substantially treat the Eleventh Amendment argument. Nor, of course, did the summary dispositions of the three District Court cases contain any substantive discussion of this or any other issues raised by the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-10\">This case, therefore, is the first opportunity the Court has taken to fully explore and treat the Eleventh Amendment aspects of such relief in a written opinion.... Having now had the opportunity to more fully consider the Eleventh Amendment holdings of those cases after briefing and argument, we disapprove the Eleventh Amendment holdings of those cases to the extent that they are inconsistent with our holding today.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 670-671, 94 S.Ct. 1347.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-12\">The Court had a similar issue before it in <em>Hagans v. Lavine, </em>and noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-13\">In none of these cases was the jurisdiction issue squarely raised as a contention in the petitions for certiorari, jurisdictional statements, or briefs filed in this Court. Moreover, when questions of jurisdiction have been passed on in prior decisions <em>sub silentio, </em>this Court has never considered itself bound when a subsequent case finally brings the jurisdictional issue before us.... We there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>fore approach the question of the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction to entertain this suit as an open one calling for a canvass of relevant jurisdictional considerations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-AK\"><em>Hagans, </em>415 U.S. at 535 n. 5, 94 S.Ct. 1872 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">Applying the foregoing teachings to the issue at bar, we see that a year after the <em>Peguero </em>decision, in <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>speaking through Justice Kennedy, the same justice who authored the opinion in <em>Peguero, </em>the Court met the precise issue presented here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">Where a district court has rejected the constitutional claims on the merits, the showing required to satisfy \u00a7 2253(c) is straightforward: The petitioner must demonstrate that reasonable jurists would find that the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong .... This construction gives meaning to Congress\u2019 requirement that a prisoner demonstrate substantial underlying constitutional claims ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">\u2014 U.S. at-, 120 S.Ct. at 1604.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">What the Supreme Court did not say in the 1999 <em>Peguero </em>case cannot trump what the court explicitly said in <em>Slack </em>a year later, especially when both opinions were authored by the same justice. Accordingly, we reject the argument that the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Peguero </em>runs counter to the holding we reach today \u2014 that a certificate of appealability in a case brought under \u00a7 2253(c)(2) may issue, in the literal language of the statute, \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">In determining whether the certificate of appealability was proper and thus whether we have jurisdiction to review this petition, we examine whether Cepero had made (1) a substantial showing of a deprivation of (2) a constitutional right, so as to invoke our \u00a7 2253(c) jurisdiction. Petitioner alleges the District Court erred by enhancing his sentence, because the Government failed at sentencing to show beyond a preponderance of the evidence that he conspired to sell crack cocaine, and not some other form of cocaine base. His contention of error thus is misapplication of the Sentencing Guidelines, and he relies on our decision in <em>United States v. James, </em>78 F.3d 851 (3d Cir.1996) to support his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-12\">Section 2D1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides a much greater sentence for drug offenses involving crack cocaine (100 to 1, based on drug amount) than for offenses involving powder cocaine or some other form of cocaine base. In <em>James, </em>we held that the Government was required to prove at sentencing that the defendant distributed crack cocaine, not just cocaine base, before \u00a7 2D1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines could be used to impose the increased sentence. 78 F.3d at 856. However, the facts and procedural posture in <em>James </em>are materially different than those in Cepero\u2019s \u00a7 2255 petition. The petitioner in <em>James </em>pursued review of his sentence on direct appeal. In contrast, Cepero sought post-conviction review of his sentence via a \u00a7 2255 petition. Section 2255 petitions are not substitutes for direct appeals and serve only to protect a defendant from a violation of the constitution or from a statutory defect so fundamental that a complete miscarriage of justice has occurred. <em>Reed v. Farley, </em>512 U.S. 339, 348, 114 S.Ct. 2291, 129 L.Ed.2d 277 (1994); <em>Young, </em>124 F.3d at 796. Under \u00a7 2253(c)(2), we have appellate jurisdiction over only those issues substantially shown to deny a petitioner a constitutional right. We find no such deprivation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-13\">Cepero\u2019s allegation here, that the sentencing court misapplied the Sentencing Guidelines in his case, is a question that does not present a constitutional issue under \u00a7 2253(c).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Buggs v. United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number><em>States, </em>153 F.3d 439, 443 (7th Cir.1998) (\u201c[E]rrors in the implementation of the Sentencing Guidelines are generally not cognizable in a collateral attack.\u201d). Because of the specific misapplication of the Sentencing Guidelines that Appellant alleges in this case,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we conclude that he has not \u201cmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d and thus the District Court erred under \u00a7 2253(c)(2) by issuing a certificate of appealability. Accordingly, we do not have jurisdiction to review the merits of Appellant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">* * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">We will grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b291-13\">.

We reach this conclusion without reference either to the statutory language or to Congress\u2019s intent, the two factors which have traditionally been the hallmarks of our jurisprudence when interpreting whether prerequisites for suit or appeal are subject matter jurisdictional in nature. <em>See, e.g., Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., </em>455 U.S. 385, 393, 102 S.Ct. 1127, 71 L.Ed.2d 234 (1982) (concluding that \u201c[t]he structure of Title VII, the congressional policy underlying it, and the reasoning of our cases all lead to\u201d the conclusion that \u201cfiling a timely charge of discrimination with the EEOC is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit in federal court\u201d); <em>Shendock v. Director, </em>893 F.2d 1458, 1462 (3d Cir.1990) (en banc) (finding the 60 day filing requirement contained in 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c) for appeals of the decisions of the Benefits Review Board to be jurisdictional, in part because the statute uses that term) (\u201cWe also recognize that <em>a priori </em>attachment of the label \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 to a statute\u2019s filing requirements without examination of its language and structure, as well as the congressional policy underlying it, would be an abdication of our duty to interpret the language of a statute in accordance with Congress\u2019s intent in passing it.\u201d). In so doing, we also reject the considered treatment of this issue by our fellow courts of appeals, which have found an improvidently granted certificate sufficient to permit appellate review, because we find their reasoning contrary to language contained in <em>Hohn v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 236, 118 S.Ct. 1969, 141 L.Ed.2d 242 (1998). <em>See Soto v. United States, </em>185 F.3d 48, 52 (2d Cir.1999) (finding that even the improvident issuance of a certificate of appealability confers appellate jurisdiction); <em>United States v. Talk, </em>158 F.3d 1064, 1068 (10th Cir.1998) (finding that \u201can erroneously-issued certificate does not deprive [the court] of jurisdiction to hear a certified appeal\u201d); <em>Young v. United States, </em>124 F.3d 794, 799 (7th Cir.1997). However, as I discuss below, the Supreme Court in <em>Hohn </em>addressed an issue quite different from the one before us. Therefore, I dissent from this portion of the majority\u2019s opinion. Given the majority\u2019s view on this issue, however, I concur in the next step it takes, namely its determination that the test for the issuance of a certificate of appealability requires that the petitioner make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional, rather than a federal, right.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-12\">I submit that neither the statutory language of \u00a7 2253(c) nor the habeas statute in its entirety can support the conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>the majority reaches on the threshold issue. Section 2253(c)(1) simply states that: <em>\u201cUnless </em>a circuit justice or judge <em>issues </em>a certificate of appealability, an appeal <em>may not be taken </em>to the court of appeals from\u2014 ... (B) the final order in a proceeding under section 2255.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) <em>&amp; </em>(c)(1)(B) (emphasis added). Section 2253(c)(2) explains: \u201cA certificate of appealability <em>may </em>issue under paragraph (1) <em>only if </em>the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2) (emphasis added). Therefore, in line with the plain language, Cepero is entitled to a review of his case because a certificate of appealability was issued. Nothing in the statutory language suggests, let alone requires, otherwise. Certainly, no portion of the language suggests that satisfaction of the underlying certificate of appealability standard is the trigger to our jurisdiction. Rather, by stating that an appeal may not be taken unless a certificate of appealability is issued, the statute explains that it is simply the issuance of the certificate which provides the ticket to appellate review. Congress\u2019s limitation of the grounds for issuance should not render the certificate a nullity if improperly issued, absent a statement to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">This reading is buttressed by the fact that \u00a7 2253(c)(2) also requires that there be a \u201csubstantial showing\u201d of a denial of a constitutional right. If satisfaction of the one term is required for jurisdiction, surely satisfaction of the other, nestled right next to the first, is required as well. If the majority\u2019s reading is correct, it would appear that a court of appeals has a duty, under <em>Steel Company v. Citizens for a Better Environment, </em>523 U.S. 83, 94, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998), to determine the \u201csubstantiality\u201d of the showing of the deprivation in order to determine whether or not it has <em>jurisdiction. </em>\u201cSub-stantiality\u201d is not a quality that yields itself easily to analysis, to say the least, and it would be an odd statute which turned the existence of judicial power to hear an appeal on whether or not such an elusive quality were deemed existent. The easier reading, I submit, is that an issuing court should attempt to meet this standard, but if it missteps, it does not deprive the appeals court of power to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Furthermore, if \u00a7 2253(c)(2) is jurisdictional, why not (c)(3)? Subsection (c)(3), like (c)(2), lays out mandatory requirements for the issuing court to follow. The certificate of appealability must \u201cindicate which specific issue or issues satisfy the showing required by paragraph (2).\u201d But what if the certificate of appealability is wanting in this regard? In such a situation, remand for clarification might be appropriate, but it would be odd indeed if a court of appeals were required to dismiss an appeal under \u00a7 2253 <em>for want of jurisdiction </em>because the certificate of appeala-bility did not \u201cindicate which specific issues satisfy the showing.\u201d Yet this is the logical extension of the majority\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">It should be noted that two other provisions\u2019 of \u00a7 2253 describe and proscribe our jurisdiction, demonstrating that Congress knew how to limit appellate jurisdiction if it wanted to do so. Following the general grant of jurisdiction over habeas appeals in \u00a7 2253(a) (providing that \u201cthe final order shall be subject to review\u201d), \u00a7 2253(b) then <em>limits </em>that jurisdiction in a particular case, and does so in clear language: \u201cThere shall be <em>no right of appeal </em>from a final order in a proceeding to test the validity of a warrant to remove to another district or place for commitment or trial a person charged with a criminal offense against the United States, or to test the validity of such person\u2019s detention pending removal proceedings.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(b) (emphasis added); <em>see also Roba v. United States, </em>604 F.2d 215, 218 (2d Cir.1979) (interpreting this language also contained in the previous version of \u00a7 2253 .to be a limitation of appellate jurisdiction). I believe that there is a clear difference between the language that there is \u201cno right of appeal,\u201d and a provision that the issu-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>anee of a certificate of appealability is a condition to the taking of an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">The lack of support for the conclusion that only the proper issuance of a certificate of appealability confers subject matter jurisdiction is particularly significant because, as the majority reasons and explains, Congress developed the certificate of appealability requirements from the preexisting certificate of probable cause mechanism. In a series of Supreme Court opinions addressing the contours of appellate review of the denial of habeas relief in \u00a7 2254 proceedings, the Supreme Court repeatedly explained that once a district court has granted a certificate of probable cause, the court of appeals must address the merits of the petitioner\u2019s appeal. <em>See Nowakowski v. Maroney, </em>386 U.S. 542, 543, 87 S.Ct. 1197, 18 L.Ed.2d 282 (1967) (\u201cBut when a district judge grants such a certificate, the court of appeals must grant an appeal in <em>forma pauperis </em>(assuming the requisite showing of poverty), and proceed to a disposition of the appeal in accord with its ordinary procedure.\u201d); <em>see also Garrison v. Patterson, </em>391 U.S. 464, 466, 88 S.Ct. 1687, 20 L.Ed.2d 744 (1968) (following Now<em>akowski); Carafas v. LaVallee, </em>391 U.S. 234, 242, 88 S.Ct. 1556, 20 L.Ed.2d 554 (1968) (following <em>Nowakowski).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The Supreme Court most recently explained the impact of the issuance of a certificate of probable cause in <em>Barefoot v. Estelle, </em>463 U.S. 880, 893, 103 S.Ct. 3383, 77 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1983), which, of course, forms the basis for much of the debate over the meaning of the standard for the issuance of a certificate of appealability contained in the majority\u2019s opinion. In <em>Barefoot, </em>however, the Court also explained that: \u201cWhen a certificate of probable cause is issued by the district court, as it was in this case, or later by the court of appeals, <em>petitioner must then be afforded an opportunity to address the merits, and the court of appeals is obligated to decide the merits of the appeal.\u201d Id. </em>at 893, 103 S.Ct. 3383 (emphasis added). Previously, in Carafas, the Court explained that review on the merits was necessary because \u201c[ajnything less than this, as we held in <em>Noioakowski, </em>would negate the office of the certificate of probable cause.\u201d <em>Carafas, </em>391 U.S. at 242, 88 S.Ct. 1556. The Supreme Court noted that this did not, however, prevent an appellate court from affirming the district court\u2019s decision on the merits in a summary, abbreviated fashion upon a finding that the claim was frivolous or otherwise foreclosed. <em>See Barefoot, </em>463 U.S. at 894, 103 S.Ct. 3383.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">In imposing the certificate of appealability requirement on habeas petitions in both state and federal cases, Congress specifically addressed two parts of the old certificate of probable cause mechanism. As we decide in this case, Congress strengthened the standard for the issuance of a certificate announced in <em>Barefoot. </em>Congress also addressed the question of whether a court may issue a certificate limited to particular issues, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(3), a question that was unclear during the certificate of probable cause era, <em>see Sherman v. Scott, </em>62 F.3d 136, 138-39 (5th Cir.1995) (describing a circuit split over whether a \u201climited\u201d certificate of probable cause binds the reviewing court to consideration of those issues alone). Given that Congress clearly addressed those issues, and given the clear discussion of the impact of a certificate of probable cause in <em>Barefoot, </em>I submit that if Congress had intended to make the propriety of the issuance of a certificate of appealability jurisdictional in the manner conceived of by the majority, or had desired more generally that we review the decision to issue a certificate,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Congress would have phrased the statute in manner that makes clear this additional change from prior practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">Although the majority relies upon <em>Hohn </em>to reach its conclusion, I see nothing in <em>Hohn, </em>or for that matter, <em>Peguero v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 23, 119 S.Ct. 961, 143 L.Ed.2d 18 (1999), or <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000), that undermines my conclusion. In <em>Hohn, </em>the Supreme Court simply concluded that the application for, and denial of, a certificate of appealability constituted a \u201ccase in the court of appeals\u201d such that the Supreme Court had <em>statutory </em>jurisdiction to review the denial under \u00a7 1254(1). <em>See Hohn, </em>524 U.S. at 241, 251, 118 S.Ct. 1969 (overruling <em>House v. Mayo, </em>324 U.S. 42, 44, 65 S.Ct. 517, 89 L.Ed. 739 (1945) (per curiam), which found that the application for, and subsequent denial of, a certificate of probable cause was not a \u201ccase in the court of appeals\u201d). The Court\u2019s holding that the denial of a certificate of ap-pealability may be reviewed because a \u201ccase\u201d exists in the court of appeals for purposes of \u00a7 1254(1) tells us nothing about the role of a certificate of appealability; the Supreme Court has statutory jurisdiction to review all types of cases of which questions of jurisdiction make up but a small part. Furthermore, I fail to grasp the significance the majority attributes to the Supreme Court\u2019s determination in <em>Hohn </em>that decisions regarding the grant or denial of a certificate of appealability in the court of appeals are not administrative in nature. <em>See ante </em>at 260-62; <em>see also Hohn, </em>524 U.S. at 245-46, 118 S.Ct. 1969. The majority\u2019s analysis both presupposes that anything which is not \u201cadministrative\u201d is jurisdictional, a conclusion that I think is clearly wrong, and posits that <em>Hohn </em>disproves the reasoning of those courts of appeals that have concluded that an appellate court need not examine the grounds for the issuance of a certificate of appeala-bility. <em>See Soto, </em>185 F.3d at 52; <em>Talk, </em>158 F.3d at 1068; <em>Young, </em>124 F.3d at 799; <em>see also Gatlin v. Madding, </em>189 F.3d 882, 886-87 (9th Cir.1999). I disagree. I see the reasoning of those courts, dictated by then-views of the role of a certificate of appeala-bility, to be sound. In <em>Young, </em>Judge East-erbrook focused upon the purpose of the certificate of appealability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-10\">The absence of a certificate of appeala-bility precludes an appeal; should an erroneously issued certificate be treated the same, as the lack of a certificate? We think not. <em>The certificate is a screening device, helping to conserve judicial (and prosecutorial) resources. The obligation to identify a specific issue concentrates the parties\u2019 attention (and screens out weak issues); the limitation to constitutional claims also reduces the number of appeals ivhile simultaneously removing a category of claim that under Davis [v. United States, </em>417 U.S. 333, 94 S.Ct. 2298, 41 L.Ed.2d 109 (1974) ], <em>and Reed [v. Farley, </em>512 U.S. 339, 114 S.Ct. 2291, 129 L.Ed.2d 277 (1994) ] <em>has poor prospects. </em>Once a certificate has issued, however, the case proceeds to briefing and decision; .the resources have been invested. It is too late to narrow the issues or screen out weak claims. Perhaps a mo- ' tion to dismiss an appeal on the ground that a certificate was improperly issued would serve some function. But once the briefs have been written and the case heard, there is little point in seruti-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>nizing the certificate of appealability. <em>An obligation to determine whether a certificate should have been issued, even if the parties do not present this issue for decision </em>\u2014 a <em>step entailed by the conclusion that a proper certificate is a jurisdictional requirement-would increase the complexity of appeals in collateral attacks and the judicial effort required to resolve them, the opposite of the legislative plan.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-4\"><em>Young, </em>124 F.3d at 799 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The strongest support for the majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Hohn </em>comes from the Supreme Court\u2019s various characterizations of the role of the certificate of appealability as \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d However, I am unwilling to place significance on random statements that have no bearing on the actual issue raised in the case, let alone its holding. I also note that in <em>Slack, </em>decided after <em>Hohn, </em>the Supreme Court characterized the certificate of appealability in a way that would suggest it is not jurisdictional in the manner the majority concludes. <em>See Slack, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 120 S.Ct. at 1603 (\u201cThe [certificate of appealability] statute establishes procedural rules and requires a threshold inquiry into whether the circuit court may entertain an appeal.\u201d). Further, in <em>Peguero, </em>the Supreme Court addressed a federal question on the merits without reviewing either the propriety of the initial grant of a certificate or the Court\u2019s own appellate jurisdiction to hear the case. While I agree with the majority that <em>Peguero </em>does not compel a conclusion as to the meaning of \u00a7 2253(c)(2), <em>see ante </em>at 265-66, I, nonetheless, think that drawing some meaning from the Court\u2019s silence in <em>Peguero </em>is no worse than finding meaning regarding the issue before us in the Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Hohn.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">Numerous efforts have been made over the years to streamline the process by which the federal courts are to sift out those habeas petitions which are unworthy of the expenditure of additional judicial resources, and Congress considered numerous options before passing AEDPA. <em>See Hunter v. United States, </em>101 F.3d 1565, 1578-83 (11th Cir.1996) (tracing and discussing the numerous proposed reform bills eventually leading to the enactment of AEDPA); Judge Henry J. Friendly, <em>Is Innocence Irrelevant ?: Collateral Attack on Criminal Judgments, </em>38 U.Chi.L.Rev. 142 (1970) (suggesting that district courts should not be permitted to grant certificates of probable cause and suggesting that the certificate of probable cause requirement be extended to petitions from federal custody). Given the concerns expressed by Congress regarding the efficiency of the process, I cannot help but agree with the other circuit courts of appeals that have counseled against an interpretation of the statute that would require us to engage in a threshold examination of the decision of the district court to issue a certificate of appealability. <em>See, e.g., Young, </em>124 F.3d at 799. While it could be argued that a threshold review of the issuance of the certificate of appealability in cases like this, where the error claimed is not constitutional, may promote efficiency, I note that after our decision in this case clarifies the meaning of \u00a7 2253(c)(2), district courts most likely will not grant certificates of appealability when a constitutional right is not implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">While a desire for efficiency should not dictate that we shirk our duty to examine our jurisdiction, if such a duty is clearly imposed by the statute, knowledge that concerns about efficiency were at the heart of Congress\u2019s decision to modify the certificate requirements should inform our interpretation of what the statute does in fact require. I would hold the modification of the <em>Barefoot </em>standard was meant to restrict the issuance of a certificate of appealability, but that once issued, such issuance should lead to merits review.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">Chief Judge BECKER and Judge SLO-VITER join in this concurring and dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b304-6\">. The majority does not address whether the order issuing a certificate of appealability might be reviewable even if we did not decide that its proper issuance is jurisdictional. However, I can locate no rule or statute that would constitute a grant of appellate jurisdiction to review the order issuing a certificate of appealability (assuming that it cannot be deemed a final order of the district court). Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 22, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>which describes how a petitioner may apply to this court for a certificate of appealability, makes no reference to the government\u2019s contesting a certificate once granted. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App.P. 22(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit recently indicated that it had \u201cdiscretion to decide the case by reviewing the validity of the CA or by going straight to the issues raised on appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Marcello, </em>212 F.3d 1005, 1007-08 (7th Cir.2000). <em>But see Lucidore v. New York State Division of Parole, </em>209 F.3d 107, 112 (2d Cir.2000) (finding the state's objection to the certificate of appealability foreclosed by <em>Soto, </em>185 F.3d at 52). However, the Court in <em>Marcello </em>cites no authority for such review power.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
