BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We take the historical facts from the allegations in petitioner's pleadings and attachments, including petitioner's response to the state's motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Verduzco v. State of Oregon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364201\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/553/\">\n    357 Or. 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 555 n. 1,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364201\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/553/\">\n    355 P.3d 902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) (taking undisputed facts from petitioner's pleadings and attachments). Petitioner is a refugee from Somalia who arrived in the United States in 2003, when he was in his early teens. In April 2010, at the age of 20, petitioner was charged with various crimes after he was discovered in a car having sex with a 16-year-old girl. Petitioner pleaded guilty to one count of sex abuse in the third degree, a class A misdemeanor, and the remaining charges were dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the sentencing hearing that followed, petitioner stated that he was pleading guilty in part because he \"really wan[ted to] travel\" and to obtain his United States citizenship. The court sentenced petitioner to two years of probation and seven days in custody with credit for time served. The court ordered petitioner to register as a sex offender, but told him that if he successfully completed probation, it would \"remove that requirement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Petitioner's trial counsel was required under\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   to provide petitioner with information regarding the potential immigration consequences of his plea.\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   was decided by the United States Supreme Court a couple of months before petitioner's sentencing. And, under ORS 135.385(2)(d), trial courts are required to inform noncitizen defendants who plead guilty that \"conviction of a crime may result *** in deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States or denial of naturalization.\" Despite petitioner's statement at sentencing that he was pleading guilty so that he could travel and become a United States citizen, neither trial counsel nor the court gave petitioner any indication that his plea subjected him to immigration\n   consequences. Petitioner's judgment of conviction was entered on June 3, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Just over two years later, on June 4, 2012, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents detained petitioner. In March 2013, petitioner filed for post-conviction relief, alleging that his trial counsel had been ineffective for failing to advise him of the immigration consequences of his plea. In an affidavit attached to his petition for post-conviction relief, he stated that his trial counsel had never discussed with him the immigration consequences of his guilty plea. At the time of his plea, petitioner was \"unaware that [he] could be deported as a result of [his] sex abuse conviction.\" He remained \"unaware that [he] could be deported until [he] was taken into ICE custody on June 4, 2012.\" He added, \"I certainly would have filed within the two-year statute of limitations had I\n   been informed that I could be deported as a result of my sex abuse conviction.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The state moved to dismiss, arguing that the petition was barred by the two-year statute of limitations. Petitioner responded that he did not know that counsel had been ineffective until he was placed in deportation proceedings and learned, at that time, that he had pleaded to an offense that made him deportable. He further argued that, based on the actions of his counsel and the trial court, he had no reason to suspect either that he would suffer immigration consequences or that his counsel had failed to provide him with legally-required advice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At a hearing on the state's motion to dismiss, the post-conviction court made clear its view that, if petitioner's allegations were true, then he would have a strong claim for ineffective assistance of counsel under\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   . The court nevertheless granted the state's motion, concluding that the information underlying petitioner's claim \"would have been available\" to petitioner because\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   \"already had been decided.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Petitioner appealed. In considering petitioner's argument that he could not reasonably have known about his trial counsel's failings before being taken into ICE custody, the Court of Appeals relied on this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Bartz\n   </em>\n   and the Court of Appeals' application of\n   <em>\n    Bartz\n   </em>\n   in\n   <em>\n    Benitez-Chacon\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Bartz\n   </em>\n   , the petitioner filed an untimely petition alleging that his trial counsel had been ineffective for \"fail[ing] to advise him of an available statutory defense.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2192858\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/314/353/\">\n    314 Or. at 357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2192858\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/314/353/\">\n    839 P.2d 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The petitioner further alleged that, based on his trial counsel's failure, he could not reasonably have known of that defense within the limitations period. This court rejected that argument. The court held that, because \"it is a basic assumption of the legal system that the ordinary means by which the legislature publishes and makes available its enactments are sufficient to inform persons of statutes that are relevant to them,\" the statutes pertaining to the petitioner's crime of conviction \"were reasonably available to [the petitioner] when his conviction became final.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 359-60,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2192858\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/314/353/\">\n    839 P.2d 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Dungey v.

She alleged as well that, because her counsel had not fully informed her, she could not reasonably have known of the immigration consequences within the limitations period. The Court of Appeals relied on\n   <em>\n    Bartz\n   </em>\n   and rejected that argument. According to the Court of Appeals, \"If the petitioner in\n   <em>\n    Bartz\n   </em>\n   was presumed to know the law based on the public nature of legislative enactments, so must petitioner in this case be presumed to have had knowledge of the relevant immigration statutes and rules.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"398281\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/178/352/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"398281\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/178/352/\">\n    at 357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"398281\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/178/352/\">\n    37 P.3d 1035\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In this case, petitioner is in essentially the same position as the petitioner in\n   <em>\n    Benitez-Chacon\n   </em>\n   , and he argued to the Court of Appeals that it should overrule its decision in that case.

Petitioner\n   then sought review in this court, which we allowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Under Oregon's Post-Conviction Hearing Act (PCHA), a petitioner who has been convicted of a crime may obtain collateral relief by establishing \"[a] substantial denial in proceedings resulting in petitioner's conviction *** under the Constitution of the United States, or under the Constitution of the State of Oregon, or both, and which denial rendered the conviction void.\" ORS 138.530(1) (a). Post-conviction relief provides the primary mechanism by which a person who has been convicted of a crime may allege constitutional errors that were not, and could not have been, raised during the underlying criminal proceeding or on direct appeal. Those errors frequently involve allegations that counsel was unconstitutionally ineffective and inadequate in his or her handling of the criminal case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The PCHA generally requires that a post-conviction petitioner file a petition within two years of the date that the conviction becomes final. ORS 138.510(3). That statute of limitations, however, is subject to an escape clause. Under the escape clause, a petitioner may file an untimely petition by asserting \"grounds for relief *** which could not reasonably have been raised\" within the two-year limitations period.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12413341\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/285/39/#p42\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The parties dispute the meaning of that text and how that text was applied in\n   <em>\n    Bartz\n   </em>\n   . Petitioner reads\n   <em>\n    Bartz\n   </em>\n   as establishing a factual presumption that people know the law. According to petitioner, even if such a presumption applies, it is a presumption that may be overcome by a petitioner who establishes facts demonstrating that, within the limitations period, he or she could not reasonably have known\n   the law that provided the basis for the claim. And petitioner maintains that whether a petitioner reasonably should have known the law that provides the basis for a claim turns on a fact-intensive consideration of the totality of circumstances, such as whether the petitioner had access to legal sources or whether the legal basis for the claim was complicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The state argues that petitioner's position is precluded by\n   <em>\n    Bartz\n   </em>\n   . According to the state, the standard is whether the bases for the claim-both the facts and the law-were reasonably available to the petitioner. And the state reads\n   <em>\n    Bartz\n   </em>\n   as holding that settled law is always reasonably available to a petitioner. Thus, under the state's reading, when the law that provides the basis for claim is settled, it is never a fact question whether that legal basis was reasonably available to a petitioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Neither party gets it exactly right. As we explain below, the state is correct that the appropriate standard focuses on whether the grounds for relief were known or reasonably available to a petitioner. However, we do not read\n   <em>\n    Bartz\n   </em>\n   as narrowing the escape clause as much as the state maintains. We instead conclude that, when a petitioner's claim is premised on a trial counsel's failure to advise on the immigration consequences of a conviction, fact questions may still be relevant to determining whether the petitioner should have known about those immigration consequences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As an initial matter, we have made clear that a ground for relief reasonably could have been raised under one of two circumstances: (1) when the ground for relief was known or (2) when the ground for relief was reasonably available, despite not being known.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Verduzco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364201\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/553/\">\n    357 Or. at 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364201\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/553/\">\n    355 P.3d 902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (providing textual analysis of the phrase \"could not reasonably have raised\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364201\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/553/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364201\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/553/\">\n    at 573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364201\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/553/\">\n    355 P.3d 902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that a ground for relief was reasonably available to the petitioner because he had previously asserted that same ground for relief).

The court reached that conclusion because, if the petitioner had looked, the law could have been found in publicly available sources. As noted above, the court held that, because \"it is a basic assumption of the legal system that the ordinary means by which the legislature publishes and makes available its enactments are sufficient to inform persons of statutes that are relevant to them,\" the statutes pertaining to the petitioner's crime of conviction \"were\n   <em>\n    reasonably available\n   </em>\n   to [the petitioner] when his conviction became final.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2192858\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/314/353/\">\n    314 Or. at 359-60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2192858\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/314/353/\">\n    839 P.2d 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

For the petitioner in\n   <em>\n    Bartz\n   </em>\n   , the conviction itself put him on notice of the need to investigate the existence of a ground for relief.

We observed in\n   <em>\n    Verduzco\n   </em>\n   that the legislature's use of the adverb \"reasonably\" to modify the phrase \"could not have raised\" requires an inquiry beyond what is merely possible, calling instead \"for a judgment about what is 'reasonable' under the circumstances.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364201\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/553/\">\n    357 Or. at 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364201\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/553/\">\n    355 P.3d 902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   When it was enacted in 1989, ORS 138.510(3) originally required a post-conviction petitioner to file within 120 days of the conviction becoming final.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The legislature's primary purpose for the statute of limitations was to reduce the costs of indigent defense by limiting frivolous post-conviction claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bartz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2192858\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/314/353/\">\n    314 Or. at 358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2192858\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/314/353/\">\n    839 P.2d 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989 amendments to PCHA were intended to reduce\n   indigent defense costs); Tape Recording, House Judiciary Crime and Corrections Subcommittee, HB 2796, Mar. 9, 1989, Tape 44, Side A (statement of Representative Baum). The escape clause creates an exception to the bar imposed by that statute of limitations. According to the court in\n   <em>\n    Bartz\n   </em>\n   , the purpose of the escape clause was \"to give persons extra time to file petitions for post-conviction relief in extraordinary circumstances.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2192858\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/314/353/\">\n    314 Or. at 358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2192858\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/314/353/\">\n    839 P.2d 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And, as a result, the court\n   said that the escape clause should be \"construed narrowly.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2192858\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/314/353/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2192858\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/314/353/\">\n    at 359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2192858\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/314/353/\">\n    839 P.2d 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court did not, however, attempt to identify the boundaries of what counts as extraordinary or to define just how narrowly to construe the escape clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We understand the court in\n   <em>\n    Bartz\n   </em>\n   to have been appropriately concerned with reading the escape clause in a manner that would not allow the exception to swallow the rule. The facts presented by the petitioner in\n   <em>\n    Bartz\n   </em>\n   were unexceptional. It is not unusual for a petitioner to be unaware of the law pertaining to the crime of conviction. If that fact, without further qualification, were sufficient to bring a claim within the escape clause, then it is likely that most claims-and certainly most claims for ineffective assistance of counsel-would fall within the escape clause. That result would defeat the goal that the legislature was attempting to advance by passing the statute of limitations in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   This case does not present those same concerns. Whereas the petitioner in\n   <em>\n    Bartz\n   </em>\n   was aware of his conviction and could have either researched whether his trial counsel was ineffective, or sought help from an attorney to make that determination, petitioner in this case did not know about the immigration consequences that form the basis for his claim until he was later detained by ICE. Further, petitioners who were unaware of the immigration consequences of their convictions are a narrow class of petitioners. Allowing petitioner's claim in this case to fall within the escape clause does not run the risk of having the escape clause swallow the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The court in\n   <em>\n    Bartz\n   </em>\n   additionally reviewed specific types of claims discussed during the legislative hearings that led to the statute of limitations and escape clause of ORS 138.510(3). The court understood those discussions as identifying representative examples of claims that might fall within the escape clause. The state points out that claims based on a trial counsel's failure to advise on the immigration consequences of conviction is not among those claims identified during those hearings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \"Discussion of the scope of the 'escape clause' took place in two subcommittees of the House Committee on the\n   Judiciary.

A representative of the Oregon Criminal Defense Lawyers Association testified to the Subcommittee on Civil and Judicial Administration that he would support the 120-day time limitation if an exception were made where 'extraordinary circumstances' were shown. As examples, he mentioned convictions procured by collusion between a prosecutor and a defense lawyer, but coming to light after the limitation period, and situations in which the statute under which the conviction was obtained is later declared facially unconstitutional.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2192858\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/314/353/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2192858\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/314/353/\">\n    at 359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2192858\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/314/353/\">\n    839 P.2d 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal footnotes and citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We do not interpret that legislative history as defining the scope of the escape clause. As an initial matter, the Justice Department representative that the court referred to was not discussing how the text of the escape clause would be applied. Instead, she was discussing the original version of the proposed statute of limitations, which contained no escape clause at all. She acknowledged that, under that original version, a petitioner who discovered evidence of a claim after the limitations period would be unable to bring a state claim for post-conviction relief. She proposed addressing that issue, not by adding an escape clause, but by extending the statute of limitations from the 120 days being proposed\n   to 180 days or one year. Minutes, Subcommittee on Crime and Corrections, Mar. 9, 1989, Ex D (statement of Assistant Attorney General Brenda Peterson). As a result, testimony by that witness says little about the scope of the escape clause that the legislature later enacted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   And, similarly, the testimony from the representative of the Oregon Criminal Defense Lawyers Association makes no attempt to define the scope of the escape clause that the legislature enacted. That witness was discussing a proposed escape clause that would have required a petitioner to establish \"manifest injustice.\" Tape Recording, Senate Judiciary Committee, SB 284, Apr. 12, 1989, Tape 123, Side A (statement of Ross Shepard). That is, however, not the standard that the legislature ultimately passed. Instead of\n   requiring a petitioner to establish \"manifest injustice,\" the escape clause passed by the legislature applies if the petitioner establishes that his or her claim \"could not reasonably have been raised\" within the limitation period. Because the legislature did not adopt the standard discussed by that witness, we do not understand that witness as discussing representative cases that would fall under separate standard that the legislature did adopt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Additional analysis of the legislative history tells us little about the intended scope of the escape clause. During the 1989 legislative session, the legislature heard testimony that most petitions, and in particular \"most stronger cases,\" would be filed within the statute of limitations, and that the effect of the statute of limitations would be to \"take[ ] away the opportunity for defendants with a little time on their hands to file in periods of time that are quite extended from when they were convicted.\" Tape Recording, Senate Judiciary Committee, SB 284, June 12, 1989, Tape 121, Side B (statement of Bill Linden).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   By adding the escape clause to the statute of limitations, the legislature expressed an intent that some untimely claims for post-conviction relief would be permitted, notwithstanding the statute of limitations. The escape clause in ORS 138.510(3) is closely related to a parallel provision in ORS 138.550(3), which prohibits a petitioner who already has filed a post-conviction petition from later filing a successive petition. Under ORS 138.550(3),\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \"all grounds [for relief] must be asserted in [the] original or amended petition, and any grounds not so asserted are deemed waived unless the court on hearing a subsequent petition\n   <em>\n    finds grounds for relief asserted therein which could not reasonably have been raised\n   </em>\n   in the original or amended petition.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   (Emphasis added.) That provision codifies claim preclusion principles: It addresses the question of whether a petitioner who already has litigated a petition for post-conviction relief may return to court and litigate a second time, and it provides that a petitioner may not do so where counsel raised, or reasonably could have raised, the grounds at issue in that prior litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Verduzco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364201\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/553/\">\n    357 Or. at 565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364201\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/553/\">\n    355 P.3d 902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

State Court Administrator Bill Linden recommended the addition of the escape clause to the proposed 120-day statute of limitations to clarify \"how [the statute barring successive petitions] might come into play both when a [petition for post-conviction relief] is timely filed within 120 days and when it is not.\" He wrote: \"Our suggestion is that an amendment may be necessary to the current bill to allow the issues brought up on [postconviction relief] past 120 days if they could not reasonably have been raised before that time.\" Linden warned that, \"without such an amendment, there is a greater chance of litigation[.]\" Exhibit G, House Judiciary Crime and Corrections Subcommittee, HB 2796, Mar. 9, 1989 (accompanying statement of Bill Linden).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   We take Linden's concern to be that a 120-day statute of limitations without exception could give rise to litigation concerning the relationship between ORS 138.510(3) and ORS 138.550(3), where a successive petition alleging a ground that could not reasonably have been raised would be permitted under ORS 138.550(3), but barred under the statute of limitations. The 1989 Legislative Assembly adopted the text proposed by Linden and enacted it into law without\n   modification. It thus appears that the 1989 Legislative Assembly intended the escape clause to provide consistency in the treatment of successive petitions that are timely and untimely: If a successive petition is permitted under ORS 138.550(3) because it raises a ground for relief that could not reasonably have been raised, then generally it also is permitted under ORS 138.510(3), even if it is filed outside the 120-day limitations period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Although that legislative history suggests that timely and untimely successive petitions will frequently be treated the same, it does not directly address what to do with petitions that are untimely but not successive. The escape clause to the statute of limitations differs from the escape clause to the bar on successive petitions in one important respect.

As noted, ORS 138.550(3) codifies claim preclusion principles: It addresses the question of whether a petitioner who already has litigated a petition for post-conviction relief may return to court and litigate a second time, and it provides that a petitioner may not do so where counsel reasonably could have raised the grounds at issue in that prior litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   By contrast, when the bar\n   on successive petitions does not apply, the inquiry under the escape clause to the statute of limitations is whether a petitioner reasonably could have raised a ground for relief\n   <em>\n    before any litigation has occurred\n   </em>\n   .

He alleged that, as a result, he did not know that his conviction could affect his immigration status and that he remained unaware of that fact until he was detained by ICE after the limitations period expired. It may be that the factual record will ultimately reveal that petitioner had information about the immigration consequences of his conviction sooner.

As we explained in\n    <em>\n     Alfieri v.

The passive voice does not, as the state suggests, necessarily render the actor inconsequential to our analysis. Here, the plain text of ORS 138.510(3) asks whether the \"grounds for relief asserted *** could *** reasonably have been raised.\" The question is not whether the grounds are reasonable, but rather, whether an unspecified actor reasonably could have raised them. Although the legislature used the passive voice, it is difficult to consider the reasonableness inquiry in ORS 138.510(3) from the point of view of the \"grounds\" alone; \"reasonably\" modifies the verb \"raised,\" and grounds do not raise themselves. Turning to the context of ORS 138.510(3), we conclude that it is the petitioner who reasonably must have raised the grounds. The statutes governing post-conviction relief refer to the person who files a petition as the \"petitioner.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ORS 138.530(1) (stating grounds for relief that the\n    <em>\n     petitioner\n    </em>\n    must establish).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"dissent\">\n  <author id=\"p-57\">\n   BALMER, J., dissenting.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Statutes of limitations, by their nature, can block good claims. In criminal law, they may protect the guilty. In the tort system, they may deprive the injured of a remedy. And in post-conviction proceedings, they can deny relief from constitutionally unsound convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Why accept that? Because statutes of limitations also play an important, and sometimes essential, role in our legal system. They press parties to bring their claims in a timely matter, they prevent disputes from being adjudicated long after the most probative evidence has gone stale, and they provide certainty to potential defendants who once the statute of limitations has run can live their lives without the fear that they will be subject to a lawsuit or to criminal charges. In the post-conviction context, a statute of limitations may provide crime victims with assurance that the criminal justice system has finally reached a definitive conclusion. A statute of limitations may also make it more likely that post-conviction claims are brought in a timeframe\n   where, if a conviction is set aside, it still may be practicable for the state to retry the petitioner, should doing so be in the interests of justice. Yet those advantages\n   come at an unavoidable cost: Any statute of limitations will necessarily, but hopefully rarely, block some good claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The legislature recognized this essential fact about statutes of limitations when drafting Oregon's system of post-conviction review, and for that reason initially declined to include one.

Although the legislature limited the time within which a post-conviction claim must be brought, it also included an \"escape clause,\" defining circumstances where the statute of limitations would not apply.

Now, the majority interprets ORS 138.510(3) to, in effect, carve out a new exception to\n   <em>\n    Bartz\n   </em>\n   -a petitioner's ignorance of immigration consequences of his or her conviction can be a basis for invoking the escape clause. I sympathize with the majority's effort to provide a path to relief for petitioner, who faces harsh immigration consequences that he did not anticipate when he made the decision to plead guilty. But the distinction that the majority draws between petitioner's claim and that of any other post-conviction petitioner who was unaware of the law pertaining to his or her challenge has no basis in the text, context, or legislative history of the escape clause. The best reading of the escape clause, considering both its text and the legislature's intent, is that it does not provide relief in this case, where petitioner's only reason for his late filing was ignorance of the law. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Petitioner is an immigrant who pleaded guilty to the crime of sex abuse in the third degree, ORS 163.315.

There is no dispute that petitioner did not file his petition within two years of the required date-in his case, the date that his conviction was entered in the record.

The majority then holds that this case differs from\n   <em>\n    Bartz\n   </em>\n   in that the petitioner was unaware of any \"need to investigate,\" 364 Or. at 512, 435 P.3d at 734, because \"until he was detained by ICE after the limitations period had run, he was unaware that his counsel had caused him harm that might arise in the future,\" 364 Or. at 513, 435 P.3d at 734. Both conclusions are incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   I begin with the question of whether the legal ignorance of a previously unrepresented petitioner is sufficient to allow invocation of the escape clause. The text of the escape clause refers to \"grounds for relief asserted which could not reasonably have been raised in the original or amended petition.\" ORS 138.510(3).

ORS 138.550(2) bars petitioners who have\n   obtained \"direct appellate review\" of their conviction from raising any ground in their petition \"unless such ground was not asserted and could not reasonably have been asserted in the direct appellate review proceeding.\" And petitioners who have already filed one petition for post-conviction review are barred from filing another by ORS 138.550(3), \"unless the court finds grounds for relief asserted therein which could not reasonably have been raised in the original or amended petition.\" Both of those provisions-the direct review escape clause and the successive petitions escape clause-have been present in Oregon law since 1959.

L. Rev. at 356. In line with that restrictive purpose, the exception to the\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   provisions for grounds that \"could not reasonably have been raised\" was not intended to be particularly broad, or to undermine the restrictions themselves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The label of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   , the structure of those provisions, and the commentary to them indicate that the provisions operated to require that claims must be brought at the first available proceeding, regardless of whether the law was known to the petitioner and his or her attorney. But what if an unrepresented petitioner failed to bring the claim in an earlier proceeding because of legal ignorance? The structure of the\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   provisions makes clear that that was not a basis for invoking their escape clauses. ORS 138.550(2) contains\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   provisions applicable when there had already been a direct appeal as well as the direct appeal escape clause. However, the drafters understood\n   that not all petitioners would have had access to counsel on direct appeal and felt \"that a layman cannot fairly be held responsible for failure to proceed and raise legal issues when he is without legal assistance.\" Collins &amp; Neil, 39 Or. L. Rev. at 357. The legislature did not understand the direct appeal escape clause to solve that problem. To protect unrepresented petitioners, the legislature added a\n   <em>\n    second\n   </em>\n   exception: The direct appeal\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   provisions do not apply \"[i]f petitioner was not represented by counsel in the direct appellate review proceeding, due to his lack of funds to retain such counsel and the failure of the court to appoint counsel for that proceeding.\" ORS 138.550(2). Because the second exception was necessary to avoid barring claims that had not been raised because of legal ignorance, the legislature clearly did not understand the escape clause, standing alone, to forgive an unrepresented nonlawyer's ignorance of\n   the law. If the direct appeal escape clause allowed petitioners to bring claims that they would have raised on appeal but for their legal ignorance, the second exception would be redundant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In addition, \"[c]ourt decisions that existed at the time that the legislature enacted a statute-and that, as a result, it could have been aware of-may be consulted in determining what the legislature intended in enacting the law as part of the context for the legislature's decision.\"\n   <em>\n    OR-OSHA v.

Shortly before the legislature enacted the post-conviction statute of limitations, the Court of Appeals held that the successive petitions escape clause, contained in ORS 138.550(3), operated on a presumption that postconviction petitioners knew the law. The issue came up in the case of a petitioner who claimed that he had grounds that he \"could not reasonably have been raised in the earlier [post-conviction] proceeding, because his counsel in that proceeding was ineffective.\"\n   <em>\n    Page v.

But\n   <em>\n    Church\n   </em>\n   had concerned grounds that the petitioner\n   <em>\n    had\n   </em>\n   tried to raise, and therefore of which the petitioner was necessarily aware. In\n   <em>\n    Page\n   </em>\n   , the petitioner claimed that he could not have raised the grounds in the first hearing because his counsel was ineffective, although he conceded that \"the factual basis underlying his * * * claims for relief was revealed during his first post-conviction proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Page\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4384598\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/78/520/#p524\">\n    78 Or.

There, as here, the question was whether petitioner's own legal ignorance and understandable reliance on counsel could excuse a failure to bring claims under the escape clause. The Court of Appeals held that ORS 138.550(3), in combination with\n   <em>\n    Church\n   </em>\n   , \"presumes that the\n   <em>\n    petitioner\n   </em>\n   has knowledge of all grounds for relief that were, or should have been, discovered before the close of the original proceeding\" and affirmed the dismissal of his petition.\n   <em>\n    Page\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4384598\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/78/520/#p524\">\n    78 Or.

Because the legislature copied the escape clause from the existing\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   provisions, it is appropriate to infer that the legislature wanted it to operate in the same way. If the legislature had wished to create a different or more generous exception, one that would forgive the legal ignorance of the typical petitioner, it surely would have used different words. And, as the majority describes, the legislative history supports the conclusion that the legislature wanted the statute of limitations escape clause to mirror the\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   provision in ORS 138.510(3). 364 Or. at 518, 435 P.3d at 737.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Having reviewed that history, I have no difficulty in concluding that\n   <em>\n    Bartz\n   </em>\n   was correctly decided and that a ground could \"reasonably have been raised\" during the statute of limitations period if the petitioner was aware of all necessary facts, but unaware of a point of law relevant to his claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The legislature\n   adopted the escape clause with full knowledge that it was a\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   provision that had previously been interpreted not to excuse legal ignorance.

Yet the majority nevertheless holds that the escape clause \"requires assessing both whether the petitioner reasonably could have accessed the ground for relief and whether a reasonable person in the petitioner's situation would have thought to investigate the existence of that ground for relief.\" 364 Or. at 512, 435 P.3d at 734.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   That approach was raised and rejected in\n   <em>\n    Bartz\n   </em>\n   , where the petitioner argued that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   \"If an innocent criminal defendant takes his case to trial and is convicted, he knows something went wrong. He will be prompted to dig for the reasons of what went wrong and\n   how he can undo that wrong\n   <em>\n    immediately\n   </em>\n   following the conviction.

This court clearly understood what it wrote in\n   <em>\n    Bartz\n   </em>\n   to be responsive to that argument, and it is not hard to see why. Because the grounds of relief were available to Bartz, they could reasonably have been raised during the statute of limitations period, even if he was not particularly motivated to overturn his conviction until later. The majority agrees that\n   <em>\n    Bartz\n   </em>\n   reached the correct result even under its new formulation of the test:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   \"For the petitioner in\n   <em>\n    Bartz\n   </em>\n   , the conviction itself put him on notice of the need to investigate the existence of a ground for relief.

In many ineffective assistance of counsel cases, particularly those involving a decision to plead guilty, the deficient performance takes the form of counsel providing a defendant with erroneous advice, or of counsel failing to provide a defendant with the advice that a reasonable attorney would have provided. In cases where the petitioner entered a\n   plea, a category that includes both\n   <em>\n    Bartz\n   </em>\n   and this case, prejudice may be shown by demonstrating a \" 'reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, [the petitioner] would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.' \"\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12605079\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1958/#p1964\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1965\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Hill v.

In this case, petitioner alleges that counsel performed deficiently by failing to inform him that the crime to which he entered a guilty plea might have immigration consequences. In both cases, the petitioners claimed prejudice, in that they would not have entered the plea if they had received the required advice. The\n   claims made in each case are structurally identical. They differ only in the type of advice that the attorney failed to provide. The basis for petitioner's claim is not the immigration consequences themselves, but his lawyer's\n   <em>\n    failure to advise him\n   </em>\n   concerning immigration consequences. Equally, his challenge is, like Bartz's, to his conviction, not to the immigration consequences that it may trigger under federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The majority attempts to distinguish the two situations as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   \"Whereas the petitioner in\n   <em>\n    Bartz\n   </em>\n   was aware of his conviction and could have either researched whether his trial counsel was ineffective, or sought help from an attorney to make that determination, petitioner in this case did not know about the immigration consequences that form the basis for his claim until he was later detained by ICE.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   364 Or. at 514, 435 P.3d at 735. Yet the majority reaches different answers only by asking different questions. Was Bartz aware of his conviction? Of course, but petitioner also was aware of\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   conviction. Did petitioner know of the immigration consequences that form the basis for his claim?\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   No, but neither\n   was Bartz aware of the neglected defense that formed the basis of\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   claim. The real question, to which the majority does not supply an answer, is why the two cases should be analyzed differently. The result is an unexplained holding that Bartz's awareness of his conviction made it \"incumbent on [him] to look for legal challenges to his conviction,\" 364 Or. at 512, 435 P.3d at 734, including ineffective assistance of counsel, yet that in this case petitioner had \"no reason to look for [ineffective assistance of counsel] before being detained by ICE,\" 364 Or. at 513, 435 P.3d at 734.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   As a result, the only fact that the majority points to that distinguishes this case from\n   <em>\n    Bartz\n   </em>\n   , and from most other untimely post-conviction claims, is that petitioner's claim was based on his lawyer's failure to advise him on\n   <em>\n    immigration consequences\n   </em>\n   . The majority suggests that its holding is limited to those facts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   \"[P]etitioners who were unaware of the immigration consequences of their convictions are a narrow class of petitioners. Allowing petitioner's claim in this case to fall within the escape clause does not run the risk of having the escape clause swallow the statute of limitations.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   364 Or. at 514, 435 P.3d at 735. That focus may narrow a rule that the majority recognizes would otherwise be too broad, but the majority points to nothing in the text, context, or legislative history of the escape clause that suggests an intent to treat that class of petitioners differently from all the others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Although it is not explained that way, the majority's distinction between this case and\n   <em>\n    Bartz\n   </em>\n   may be better understood as rooted in fundamentally practical concerns. As the Supreme Court has observed,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   \"The nature of relief secured by a successful collateral challenge to a guilty plea-an opportunity to withdraw the plea and proceed to trial-imposes its own significant limiting\n   principle: Those who collaterally attack their guilty pleas lose the benefit of the bargain obtained as a result of the plea. Thus, a different calculus informs whether it is wise to challenge a guilty plea in a habeas proceeding because, ultimately, the challenge may result in a\n   <em>\n    less favorable\n   </em>\n   outcome for the defendant, whereas a collateral challenge to a conviction obtained after a jury trial has no similar down-side potential.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    559 U.S. at 372-73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original). As\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   recognized, that difference between challenges to guilty\n   pleas and challenges to convictions after trial would likely reduce the number of challenges under its new rule. In that sense, the majority is likely correct in observing that \"[petitioner] had no reason to look for [his claim] before being detained by ICE.\" 364 Or. at 513, 435 P.3d at 734. But that is equally true in most ineffective assistance of counsel cases involving guilty pleas. A petitioner is likely to view her plea, and the underlying plea bargain, as something other than an injury-and perhaps to see it as a boon, given the alternatives-and thus will have no reason to seek to challenge it until she discovers that the advice that informed her decision to enter the plea was incorrect or incomplete. But there is no special connection between that fact and unforeseen immigration consequences. There are many reasons why an individual might come to regret a guilty plea and seek to undo it-an unknown defense, an overlooked motion to suppress, an obscure constitutional challenge to the law-so an exception to the statute of limitations crafted to accommodate this concern would have to either be very broad or very arbitrary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Another practical dimension to this case is the ease of locating and discerning the point of law of which the petitioner was unaware. For an individual looking to challenge a criminal conviction, the elements of the crime and the available defenses are an intuitive place to begin the search-and, in\n   <em>\n    Bartz\n   </em>\n   , such an investigation would have\n   sufficed to uncover the attorney's error. The immigration consequences of petitioner's conviction might be less intuitive or more complex. But, again, there is nothing unique about immigration consequences in this regard. Many of the other topics on which a constitutionally deficient attorney could have failed to provide advice are no less obscure to the nonlawyer than immigration consequences-merger rules, search and seizure law, hearsay exceptions-and criminal cases with some frequency turn on aspects of the law that are removed from quotidian criminal practice, such as free speech rights or property law. There is no principled or workable basis on which to distinguish advice about immigration consequences from all other types of advice-and the majority does not offer one. The majority's exception will thus prove to be very broad or very arbitrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Of course, the legislature is entitled to carve out exceptions to the statute of limitations that are broad, seemingly arbitrary, or both. But the legislature intended to create neither a broad exception to the statute of limitations in ORS 138.510(3) for all types of legal ignorance nor a special exception for claims with some connection to immigration consequences. The majority agrees that the former exception would be contrary to the legislature's intentions and points to nothing to suggest that the legislature intended the latter exception. The majority's rule is, in essence, a judicial creation. In articulating the common law or constitutional requirements we may have a freer hand, but since 1959 the post-conviction process has been statutorily defined, and our role is to interpret what the legislature has written.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dillard v. Premo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=362%20Or.%2041\">\n    362 Or. 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 48-49,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=403%20P.3d%20746\">\n    403 P.3d 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017) (Balmer, C. J., dissenting).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Strict statutes of limitations have their advantages, but their price is that they occasionally produce harsh results and unfairness. Even a claim that, as far as I can tell at this stage, is meritorious, and would likely have succeeded had it been filed a year earlier, must be dismissed. It may be the case that the escape clause, which has not been amended since\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   was decided, should be modified to be more for-giving of immigration-related claims like petitioner's. The legislature is entitled to engage in the delicate balancing of competing policy objectives as is necessary in crafting any\n   statute of limitations. Here, they did so, and I cannot give their words any fair reading other than that outlined above. For those reasons, I\n   would affirm the judgment below, and therefore I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Kistler, S.

Petitioner's actual immigration status is only somewhat related to his post-conviction claim. Petitioner may be deportable for reasons besides this conviction; conversely, he may have valid defenses against removal irrespective of this conviction. Moreover, the true immigration consequences of his conviction may turn on law that trial counsel was not constitutionally required to advise him on, or on changes in the law subsequent to his conviction, among several possible scenarios.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Esquivel-Quintana v.

In this case, the two are apparently aligned, but that will not be so in all cases. For example, a petitioner might wish to undo her plea principally because of the deleterious effect that her conviction has upon her employment opportunities, but raise as grounds for relief that her trial counsel was ineffective for failing to uncover exculpatory evidence.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
