Defendant moved the district court to set aside the racketeering convictions\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and enter judgments of acquittal on the grounds that the jury had failed to find she committed the requisite two predicate acts and that there was instructional error. Defendant additionally argued that retrial would violate her right to be free from double jeopardy on the ground that sufficient predicate acts were lacking. The district court vacated Defendant's racketeering convictions but permitted retrial. Defendant now appeals this order. We hold that instructional error warranted vacating Defendant's racketeering convictions. Because the State may rely on conspiracy to commit drug trafficking as a predicate offense, however, sufficient predicates exist to permit retrial of the racketeering charges. Defendant additionally appeals her conviction for conspiracy to commit drug trafficking on sufficiency grounds. We hold that substantial evidence supported this conviction. We therefore affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {2} Defendant was alleged to be associated with a methamphetamine trafficking organization known as \"the AZ Boys.\" She was charged by indictment with three counts of methamphetamine trafficking occurring on March 18, 2012, April 8, 2012, and May 1, 2012; three counts of conspiracy to traffic methamphetamine related to the same dates; and one count each of racketeering and conspiracy to commit racketeering. After a four-day trial, a jury convicted Defendant of racketeering (Count 1), conspiracy to commit racketeering (Count 2), and conspiracy to traffic methamphetamine on April 8, 2012 (Count 8). The jury acquitted Defendant of the trafficking and conspiracy to traffic counts pertaining to the date of March 18, 2012 (Counts 5 and 6), as well as the trafficking count pertaining to the date of April 8, 2012 (Count 7). The jury deadlocked on the trafficking and conspiracy to traffic counts related to the alleged conduct of May 1, 2012 (Counts 3 and 4). The district court declared a mistrial as to those counts and permitted retrial. Defendant does not appeal this decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {3} Shortly after trial, Defendant moved the district court to set aside her racketeering convictions, and to enter judgments of \"not guilty\" or dismiss the racketeering counts with prejudice. Defendant argued that the failure of the jury to convict her of two trafficking counts demonstrated that insufficient evidence existed to convict her of racketeering and conspiracy to racketeer. Therefore, Defendant asserted, a retrial of those counts would violate her right not to be tried twice for the same conduct. At the hearing on Defendant's motion, Defendant additionally argued that the jury instruction defining \"racketeering\" was incorrect because it included all of the possible predicate offenses but failed to provide the elements of those crimes. The State agreed that the jury instructions for the racketeering counts were incorrect. Ultimately, the State did not oppose vacatur of the racketeering convictions but argued that retrial, not acquittal or dismissal, was the appropriate remedy. Both Defendant and the State maintained that the convictions for the racketeering charges and acquittals for the trafficking charges were inconsistent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {4} The district court vacated the racketeering convictions but ordered a retrial. Although the exact basis for the district court's decision is not clear, the court noted the inconsistencies in the verdicts, that the motion was uncontested in terms of vacating the racketeering convictions, and that the State agreed that there was instructional error. The district court additionally entered a judgment and sentence on Defendant's conviction for conspiracy to commit trafficking methamphetamine on April 8, 2012 (Count 8), sentencing Defendant to a four-year term of incarceration. Defendant appeals the district court's denial of her request for judgments of acquittal or dismissal of the racketeering charges and appeals her conviction for conspiracy to commit drug trafficking for sufficiency of the evidence. Additional facts are discussed as needed in our analysis. Table 1 summarizes the present posture of the charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Tabular or graphic material set at this point is not displayable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    THE RACKETEERING CONVICTIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {5} We first address whether this Court has jurisdiction to review the denial of Defendant's motion for acquittal or dismissal in the absence of a final order. Concluding we do, we then lay out general principles of double jeopardy and racketeering. We next hold that the district court correctly determined that both racketeering convictions should be set aside for instructional error. The issue then is whether Defendant can, consistent with her right to be free from double jeopardy, be subject to retrial on these charges. We hold that she can. Finally, although the parties request us to opine about the scope of retrial, we decline to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The Court Has Jurisdiction to Review the District Court's Order Denying Defendant's Motion for Acquittal or Dismissal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {6} The State argues that Defendant's appeal should be summarily dismissed \"for want of a final order\" or, if the appeal is construed as an interlocutory appeal, because it is untimely. The district court's order, however, implicates Defendant's constitutional right to avoid double jeopardy-indeed, Defendant's \"right not to be subjected to a second trial for the same offense could not be remedied once the second trial has taken place.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Second, in addition to the error identified with the substantive racketeering instruction, we conclude that the conspiracy to racketeer instruction is flawed on other grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {16} As to the conspiracy to commit racketeering instruction, the jury was instructed as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   For you to find [D]efendant guilty of conspiracy to commit racketeering (conduct or participate) as charged in Count 2, the [S]tate must prove to your satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt each of the following elements of the crime:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   1.

Although the intention of the conspiracy to commit racketeering instruction may have been to incorporate all the elements from the racketeering instruction pertaining to Count 1, it did not accomplish this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {17} Instead, the jury instruction refers to \"racketeering\" alone. Although \"racketeering\" is a separate criminal offense (as charged in Count 1), it also is a\n   <em>\n    defined term\n   </em>\n   meaning any act involving any of twenty-five predicate offenses. It is not clear from the instruction in Count 2 whether \"racketeering\" refers to the separate criminal offense or to the defined term. If it is the latter, the instruction for Count 2 (conspiracy to commit racketeering) requires only that Defendant and another agreed to and intended to commit any one of the twenty-five predicate acts. This leads to the possibility that, for example, if the jury determined that Defendant committed one count of conspiracy to commit drug trafficking, the jury also could have convicted Defendant for conspiracy to commit racketeering on this basis\n   <em>\n    alone\n   </em>\n   . This is impermissible. The instruction omitted, among other things, any elements pertaining to an enterprise or a pattern of racketeering.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The State, in turn, requests carte blanche permission to rely on any and all uncharged predicates, without even naming the offenses it intends to rely on at retrial.

As required by the conspiracy instruction, the essential elements of trafficking methamphetamine by possession with intent to distribute ( UJI 14-3104 NMRA) also were given. UJI 14-2810 use note 1. As to duress, the jury was instructed that \"[i]f [D]efendant feared immediate great bodily harm to herself or another person if she did not commit the crime(s), and if a reasonable person would have acted in the same way under the circumstances, you must find [D]efendant not guilty.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UJI 14-5130 NMRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {39} The AZ Boys, the methamphetamine trafficking organization Defendant was alleged to be associated with, was run by Defendant's boyfriend, Robert (Bob) Chavez, and his brother Joe Chavez. The State's primary witness was Sonya Sanders, who had been Defendant's friend and later became an informant. Sanders' testimony was as follows: In February 2012, Defendant asked Sanders if she wanted to travel to Arizona \"to make some money.\" Defendant explained to Sanders that Bob Chavez, Joe Chavez, and Defendant needed a driver because the previous driver \"had gotten busted\" for possession of methamphetamine. Sanders agreed and indicated that she knew that \"driving\" for Defendant meant transporting drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   {40} Sanders made a total of three trips with Defendant and Bob Chavez to Phoenix, Arizona and back to Alamogordo, New Mexico, which were the bases for the drug trafficking charges in the indictment. On the first trip in March 2012, Sanders traveled with Defendant and Bob Chavez to a house in Phoenix. Sanders made the return trip to Alamogordo in a rental truck, while Bob Chavez and Defendant drove back in another vehicle. Sanders did not perform well on the first drive back from Arizona. While driving, Sanders observed Bob Chavez hitting Defendant; Sanders believed Bob Chavez was taking out his anger about her driving on Defendant. Both Defendant and Joe Chavez gave Defendant advice on how to drive better in the future. Joe Chavez and Defendant paid Sanders in cash and methamphetamine for the first trip.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   {41} After the first trip, Defendant and Bob Chavez arranged to buy a truck for Sanders, \"to go back and forth to Arizona with them.\" About ten days later, Sanders received a call from Defendant who instructed Sanders that \"we're gonna leave in a couple hours, get ready.\" They stayed in Phoenix for several days. Despite Bob Chavez's displeasure, Defendant ensured that they left back to Alamogordo in time for Sanders to spend Easter (April 8, 2012) with her children. As they prepared for the return trip, Sanders observed Defendant and Bob Chavez make preparations with a tire on a tarp, and at one point, Defendant handed Sanders some methamphetamine to help her stay awake for the return trip. Sanders later observed the tire had been loaded onto her truck. After getting back to Alamogordo, Defendant \"was really happy ... [because] for the first time in a long time,\" they had someone who was \"able to drive.\" Defendant\n   and Bob Chavez compensated Sanders with a combination of methamphetamine and cash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {42} Sometime after the second trip, Sanders was stopped pursuant to a warrant for selling methamphetamine. Sanders agreed to cooperate with law enforcement to help bring down the AZ Boys. In May 2012, Sanders participated in a third trip to Arizona while cooperating with law enforcement. During this trip, Sanders saw bruising on Defendant and observed Bob Chavez abusing Defendant; at one point, Sanders asked Defendant to leave with her but Defendant would not go. Law enforcement ultimately recovered four pounds of methamphetamine from the spare tire of the truck Sanders had driven back from Arizona on the third trip.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   {43} At trial, Defendant testified on her own behalf and raised the defense of duress. Although Defendant claimed not to have knowledge about or involvement in the AZ Boys organization, some of Defendant's testimony corroborated Sanders' testimony. For instance, Defendant testified she had \"invited [Sanders] to go to Phoenix\" at Bob Chavez's direction, although Defendant claimed not to know why. Defendant spoke with Sanders about making a second trip to Phoenix. Defendant advised Sanders \"to be ready,\" and to try not to make any mistakes. Defendant testified that she had given Sanders methamphetamine when they were in Phoenix on the second trip to help Sanders stay awake for the drive back. Defendant testified that she knew Bob Chavez \"was selling drugs,\" but claimed not to know about the \"interstate methamphetamine trafficking organization\" until the second trip with Sanders. In reference to the tires that were used in the second and third trips, Defendant added that \"any person in their right mind would know what was going on.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {44} Defendant testified to the abusive and controlling nature of her relationship with Bob Chavez and that she feared for her life if she left him. Defendant, however, acknowledged that she and Bob Chavez had previously broken up, and she had received family support during the breakup. She also acknowledged that she was able to go to her mother's home, which was close to the local police station, and that she had family members who were retired law enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   {45} The foregoing evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, is sufficient to support the conviction for conspiracy to commit trafficking. There was testimony that the second trip from Phoenix to Alamogordo happened on or about April 8, 2012, meeting the fourth element. There was significant circumstantial evidence that Defendant agreed with one or more individuals to commit trafficking methamphetamine and intended to commit this offense, meeting the first and second elements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Further, the jury heard testimony that Defendant exerted some influence over Bob Chavez during the second trip and had options available to her other than committing the offense. As such, a rational jury could have determined beyond a reasonable doubt that Defendant did not act under duress. Therefore, the evidence was sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Defendant committed each element of conspiracy to commit trafficking methamphetamine (Count 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   {46} We affirm the district court's order vacating the racketeering convictions, denying Defendant's motion for acquittal or dismissal, and permitting retrial of the racketeering counts.

For reference, we provide citation to pattern jury instructions adopted by several federal circuit courts.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , 2B Fed. Jury Prac. &amp; Instr. \u00a7 56:11 (6th ed.) (setting out pattern jury instructions on conspiracy to commit racketeering through a pattern of racketeering, and including model criminal jury instruction from the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit); Mod. Crim. Jury Instr. 3rd Cir. 6.18.1962D (2018) (Third Circuit pattern instruction); Fed. Crim. Jury Instr. 7th Cir. 1962(d)[1] (2012 ed.) (Seventh Circuit pattern instruction); Pattern Crim. Jury Instr. 11th Cir. OI O75.2 (2016) (Eleventh Circuit pattern instruction). It should be noted that the federal circuits diverge, and in some cases conflict, on various elements required for conspiracy to commit racketeering. Our citation to these instructions in no way endorses the approach taken by any one of these circuits.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    As discussed above, the State need not prove that Defendant committed two predicate acts to be convicted of conspiracy to racketeer. Given this holding, we need only examine Defendant's arguments that insufficient predicate acts exist to permit retrial in the context of the racketeering charge,\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    the conspiracy to commit racketeering charge.
