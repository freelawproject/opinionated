The Department is responsible for administering \u00a7 15-30-3111, MCA (the Tax Credit Program), which provides a taxpayer a dollar-for-dollar tax credit based on the taxpayer's donation to a Student Scholarship Organization (SSO). SSOs fund tuition scholarships for students who attend private schools meeting the definition of Qualified Education Provider (QEP). The Legislature instructed the Department to implement the Tax Credit Program in compliance with\n   Article V, Section 11(5), and Article X, Section 6, of the Montana Constitution. Pursuant to that grant of authority, the Department implemented Admin. R. M. 42.4.802 (Rule 1), which it believed was necessary to constitutionally administer the Tax Credit Program. Rule 1 adds to the Legislature's definition of QEP and excludes religiously-affiliated private schools from qualifying as QEPs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 2 Plaintiffs are parents whose children attend a religiously-affiliated private school. Because Rule 1 precludes religiously-affiliated private schools from the definition of QEP, SSOs cannot fund tuition scholarships at the school Plaintiffs' children attend. Plaintiffs filed this proceeding challenging Rule 1. The Department responded, arguing Rule 1 was necessary because the Tax Credit Program as enacted by the Legislature violates Montana's Constitution. The District Court determined the Tax Credit Program was constitutional without Rule 1 and accordingly granted Plaintiffs summary judgment. The Department now appeals, arguing that the Tax Credit Program is unconstitutional absent Rule 1. We address the following issue on appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Does the Tax Credit Program violate Article X, Section 6, of the Montana Constitution ?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 3 We conclude the Tax Credit Program violates Article X, Section 6, of the Montana Constitution and accordingly reverse the\n   District Court's order granting Plaintiffs summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 4 In 2015, the Legislature, through Senate Bill 410, enacted Title 15, chapter 30, part 31, MCA, entitled \"Tax Credit for Qualified Education Contributions.\" Sections 15-30-3101 to -3114, MCA (Part 31);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20Mont.%20Laws%202165\">\n    2015 Mont. Laws 2165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Part 31 provides two types of dollar-for-dollar tax credits to taxpayers who donate to educational programs in Montana. Sections 15-30-3110 to -3111, MCA. A taxpayer may receive a tax credit for providing supplemental funding to public schools, \u00a7 15-30-3110, MCA, or for donating to the Tax Credit Program, \u00a7 15-30-3111, MCA. The only tax credit at issue in these proceedings is the credit a taxpayer receives based on her donation to the Tax Credit Program, \u00a7 15-30-3111, MCA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Tax Credit Program provides a taxpayer a dollar-for-dollar tax credit of up to $150 based on her donation to an SSO. Section 15-30-3111(1), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 5 An SSO is a charitable organization in Montana that is (1) \"exempt from federal income taxation under [ I.R.C. \u00a7 501(c)(3) ]\"; (2) \"allocates not less than 90% of its annual revenue for scholarships to allow students to enroll with any [QEP]\"; and (3) \"provides educational scholarships to eligible students without limiting student access to only one education provider.\" Section 15-30-3102(9)(a)-(c), MCA ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 15-30-3103, MCA (listing additional SSO requirements); \u00a7\u00a7 15-30-3105 to -3106, MCA (setting forth SSO reporting requirements). The purpose of SSOs \"is to provide parental and student choice in education with private contributions through tax replacement programs.\" Section 15-30-3101, MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 6 Taxpayer donors donate to SSOs generally; they \"may not direct or designate contributions to a parent, legal guardian, or specific [QEP].\" Section 15-30-3111(1), MCA. SSOs then use those donations to fund student tuition scholarships at private schools meeting the definition of QEP in \u00a7 15-30-3102(7), MCA. Section 15-30-3104(1), MCA. SSOs are responsible for maintaining \"an application process under which scholarship applications are accepted, reviewed, approved,\n   and denied.\" Section 15-30-3103(1)(h), MCA. After an SSO decides to grant a student a tuition scholarship, the SSO pays the scholarship directly to the scholarship recipient's QEP. Section 15-30-3104(1), MCA. The Legislature defined QEP as \"an education provider that\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (a) is not a public school;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (b) (i) is accredited, has applied for accreditation, or is provisionally accredited by a state, regional, or national accreditation organization; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (ii) is a nonaccredited provider or tutor and has informed the child's parents or legal guardian in writing at the time of enrollment that the provider is not accredited and is not seeking accreditation;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (c) is not a home school as referred to in 20-5-102(2)(e);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (d) administers a nationally recognized standardized assessment test or criterion-referenced test and:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (i) makes the results available to the child's parents or legal guardian; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (ii) administers the test for all 8th grade and 11th grade students and provides the overall scores on a publicly accessible private website or provides the composite results of the test to the office of public instruction for posting on its website;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (e) satisfies the health and safety requirements prescribed by law for private schools in this state; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (f) qualifies for an exemption from compulsory enrollment under 20-5-102(2)(e) and 20-5-109.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Section 15-30-3102(7), MCA. Essentially, the Legislature's definition of QEP means \"a private school.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 7 The Department is responsible for implementing and administering Part 31. Sections 15-30-3102(1), -3114, MCA. The Department must perform extensive administrative tasks to ensure Part 31 functions appropriately. Sections 15-30-3103, -3105, -3111 to -3113, MCA. The Legislature explicitly granted the Department rulemaking authority to \"adopt rules, prepare forms, and maintain records that are necessary to implement and administer [Part 31].\" Section 15-30-3114, MCA. The Legislature also instructed the Department to administer Part 31 in compliance with Article V, Section 11(5), and Article X, Section 6, of the Montana Constitution. Section 15-30-3101, MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 8 Beginning in fiscal year 2016, to accomplish these statutorily-mandated responsibilities, the Department required additional resources and personnel. Senate Bill 410's Fiscal Note estimated one-time costs to the Department of $420,325 to develop new\n   forms and add data processing systems. S. 410 Fiscal Note, 64th Reg. Sess., at 3 (April 21, 2015), https://perma.cc/6X7Z-GEEZ (hereinafter Fiscal Note). Further, the Department required two additional full-time employees: one to process and verify credit applications and annual reports from SSOs and another to verify and audit the new tax credits. Fiscal Note, at 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 9 Tasked with constitutionally implementing Part 31, the Department identified what it saw as a constitutional deficiency: the Tax Credit Program aided sectarian schools in violation of Article X, Section 6, of Montana's Constitution. Under the Legislature's definition of QEP, most QEPs were religiously-affiliated private schools. The Department examined how the Tax Credit Program operated and determined it unconstitutionally aided those religiously-affiliated QEPs. To combat the issue, and pursuant to the rulemaking authority granted by the Legislature, \u00a7\u00a7 15-30-3101, -3114, MCA, the Department adopted Rule 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 10 Rule 1 added to the Legislature's definition of QEP, \u00a7 15-30-3102(7), MCA, providing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (1) A \"qualified education provider\" has the meaning given in 15-30-3102, MCA, and pursuant to 15-30-3101, MCA, may not be:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (a) a church, school, academy, seminary, college, university, literary or scientific institution, or any other sectarian institution owned or controlled in whole or in part by any church, religious sect, or denomination; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (b) an individual who is employed by a church, school, academy, seminary, college, university, literary or scientific institution, or any other sectarian institution owned or controlled in whole or in part by any church, religious sect, or denomination when providing those services.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (2) For the purposes of (1), \"controlled in whole or in part by a church, religious sect, or denomination\" includes accreditation by a faith-based organization.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Admin. R. M. 42.4.802. Simply put, Rule 1 excluded religiously-affiliated private schools from the Legislature's definition of QEP, \u00a7 15-30-3102(7), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 11 Plaintiffs are parents whose children attend a religiously-affiliated private school in Montana. The school qualifies as a QEP under the Legislature's definition, \u00a7 15-30-3102(7), MCA, but does not qualify as a QEP under the Department's definition, Rule 1. Plaintiffs challenged Rule 1 in District Court, arguing it violated the free exercise clauses of\n   the Montana and U.S. Constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs further reasoned that Rule 1 was unnecessary because the Tax Credit Program and the Legislature's definition of QEP were constitutional. The Department responded, arguing that the Tax Credit Program is unconstitutional and reasoning that Rule 1 necessarily restricted the Tax Credit Program which, absent Rule 1, aided sectarian schools. Both sides filed cross-motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 12 The District Court narrowly focused its analysis on the tax credits themselves, noting the credits did not \"involve the expenditure of money that the state has in its treasury.\" Instead, it determined the tax credits \"concern[ed] money that is not in the treasury and not subject to expenditure.\" For that reason alone, the District Court concluded the Department incorrectly interpreted Article V, Section 11(5), and Article X, Section 6(1), of the Montana Constitution. Because it decided the Tax Credit Program was constitutional as enacted by the 2015 Legislature, the District Court did not further address Rule 1's constitutionality. The District Court granted Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, denied the Department's motion for summary judgment, and permanently enjoined the Department from applying or enforcing Rule 1. The Tax Credit Program remained as enacted by the 2015 Legislature. The Department now appeals the District Court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 13 This Court exercises plenary review over constitutional law questions.\n   <em>\n    Nelson v.

Article X, Section 6, broadly and strictly prohibits aid to sectarian schools.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 17 Article X, Section 6, of the Montana Constitution, entitled \"Aid prohibited to sectarian schools,\" provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   (1) The legislature, counties, cities, towns, school districts, and public corporations shall not make any direct or indirect appropriation or payment from any public fund or monies, or any\n   grant of lands or other property for any sectarian purpose or to aid any church, school, academy, seminary, college, university, or other literary or scientific institution, controlled in whole or in part by any church, sect, or denomination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   (2) This section shall not apply to funds from federal sources provided to the state for the express purpose of distribution to non-public education.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 18 The Constitutional Convention Delegates' (Delegates) intent controls our interpretation of a constitutional provision.\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 14. We primarily discern the Delegates' intent \"from the plain meaning of the language used.\"\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 14 (explaining that we apply our rules of statutory construction to our analysis of constitutional provisions). However, we define the Delegates' intent \"not only from the plain meaning of the language used, but also in light of the historical and surrounding circumstances under which the [Delegates] drafted the Constitution, the nature of the subject matter they faced, and the objective they sought to achieve.\"\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 14. Accordingly, we \"determine the meaning and intent of constitutional provisions from the plain meaning of the language used without resort to extrinsic aids\n   <em>\n    except\n   </em>\n   when the language is vague or ambiguous or extrinsic aids clearly manifest an intent not apparent from the express language.\"\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 16 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 19 In determining what the Delegates intended Article X, Section 6, to mean, we first observe that the plain language of the provision's title is expansive and forceful: \"Aid prohibited to sectarian schools.\" The title clearly manifests the Delegates' intent to broadly prohibit aid to sectarian schools. The provision's text is equally expansive, prohibiting numerous types of state actors, including the \"legislature, counties, cities, towns, school districts, and public corporations\" from making \"any direct or indirect appropriation or payment from any public fund or monies, or any grant of lands or other property for any sectarian purpose or to aid any ... school ... controlled in whole or in part by any church, sect, or denomination.\" Mont. Const. art. X, \u00a7 6 (1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 20 The provision's plain language begs three main inquiries, each of which cast a broad net clearly intended to prohibit \"any\" type of state aid being used to benefit sectarian education. First, the provision's plain language identifies the entity that is prohibited from providing the aid: Article X, Section 6, prohibits the \"legislature, counties, cities, towns, school districts, and public corporations\" from aiding sectarian schools. Second, the provision's plain language identifies the type of aid it prohibits: Article X, Section 6, broadly prohibits any type of direct or indirect aid to sectarian schools-\"any direct or indirect appropriation\n   or payment from any\n   public fund or monies, or any grant of lands or other property.\" Third, the provision's plain language specifies that the aid is prohibited \"for any sectarian purpose or to aid any church, school, academy, seminary, college, university, or other literary or scientific institution, controlled in whole or in part by any church, sect, or denomination.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 21 The Delegates adapted Article X, Section 6, of the Montana Constitution from the 1889 Constitution's broad and general no-aid provision, recognizing that it was already \"among the most stringent [no-aid clauses] in the nation.\" Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, March 11, 1972, pp. 2008, 2011 (hereinafter Convention Transcript);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Mont. Const. of 1889, art. XI, \u00a7 8 (\"[T]he Legislative Assembly ... shall [n]ever make directly or indirectly, any appropriation, or pay from any public fund or moneys ... in aid of any church, or for any sectarian purpose, or to aid in the support of any school ... controlled in whole or in part by any church....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 22 The Delegates' strong commitment to maintaining public education and ensuring that public education remained free from religious entanglement is evident from the Constitutional Convention Transcripts; the Delegates wanted the public school system to receive \"unequivocal support.\" Convention Transcript, p. 2008. Delegate Burkhardt noted, \"Under federal and state mandates to concentrate public funds in public schools, our educational system has grown strong in an atmosphere free from divisiveness and fragmentation.\" Convention Transcript, p. 2009. He further emphasized, \"\n   <em>\n    Any diversion of funds or effort from the public school system\n   </em>\n   would tend to weaken that system in favor of schools established for private or religious purposes.\" Convention Transcript, p. 2009 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 23 A minority of Delegates sought to delete the language prohibiting indirect aid from Article X, Section 6. Those Delegates wanted to ensure private school students could receive federal aid under the United States Supreme Court's child-benefit theory, which allows federal aid as long as it directly supports the child and not the religious school. Convention Transcript, pp. 2010-11. Delegate Blaylock, however, expressed concern that deleting the indirect language would make it \"fairly easy to appropriate a number of funds ... to some other group and then say this will be done indirectly.\" Convention Transcript, p. 2015. The Delegates ultimately maintained the indirect language and instead added a separate subsection specifically addressing federal aid: \"[ Article X, Section 6 ] shall not apply to funds from federal sources provided to the state for the express purpose of distribution to non-public education.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Mont. Const. art. X, \u00a7 6 (2). Notably, the Delegates understood that Montana could prohibit forms of state aid that were otherwise permissible as federal aid. Convention Transcript, pp. 2008, 2011, 2024-25. Our conclusion that Article X, Section 6, more broadly prohibits aid to sectarian schools than the federal Establishment Clause is consistent with the Delegates' intent of the provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 24 It is also worth observing that Montana's no-aid provision is unique from other states' no-aid provisions. Article X, Section 6 's prohibition of \"any direct or indirect appropriation or payment from any public fund or monies, or any grant of lands or other property for any sectarian purpose or to aid any ... school ... controlled in whole or in part by any church\" make it a broader and stronger prohibition against aid to sectarian schools than other states.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even other states whose no-aid provisions also contain \"indirect\" language only prohibit aid in the form of the\n   <em>\n    direct or indirect taking of money\n   </em>\n   from the public treasury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ga. Const. art. I, \u00a7 II, \u00b6 VII (\"No money shall ever be taken from the public treasury, directly or indirectly,\n   in aid of any church....\");\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fla. Const. art. I, \u00a7 3 (\"No revenue of the state or any political subdivision or agency thereof shall ever be taken from the public treasury directly or indirectly in aid of any church....\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Such language is distinct from and less stringent than Montana's prohibition on\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   type of aid, whether it be a \"direct or indirect appropriation or payment from any public fund or monies, or any grant of lands or other property.\" Mont. Const. art. X, \u00a7 6 (1).\n   \u00b6 25 As a Court, we have not yet interpreted Article X, Section 6. However, the 1972 Constitutional Convention Delegates intended Article X, Section 6, to retain the meaning of Article XI, Section 8, of the Montana Constitution of 1889.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Convention Transcript, p. 2014. Accordingly, this Court's pre-1972 precedent analyzing Article XI, Section 8, of the Montana Constitution of 1889 remains helpful to our analysis of Article X, Section 6.

The Tax Credit Program aids sectarian schools in violation of Article X, Section 6, of the Montana Constitution.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 27 Plaintiffs initially filed this action challenging Rule 1. The District Court focused its analysis on the underlying Tax Credit Program, determining the program itself was constitutional. Therefore, the District Court easily dispelled of Rule 1 after concluding it was based on a mistake of law. On appeal, the Department argues that the Tax Credit Program is unconstitutional and, accordingly, Rule 1 is necessary for the Department to constitutionally administer the program.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   To properly evaluate the propriety of Rule 1, we must first\n   address the Department's contention that the Tax Credit Program is unconstitutional. It is clear the Department's contention is a facial challenge to the Tax Credit Program, as it asserts the Tax Credit Program unconstitutionally aids sectarian schools and promulgated Rule 1 to cure the constitutional defect.

The Legislature aided sectarian schools when it enacted the Tax Credit Program.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 29 Article X, Section 6, directly prohibits various entities, including the Legislature, from aiding sectarian schools. Preliminarily, we recognize that an individual taxpayer may give money to any cause she wishes. A taxpayer is free to donate to an SSO, a QEP, or any other charitable cause of her choice. There is no prohibition on a taxpayer giving her money away, nor would such prohibition be constitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 30 In this case, the action under scrutiny is the Legislature's provision of a tax credit to taxpayer donors. The Legislature, by enacting the Tax Credit Program, involved itself in donations to religiously-affiliated private schools. The Tax Credit Program provides a dollar-for-dollar incentive of up to $150 for taxpayer donations to SSOs. The tax credit encourages the transfer of money from a taxpayer donor to a sectarian school because the taxpayer donor knows she will be reimbursed, dollar-for-dollar, for her donation to an SSO. SSOs, in turn, directly fund tuition scholarships at religiously-affiliated QEPs. The Legislature, by enacting a statute that provides a dollar-for-dollar credit against taxes owed to the state, is the entity providing aid to sectarian schools via tax credits in violation of Article X, Section 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    b. The Tax Credit Program permits the Legislature to indirectly\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    pay tuition at private, religiously-affiliated schools.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 31 Article X, Section 6, broadly prohibits any type of direct or indirect aid: the Legislature may not make \"any direct or indirect appropriation or payment from any public fund or monies, or any grant of lands or other property.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 32 The Tax Credit Program permits the Legislature to indirectly pay tuition at private, religiously-affiliated schools. Parents owe a certain amount of tuition to the QEP their child attends. If a child receives a tuition scholarship from an SSO, the scholarship decreases the amount of tuition that child's parents owe to the QEP. Many of the taxpayer donors who would donate to SSOs would be parents of children who attend QEPs. When parents donate to an SSO, they receive a dollar-for-dollar tax credit of up to $150. If the parents' child also receives a tuition scholarship from an SSO in the amount of, for example, $150, the parents' tuition obligation to the QEP decreases by $150-the exact amount the parents received as a tax credit for their donation to an SSO. The parents donated $150 to an SSO, received a dollar-for-dollar reimbursement for that donation in the form of a tax credit, and subsequently owed $150 less in tuition to their child's QEP. The Legislature indirectly payed $150 of that student's tuition by permitting his or her parents to claim a tax credit instead of paying that amount of tuition to the QEP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 33 The Legislature attempted to sever the indirect payment by requiring taxpayer donors to donate to an SSO generally and prohibiting them from directing or designating contributions to specific parents, legal guardians, or QEPs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 15-30-3111(1), MCA. Therefore, parents cannot donate to an SSO, claim a tax credit for their donation, and then directly designate the funds they donated to their own child's scholarship. However, an indirect payment still exists, as described above, when a student whose parents claimed the tax credit receives a scholarship\n   from an SSO. The simple fact that parents who donate to SSOs cannot directly designate the scholarship funds to their own child or to their child's school does not defeat the fact that the Legislature indirectly pays tuition to the QEP. Senate Bill 410's Fiscal Note recognized as much, stating that the donations to SSOs, the bases for the tax credits, \"would primarily represent funds that\n   <em>\n    would have been used to pay tuition directly\n   </em>\n   ....\" Fiscal Note, at 2. The Tax Credit Program permits the Legislature to indirectly pay tuition at QEPs by reimbursing parents for donating to SSOs, donations funded with money the parents would have otherwise used to pay their child's tuition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 34 The Tax Credit Program permits the Legislature to subsidize\n   tuition payments at religiously-affiliated private schools. A subsidy is a \"\n   <em>\n    grant\n   </em>\n   , usu[ally] made by the government, to any enterprise whose promotion is considered to be in the public interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Subsidy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed. 2014). \"Although governments sometimes make direct payments (such as cash grants), subsidies are usu[ally] indirect. They may take the form of ... tax breaks....\"\n   <em>\n    Subsidy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed. 2014). When the Legislature indirectly pays general tuition payments at sectarian schools, the Legislature effectively subsidizes the sectarian school's educational program. That type of government subsidy in aid of sectarian schools is precisely what the Delegates intended Article X, Section 6, to prohibit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 35 While $150 may seem like a small sum of money when compared to the State's overall operating budget, the amount of aid is wholly insignificant to an Article X, Section 6, analysis. The Legislature violates Article X, Section 6 's prohibition on aid to sectarian schools when it provides any aid, no matter how small. Further, the $150 indirect payments certainly add up over time, especially as the aggregate limits on the tax credits increase from $3 million each year the limit is met.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 15-30-3111(5)(a)(i)-(iii), MCA. The Tax Credit Program creates an indirect payment: the program reduces \"the net price of attending private school ... for students who receive scholarships and whose families claim the credit.\" Fiscal Note, at 2. Article X, Section 6, expressly prohibits that type of indirect payment to sectarian schools.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 36 Importantly, for purposes of examining the facial constitutionality of the Tax Credit Program, the schools meeting the Legislature's definition of QEP may be-and, in fact, the overwhelming majority are-religiously affiliated. There is simply no mechanism within the Tax Credit Program itself that operates to ensure that an indirect payment of $150 is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   used to fund religious education in contravention of Article X, Section 6. The Department, in administering the Tax Credit Program pursuant to the Legislature's definition of QEP, \u00a7 15-30-3102(7), MCA, has no ability to ensure that indirect payments are not made to religious schools. Or, as this Court has previously cautioned, there is no mechanism within the Tax Credit Program to identify \"where the secular purpose end[s] and the sectarian beg[ins].\"\n   <em>\n    Chambers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5280849\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/155/422/#p436\">\n    155 Mont. at 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=472%20P.2d%201013\">\n    472 P.2d at 1021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Department cannot discern when the tax credit is indirectly paying tuition at a secular school and when the tax credit is indirectly paying tuition at a sectarian school. Because the Tax Credit Program does not distinguish between an indirect payment to fund a secular education and an indirect payment to fund a sectarian education, it cannot, under\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   circumstance, be construed as consistent with Article X, Section 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    c.

The Legislature's enactment of the Tax Credit Program is facially unconstitutional and violates Montana's constitutional guarantee to all Montanans that their government will not use state funds to aid religious schools. This basic notion of separation of church and state is a foundation of our Nation's federal Constitution, but is more fiercely protected by Montanans through the broader prohibitions contained in Article X, Section 6. Although the Tax Credit Program provides a mechanism of attenuating the tax credit from the SSO's tuition payment to a religiously-affiliated QEP, it does not comport with the constitutional prohibition on indirectly aiding sectarian schools. We conclude, following consideration of both the plain language of the provision and the Delegates' intent as discerned from their discussion when drafting\n   Montana's 1972 Constitution, that such attenuation remains inconsistent with Article X, Section 6 's strict and broad prohibition on aid to sectarian schools. The Tax Credit Program constitutes the precise type of indirect payment the Delegates sought to prohibit in their formulation of Article X, Section 6. Based on the Legislature's definition of QEP, the Department cannot constitutionally implement or administer the Tax Credit Program. Because Senate Bill 410 contained a severability clause,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   we conclude the Tax Credit Program, \u00a7 15-30-3111, MCA, must be severed from the remainder of Part 31, \u00a7\u00a7 15-30-3101 to -3114, MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b6 40 Having concluded the Tax Credit Program violates Article X, Section 6, it is not necessary to consider federal precedent interpreting the First Amendment's less-restrictive Establishment Clause. Conversely, however, an overly-broad analysis of Article X, Section 6, could implicate free exercise concerns. Although there may be a case where an indirect payment constitutes \"aid\" under Article X, Section 6, but where prohibiting the aid would violate the Free Exercise Clause, this is not one of those cases. We recognize we can only close the \"room for play\" between the joints of the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses to a certain extent before our interpretation of one violates the other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <em>\n    III.

An agency cannot transform an unconstitutional statute into a constitutional statute with an administrative rule. It is the Legislature's responsibility to craft statutes in compliance with Montana's Constitution, which it failed to do here.

In such instances, the State incentivizes charitable giving; for example, under \u00a7 15-30-2326, MCA, for every $10 a taxpayer contributes, that taxpayer's tax liability is decreased by $1. The taxpayer, however, still donates $9 out of his or her own pocket. Here, the taxpayer donates none of his or her own funds, but instead dictates where and how a portion of their tax liability is spent.

The question of whether a statute conflicts with a federal or state constitutional provision, whether facially or as applied to a certain factual scenario, is a pure question of law. Whether facially or as applied, a statute either conflicts with a constitutional provision as a matter of law or it does not. Without reference to \"reasonable doubt\" or \"proof,\" the proper standard for reviewing the constitutionality of statutes should be that statutes are presumed constitutional until clearly demonstrated to conflict with a constitutional provision, whether facially or as applied to a particular set of facts.

In context, the constitutional phrase \"appropriation\" from \"any public fund or monies\" narrowly connotes an expenditure or commitment of public money in hand. I further concur that the program does not effect a\n   <em>\n    direct payment\n   </em>\n   from \"any public fund or monies\" as referenced in Article X, Section 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   \u00b6 76 I concur, however, that as applied to religiously-affiliated private\n   schools, the private school tax credit program effects an\n   <em>\n    indirect payment\n   </em>\n   of\n   <em>\n    public monies\n   </em>\n   for a sectarian purpose or to aid schools controlled in whole or in part by a church, religious sect, or religious denomination. Though it does not effect a direct or indirect \"appropriation\" or a direct payment, the program nonetheless diverts, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, funds otherwise earmarked and accrued to the public purse in the form of tax liability independently imposed by law. As applied to religiously-affiliated private schools, the undeniable purpose of the diversion is to further a sectarian purpose-the proliferation of the chosen religious beliefs and values of the participating parents-thereby further aiding private schools controlled in whole or in part by the affiliated church, religious sect, or religious denomination. As noted by the majority and previously by this Court, \"[t]he most effective way to establish any institution is to finance it.\" The private school tax program is a clever, even somewhat ingenious, attempt by the Legislature to have the State provide affirmative financial aid to help parents enroll their children in private schools, not coincidentally including religiously-affiliated private schools. The Legislature attempted to accomplish this manifest objective through the guise of a facially neutral statutory scheme that does not reference religion\n   or religiously-affiliated schools and which directs an administrative agency to administer the scheme in a constitutional manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   \u00b6 77 Plaintiffs assert,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the program does not violate Article X, Section 6, of the Montana Constitution because the purpose and effect of the program is not to further a sectarian purpose or aid religiously-affiliated schools but, rather, merely to facilitate parental educational choice without regard for the choice made. They assert that any secondary benefit to religiously-affiliated schools is only incidental or\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   . Despite the superficial appeal of this argument, closer examination quickly unveils the false distinction on which it is premised. Religiously-affiliated schools exist for the purpose of providing a quality general education, but with a specific emphasis on religious beliefs and values not taught in public schools. It is certainly conceivable that some parents, even though they do not subscribe to the affiliated religion, may nonetheless choose a religiously-affiliated school in pursuit of a quality general education perceived to be unavailable in public schools. However, the obvious and indisputable fact is that most, if not all, parents choose to send their children to a religiously-affiliated school for the specific purpose of educating their children with an emphasis on particular religious beliefs and values not taught in public schools. Providing children with\n   particular religious instruction or emphasis incident to general education unquestionably aids and benefits the exercise and proliferation of those religious beliefs and values-the very\n   <em>\n    raison d'\u00eatre\n   </em>\n   for religiously-affiliated schools. Tuition aids also help maintain enrollment in religiously-affiliated schools, thereby helping facilitate their continued existence and administration. However neutrally characterized, a law diverting money otherwise earmarked and accrued to the public purse to allow parents to choose religiously-affiliated schools is clearly tantamount to an indirect payment of government monies for a sectarian purpose and aids schools controlled in whole or in part by a particular church, religious sect, or religious denomination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   \u00b6 78 As an ancillary matter not necessary to the Court's decision in light of its primary holding, I further concur with the majority that the Department of Revenue exceeded the scope of its administrative rulemaking authority in adopting Rule 1. Regardless of its general charge to the Department to administer the private school tax credit program in a constitutional manner, the Legislature has long provided that administrative agencies have no authority to promulgate rules conflicting with or otherwise limiting a clear and unequivocal statutory provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2-4-305(6), MCA (limiting exercise of delegated administrative rulemaking authority to rules necessary to effect an express or manifest statutory purpose but in a manner consistent and not in conflict with the statutory language and effect).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Mont. Const. art. III, \u00a7 1 (separation of powers between co-equal branches of government). The Legislature put the Department in a hopelessly untenable position-it enacted a facially neutral statutory scheme with obvious application,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , to an unconstitutional purpose and effect, and then inconsistently charged the Department with the task of administering the scheme in a constitutional manner. The only way for the Department to carry out the Legislature's mandate was to administer the program in a manner inconsistent with the manifest intent and express provision of the statute-by declaring the tax credit unavailable to help fund the cost of sending children to religiously-affiliated schools.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   \u00b6 79 I further concur with the Court's implicit holding, and Justice Gustafson's express concurrence, that as applied to religiously-affiliated schools, the private school tax credit program not only violates Article X, Section 6, of the Montana Constitution, but also violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. As applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, the Establishment Clause clearly, broadly,\n   and unequivocally prohibits state governments from \"mak[ing]\" any \"law respecting an establishment of religion....\" U.S. Const. amend. I. As applied to religiously-affiliated schools, and for the same reasons that it violates\n   Article X, Section 6, of the Montana Constitution, the private school tax credit program constitutes a state law \"respecting an establishment of religion.\" Whether viewed objectively or through the subjective view of the churches or religious denominations that provide and control religiously-affiliated schools, the provision of government tuition subsidies, aids, or incentives to facilitate enrollment in those schools is a substantial, if not essential, aid to the proliferation of the affiliated religions and the continued existence and administration of the schools.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   \u00b6 80 Finally, I concur with the majority and Justice Gustafson's concurrence, that as applied to the private school tax credit program as it applies to religiously-affiliated schools, Montana's constitutional prohibition on the indirect payment of public monies for sectarian purposes or to aid schools controlled in whole or in part by a church, religious sect, or denomination does not violate the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. As applied to state governments through the Fourteenth Amendment, the Free Exercise Clause does nothing more than clearly, broadly, and unequivocally prohibit state governments from \"mak[ing]\"\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   \"law ...\n   <em>\n    prohibiting\n   </em>\n   the free exercise\" of religion. U.S. Const. amend. I (emphasis added). Regardless of the increasingly value-driven hairsplitting and overstretching that unnecessarily complicates its modern jurisprudence, the Free Exercise Clause is nothing more than a protective shield against government\n   <em>\n    interference\n   </em>\n   in the free\n   <em>\n    exercise\n   </em>\n   of a citizen's chosen religion or religious views. The Free Exercise Clause is not, nor did the Framers intend it to be, a sword or affirmative right to\n   <em>\n    receive\n   </em>\n   government aid-precisely the manifestly intended purpose and effect of the private school tax credit program as applied to religiously-affiliated schools. Though there may indeed be some room for \"play\" in reconciling the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses, the bottom line is that the Free Exercise Clause only prohibits the government from interfering with the exercise of religious beliefs, practices, and, by extension, related activities and operations of religious and affiliated entities. As applied to the private school tax credit program, Montana's constitutional ban on sectarian aid does not in any way interfere with or otherwise substantially burden the preexisting First Amendment right of parents to send their children to religiously-affiliated schools without government-imposed interference or impediment. Parents who wish to send their children to religiously-affiliated\n   schools can and will continue to do so without government inference or impediment, just as they always have. As applied here, Article X, Section 6, of the Montana Constitution merely prohibits state and local governments from\n   <em>\n    affirmatively promoting or facilitating\n   </em>\n   the exercise of religious beliefs by diverting or foregoing government tax revenue for that purpose. The right to freely exercise religious beliefs without government interference or impediment cannot be reasonably stretched to require the state and its taxpayers to help pay for the exercise of that right through the diversion of otherwise earmarked and accrued government tax revenue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   \u00b6 81 Nor does Montana's broad constitutional ban on sectarian aid\n   <em>\n    unconstitutionally\n   </em>\n   discriminate on the basis of religion. Article X, Section 6 may well have broader application that might be problematic in some other context. But, as specifically applied to the particular private school tax credit at issue and its application to religiously-affiliated schools, Article X, Section 6 does not discriminate against the exercise of religion any more than the First Amendment Establishment Clause already lawfully does, just as intended and expressly provided by the Framers of the United States Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   \u00b6 82 Having greatly benefitted from eight years of attendance in a religiously-affiliated elementary and middle school, I certainly understand the value and import to parents of educating their children with an emphasis on their chosen religious beliefs and values, parents' desire to further the proliferation of those beliefs and values, parents' fundamental right to make that choice for their children without governmental interference or impediment, and the concerted, well-intentioned efforts of powerful social and political forces to advance the proliferation of their respective religious beliefs in our state and\n   country. However, the federal and state constitutional prohibitions on government aid for sectarian purposes respectively embodied in the First Amendment Establishment Clause and Article X, Section 6, of the Montana Constitution do not conflict, and are perfectly consistent, with the fundamental right to freely exercise one's chosen religion. In balanced tandem, the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses form one of the cornerstones upon which our country and federal and state constitutions were founded and framed to the benefit and protection of all-the clear separation of church and state regardless of the will of the majority at any given time.

The Montana Constitutional Convention Delegates, seeking to avoid \"jeopardiz[ing] the precarious historical balance which has been struck between opposing doctrines and countervailing principles,\" Montana Constitutional Convention, Committee Proposals, Feb. 22, 1972, p. 728, preserved the 1889 State Constitution's protection against direct or indirect public funding for sectarian purposes. As the Court accurately observes, other than stylistic changes, the Delegates maintained the language, and thus the meaning, of the 1889 Constitution when they adopted Article X, Section 6. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 21, 25.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court today seeks to outline a logical framework for examining claimed violations of Article X, Section 6, of the Montana Constitution.

Relying in part on the title of Section 6, the Court makes a sweeping statement that the provision broadly prohibits \"aid\" to sectarian schools. Opinion, \u00b6 19. Recognizing the first principle of statutory construction-to examine the plain meaning of the words used, Opinion, \u00b6 18-it nonetheless\n   skips over the words used in Section 6 to divine the Delegates' intent. Throughout the Opinion, the Court then applies its broad construct of \"aid\" to draw conclusions on each element within its outlined framework.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   \u00b6 87 Let's back up a step. Article X, Section 6, says that the government \"shall not make any direct or indirect\n   <em>\n    appropriation or payment from any public fund or monies\n   </em>\n   , or any grant of lands or other property\n   <em>\n    for any sectarian purpose\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    to aid\n   </em>\n   any church, ... or other ... institution, controlled in whole or in part by any church, sect, or denomination.\" (Emphasis added). In purporting to identify the \"three main inquiries\" required in its analysis, the Court applies the sweeping term \"aid\" instead of the textual \"appropriation or payment from any public fund or monies.\" Opinion, \u00b6 20.

It emphasizes that the tax breaks indirectly aid sectarian schools. This argument becomes the lynchpin for the Court's holding. The argument may be correct, as far as it goes.

As the Court observes, the same principles of statutory construction apply when we interpret constitutional provisions. Opinion, \u00b6 18. To invalidate the statute on the basis that it indirectly impacts sectarian schools to the detriment of the public fisc violates ordinary rules of grammar, as it requires reading \"indirect\" to modify \"aid\" rather than \"appropriation or payment.\" The clause, \"any direct or indirect appropriation or payment from any public funds or monies ... for any sectarian purpose or to aid any\" sectarian institutions, contains at least two modifiers of \"appropriation or payment.\" The first, \"direct or indirect,\" modifies the parallel terms \"appropriation or payment.\" It thus prohibits any appropriations or payments, whether direct or indirect. What follows are non-parallel prepositional phrases, which describe from where these appropriations or payments may not be taken-\"any public fund\n   or monies\"-and for what these appropriations or payments may not be used-\"any sectarian purpose\" or \"to aid\" sectarian institutions. The sentence structure means that \"direct or indirect\" modifies \"appropriation or payment,\" and does not modify the non-parallel phrases \"from public funds or monies\" or \"to aid any\" sectarian school.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   \u00b6 93 The funds at issue pass from donor to SSO to student-selected school; they are accounted for in the public fisc by virtue of the dollar-for-dollar offset.\n   <em>\n    Tax Credit\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed. 2014) (defining tax credit as \"[a]n amount subtracted directly from one's total tax liability, dollar for dollar ...\"). Although this may be an indirect\n   <em>\n    transfer of benefit\n   </em>\n   to the student-selected school, the word \"indirect,\" by itself, does not impose a prohibition upon all tax policies merely because they have that indirect effect. Rather, \"indirect\" modifies the subject of the clause, which is the \"payment.\" Thus, the provision prohibits government agencies\n   from making payments from a public fund or monies to religious schools indirectly. In this case, the funds eligible for tax credits are not \"payment from any public fund or monies.\" The creation of the credit is a government's determination\n   <em>\n    not to collect\n   </em>\n   tax revenues. The statute diverts the funds before they ever become public monies. This well may result in an indirect impact on the \"public fund or monies,\" but it is not an indirect payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   \u00b6 94 Under the Tax Credit Program, the funds originate with private donors and are donated to the SSOs, which in turn direct the funds to the student's chosen school as a credit toward the student's obligation. No money originates, is deposited into, or is expended from the state treasury or any public fund. The State never takes \"title\" to the donated money or otherwise possesses it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   \u00b6 95 When this Court struck the property tax levy for private schools in\n   <em>\n    Chambers\n   </em>\n   , it was careful to distinguish its holding from property tax\n   <em>\n    exemptions\n   </em>\n   for religious institutions that had been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Walz\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chambers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5280849\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/155/422/#p436\">\n    155 Mont. at 431-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=472%20P.2d%201013\">\n    472 P.2d at 1018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Delegate Loendorf, sponsor of the proposal to retain the \"indirect\" language that the Convention ultimately adopted, stated that, under his proposal, the provision \"will continue to mean and do whatever it does now,\" expressing an apparent desire to preserve the status quo so recently stated by this Court.

For this reason, the Court's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   to divine a broader meaning is misplaced. The Constitutional Convention record we examined in\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   directly discussed the issue before the Court-the retention of common-law privileges-and contained thorough consideration explaining the Delegates' intention that such privileges would survive the broad language of the public's right to know in Article II, Section 9.\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 20-21. Here, in contrast, the Convention transcript contains zero discussion of the use of, or prohibition against, tax incentives to encourage donations to private schools.

The Court mentions the heightened standard that a facial challenge brings, but falls short of actually analyzing the statute under this standard. Conceivably, the statute would not be applied unconstitutionally if a student chose to apply her scholarship to a non-sectarian private school. In such a case, the tax credits offered under the statute would not offend Article X, Section 6. The Court dismisses any such constitutional applications because the statute contains \"no mechanism\" for the Department to determine whether the money will be used to indirectly pay tuition at sectarian schools. Opinion, \u00b6 36. This conclusion is problematic for at least two reasons. First, no one-not even the Department-argued that every application of the statute was unconstitutional under Article X, Section 6. Rather, the Department instituted Rule 1 to prohibit what it saw as unconstitutional applications of the statute, while still allowing what it saw as constitutional applications to continue to utilize the Tax Credit Program. Second, the Court's holding transforms almost any as-applied challenge into a facial challenge; challenged statutes rarely have a built-in mechanism to sift out unconstitutional applications. The Court notably ignores the statute's severability clause until after it already has thrown out the entire Tax Credit Program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   \u00b6 100 The Court's heavy reliance on\n   <em>\n    Chambers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Opinion, \u00b6 36, fails because that case involved payment from public monies to hire teachers at a parochial high school-a plain violation of the prohibition\n   against \"direct appropriations.\" Even though the teachers were to give \"a standard course of instruction\" at the sectarian school, the public school district had no control over the parochial school, and \"it of necessity must supplement these courses of instruction by those required by the doctrines of the Church.\"\n   <em>\n    Chambers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5280849\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/155/422/#p436\">\n    155 Mont. at 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=472%20P.2d%201013\">\n    472 P.2d at 1020-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It was in this context-public payment of teacher salaries-that the Court concluded the lines between secular and sectarian purposes were impermissibly blurred.

The Opinion contains no other support for its key holding that the Tax Credit Program is an indirect payment of tuition at private, religiously affiliated schools.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   \u00b6 102 This is a problem. First, fiscal notes are prepared by the Governor's Office of Budget and Program Planning, an agency of the Executive Branch, not by the Legislature. Second, a fiscal note is simply the Executive's estimate of revenue and spending impacts based on a series of assumptions made by presumably affected agencies. The Court\n   relies on the Department's fiscal note assumptions to support its conclusion that the statute is facially unconstitutional because of how the agency surmised the tax credit would be used. Those assumptions reflect the Department's advocacy here-that Rule 1 was necessary to save the statute from \"aiding\" sectarian schools.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ,\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Whether the\n   Department's assumptions were well-researched or its predictions accurate is not the point of an inquiry into the constitutionality of the statute. They do not represent the Legislature's rationale for the statute and do not control a facial analysis of the statute's constitutionality. Third, relying on the assumption that many donors who claim the tax credit also will be parents who otherwise would be paying tuition reduces the issue to a purely as-applied challenge. It overlooks the instances in which the Tax Credit Program could constitutionally be applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   \u00b6 103 Its failure to recognize constitutional applications of the statute under Article X, Section 6, undermines the Court's severability analysis, because-focusing only on Article X, Section 6, as the Court does-parts of the law would have valid application. Tax credits could be afforded for donations to private secular schools without running afoul of that section. That said, given its conclusion that the Tax Credit Program violates the prohibition against aid to religious schools, First Amendment considerations may require the Court's ultimate solution here-striking \u00a7 15-30-3111, MCA, in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   \u00b6 104 Quite remarkably, the Court dismisses any Free Exercise Clause concerns by proclaiming simply that \"this is not one of those cases.\" Opinion, \u00b6 40. I do not believe this issue so easily may be discarded. The Department acknowledges this as well, explaining that if the Court holds the Tax Credit Program unconstitutional, \"the only way of respecting both constitutional limits on the State is to invalidate the private school tax-credit program and sever it from the remaining curricular innovation program.\" A State's interest \"in achieving greater separation of church and State than is already ensured under the Establishment Clause of the Federal Constitution [ ] is limited by the Free Exercise Clause.\"\n   <em>\n    Trinity Lutheran\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12605129\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/2012/#p2021\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 2024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Widmar v.

The Plaintiffs gave notice of their challenge, stating \"the Department of Revenue's Rule 1 implementing the [Scholarship] program violates Named Plaintiffs' rights under the Montana and U.S. Constitutions\" and that \"the Department of Revenue's rule is inconsistent with the statutory language and intent.\" In response, the Attorney General elected not to defend the Rule. No challenge to the constitutionality of \u00a7 15-30-3111, MCA, was ever made or noticed and, therefore, the Attorney General was not provided an opportunity to appear and defend its constitutionality. While the State is a party, and therefore, had notice of the proceeding itself, no challenge to the statute was made within the proceeding, and, consequently, the issue was not noticed, briefed, or argued. The Court has raised the constitutionality of the statute\n   <em>\n    sua sponte.\n   </em>\n   Striking a statute under such circumstances, including without notice, briefing or argument, and an opportunity for the parties and Attorney General to argue the issue, is a violation of due process and an inappropriate exercise of the Court's powers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   \u00b6 110 On the merits of its analysis, the Court's conclusions are largely devoid of supporting authority, and I concur with Justice Baker that the Court is not interpreting the Montana Constitution in accordance with established legal principles. Indeed, the Court's interpretation ignores, for the most part, the plain language of the Constitution and our Constitutional history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   \u00b6 111 The Court summarily declares that the subject Scholarship Program \"aids sectarian schools\" in violation of Article X, Section 6, of the Montana Constitution, a conclusion that is factually and legally incorrect. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 16, 28. First, as the Department acknowledges, the Program is facially neutral, and does not require any benefit to accrue to a particular school, religious or otherwise. The Program is voluntary, funded by charitable donations, and, consistent with its stated legislative purpose to promote school choice, is entirely directed by private action, without government direction, as follows: (1) the charitable donor has a choice, first, whether to donate, and, second, whether to donate to the private or to the public school scholarship program, but may not direct contributions to specific schools; (2) the\n   student and parents/guardians choose the qualifying private institution, whether religious or non-religious, which the student will\n   attend and to which a scholarship is directed; and (3) the SSO must direct the scholarship to the institution, religious or non-religious, chosen by the student's family, and may not otherwise reserve or restrict scholarships for use at a particular school. Thus, a religiously-affiliated school cannot be designated by the donor, the SSO, or the government-only by students and their families.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   \u00b6 112 Further, the beneficiary of the Program is not the school, but the student/family receiving the scholarship, because they are relieved of a portion of their financial obligation for the student's attendance at a private school. This is separate from the private school itself, which must be paid the same tuition regardless of any assistance from the Program.

The Program simply creates a neutral opportunity for genuine independent choices of donors and scholarship recipients, and provides that the beneficiaries of the program are the scholarship recipients.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oliver\n   </em>\n   , 368 P.3d at 1277 (upholding a student scholarship program because it was \"completely neutral with regard to religion and that any funds deposited to a sectarian school occur as the sole result of the parent's independent decision completely free from state influence.... The parent,\n   <em>\n    not the State\n   </em>\n   , determines where the scholarship funds will be applied.\") (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   \u00b6 115 Thus, in my view, the Court's conclusion that the Program\n   \"permits the Legislature to indirectly pay\" sectarian schools, Opinion, \u00b6 32, is not supported by the facts here, and, as Justice Baker's dissenting opinion also illustrates, is not supported by the plain language of the Constitution or the history of the Constitutional Convention. This conclusion follows the Department's troubling argument that the Scholarship Program is a \"diversion\" of \"public funds\" by the Legislature. The argument is premised on the Department's theory that the base tax liability each taxpayer will owe to the State on income that the taxpayer will earn should be considered \"public funds,\" and that all tax liability-even potential liability on potential income, before a taxpayer timely completes the tax return process and applies deductions and credits for the entire year-is the property of the State, until such time a proper tax return is filed and the state permits a credit for the year's donations to be made against the taxpayer's liability. The Department's view, that \" '[t]ax expenditures' are monetary subsidies the government bestows on particular individuals or organizations by granting them preferential tax treatment ... the various deductions, credits and loopholes [ ] are just spending by another name,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   might be correct for purposes of internal state government budgeting, \u00a7 5-4-104, MCA, but it is an utter misstatement of the fundamental right of private property ownership. A citizen's income-all income of each year, every year-belongs to the citizen until such time the proper portion thereof becomes owed to the government; the government does not own all income until the citizen demonstrates otherwise. At the time a citizen donates to the Scholarship Program, the tax year has not ended, the donor's total income may not have been earned, the tax return process has not been timely initiated, and the donor's potential tax liability is unknown. The government cannot at that time \"own\" the unknown tax liability as a public fund, or even an asset, regardless of whether the tax credit is \"dollar-for-dollar\" or otherwise, and regardless of the previous year's tax law. \"[U]nder such reasoning all taxpayer income could be viewed as belonging to the state because it is subject to taxation by the legislature.\"\n   <em>\n    Kotterman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"747585\" index=\"233\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/193/273/\">\n    972 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   618 ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ariz.
