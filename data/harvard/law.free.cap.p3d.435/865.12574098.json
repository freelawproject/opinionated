This Court concludes\n   that\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   bars his claims and affirms on those grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ISSUE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b62] In his appeal, Goetzel states the issue(s) as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   The Defendant's motion was barred by res judicata by the District Court. Further the Wyoming Supreme Court barred the Defendant[']s claim in a prior case with similar issues [sic] this is due to ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. More specifically appellate counsel never submitted critical information provided by the defendant, one of the issues relating to the subject of res judicata, as well as ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. However the defendant believes res judicata should not apply in this case because the defendant is filing this appeal under the new Wyoming Statute \u00a7 7-12-401 through 407, 7-6-107, 7-14-103, and 7-14-105\"factual innocence actual innocence.\" The actual issue the Defendant would like to bring to this court[']s attention is the defendant was convicted of a two count violation of Wyoming Criminal Statutes \u00a7 6-5-204 Interference with a peace officer and \u00a7 6-5-207 Escape by violence or assault. The issue before the Court is whether the charging, conviction, or consecutive sentencing of the defendant pursuant to two general statutes for the same conduct subjected him to Double Jeopardy in violation of the Constitutional guarantees of either the Wyoming or United States Constitutions?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The State of Wyoming generally rephrases the issue as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Res judicata\n   </em>\n   bars the relitigation of claims raised and decided in previous criminal proceedings. It also bars litigation of issues that could have been determined in a prior proceeding. The district court determined that\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   barred Goetzel's petition for post-conviction relief because he could have raised his underlying claims earlier. Did the district court err?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b63] This Court previously summarized the relevant background facts as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   While being booked on various charges at the Goshen County Detention Center, Appellant hit the officer in charge, who fell to the floor. Appellant then kicked him in the head, causing severe injuries to the officer. Appellant used the officer's radio to ask for the door to be unlocked. The door was opened, and he fled from the facility, taking the radio with him. He was apprehended six days later in Nebraska. Following his arrest, Appellant was charged with felony interference with a peace officer, felony escape, and felony larceny. About six weeks later, in a separate docket, Appellant was charged with the additional crimes for which he had originally been arrested. Those crimes included possession of a controlled substance, felony larceny, two counts of burglary, and four counts of forgery. Pursuant to a plea agreement, the State dismissed several of the charges and Appellant pled guilty to burglary, forgery, felony larceny, felony escape, and felony interference with a peace officer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Goetzel v.

The district court sentenced Goetzel to concurrent sentences of four-to-seven years of incarceration for burglary and forgery. It also sentenced him to five-to-eight years of incarceration for larceny and nine-to-ten years for escape, to be served concurrently with each other but consecutively to the sentences for burglary and forgery. Finally, the court sentenced Goetzel to nine-to-ten years of incarceration for interference with a peace officer, to be served consecutively to his sentences for larceny and escape. Goetzel did not appeal his judgment and sentence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12346360\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/406/310/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b64] In July 2012, Goetzel filed a\n   <em>\n    Motion For Sentence Reduction\n   </em>\n   , which was denied on its merits.

He argued that his sentences constituted multiple punishments for the same offense, namely conduct that he characterizes as \"one violent escape from county jail.\" The district court denied Goetzel's 2016 motion to correct an illegal sentence on its merits, concluding that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%206-5-204\">\n    Wyo.

He does not challenge on appeal the district court's other two independent grounds for denying his\n    <em>\n     Petition for Post-Conviction Relief under the \"Post-Conviction Determination of Factual Innocence Act\n    </em>\n    .\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Neither Goetzel's motion for sentence reduction, nor his motion for sentence modification, raised double jeopardy issues. He did, however, raise double jeopardy as grounds for his motion to correct an illegal sentence, which was the subject of his previous appeal to this Court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Instead, Goetzel expressly stated that he did not question \"any of the substantive or procedural underpinnings of his original sentence.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    This Court recognizes that there may be occasions where a criminal defendant fails to raise double jeopardy issues in a motion for sentence reduction, brought under W.R.Cr.P. 35(b), within the one-year time limit, which may be brought in a later motion to correct an illegal sentence under W.R.Cr.P. 35(a), with its indefinite time limit. This Court is not called upon at this time to address whether the \"good cause\" exception to the doctrine of\n    <em>\n     res judicata\n    </em>\n    may apply under those circumstances.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
