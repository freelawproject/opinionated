The State's Notice stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Please take notice pursuant to \u00a7 46-13-108, [MCA,] that the State of Montana will seek treatment of [Martin] as a [PFO] as provided in \u00a7 46-18-501 et seq., [MCA ].... The previous felony conviction [criminal possession of dangerous drugs] detailed in the Notice\n   meets the definition required in \u00a7 46-18-501, [MCA ].\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Notice did not indicate whether the State would seek sentencing under \u00a7 46-18-502(1), MCA, or \u00a7 46-18-502(2), MCA. The Notice did not explicitly state that Martin was designated a PFO in his 2012 conviction for criminal possession of dangerous drugs (DC 11 - 0146). However, the State attached the Judgment in Martin's 2012 conviction to the Notice. The Judgment ordered that Martin be \"designated as a [PFO] for sentencing under \u00a7 46-18-501 and \u00a7 46-18-502, MCA.\" At the omnibus hearing, Martin did not challenge the applicability, validity, or accuracy of the 2012 conviction or the PFO designation with that conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b65 On December 23, 2016, the District Court held a change-of-plea hearing. Martin pled guilty to robbery by accountability and assault with a weapon. As part of the plea agreement, Martin admitted that his guilty plea established a violation of the conditions of his sentence in another case, DC 07-0491. The State agreed to dismiss the three misdemeanor charges in the present case and a pending felony charge in another case (DC 16-1208). The State recommended a ten-year sentence on the robbery count and a ten-year sentence on the assault count, with five years suspended, for a total of twenty years with five years suspended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 During the hearing, the District Court instructed Martin that if he were to be designated a PFO on the counts of robbery by accountability and assault with a weapon, Martin would be sentenced to a \"minimum [of] five years in prison up to 100 years in prison....\" Later, the District Court referred to the robbery by accountability charge, saying, \"you are a PFO on that....\" Martin's counsel acknowledged, \"this plea agreement contemplates him being designated a persistent felon.... we've had extensive discussions about the subsequent [PFO] designation that he would be subject to....\" The District Court then accepted Martin's guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67 Following the change-of-plea hearing, Martin was released on bond but twice violated the conditions of his release. As a result, on May 30, 2017, the District Court held a revocation hearing to\n   determine whether Martin's previous sentence should be revoked.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   After determining that revocation was proper, the District Court held a disposition hearing and resentenced Martin. The State revised its sentencing recommendation in DC 16-0639 to fifteen years for the robbery by accountability charge and fifteen years for the assault charge, for a total of thirty years with no time suspended. Martin requested a total sentence of twenty years in DC 16-0639 and for his probation violation sentence in DC 07-0491 to run concurrently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68 After the parties made their sentencing recommendations, the District Court told Martin:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [Y]ou have been designated as a [PFO] in this case. There was no objection raised to the [PFO] status. I note that in our previous case, DC [11 - 0146 in 2012], you were designated and sentenced as a [PFO] in that case ... therefore, pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-501 and -502, [MCA,] you must be sentenced as a [repeat] persistent felony offender, which requires a mandatory minimum of [ten] years on each particular count, and those must run consecutive to any other cases.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b69 Martin objected to being sentenced as a repeat PFO. Martin argued the State failed to provide notice that it would seek that designation, and that based on the State's previous recommendation of five years, the State must have assumed Martin was a \"single PFO,\" not a repeat PFO. Martin requested the District Court sentence him as \"a single PFO, understanding that does not limit what the [District] Court may well do in terms of sentence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b610 The District Court disagreed, concluding that the State provided Martin with sufficient notice that he was a PFO. The District Court further concluded that under the PFO sentencing statute, \u00a7 46-18-502(2), (4), MCA, it did not have discretion to sentence Martin to less than ten years for each felony, and it could not allow the probation violation sentence to run concurrently. After determining that the State's sentencing recommendation was appropriate given the circumstances of the case, the District Court sentenced Martin in DC 16-0639 to the Montana State Prison for fifteen years for the count of robbery by accountability and fifteen years for the count of assault with a weapon, to run consecutively to the robbery count, with credit for time served, for a total of thirty years. Additionally, the District Court sentenced Martin to three years suspended for the probation violation\n   in DC 07-0491, to run consecutively to the thirty-year sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b611 On July 5, 2017, the District Court issued its written judgment, in which it designated Martin a \"Subsequent Persistent Felony Offender\" under \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-501, -502, MCA, for purposes of sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b612 This Court reviews for legality sentences beyond one year of incarceration.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Sentences for repeat PFOs must run\n   <em>\n    consecutively\n   </em>\n   to any other sentences imposed.\n   <em>\n    Gunderson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 48, 55 (affirming a district court's decision sentencing the defendant to both life imprisonment on the charge of\n   attempted sexual intercourse without consent and a term of 100 years as a PFO on the burglary charge) (emphasis in original); \u00a7 46-18-502(4), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b619 The District Court concluded that, based upon Martin's prior felony convictions and PFO designation, it had no alternative but to sentence him under \u00a7 46-18-502(2), MCA, to a minimum of ten years incarceration on both the robbery by accountability and assault charges, and that the sentence must run consecutively to the three-year suspended sentence for his probation violation in DC 07-0491.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b620 Martin argues that the State and the District Court led him to reasonably believe he would be designated a \"regular\" PFO under \u00a7 46-18-502(1), MCA, rather than a \"repeat\" PFO under \u00a7 46-18-502(2), MCA. Martin argues the State did not request a repeat PFO designation, and Martin did not receive notice that he may be sentenced as such. Instead, Martin argues, the District Court made a sua sponte decision during the sentencing hearing to designate Martin as a repeat PFO. This decision violated statutory and constitutional notice requirements and deprived Martin of a meaningful opportunity to challenge the repeat PFO designation. Martin further argues the District Court's designation of Martin as a repeat PFO prejudiced his sentence, evinced by the District Court's conclusion that Martin's thirty-year combined felony sentence and his three-year suspended sentence in DC 07-0491\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   run consecutively, rather than concurrently, to each other. Finally, Martin asks this Court to clarify that \u00a7 46-13-108, MCA, requires notice of when (and whether) the State seeks to designate a defendant as a \"regular\" or \"repeat\" PFO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b621 The State responds that the PFO notice statute, \u00a7 46-13-108, MCA, does not require specificity as to which subsection of the PFO sentencing statute, \u00a7 46-18-502, MCA, will apply at sentencing. Instead, the PFO sentencing statute requires only that the State give notice that the defendant will be sentenced under the PFO sentencing statute, in lieu of the statute that would otherwise apply to the conviction. Finally, the State argues that regardless of which subsection of \u00a7 46-18-502, MCA, applied, the alleged error did not violate Martin's substantial rights because the record does not establish that the District Court's sentence would have been different had Martin not been subject to repeat PFO sentencing. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b622 Section 46-13-108, MCA, required the State to notify Martin that it planned to seek a PFO designation and to specify the alleged prior convictions that formed the basis for the current PFO designation. The Notice that Martin received referenced the 2012 conviction, which first designated Martin a PFO, and stated this was\n   the alleged prior conviction upon which the State was relying for the PFO designation in the present case. Martin acknowledged that the 2012 conviction was specified in the PFO Notice and he does not dispute that he was, in fact, designated a PFO when he was sentenced in 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b623 Section 46-13-108, MCA, does not require the State to specify that it is seeking a \"repeat PFO\" designation. In fact, the sentencing statute does not include such a designation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 46-18-502, MCA. It merely distinguishes between a defendant for whom the State seeks a PFO designation for the first time, versus a defendant for whom the State seeks a PFO designation premised on a previous conviction where a defendant was designated a PFO. Section 46-18-502(1), (2), MCA. In this case, the prior conviction specified in the PFO Notice was a conviction for which Martin was designated a PFO. That was sufficient notice that Martin was a PFO \"at the time of [his] previous felony conviction,\" which placed him under \u00a7 46-18-502(2), MCA, for sentencing purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 46-18-502(2), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b624 The purpose of the PFO notice statute is to provide a defendant with the opportunity\n   to challenge the previous conviction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 46-13-108, MCA ;\n   <em>\n    Dist. Ct. of the Eighteenth Jud. Dist.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 49. Martin was afforded such an opportunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gallagher\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 32 ;\n   <em>\n    Minez\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 39. Martin knew of his previous felony conviction, that he was designated a PFO for that previous felony conviction, and that this was the conviction upon which the State was seeking a PFO designation in the current case. Martin did not object to that previous PFO designation, and he did not contest the validity of the underlying conviction. The District Court correctly concluded Martin received adequate notice under the requirements of \u00a7 46-13-108, MCA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ariegwe\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 174-75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b625 Martin satisfied all the requirements to be sentenced under \u00a7 46-18-502(2), MCA : (1) robbery by accountability and assault with a weapon are both felonies within the meaning of \u00a7 45-2-101(23), MCA\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; (2) Martin was previously designated a PFO; (3) less than five years had elapsed between his 2012 felony conviction for which he was designated a PFO and the present felony offenses; (4) Martin was over twenty-one years of age when he committed the present offense; and (5) Martin was not pardoned, and his sentence was not commuted. Section 46-18-502, MCA ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 46-18-501, MCA. Thus, the District Court correctly concluded that it had no choice but to sentence Martin pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-502(2), (4), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b626 Martin's argument that he was prejudiced by his improper designation as a repeat PFO also fails. Martin acknowledges that it was well within the District Court's discretion and statutory mandates to impose the sentence it did.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ariegwe\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 174. The District Court correctly determined that it was mandated to follow the sentencing requirements of \u00a7 46-18-502, MCA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DeWitt\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 11. Accordingly, the District Court correctly determined that, based on the past felonies and previous PFO designation, it had no discretion but to sentence Martin under \u00a7 46-18-502(2), (4), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b627 Finally, Martin raises several additional claims of due process violation, all of which are premised on the State's alleged failure to provide notice of which sentence Martin might receive and on the District Court's ultimate sentencing decision. Because we hold Martin received adequate notice prior to sentencing that the State planned to seek PFO designation in this case, we decline to address Martin's due process claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b628 The District Court did not err when it sentenced Martin as a repeat PFO under \u00a7 46-18-502(2), MCA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ariegwe\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 174-75.
