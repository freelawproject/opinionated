In this proceeding, petitioner argues, and the superintendent concedes, that the post-conviction court exceeded the scope of remand by revisiting the issue of whether trial counsel failed to exercise reasonable professional skill and judgment instead of addressing the issue of prejudice under the correct standard. For the reasons set out below, we agree with the parties that the post-conviction court exceeded the scope of remand and we remand again to the post-conviction court to determine whether trial counsel's deficient performance prejudiced petitioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Our first opinion set out the circumstances of petitioner's conviction and petition for post-conviction relief:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   \"Petitioner was convicted in a bench trial of nine counts of robbery-three counts of first-degree robbery and six counts of second-degree robbery. The trial court sentenced him to a sum of 40 years' incarceration. It did so by imposing consecutive sentences on five of the counts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \"Petitioner seeks post-conviction relief on the ground that he received inadequate and ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing, in violation of his rights under Article I, section 11, [of the Oregon Constitution] and the Sixth Amendment [to the United States Constitution]. Specifically, he contends that, by failing to present a mitigation case at sentencing, his trial counsel performed below constitutional standards, and that his trial counsel's deficient performance prejudicially affected the trial court's sentencing decision. To prove this claim, petitioner introduced affidavits from friends and family members, and presented live testimony from a legal expert and a neuropsychological expert.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \"The post-conviction court was persuaded by petitioner's evidence that trial counsel performed deficiently by not presenting mitigation evidence at petitioner's sentencing.

Both parties argue that we can, and should, decide the issue of prejudice in this appeal. For his part, petitioner asserts that the post-conviction court failed to address the substantial mitigation evidence presented during the post-conviction hearing and that, had it done so, it would have been required to order petitioner resentenced. The superintendent remonstrates that we should conclude that petitioner failed to prove prejudice because \"none of the affidavits or sworn testimony indicate that the witnesses were available or would have given statements consistently with their post-conviction testimony\" and, in any event, petitioner was not prejudiced given the substance of the proffered testimony. Although we agree with the parties that the determination of whether petitioner was prejudiced by trial counsel's deficient performance is a question of law that we may address on appeal, we decline to do so for the following reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   First, on remand, the post-conviction court will be able to exercise its discretion to determine whether to make a determination about prejudice on the existing record or reopen the record for the parties to present additional evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12565148\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/412/1199/#p828\">\n    289 Or.
