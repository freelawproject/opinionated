NDL asserts that it was denied due process by the entry of a temporary injunction without an evidentiary hearing, and that the temporary injunction was improperly granted under the facts presented. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 Waveland instituted an action against NDL seeking a money judgment and declaratory judgment related to the Restated and Amended Eight East Participation Agreement (Participation Agreement) between the parties. Under the Participation Agreement, the Eight East Participants, who include Waveland, sell gas from wells to the first purchaser of gas, who then remits payment to NDL as contract operator of the wells. NDL is required to remit the gas sales payments to the Eight East Participants, including Waveland, their royalty owners, and the State of Oklahoma for gross production taxes. In July of 2014, NDL was removed as operator of the gathering system by a majority vote of the participants. NDL continues to serve as contract operator of wells under the Participation Agreement, but was notified in January 2016 that its right \"to market, collect the revenues from the Gas (including natural gas liquid hydrocarbons and oil separated at the wellhead or collected along the Gathering System) and to distribute the net proceeds therefrom\" was terminated by the agreement of a majority of the Participants. NDL was also notified that the parties had agreed that Hunton would take over its obligations. Hunton then began selling condensate collected from the Gathering System to Enerfin. When NDL learned of the agreement with Enerfin, it demanded that Hunton deliver the proceeds received on condensate sales to NDL so that the proceeds could be disbursed to the participants and royalty owners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b63 NDL withheld from natural gas proceeds which were held in trust for Waveland $70,000.00, the amount that it estimated due for condensate sales in the month of September 2016. Waveland claimed that NDL then threatened to distribute the $70,000.00 to third parties, including other working interest owners, royalty owners, and the Oklahoma Tax Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b64 Waveland sought and obtained an emergency\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   restraining order (TRO) on November 20, 2016, precluding NDL from distributing the amount \"offset\" from Waveland proceeds and from making further offsets. NDL filed an objection and motion to vacate the TRO, and issued a notice of hearing for November 28, 2016. Hearings were held on November 28, December 2, and December 6, 2016. A temporary injunction was issued in favor of Waveland on December 10, 2016. NDL appeals from this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 An action involving the grant or denial of injunctive relief is equitable in nature.

Waveland argues that NDL's propositions of error relative to the TRO are improperly raised because a TRO is not an appealable order. In its brief, NDL argues that the TRO should be vacated. However, Waveland is correct in its assertion that a temporary restraining order loses its force once a temporary injunction is acted upon by the court.\n   <em>\n    Jennings v.

Rather, it sets forth the requirement that a hearing be set at the earliest possible time. Furthermore, the Oklahoma statutes regarding injunctions, 12 O.S. \u00a7 1381\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , do not contain any provision mandating an evidentiary hearing. It is within the trial court's discretion to determine whether a temporary injunction will be decided on pleadings and affidavits.

The TRO was issued on November 10, 2016. Following the issuance of the TRO, NDL filed an objection to the emergency TRO, a motion to vacate the TRO, and a notice of hearing on that response was issued by NDL on November 10, 2016 for a November 28 hearing. In its objection, NDL stated that Waveland was not \"entitled to the equitable relief of a preliminary injunction,\" and requested that Waveland's \"request for injunctive relief\" be denied. At the November 28 hearing, the court announced that the parties were present on the \"show cause as to whether a temporary injunction should be entered,\" as well as NDL's motion to vacate the TRO. No objection was made regarding the type of proceeding or issues before the court on November 28, 2016. The parties returned on December 2, 2016 to discuss whether they had reached an agreed order, and to determine whether the court would make a ruling at that time. Likewise, no objection was made at this hearing. Finally, the parties came before the court for a third time on December 6, 2016 to finalize the issues. The parties indicated that they did not reach an agreement, and the court indicated that it would enter an injunction. NDL objected to the court's procedure at that time.

To obtain a temporary injunction, a plaintiff must show that four factors weigh in their favor: 1) the likelihood of success on the merits; 2) irreparable harm to the party seeking the relief if the injunction is denied; 3) their threatened injury outweighs the injury the opposing party will suffer under the injunction; and 4) the injunction is in the public interest.\n   <em>\n    Edwards v.

However, pursuant to\n   60 O.S. \u00a7\u00a7 175.57 (B) (2) and (3), a trial court may enjoin a trustee from committing a breach of trust, and may also \"compel the trustee to redress a breach of trust by payment of money or otherwise.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b615 Waveland asserted below that NDL was required, under the Participation Agreement, to establish and maintain a separate account for the sole purpose of maintaining and disbursing revenues to the participants in their proportionate share of revenues. Waveland further asserts that as a custodian and fiduciary of the account for the exclusive benefit of the participants, NDL was not entitled to disburse the funds outside of the terms of the agreement. NDL argued that an injunction would change the status quo because it would allow Hunton to distribute revenue to the Waveland entities instead of NDL. It also argues that Waveland failed to establish a probability of success on the merits and irreparable harm sufficient to warrant injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b616 The trial court found that if not enjoined, NDL would distribute the revenue payments, as condensate sales proceeds, to the Participants and their royalty owners, and will pay gross production taxes on a $70,000.00 fictional sales amount. If the funds were distributed, the court noted, the owners and the State of Oklahoma would be \"grossly overpaid\" based upon actual sales at the sole cost of Waveland and to the confusion of all owners and the Oklahoma Tax Commission. The court further noted that these payments would be duplicative of other's payments of actual condensate sales proceeds received. The court ultimately found that Waveland had shown a likelihood of success on the merits, that there would be no harm to NDL if the order was entered, that an injunction is in the public interest and that it is necessary to safeguard Waveland's property from being used, transferred, diverted, distributed, paid or commingled without Waveland's consent and to its detriment, and that if NDL were to pay out the funds, it would be a breach of an express trust which may be enjoined under 60 O.S. \u00a7 175.57 without a showing of irreparable harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b617 We disagree with NDL's contention that injunctive relief was improperly granted because it would change the status quo.

However, we note that NDL has failed to present any argument or authority in support of the contention that there was no showing of a likelihood of success on the merits except for asserting a lack of evidence. NDL has argued that the court's interpretation fails to apply the entire contract, without showing where in the record this is the case. It is not the appellate court's duty to search the record for evidence to support a party's position. In interpreting the Participation Agreement, the court found that NDL proceeds as a fiduciary and in trust for Waveland, and based upon our review of the record, we cannot say that this was an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Girdner v.

We also agree with the trial court that NDL may be enjoined pursuant to 60 O.S. \u00a7 175.57 without a showing of irreparable harm; this section allows a trial court to enjoin a trustee from committing a breach of trust, as well as compel a trustee to redress a breach of trust by payment of money or otherwise. A statutory basis for injunctive relief is governed by the requirements of the statute, and express statutory language supersedes common-law requirements. 42 Am.Jur.2d \u00a7 25. Finally, we note that the court could have relied upon evidence of irreparable harm anyway, due to the complex accounting which would be required if NDL's actions had not been enjoined, the potential for duplicative and incorrect payments to be made, as well as a possibility of having to pursue the numerous transferees who receive the incorrect payments\n   from NDL.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thompson v.
