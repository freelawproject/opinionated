We hold when a marital separation agreement is presented to the superior court under Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") section 25-317, the superior court must determine whether the agreement is enforceable, and if the agreement is enforceable, determine whether it is \"unfair.\" We also hold that parties to a separation agreement may consider their sole and separate property when creating an agreement, and if they do so, the superior court also may consider the parties' sole and separate property in determining whether the agreement is unfair under A.R.S. \u00a7 25-317. We emphasize, however, that this is so only if they have acted with full knowledge of the nature of the property involved, including knowing whether the property at issue is a community or separate asset. For the following reasons, we reverse and remand the decree in this case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 Husband and Wife were married in 1978. On June 3, 2013, after individually consulting with attorneys, they signed a Marriage Separation Agreement (the \"Agreement\") to divide their property and debts. The Agreement stated Husband \"will remain\" in their marital residence and the parties \"agreed upon a division of all assets, owned or possessed by them as marital property or separate property ... [and] are in possession of all of those assets to which he or she is respectively entitled.\" The parties also agreed that any \"debt accumulated as of the date of this Agreement is the debt of the individual party, regardless if the debt was incurred as a result of joint credit.\" The Agreement did not specifically reference any other assets or debts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 The parties have raised arguments regarding two significant assets. The first asset is the parties' home. Approximately one month before signing the Agreement, the house was appraised at $257,500. Around the time the Agreement was signed, Wife quit-claimed all right, title, or interest in the house to Husband. Husband refinanced the house, and the same day the parties signed the Agreement, Husband transferred $127,435 to Wife, approximately one-half of the house's equity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 The other significant asset is Wife's 401(k) account. After the parties married, Wife began working for an airline and in April 2013, her 401(k) was valued at $152,122. On June 3, 2013, in a separate document, Husband quit-claimed all right, title, or interest in Wife's 401(k) to Wife \"as her sole and separate property.\" It is unclear why the parties used a \"quit-claim deed\" to transfer Husband's interest in Wife's 401(k), but Husband testified he knew that by signing the document he was giving up his rights to Wife's 401(k).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 The Agreement, however, did not reference Wife's 401(k) account or the equity in the community home. The Agreement also did not reference a monthly benefit payment Husband receives from the military related to his service before the parties married. The parties and the superior court referred to Husband's military benefit as both a disability payment and a pension. Regardless of the type of military benefit, both parties agree on appeal the benefit is Husband's sole and separate property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 More than three years after Husband and Wife signed the Agreement and the \"quit claim deeds,\" Husband petitioned for dissolution of the marriage. Neither party sought spousal maintenance and they do not have any minor children; therefore, the only issue before the court was division of the parties' assets and debts. In his petition, Husband admitted that the parties entered into the Agreement, but alleged that provisions of the Agreement were not fair and equitable. At an evidentiary hearing, Husband argued the Agreement unfairly and inequitably divided the parties' home and Wife's 401(k) because Wife received approximately half the equity in the house and all of her 401(k) account. Husband claimed he was entitled to fifty percent of the value of Wife's 401(k) as of the date the parties signed the Agreement, plus\n   any increase in value he would have obtained from his share between that date and the termination of the community estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 Following the evidentiary hearing, the superior court entered a decree of dissolution. The court found the parties freely, knowingly, and voluntarily entered into the Agreement, and that the Agreement was valid and binding and fairly and equitably divided the community property and debts as of June 3, 2013. The court then incorporated the Agreement into the decree. The court affirmed the house as Husband's separate property pursuant to the Agreement; affirmed the payment of $127,435 to Wife as her share of the community interest in the house; and awarded Wife her 401(k), with Husband having no claim to the account. The court confirmed Husband's \"military pension\" was his sole and separate property, with Wife having no claim to the benefit. The court also distributed the parties' community debts and other community assets, including household furnishings, cars, life insurance policies, and bank accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68 Pursuant to Arizona Rules of Family Law Procedure 82 and 83,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Husband moved to correct the findings of fact, for an amended judgment, and for a new trial. The court denied the motions. Husband timely appealed, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-120.21(A)(1) and -2101(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Finding Wife's testimony about discussions between the parties to be credible, the court also found that \"when the parties entered into the [Agreement], they had full knowledge of the community property in their respective possession. In addition, the totality of the evidence showed that the parties held deliberative discussions about the distribution of the community property.\" We agree that the evidence presented shows the parties had a binding agreement regarding the disposition of some assets listed in the decree, including their vehicles, life insurance policies, and bank accounts.

Husband and Wife both testified it was their understanding Husband would \"keep\" the house and that Wife would keep her 401(k). And yet, Wife also received $127,435-approximately one-half of the house's equity. Husband testified he paid Wife one-half of the house's equity, not because that was what the parties agreed to, but because a mortgage advisor told him to do so for liability purposes. Wife, meanwhile, testified that she was not involved in Husband's refinancing of the house; when she was preparing the Agreement she was unaware of Husband's actions related to the house; and it was Husband's choice to pay her a share of the house's equity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b614 Consistent with Wife's testimony, she argues on appeal that Husband \"gifted\" her the equity in the house.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Wife maintains that Husband's intent to gift her a portion of the equity in the home was outside the scope of the Agreement.

He posits that there is no authority permitting the superior court to consider one spouse's sole and separate property in determining whether a separation agreement is unfair. We agree with Husband that his military benefit is his sole and separate property because his military service occurred before the parties' marriage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 25-213(A).

Husband is correct that the superior court may only \"assign\" each spouse his or her own separate property when it is distributing property in a divorce proceeding pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 25-318(A). However, A.R.S. \u00a7 25-317 does not limit parties who enter into a separation agreement to only considering community property. Rather, \"[t]o promote amicable settlement of disputes between parties to a marriage attendant on their separation or the dissolution of their marriage,\" under A.R.S. \u00a7 25-317(A), \"the parties may enter into a written separation agreement containing provisions for disposition of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   property owned by either of them.\" (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, we hold a separation agreement may be based on one or both party's separate property if the parties intend to do so when arriving upon the settlement agreement, and the resulting agreement is not unfair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b621 Husband also argues the superior court erred by considering his military benefit based on A.R.S. \u00a7 25-318.01, which provides that when making a property disposition, a court cannot \"[c]onsider any federal disability benefits awarded to a veteran for service-connected disabilities\" pursuant to certain portions of the United States Code. We agree the superior court may not consider such federal disability benefits when it is distributing community property under A.R.S. \u00a7 25-318, but A.R.S. \u00a7 25-317 does not prohibit parties from considering such benefits when entering into a separation agreement nor does it limit the court from considering the parties' intentions when determining whether the agreement is unfair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b622 However, when entering into a separation agreement, as a \"built-in safeguard[ ],\"\n   <em>\n    In re Harber's Estate\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"630133\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/104/79/#p88\">\n    104 Ariz. 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 88,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"630133\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/104/79/#p88\">\n    449 P.2d 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 16 (1969), parties must act with \"full knowledge of the property involved and [their] rights therein,\"\n   <em>\n    Wick v.

Wife testified she and Husband discussed his military benefit and her 401(k) and that Husband thought it was fair for him to keep his military benefit and her to keep her 401(k) because that is Wife's only retirement account. The superior court noted this testimony and found \"[i]t is quite likely that [Husband] will receive far more from his pension than [Wife] will receive from her 401k over the respective parties' lives. In fact, from June 3, 2013 to the time of trial, [Husband] has received approximately $143,000.00 solely from his military pension.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b624 Husband and Wife could have believed it was \"fair\" for Husband to keep his military benefit in exchange for Wife keeping her 401(k) and could have agreed to such terms, despite Husband's military benefit\n   being his separate property. However, on appeal Husband asserts he was unaware his military benefit was his sole and separate property until he hired an attorney and petitioned for dissolution, more than three years after he signed the Agreement. Wife testified at trial she understood that Husband's military benefit predated their marriage and was his sole and separate property. But there is nothing in the record showing Husband knew his military benefit was his sole and separate property when he and Wife entered into the Agreement or that he understood Wife did not have a community interest in his benefit. Accordingly, on remand the superior court must determine whether the Agreement was \"unfair\" considering the lack of agreement regarding the equity issue in the marital home, and whether Husband acted with full knowledge of his separate property rights in his military benefit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 25-317(B).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Superior Court Erred by Considering Equitable Defenses Not Raised by the Parties.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b625 Husband also argues the superior court erred by finding that Wife had equitable defenses of laches, ratification, and detrimental reliance. The court found that Husband relied on the Agreement to relieve him of a tax debt that would have been a community debt but for the existence of the Agreement and waited more than three years to challenge the Agreement. The court further found that Wife relied to her detriment on the Agreement \"by expending the majority of the funds she received [from the home equity payment] pursuant to the division of property and debts, as confirmed by the [Agreement], without any formal or legal objection to the [Agreement] for over three years.\" Without making any further findings, the court found the equitable defenses precluded Husband's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b626 The superior court erred to the extent it relied on equitable defenses. \"Every defense, in law or fact, to a claim for relief in any pleading, shall be asserted in the response if one is required.\" Ariz. R. Fam. Law P. 32(B). Wife, however, did not assert or argue equitable defenses to Husband's claims before the superior court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Husband testified the parties operated under the Agreement for three-and-a-half years and that in a filing with the Internal Revenue Service he referenced some of the parties' actions around the time the Agreement was signed. But Husband's testimony did not establish that he received a benefit from, or that Wife relied to her detriment on, the IRS filing. Likewise, Wife testified about what she did with some of the home equity money she received, but the fact that she used the money to invest in certain assets does not establish an equitable defense. And, beyond that testimony, no other significant evidence was presented at trial regarding the elements of the equitable defenses found by the court. Therefore, the superior court erred by finding equitable defenses precluded Husband's claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed v.
