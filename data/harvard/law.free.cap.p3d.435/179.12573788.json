In the request, JRRN also asked the City to provide the documents at no charge. The City granted the document request, but denied JRRN's fee waiver request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 2 JRRN appealed the City's fee waiver denial to the City Records Appeals Board, which ruled in JRRN's favor. The City appealed that decision to the State Records Committee, which also ruled in favor of JRRN. The City then petitioned for judicial review of these administrative orders in the district court. The court ruled in favor of the City, concluding its fee waiver denial was reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 3 JRRN challenges a number of the district court's procedural and substantive rulings. We conclude that the court conducted the review contemplated by the Government Records Access and Management Act (GRAMA). And while we find that the court did make some procedural errors, each was harmless. Accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 4 JRRN is a coalition of individuals and organizations committed to restoring and preserving the Jordan River and the surrounding area. When JRRN's founder, Jeff Salt, learned of the City's plan to develop a sports complex along the river in Salt Lake County, he was concerned. He ultimately came to oppose the plan altogether.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 5 To obtain information about the project, JRRN filed somewhere between five to twenty GRAMA requests with the City. The City provided \"roughly 700 pages of records\" to JRRN free of charge. However, JRRN did not find this information to be sufficient and filed an extensive and detailed GRAMA request on March 10, 2010, that effectively sought every document related to the project. This is the request at issue in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 6 In this request, JRRN asked for \"all records in the City's possession that related to the Project,\" including \"all agreements related to the Project, all correspondence and meeting information, all site selection analysis, all budgets, and all engineering plans.\" Some of the records sought had already been provided in response to JRRN's earlier requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7 JRRN also asked the City to waive any fee associated with producing the records. Salt justified the fee waiver request by including on the request form: \"nonprofit organization, information for public good and education, not used for profit.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 8 While the City agreed to provide JRRN with the documents it had requested, it denied the fee waiver request. By letter, the City informed JRRN that the estimated cost of providing the requested records would be two hundred dollars, and JRRN would have to pay that amount \"before any response to the GRAMA request [could] begin.\" In the same letter, the City informed JRRN that it could appeal the City's decision to the City Records Appeals Board.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 9 JRRN did so. After a hearing, the City Records Appeals Board agreed with JRRN, and ordered the City to provide the requested records without charge. The Appeals Board also found that the request was \"voluminous.\" The result of this finding was to extend the period of time in which the City was required to fulfill the request from ten business days to forty-five days from the date of the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 10 Both parties appealed to the State Records Committee. JRRN appealed the Appeals Board's finding that the request was voluminous and the City cross-appealed the determination that JRRN was entitled to a fee waiver. After a hearing, the Records Committee denied the City's cross-appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 11 The City filed a petition for judicial review in the district court of the orders of both the Appeals Board and the Records Committee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   After some initial motion practice followed by a significant period of inactivity, the parties eventually exchanged initial disclosures, engaged in fact discovery, and JRRN disclosed an expert witness. Both sides then filed motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 12 JRRN argued that the City's petition for judicial review should be dismissed because it lacked standing to appeal the decision of its own City Records Appeals Board and its internal appeals process did not strictly comply with the GRAMA statute. The district court denied JRRN's motion. But the court partially granted the City's motion, entering summary judgment against JRRN on each of its counterclaims. However, the court found that there were \"factual issues as to whether the City's decision to deny the fee waiver was reasonable.\" Accordingly, the court could not grant summary judgment on that claim and informed the\n   parties that it would resolve the issue in a trial\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 13 The City then filed a motion asking the court to determine what the standard of review would be and which party would have the burden of proof at the trial\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   . In a written order, the court ruled that the burden of going forward would be on \"Respondents [JRRN] as the party seeking relief in the form of a Court-ordered fee waiver from the City.\" The court stated that it would review \"the City's decision to deny the fee waiver and not the decision or proceedings of the City Appeals Board and State Records Committee.\" The court further explained: \"At this state of review, those proceedings are not relevant. The evidence cannot be limited to the record before the State Records Committee because there is not a record.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 14 After conducting the trial\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , the district court upheld the City's decision to deny the fee waiver. The court issued detailed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, and ultimately held that \"the City was entitled to charge for the costs of [fulfilling the GRAMA Request].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 15 JRRN then filed this appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   JRRN asserts that the court should have granted summary judgment against the City because it did not have standing to petition for judicial review, and its internal appeals procedure did not strictly comply with the GRAMA statute. JRRN also argues the court should not have granted summary judgment against it on its counterclaims. With regard to the bench trial, JRRN contends that the court: (1) should have limited its review to the administrative record rather than considering new evidence, (2) applied the wrong standard of review, (3) should have assigned the burden of proof to the City, and (4) misapplied the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 16 We have jurisdiction to hear this case pursuant to Utah Code section 78A-3-102(3)(j).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 17 JRRN raises a number of legal issues that we review for correctness, without any deference to the holdings of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 18 Regarding our review of the district court's ruling against JRRN on summary judgment, \"the district court's legal conclusions and ultimate grant or denial of summary judgment are reviewed for correctness.\"\n   <em>\n    Massey v.

Finally, we assess whether the court correctly applied GRAMA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   I. SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    A. Standing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 23 JRRN claims the district court should have granted summary judgment against the City because the City lacked standing to petition for judicial review. JRRN reasons that the City should not have been allowed to appeal the decision of its own City Records Appeals Board, so the City lost standing after that point in the proceedings. Before addressing this argument, it is helpful to review the avenues GRAMA establishes for appealing the denial of a fee waiver request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 24 GRAMA permits a governmental entity to charge a reasonable fee to recoup the actual cost of providing records in response to a GRAMA request. UTAH CODE \u00a7 63G-2-203(1) (2010). But the statute encourages entities to fulfill a record request without charge when \"releasing the record primarily benefits the public rather than a person,\" among other reasons.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8459232\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/143/268/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 63G-2-203(4)(a). This statutory language gives a government entity discretion-it\n   <em>\n    encourages\n   </em>\n   but does not mandate an entity to waive its costs when a request benefits the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 25 But despite the discretionary nature of this provision, a requester who believes a government entity's fee waiver denial was unreasonable can challenge the denial in the same way a person appeals the denial of a record request.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8459232\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/143/268/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 63G-2-203(6)(a). First, the requester can appeal the denial to the entity's chief administrative officer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8459232\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/143/268/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 63G-2-401. If the chief administrative officer denies the request, the requester may appeal the denial to the State Records Committee,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8459232\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/143/268/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 63G-2-403, or petition for judicial review in the district court,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8459232\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/143/268/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 63G-2-404.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 26 GRAMA also allows, but does not require, a political subdivision such as the City to adopt its own internal appeals process.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8459232\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/143/268/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 63G-2-701. The City did this and created the City Records Appeals Board.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH, CODE \u00a7 2.64.140 (2010). Any appeal from an appeals board established by a political subdivision is to be by petition for judicial review to the district court. UTAH CODE \u00a7 63G-2-701(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 27 A political subdivision may also provide an additional level of administrative review to the State Records Committee.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8459232\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/143/268/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 63G-2-701(5). Any party to that proceeding may petition for judicial review to the district court.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8459232\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/143/268/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 63G-2-404(1)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 28 In this case, the City had not designated a chief administrative officer, so JRRN's initial appeal was to the City Records Appeals Board. Both parties appealed from the Appeals Board to the Records Committee. After the Records Committee found in favor of JRRN, the City petitioned for judicial review in the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 29 JRRN argues that the City did not have standing to petition for judicial review\n   because it should not have been allowed to challenge the decision of its own City Records Appeals Board. Essentially JRRN argues that, although it appealed part of the decision of the Appeals Board to the State Records Committee, the City should not have been allowed to do the same. And because the City should not have been permitted its intermediate appeal to the State Records Committee, its standing here is compromised. We reject this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 30 First, nothing in GRAMA prevents a city from appealing a decision made by a municipal-level appeals board. Section 701 governs a political subdivision's internal appeals process, if it adopts one. The provision discussing appeals from a municipal appeals board does not limit which parties are permitted to appeal. It directs: \"Appeals of the decisions of the appeals boards established by political subdivisions shall be by petition for judicial review to the district court.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 63G-2-701(6). The sentence does not contain a subject limiting who can appeal the decisions of municipal appeals boards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 31 This provision also instructs that a judicial review proceeding should be in accordance with sections 402 and 404 of GRAMA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8459232\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/143/268/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 63G-2-701(6). Neither section prohibits the City from challenging a decision of the Appeals Board.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8459232\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/143/268/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 63G-2-402, -404. JRRN points to section 402(1) as limiting the City's right to appeal because it specifies that a \"requester\" may petition for judicial review if a chief administrative officer of a governmental entity denies a records request. But this case does not involve a denial from a chief administrative officer, so that section does not govern here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 32 And it makes sense that GRAMA allows only a requester to appeal a decision of a chief administrative officer but does not similarly limit who may appeal a decision of a municipal appeals board. A chief administrative officer is employed by and, in this context, speaks for the government entity. If GRAMA permitted a city to appeal a decision of its chief administrative officer, the city would effectively be appealing itself. But a municipal appeals board is different. Section 701 requires such a board to include one government employee and two public members.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8459232\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/143/268/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 63G-2-701(5). It is designed to have some independence from the governmental entity that created it. So it is logical that the legislature would permit a city to appeal from its municipal appeals board but not its chief administrative officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 33 The plain language of GRAMA reveals that it does not limit which parties may appeal decisions of a municipal appeals board. And although the City established its internal appeals process, including the City Records Appeals Board, the City and the Appeals Board are not the same entity.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Salt Lake City Corp. v. Haik\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6914012\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/334/490/\">\n    2014 UT App 193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6914012\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/334/490/\">\n    334 P.3d 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

JRRN asserts that the court should have: (1) conducted a non-deferential review of the Records Committee's decision instead of reviewing the decision of the City for an abuse of discretion, (2) assigned the burden of proof to the City rather than JRRN, and (3) confined its review to the administrative record below rather than accepting new evidence. Finally, JRRN argues that the court's legal analysis was insufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    A. Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 42 JRRN argues that the court should have conducted a non-deferential review of the State Records Committee's decision rather than reviewing the City's decision for an abuse of discretion. JRRN is not wrong, but it mischaracterizes the standard of review the district court employed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 43 When a petition for judicial review under GRAMA arrives in the district court after a proceeding in the Records Committee, the text of GRAMA does direct the court\n   to review the Records Committee's decision. Section 403, which outlines the procedure the Records Committee follows when it receives a GRAMA appeal, directs the Committee to include in its order \"a statement that any party to the proceeding before the records committee may appeal\n   <em>\n    the records committee's decision\n   </em>\n   to [the] district court.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 63G-2-403(12)(c) (2010) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 44 And section 404, which addresses judicial review in the district court, explains that \"[a]ny party to a proceeding before the records committee may petition for judicial review by the district court\n   <em>\n    of the records committee's order\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6993936\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/222/55/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 63G-2-404(1)(a) (emphasis added). This section also instructs a petitioner to include \"a copy of the records committee order from which the appeal is taken\" with its complaint.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6993936\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/222/55/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 63G-2-404(3)(b). This provision would not make sense if the Records Committee's order was irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 45 Thus, the plain language of the statute makes clear that when a petition for judicial review makes its way to the district court by way of the Records Committee, it is the Records Committee's decision that the district court should review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 46 However, the court does not give the Records Committee's decision any deference. GRAMA instructs the district court to \"make its decision\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6993936\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/222/55/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 63G-2-404(7)(a).\n   <em>\n    De novo\n   </em>\n   means \"anew.\"\n   <em>\n    De Novo\n   </em>\n   , BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (10th ed. 2014). In practice, this means the district court must make its own, independent determination of whether the governmental entity's fee waiver decision was reasonable-with no deference to the Committee's decision. To do this, the court must make its own assessment of the City's denial. And that is precisely what the district court did here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 47 As JRRN points out, the district court did expressly rule that it was reviewing the decision of the City, not the State Records Committee. And that was incorrect. But in this context, that is a distinction without a difference. The district court conducted the review contemplated by GRAMA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 48 JRRN claims that the court incorrectly assessed the City's decision under an abuse of discretion standard. But this misunderstands the court's review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 49 Rather, the court analyzed the City's denial in light of the fee waiver provisions of GRAMA, which give the City great discretion in choosing whether to waive a fee. The provisions provide:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   (1) A governmental entity\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   charge a reasonable fee to cover the governmental entity's actual cost of providing a record.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   (4) A governmental entity\n   <em>\n    may fulfill a record request without charge\n   </em>\n   and is\n   <em>\n    encouraged\n   </em>\n   to do so when it determines that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   (a) releasing the record primarily benefits the public rather than a person....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 63G-2-203 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 50 Looking to the statute, the court assessed the City's decision as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   If the City establishes that it considered the appropriate statutory factors ... and did not rely on any impermissible policies or factors ... then under the statute, the City's decision is entitled to deference ... [and the] Court's role is limited to a review of whether the result was reasonable. If the Court determines the City's decision was an abuse of discretion, then it is not entitled to deference and the Court will determine\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   based on the evidence presented at trial whether the City's denial of the fee waiver was unreasonable pursuant to Utah Code \u00a7 63G-2-203(6)(a).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 51 Although the court used the term \"abuse of discretion,\" we note that this was not because the court had adopted that particular standard of review. Rather, the court was merely applying the statute governing the City's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 52 But the court's review was not entirely correct. We clarify that upon judicial review of a government entity's fee waiver denial, the ultimate question is not whether the entity abused its discretion, but whether its decision was reasonable. The court should make this decision\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   -meaning without deference to the Records Committee's decision, the Appeals Board's decision, or the governmental agency's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b6 53 When making this determination, a court should do as the court did here: view the entity's decision in the context of the governing statute. Here, that meant assessing whether the entity properly considered those circumstances under which GRAMA encourages a fee waiver: when releasing the record primarily benefits the public, the requester is the subject of the record, or the requester's legal rights are directly implicated by the information in the record and the requester is impecunious.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 63G-2-203(4). But this is not necessarily determinative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b6 54 The court should examine this and any other evidence it finds relevant to the reasonableness of the entity's denial. Here, the court properly considered the City's failure to contemplate whether releasing the record benefitted the public, along with the time and effort required of the City to fulfill the request, the extreme breadth of the request, and the fact that some of the material requested duplicated records the City had already produced to JRRN.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 55 Because the court found that the City had not considered whether releasing the record would primarily benefit the public, the court gave no deference to the City's decision. So the court ultimately conducted a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review to determine if the City's decision was reasonable in light of the GRAMA provisions regarding fee waivers. Accordingly, it conducted the review contemplated by GRAMA and any error it made as to the standard of review was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <em>\n    B. Burden of Proof\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b6 56 The court's ruling that it was reviewing the City's decision rather than the order of the Records Committee did lead to an error regarding the assignment of the burden of proof. But that error is also harmless because the court concluded the City had proven its case by a preponderance of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b6 57 The court ruled that the burden of proof\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   was on the respondent, as \"the party seeking relief in the form of a Court-ordered fee waiver from the City.\" However, it was JRRN that prevailed before the State Records Committee, and it was the City petitioning for a review of that decision. As the petitioner seeking a reversal of the decision below, the City should have borne the burden of proof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b6 58 The governing statute, Utah Code section 63G-2-404, does not expressly state which party bears the burden of proof in a judicial review proceeding. The nearest guidance section 404 provides is that the petition for judicial review shall be a complaint governed by the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure, and shall contain \"a request for relief specifying the type and extent of relief requested,\" and \"a statement of the reasons why the petitioner is entitled to relief.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6993936\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/222/55/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 63G-2-404(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b6 59 In general, the law has long assigned the burden of proof to the petitioner, plaintiff, or appellant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cox v.

And because the statute states that it is the decision of the State Records Committee under review, it makes sense that the party challenging the Records Committee's decision should bear the burden of proof. While the Committee's decision is not entitled to deference, it still has significance. If the district court denies the petition, then the Committee's decision remains.

This is because, while the court did not formally assign the burden of proof to the City, in practice the court analyzed the case as if the City did have that burden. Before trial the district court ruled that it was the City's burden to \"establish[ ] that it considered the appropriate statutory factors and factors consistent with the polices of GRAMA and did not rely on any impermissible polices or factors in making its decision.\" And after the bench trial, the court ultimately concluded that the City had established by a \"preponderance of the evidence ... that the decision to deny the requested fee waiver ... was reasonable....\"\n   <em>\n    Salt Lake City Corp. v.

The Scope of the Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \u00b6 65 JRRN's final procedural challenge relates to the scope of the district court's review. The district court conducted a complete trial\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , in which it considered any admissible evidence offered by the parties. JRRN asserts the court should have limited its review to the record before the State Records Committee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b6 66 The text of the relevant provision does not provide a clear answer. The statute directs the district court to \"make its decision\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , but allow introduction of evidence presented to the records committee.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 63G-2-404(7)(a) (emphasis added). JRRN argues that this language permits the district court to review only the evidence presented to the Records Committee. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b6 67 While the statute directs the district court to include evidence presented to the Records Committee in its review, it does not contain language requiring the exclusion of other evidence. JRRN's interpretation of the statutory text assumes a word that is absent: the provision does not say that the court should allow introduction of \"only\" the evidence presented to the Records Committee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b6 68 JRRN also points out that the relevant provision uses the term \"\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   \" without conjoining the word \"trial.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10449713\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/615/1276/#p1277\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In contrast, other statutes explicitly reference a \"trial\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\" For example, the Administrative Procedures Act, which does not apply to\n   GRAMA,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   states that \"district courts have jurisdiction to review by trial\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   all final agency actions resulting from informal adjudicative proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10449713\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/615/1276/#p1277\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 63G-4-402 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b6 69 This distinction is worth consideration.

UTAH CODE \u00a7 63G-2-403(10)(a). But proceedings in the district court are governed by the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure.

In the first,\n   <em>\n    Deseret News Publishing Co. v.

JRRN quotes passages from\n   <em>\n    Deseret News\n   </em>\n   in which we discussed the foundational policies of the GRAMA statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13-14. We noted there that GRAMA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   strikes a balance between \"the right of access to information concerning the conduct of the public's business and the right of individual privacy concerning personal information acquired by governmental entities.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 63G-2-102(1). In\n   <em>\n    Deseret News\n   </em>\n   , we did not interpret GRAMA to require district courts to enter into a balancing analysis in the context of fee waiver requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b6 77 In the second case,\n   <em>\n    Graham v.

In so doing, the court discussed GRAMA's balancing of \"the public's right to access government documents against the government's interest in operating free from unreasonable and burdensome records requests.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. The court noted that \"the Legislature ... also restricted access to public records by allowing agencies to impose fees for the production of records in limited instances.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b6 78 Although allowing governmental entities to impose fees is one way that GRAMA balances the government's interests and the public's right of access, GRAMA does not require for fee waivers the same balancing analysis that applies in the context of records requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   \u00b6 79 In assessing a request for records that are private or protected, GRAMA instructs government entities to weigh the interests favoring access against the interests favoring restriction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 63G-2-201(5)(b)(ii). If the government entity denies the records request, and the requester petitions for judicial review, section 63G-2-404 directs district courts to \"weigh[ ] ... the various interests and public policies\n   <em>\n    pertinent to the classification and disclosure or nondisclosure\n   </em>\n   , [and] order the disclosure of information properly classified as private, controlled, or protected if the interest favoring access outweighs the interest favoring restriction of access.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 63G-2-404(8)(a) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   \u00b6 80 But the code does not require the same substantive analysis, either from the government entity or the reviewing court, in determining whether to grant or deny a fee waiver request. As we have discussed, GRAMA has provisions specific to charging and waiving fees. And while an appeal of a fee waiver denial follows the same procedure as an appeal of a record request denial, that does not mean the same substantive law applies. As JRRN states in its brief, \"[t]he reasonableness of the [entity's] order must be determined in light of the statutory setting in which it operates.\" (Quoting\n   <em>\n    Utah Dep't of Admin. Servs. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10430566\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/658/601/#p611\">\n    658 P.2d 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 611 (Utah 1983) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b6 81 Here, the district court properly assessed the reasonableness of the City's decision in light of the relevant fee waiver statute. The court recognized that section 63G-2-203\"permitted [the City] to charge fees for retrieving and copying the requested documents,\" but encouraged it to fulfill record requests without charge when the request primarily benefits the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \u00b6 82 The court found that the City incorrectly had not considered this provision, and factored that into its ultimate ruling in this case. The court also considered any other evidence relevant to the question of reasonableness. It found that JRRN's request:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   required substantial efforts to \"compile\" documents as defined in\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   . The request's breadth would require extracting many documents from disparate larger sources. The effort within Public Works required many hours and interrogating many employees as to the files they possessed. It would not have been feasible to\n   allow JRRN the access needed to gather the documents themselves.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The court also found that \"the breadth of the request ... was unreasonably large,\" that \"full compliance with the request would have required many more hours of employee time compiling and copying,\" and that the \"request [was] not tailored to [this] issue, but rather appear[ed] calculated to require production of every conceivable document concerning the project.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   \u00b6 83 Despite finding that JRRN's \"purpose was to primarily benefit the public,\" the court concluded that the City's \"decision to deny the requested fee waiver ... was reasonable given the voluminous nature of the request and the effort necessary to compile the requested documents.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   \u00b6 84 The district court did not also need to weigh competing interests pertinent to disclosure and nondisclosure. While fees do affect the public's access to documents, the legislature has identified different considerations specific to the fee waiver context. The district court correctly identified and applied them here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   \u00b6 85 The district court correctly concluded that the City had standing to petition for judicial review. And while the court should have conducted a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of the decision of the State Records Committee, its error was harmless because that decision is not entitled to deference. It was necessary for the court to make its own assessment of the governmental entity's decision, which it did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   \u00b6 86 At trial, the court correctly considered any admissible evidence and applied the specific provisions of GRAMA governing fee waivers. While the court's ruling on the burden of proof was incorrect, that error was harmless because the court ultimately found that the City proved the reasonableness of its decision by a preponderance of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   \u00b6 87 Accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    Accordingly, we reference and analyze the 2010 version of the Utah GRAMA statute throughout this opinion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    The City cited Salt Lake City Code section 2.64.130(D) (2010), which provided that a \"person who believes that there has been an unreasonable denial of a fee waiver ... may appeal the denial in the same manner as a person appeals when inspection of a public record is denied.\" This mirrors the language in GRAMA section 63G-2-203(6)(a).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    The City filed its petition pursuant to Utah Code sections 63G-2-404(1)(a) and 63G-2-701(6) and in accordance with 63G-2-404(3).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    JRRN appealed to the Utah Court of Appeals.
