After the arrest, the investigating officer read her the following \"admin per se\" admonition:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Arizona law states that a person who operates a motor vehicle at any time in this state gives consent to a test or tests of blood, breath, urine or other bodily substances for the purpose of determining alcohol concentration or drug content.

The court deemed the admonition coercive, ruled that Diaz's consent to testing was involuntary, found the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule inapplicable, and granted her motion to suppress. On appeal, the superior court affirmed the municipal court's involuntariness finding but found the good-faith exception applicable and therefore reversed the suppression order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b64 The court of appeals accepted jurisdiction of Diaz's ensuing special action petition but denied relief for reasons different from the superior court's.\n   <em>\n    Diaz v.

In its cross-petition for review, the State argues the court of appeals erred in holding that \u00a7 28-1321 requires \"voluntary\" agreement to submit to breath tests and that if that requirement is not met, evidence of breath test results is inadmissible in a criminal DUI prosecution under A.R.S. \u00a7 28-1381.

This distinction is meaningful because, as relevant here, the word \"consent\" is found only in subsection (A), under which a DUI arrestee \"gives consent\" to testing by operating a motor vehicle in this state.
