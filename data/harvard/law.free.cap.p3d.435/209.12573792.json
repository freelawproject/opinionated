EnerVest, Ltd. (EnerVest)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   asks us to review the district court's grant of summary judgment, which upheld the state engineer's proposed determination that The Minnie Maud Reservoir and Irrigation Company (Minnie Maud) is the owner of disputed water rights on Minnie Maud Creek and rejected the objections to the proposed determination made on those grounds. Before reaching this issue, however, we must first decide whether we have jurisdiction over the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b63 We conclude that we do not. The district court's certification of its summary judgment ruling as final under Utah Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) was improper and thus\n   we do not have a final judgment before us for review. And we do not consider whether we should treat the appeal as a petition for interlocutory appeal under Utah Rule of Appellate Procedure 5 because we conclude that EnerVest was not aggrieved by the district court's decision and so lacks appellate standing. Therefore, we dismiss the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   I. GENERAL ADJUDICATION PROCESS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b64 A general understanding of Utah's process for adjudicating water rights in cases like this one is helpful for grasping the issues in this appeal. When a justified petition of \"five or more or a majority of water users\" for a determination of water rights is given to the state engineer, the engineer files an action in the district court to determine the water rights (similar to a quiet title action). UTAH CODE \u00a7 73-4-1 (1953). The district court may then order a general adjudication, which will provide it guidance in establishing water rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b65 \"[T]he purpose of the general adjudication process is to prevent piecemeal litigation regarding water rights and to provide a permanent record of all such rights by decree.\"\n   <em>\n    Jensen v.

PROCEEDINGS BELOW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b67 In the early 1900s, several owners of water rights on Minnie Maud Creek filed articles of incorporation for Minnie Maud and transferred their water rights to the newly formed corporation. The relevant parties in this case transferred their rights to Minnie Maud in exchange for shares in Minnie Maud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b68 In 1956, this general adjudication, which includes Minnie Maud Creek, was initiated. The state engineer issued a proposed determination in 1964, allocating twelve water rights to Minnie Maud. In the following months, four different objections were filed, challenging a total of eight of the water rights provided to Minnie Maud. Each of the four objections raise several different challenges, but all of the objections argue that Minnie Maud could not be the owner of the water rights, either because Minnie Maud\n   never legally existed or because it was a defunct corporation. EnerVest did not file an objection, and the water rights it now claims are not directly challenged by the objections.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b69 In 2012, EnerVest filed a petition under Utah Code section 73-4-24(1) to expedite a hearing on the objections. The district court granted the petition but limited the scope of the section 24 hearing to whether the proposed determination correctly lists Minnie Maud as the owner of the water rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b610 Several parties participated in the section 24 hearing, including non-objectors, EnerVest and Michael Carlson, and objectors, the Willis A. and Wilma Hammerschmid Trust (the Hammerschmid Trust) and Gary and Nancy Motte. Eventually the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, with EnerVest and the Hammerschmid Trust arguing that Minnie Maud could not own the water rights and Carlson arguing that the state engineer correctly deemed Minnie Maud the owner of the water rights. The district court granted Carlson's motion for summary judgment and denied EnerVest's and the Hammerschmid Trust's motions for summary judgment. At the parties' request, the district court certified its decision as final under Utah Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b). EnerVest and the Hammerschmid Trust appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b611 During the pendency of the appeal, before the briefing schedule was even set, the Hammerschmid Trust's appeal was voluntarily dismissed with prejudice. As a result, Carlson challenges EnerVest's standing to appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b612 \"Whether appellate jurisdiction exists is a question of law, which we review for correctness.

First, the district court certified its grant of summary judgment to Carlson and denial of partial summary judgment to EnerVest and the Hammerschmid Trust as final under Utah Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b). We conclude that the district court's summary judgment decisions did not meet the criteria for proper rule 54(b) certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b615 Second, Carlson challenges EnerVest's standing to pursue an appeal of the rejection of other parties' objections. We agree with Carlson and conclude that EnerVest lacks standing to appeal. Therefore, we decline to consider whether the defects in the rule 54(b) certification could otherwise be cured by treating the appeal as a petition for permission to file an interlocutory appeal under Utah Rule of Appellate Procedure 5(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   I. FINAL JUDGMENT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b616 The first jurisdictional issue we must address is whether this case presents a final judgment over which we have jurisdiction on appeal. Unless one of three exceptions is met, we lack appellate jurisdiction over a judgment that does not \"end[ ] the controversy between the litigants.\"\n   <em>\n    Copper Hills Custom Homes, LLC v. Countrywide Bank, FSB\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20UT%2042\">\n    2018 UT 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 10, 13-15 (citation omitted) (internal quotation\n   marks omitted). Certification by a district court as final under Utah Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) provides one of those exceptions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b617 In order to be appropriately certified as final under Utah Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), three requirements must be met: (1) \"there must be multiple claims for relief or multiple parties to the action;\" (2) \"the judgment appealed from must have been entered on an order that would be appealable but for the fact that other claims or parties remain in the action;\" and (3) \"the [district] court, in its discretion, must make a[n express] determination that there is no just reason for delay.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16 (alterations in original) (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). Additionally, the district court must \"set forth a clear rationale as to why there is no just reason\" for delay.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b618 The district court's 54(b) certification suffers from two flaws. First, the district court did not offer a rationale for why it determined there is no just reason for delay. This omission, in and of itself, \"functions as a\n   <em>\n    practical\n   </em>\n   bar to our appellate jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b619 Second, the district court's underlying order granted summary judgment to Carlson and denied partial summary judgment to EnerVest and the Hammerschmid Trust. And the district court's rule 54(b) certification order attempted to certify its ruling on all three motions as final. But the denial of EnerVest's and the Hammerschmid Trust's motions for partial summary judgment is not an \"order that would be appealable but for the fact that other claims or parties remain in the action\" because they are not final.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16 (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Denison v.

We have the discretion under Utah Rule of Appellate Procedure 5(a) to treat an appeal from an order certified under rule 54(b) that is not actually final \"as a petition for permission to appeal an interlocutory order.\" Because we conclude that EnerVest lacks standing on appeal, we do not exercise this discretion here and therefore lack appellate jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   II.

This cannot be the case.

EnerVest cannot now, on appeal, retract its confession to the statements contained in the proposed determination, undo its default, and argue that it is entitled to greater water rights than provided it under the proposed determination.

We have previously noted that \"claimants should be immediately aware of any possible objection as soon as they see the proposed determination\" because they are aware of the water claims they submitted and can determine if the proposed determination \"does not match the contours of [their] submitted claim[s].\"\n   <em>\n    In re Gen.

There is nothing in our case law or the statutory text to warrant such a result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b634 Hearings on an objection occur in one of two ways. First, a water claimant with a \"direct interest\" in a \"valid,\n   <em>\n    timely\n   </em>\n   objection\" may file a petition under section 73-4-24 for an expedited hearing on that objection. UTAH CODE \u00a7 73-4-24(1) (emphasis added). A court should grant that petition if it \"will facilitate a reasonably prompt resolution\n   <em>\n    of the matters raised in the objection\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 73-4-24(4) (emphasis added). If no section 24 petition is filed, the court will eventually hear the objection as a matter of course as part of the general adjudication. Before a hearing on an objection, the court must give all claimants notice of when \"the\n   <em>\n    matter\n   </em>\n   will be heard.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 73-4-13 (emphasis added). This language does not suggest that a water claimant participating in a hearing on an objection has the right to make or pursue an objection that it did not itself timely lodge. Instead, the hearing is on the objection that was filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b635 EnerVest would have known of its potential objection immediately upon the proposed determination's release. At that time, it had the option of objecting to the proposed determination or acquiescing in its allocation. EnerVest chose the latter and has not argued that there is due cause to excuse its failure to file an objection. The right to participate, if any,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   in a hearing on the objection under sections 73-4-13 or 73-4-24 does not serve as an \"escape hatch for water claimants that simply neglect to pursue their claims.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Gen.

EnerVest cannot use that hearing as a mechanism to lodge its own objection on those grounds. While a non-objecting party's interests may ride an objector's coattails as far as the objector wishes to go, the non-objecting party cannot drag the objector across the finish line against the objector's will. To allow this would undermine the individual requirement of filing a timely objection, UTAH CODE \u00a7 73-4-11, or excusing the failure to timely file an objection for due cause,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9066867\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/82/1125/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 73-4-10(1).

But those hearings are limited to the objections that are filed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b634. By the end of the ninety-day objection period, a water user with rights under the proposed determination will know whether his or her rights are challenged and, if so, which rights and by whom. This allows \"subsequent appropriators [to] rely upon [these recorded water rights] before making their investments.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Gen.

(emphases added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   But EnerVest is attempting to do just that on appeal-attack Minnie Maud's rights under the proposed determination despite allowing its ninety-day objection period to expire more than half a century ago.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b640 It is clear from the record, and EnerVest does not dispute, that EnerVest's predecessor in interest did not file an objection to the proposed determination. Therefore, EnerVest is a claimant that allowed its time period to lapse. However, EnerVest's position might doubly undermine the goal of certainty. EnerVest is only claiming two of the twelve water rights allocated to Minnie Maud, water rights 90-24 and 90-196. According to EnerVest, it \"owns all the lands comprising the authorized places of use for\" those two water rights. It is unclear whether\n   objections were ever filed that directly challenge Minnie Maud's rights to those two water rights,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   especially given that EnerVest's predecessors in interest-the landowners with interests in receiving those two water rights associated with their land-never filed an objection. If no objections filed actually challenge Minnie Maud's right to water rights 90-24 and 90-196, not only would Minnie Maud be subject to attack by a claimant who allowed its objection period to expire, but also subject to attack on otherwise uncontested water rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Opening up water right owners to these types of attacks undercuts the objective of establishing certainty through a general adjudication, so we decline to recognize EnerVest as having such an interest in another party's objection. And therefore EnerVest cannot be aggrieved for purposes of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b641 For these three reasons, EnerVest cannot have a sufficient interest in another party's objection to be aggrieved by the denial of that objection for the purposes of appellate standing. While it may technically be the case that EnerVest would benefit from the district court granting the objections and stripping Minnie Maud of its water rights under the proposed determination, EnerVest, as a defaulting party, lacks the legal ability to argue that it is entitled to more rights than those to which it acquiesced when it failed to object to the proposed determination. And, without the participation of the objector, it cannot champion the objection on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b642 This does not mean, as EnerVest suggests, that a non-objecting party could never appeal a district court's ruling on an objection.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   There will often be times that claimants receive exactly that which they request and the proposed determination directly reflects the entirety of the claim they filed. In that case, such claimants will have no reason to object and will become, in a sense, defaulting parties. However, if an objection is made on the water rights they receive under the proposed determination, and the court grants the objection in a way that negatively impacts the water rights the defaulting party is to receive under the proposed determination, those claimants will be aggrieved by the district court's decision and can appeal. A party would also have standing to challenge a district court's decision deeming it a non-objecting (defaulting) party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    VP Props. &amp; Devs., LLP v. Seneca Specialty Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321967\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/645/912/#p915\">\n    645 F. App'x 912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 915 (11th Cir. 2016) (noting that a defaulting party has \"standing to appeal the default judgment against it\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b643 Similarly, if a claimant timely objects to a proposed determination and the district court does not grant the objection (and the corresponding water rights) in its entirety, that claimant will likewise be aggrieved and able to appeal. But EnerVest does not fit into any of these categories and therefore is not aggrieved by the district court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b644 EnerVest failed to file a timely objection to the proposed determination. While\n   EnerVest may technically benefit from other parties' objections, it became a defaulting party that lacks a sufficient interest in those objections to be aggrieved by their denial for the purpose of appellate standing. It may be that a non-objecting party's interests can piggyback on another party's objection, but only as far as the objecting party is willing to travel. Once the objecting party chooses to end its objection's journey, the non-objecting party cannot take over.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b645 The district court's rule 54(b) certification was insufficient to confer appellate jurisdiction upon this court because the requirements for certification were not met, and therefore there is no final judgment for our review.
