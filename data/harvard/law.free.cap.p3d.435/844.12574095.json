We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 On December 18, 2015, an undercover detective, posing as a prospective drug buyer, attempted to make contact with a suspected dealer in a downtown Chelan apartment building. After knocking on the door of the apartment, a nearby apartment door opened and Mr. Rivera-Zamora exited, asking the detective what he was doing. The detective spoke to Mr. Rivera-Zamora briefly and explained that he was looking to buy cocaine. Mr. Rivera-Zamora responded that he did not have cocaine but could help him get some \"crystal.\" The detective agreed and the two made arrangements for the purchase of methamphetamine. As arranged, Mr. Rivera-Zamora took the detective's money and returned with a small bag, set it down and motioned for the detective to come and take it. The bag later tested positive for methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 The detective returned February 2, 2016, and again was able to purchase methamphetamine from Mr. Rivera-Zamora. Nine days later, after an unsuccessful attempt to buy more methamphetamine, officers executed a search warrant for Mr. Rivera-Zamora's apartment. During the search, deputies found a total of $1,765 in Mr. Rivera-Zamora's pockets, and two digital scales in the apartment. He told officers where to find a bag of methamphetamine inside\n   a plastic glove in a cereal box. The plastic glove weighed 11.7 grams and tested positive for methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Mr. Rivera-Zamora was arrested and spoke with two detectives. He admitted that he used methamphetamine and \"sold to a few people\" to sustain his personal use. Mr. Rivera-Zamora was subsequently charged with two counts of delivery of a controlled substance, possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, and maintaining a drug property. Three of the charges included allegations that the offenses occurred within 1,000 feet of school grounds and/or a school bus stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 At trial, Mr. Rivera-Zamora requested an entrapment instruction on the first delivery charge, arguing that his testimony detailing the detective's badgering behavior was sufficient to persuade a reasonable jury of\n   the existence of the defense. In denying the instruction, the trial court explained that the proposed instruction was an incorrect statement of the law and inaccurate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court also determined that the testimony was insufficient under the case law to support the instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 The jury convicted as charged and found the enhancements had been established. Mr. Rivera-Zamora received a prison-based drug offender sentencing alternative (32 months in prison followed by 32 months' community custody).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 Mr. Rivera-Zamora timely appealed to this court. A panel considered the appeal without hearing argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 This opinion addresses two issues. First, we consider Mr. Rivera-Zamora's challenge to the sentence on the charge of possession with intent to deliver. We then turn to\n   the claim that the trial court erred in denying his proposed entrapment instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Possession with Intent Sentence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 Mr. Rivera-Zamora first argues that the omission of the identity of the controlled substance in the elements instruction for the charge of possession with intent to deliver requires resentencing for the imposition of a lesser felony. We conclude that despite the omission of the word \"methamphetamine\" in the \"to convict\" instruction, he has not established manifest constitutional error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 The omission of an element from a \"to convict\" instruction is an error of constitutional magnitude that may be raised for the first time on appeal.\n   <em>\n    State v.
