In return, See's received shares of Columbia's stock. After the sale, See's was required to pay Columbia to use the See's trade name. See's deducted these royalty payments from its taxable income. A tax commission auditor reviewed See's\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   tax returns and called shenanigans, concluding that the transaction had been structured to permit See's to improperly reduce its taxes. Utah Code section 59-7-113 permits the Utah State Tax Commission (the Commission) to allocate income between related organizations if it is \"necessary\" to \"prevent evasion of taxes\" or \"clearly to reflect the income\" of the corporations. And that is what the Commission did; it allocated the royalty payment deductions back to See's as taxable income. This increased See's tax liability for the audited years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b62 See's appealed that assessment to the Commission, which decided that the allocation was appropriate. See's then appealed that decision to the district court, which, by statute, has the authority to conduct a trial de novo. After trial, the district court reached the opposite conclusion and allowed See's to take the deductions. To reach that conclusion, the district court analyzed section 113 to assess when the statute authorizes the Commission to allocate income between related companies. The Commission argued that it had plenary authority to allocate income whenever it, in its sole discretion, believed it was necessary to prevent tax evasion or to make a corporation's returns clearly reflect its income. See's argued that the statute should be interpreted in the same fashion as a similarly worded provision of the federal tax code. Under that interpretation, the Commission would be authorized to allocate when the transaction occurs on terms more favorable than those that two unrelated companies would reach after negotiating at arm's length.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b63 The district court concluded that section 113 was ambiguous. To resolve the ambiguity, the district court interpreted the section in harmony with that similarly worded section of the federal tax code. The district court credited expert testimony opining that the See's-Columbia transaction looked like one that two unrelated companies would have reached. The Commission has not challenged this finding. Based on that testimony, the district court ultimately concluded that section 113 did not permit the allocation the Commission had imposed. The Commission appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b64 Like the district court, we conclude that the language of section 113 is ambiguous. We also conclude that the district court properly looked to section 113's federal counterpart and its accompanying regulations for guidance. The original version of section 113 was lifted directly from the 1928 Internal Revenue\n   Code. Because the Legislature modeled the original version of section 113 on its federal counterpart, we look to the federal statute's history and interpretation for guidance. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b65 See's and Columbia Insurance Company are wholly owned subsidiaries of Berkshire Hathaway.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 1997, See's sold intellectual property, including its trademarks, to Columbia in exchange for Columbia stock. The value of the intellectual property was independently assessed at the time of the transaction, and Columbia tendered shares that roughly equaled the value of See's intellectual property. As part of the transaction, Columbia and See's entered into a licensing agreement to permit See's to continue using its trade name. Under the agreement, Columbia would protect and develop the intellectual property; See's would pay royalties to license the intellectual property back.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b66 See's deducted the royalty payments from its income as a business expense. The Multistate Tax Commission (MTC)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   audited See's deductions for the years 1995 through 1998 and concluded the deduction was proper for various states, including Utah. The MTC recommended a 10 percent disallowance of the deduction to \"represent an increase in Columbia's capital and reflect See's business activities in the State.\" The Commission accepted the MTC's recommendations and allowed the deduction with the 10 percent disallowance. That decision is not before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b67 The Commission later audited See's for the years 1999 through 2007 and disallowed the royalty deductions. In an administrative proceeding, the Commission concluded that Utah Code \" section 59-7-113 precluded shifting of income through royalty payments between See's and Columbia since Columbia does not file Utah corporate franchise tax returns.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Commission concluded that the royalty deduction See's claimed \"would decrease See's taxable income by 75% for the audited years and thus section 59-7-113 justified the disallowance to clearly reflect See's income.\" The Commission did not evaluate whether the royalty was priced at arm's length or if there was a business purpose for the transaction, but did state that See's would not have entered into this deal with an unrelated corporation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b68 See's sought a trial de novo of the Commission's assessment in the district court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7\u00a7 59-1-601, -602.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 113's meaning became a threshold question for the court. The Commission argued\n   that section 59-7-113\"is a stand-alone section giving the Commission authority to reallocate income if it concludes in its broad discretion there is a distortion of income for tax purposes or avoidance of income,\" and that the \"Legislature did not intend the statute to involve interpretation by reference to federal [Internal Revenue Service] regulations.\" See's contended that \" section 59-7-113, being virtually identical to [ Internal Revenue Code section] 482, depends on the [Internal Revenue Service] regulations for interpretation and application [and that] it me[t] those regulations' requirements for taking the deduction.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b69 The district court concluded that the language of Utah Code section 59-7-113\"appears to be unambiguous regarding the Tax Commission's ability to redistribute deductions if necessary to clearly reflect income.\" But the district court also reasoned that the language \"is less clear regarding conditions that should exist before it undertakes that task.\" The court reasoned that although the Commission \"enjoys broad discretion to adjust income ... there should be some law to guide how its discretion should operate in getting [the] deductions to clearly reflect income.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b610 In addition, the court opined that the statutory inquiry was \"rooted in whether the transaction [between related companies] was arm's length.\" The court concluded that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Utah income [and] franchise taxing relies heavily on federal definitions and section 59-7-113 is itself a virtual copy of [Internal Revenue Code] section 482, indicating, as provided in [a] [Utah] Attorney General Opinion and Utah case law on similar statutes cited above, the Legislature wants to use federal guidance to interpret and apply the statute when dealing with whether a transaction is arm's length or not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b611 With respect to the substance of the dispute, See's called multiple expert witnesses at trial. See's economist opined that \"the purpose of transfer pricing evaluation is to ensure transactions between related parties reflect fair market pricing.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   He explained that \"[t]he practice ... has a long history in sales and in application of [Internal Revenue Code] section 482.\" He concluded that \"the royalty rate See's paid Columbia was in the arm's length range of royalty rates specified in\" transfer pricing studies performed by an accounting firm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b612 See's also called a tax law professor to explain that \"the purpose of [Internal Revenue Code] section 482 is to put transactions between related parties on the same footing as if they took place between unrelated parties.\" The professor also explained that \"many other states have adopted statutes which, like section 59-7-113, are virtually identical to [Internal Revenue Code] section 482,\" and other states \"refer to the [Internal Revenue Code] thus implicitly adopting section 482.\" The professor concluded that \"[t]he Commission simply exercised unfettered discretion to reach its decision unguided by any reasonable standard.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b613 Through its witnesses, See's introduced an independent transfer pricing study prepared by an accounting firm. The study concluded that the See's-Columbia transaction reflected terms like those that would be reached between unrelated parties dealing at arm's length. The study concluded that \"[b]ased on the financial information for the last three years ... the net royalty payments made to [Columbia] for these intangible assets ... are appropriate.\" The study also noted that \"[i]n evaluating the appropriateness of this royalty rate, we confirmed that [Columbia] pays certain costs associated with these intangible assets. This net royalty rate allows See's to earn a normal return on its intangible assets.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b614 The court ultimately concluded that the transfer between See's and Columbia resembled a transaction that unrelated parties dealing at arm's length could have reached. The Commission appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUE AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b615 The Commission contends that the district court erred by interpreting\n   Utah Code section 59-7-113 to reflect the federal arm's length transaction standard.

The statute does not plainly speak about when it is \"necessary\" for the Commission to intervene and what \"clearly to reflect\" income means.

The Language of Utah Code Section 113\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b625 The district court concluded that the similarity between section 113 and Internal Revenue Code section 482 suggested that the Legislature intended that federal guidance be used to interpret section 113. Internal Revenue Code section 482 provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   In any case of two or more organizations, trades, or businesses (whether or not incorporated, whether or not organized in the United States, and whether or not affiliated) owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the same interests, the Secretary may distribute, apportion, or allocate gross income, deductions, credits, or allowances between or among such organizations, trades, or businesses, if he determines that such distribution, apportionment, or allocation is necessary in order to prevent evasion of taxes or clearly to reflect the income of any of such organizations, trades, or businesses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20482\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b626 The Commission dismisses the notion that we can derive any meaning from the similarity in the two provisions. Instead, the Commission looks to other parts of the tax code and argues that \"[b]y explicitly incorporating federal tax provisions into some parts of the Utah Tax Code-but omitting I.R.C. [section] 482 from [s]ection 113-the Legislature manifested its intent that federal law would not inform the Commission's power under [s]ection 113.\" The Commission reasons that because the Legislature does not\n   cite section 482 or its regulations in the language of section 113, the Legislature did not intend for these provisions to be incorporated into section 113. The Commission points to several other sections of the tax code that \"define certain Utah Tax Code terms by reference to the Internal Revenue Code\" to demonstrate that \"[w]here the Legislature has wanted to incorporate federal tax provisions into the Utah Tax Code, it has done so explicitly.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b627 See's counters that because section 113 is \"nearly identical\" to Internal Revenue Code section 482, the language of section 113 \"must be understood in light of the well-established norm of interpreting [section 113] by reference to [ section] 482 and its regulations.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   See's also argues that the arm's length transaction standard \"was encompassed by the statutory phrase 'clearly to reflect the income' in federal income tax law at the time Utah enacted virtually identical statutory language.\" See's notes that \"[f]ederal tax law governing related-party transactions had long inquired whether a transaction was 'market price' instead of 'arbitrary' or 'artificial,' and when the clear-reflection language was adopted in 1928, it embodied this 'arm's length' approach.\" See's argument outlines the more persuasive interpretation of section 113.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   II.

Accordingly, we concluded that \"[t]he striking parallelism between the statutory definition and the federal standard is an indication that our legislature was adopting the 'cluster of ideas' in federal law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b645 The idea that use of similar language indicates a legislative intent to adopt not just the language of a federal statute, but also its accompanying \"cluster of ideas,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , dovetails with the approaches other states have employed. Accordingly, we conclude that, absent evidence of a contrary legislative intent, when our Legislature copies a federal statute, federal interpretations of the statute constitute persuasive authority as to the statute's meaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b646 Here, section 20 is a carbon copy of section 45. Because of this similarity, and in the absence of any other signal from the Legislature about how this language should be interpreted, it is proper to look to the history and purpose of section 45 to guide our interpretation of section 113. And the \"striking similarity\" between the two statutes is best interpreted as a legislative signal that section 20 should function like section 45. That is, the Legislature enacted this provision to combat transfer pricing manipulation and to prevent affiliated corporations from gaining a tax benefit by engaging in transactions with each other for goods or services for prices above or below the current market, by the shifting of profits through the making of fictitious sales, and by taking advantage of questionable sales to each other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b647 In other words, because section 113 shares section 45's language, we look to the federal interpretation for guidance in resolving the ambiguity in the statute. And \"necessary ... clearly to reflect the income of any of such corporations,\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 59-7-113, means, as it does in its federal analog, that allocation is \"necessary\" in circumstances when related companies enter into transactions that do not resemble what unrelated companies dealing at arm's length would agree to do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   IV. The District Court's Application of the Arm's Length Standard\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b648 After interpreting the statute, the district court applied it. The district court acknowledged the unique nature of the See's-Columbia transaction: \"The Court believes See's had an uphill task ... establishing an arm['s] length transaction. After all, it seemed conveniently owned by the same company that owned a non-income tax company.\" However, after considering the expert testimony and See's transfer pricing study, the court concluded that \"the transfer was arm's length[,] justifying a deduction not barred under [Internal Revenue Code] section 482 and therefore not barred under Utah Code Annotated section 59-7-113.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b649 The Commission does not challenge the district court's factual findings. Accordingly, because we conclude that the district court correctly ruled that the Legislature intended that section 113 be interpreted with reference to its federal counterpart, we affirm the district court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   V. Additional Arguments\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b650 The Commission and the MTC make several additional arguments aimed at convincing us that the district court got it wrong. The Commission first argues that we \"noted the breadth of the Commission's authority under section 113\" in\n   <em>\n    Continental Telephone Co. v. State Tax Commission\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10464639\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/539/447/\">\n    539 P.2d 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Utah 1975). And that breadth of authority aligns better with a reading of the statute that, according to the Commission, authorizes the Commission to determine, in its sole discretion, when allocation is \"necessary ... clearly to reflect the income.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b651 Specifically, the Commission argues that the following language from\n   <em>\n    Continental\n   </em>\n   supports its position:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   We think the broad wording of [section 113's predecessor] indicates a legislative intent to cover all situations dealing with either direct or indirect corporate affiliates without regard to whether they file individual state or consolidated state corporate franchise tax returns; and that the language of that section authorizes the Tax Commission to so apportion income and deductions of corporations within such controlled groups as to fairly and equitably reflect the income earned in Utah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10464639\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/539/447/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10464639\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/539/447/\">\n    at 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b652 This language does indicate that the Commission should be granted broad authority to allocate income. However, this authority is not unlimited. As discussed above,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b639-47 the better reading of the statute limits the application of section 113 to situations where related companies enter transactions on terms that unrelated companies would not agree to. Once the Commission has made that determination, it possesses broad authority to allocate income. But we do not read\n   <em>\n    Continental\n   </em>\n   to support the proposition that the Legislature intended the Commission to exercise its section 113 discretion untethered to any identifiable standard.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b653 Next, the Commission argues that \"[s]ection 113 and I.R.C. [section] 482 differ in language and in context of application.\" The Commission first highlights that several linguistic and \"minor grammatical\" differences now exist between section 113 and section 482.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, section 482 now allows the Secretary to distribute, apportion, or allocate credits and allowances in addition to gross income and deductions, and also contains a provision referencing intangible property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20482\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the Commission fails to explain how these differences affect the meaning of the section 482 in a manner relevant to our analysis of section 113.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b654 At the time that section 113 was originally adopted as section 20, the Legislature adopted the language wholesale from the federal tax code. And that aspect of section 113 has remained unchanged. That Congress has since added provisions clarifying section 482 's application that do not substantively alter the language at issue here does not persuade us that we should afford section 113 a different interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b655 The Commission also contends that \"[e]ven if the language of section 113 was identical to I.R.C. [section] 482, they operate differently because of differences between the Utah and Federal tax codes.\" The Commission points to the federal government's \"affiliated group\" consolidated return requirement and explains that Utah's tax scheme operates differently because the Utah Code combines entities that form a \"unitary group.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b656 The Commission explains that \"[t]he federal government and some other states have taken a different approach [than Utah] by taxing the income of insurance companies.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   And the Commission argues that \"the current case is one circumstance where combined reporting does not net out the effect of intercompany transactions,\" and thus \"[s]ection 113's existence suggests that the Legislature foresaw that there could be circumstances where transactions distort income or deductions or they cause the evasion of taxes[,] and it wanted the Commission to be able to reallocate income to clearly show it.\" But this statement does not adequately explain why the differences between affiliated and unitary groups support the Commission's interpretation of section 113. Without more, we are unpersuaded that section 113 and section 482 differ in their context and application or that those differences would be material to our analysis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b657 Finally, the MTC argues that there are several indications that the Legislature did not intend for section 113 to be interpreted in harmony with section 482 and its regulations. The MTC does not rely on the plain language argument that the Commission makes. Nor does it directly engage with the history of the language that the Legislature imported into our code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b658 Instead, the MTC first argues that because the arrangement between See's and Columbia does not reduce See's federal taxes in the same way it reduces its state taxes, section 482 would not apply. The MTC points out that \"the IRS would not need to apply [ section] 482 to eliminate related-company deductions in analogous circumstances where federal taxes\n   <em>\n    would\n   </em>\n   be affected.\" The MTC argues that if section 482 would not apply to See's federal taxes in this situation, the Legislature must not have intended that section 113 be construed with reference to its federal analog. And if this was the only evidence that spoke to the possible meaning of section 113, it might have some persuasive force. But, as we outlined above, an abundance of evidence, rooted in the language and history of the statute, demonstrates that at the time the Legislature inserted this language into our code, it intended to adopt the \"cluster of ideas\" associated with the language it lifted from the federal statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b659 Second, the MTC argues that two policy choices our Legislature made-to require formulary apportionment and combined filing-demonstrate \"a fundamental choice to reject the use of transactional accounting as the means for ... accurately determining income of a multistate business earned within the state, and determining the income of related companies participating in a single enterprise.\" The MTC suggests that the arm's length transaction standard, a method of transactional accounting, is inconsistent with Utah's formulary apportionment scheme. The MTC also asserts that \"Utah's long-standing policy choices favoring formulary apportionment and combined filing over the sole alternative-transactional accounting-bear directly on the question of what it means to 'clearly reflect income' under [ section 113 ].\" But the MTC provides no support for its implicit assertion that the Legislature could not have decided that it wanted a section 113 with an arm's length standard to coexist with its other policy choices. This argument does not persuade.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b660 Third, the MTC argues that \"[s]tate tax agencies may have authority under state law to remedy potential distortions in income caused by related company transactions, similar to the arrangement in this case, by eliminating the effects of those transactions entirely.\" The MTC explains three general approaches: combined filing, add-back statutes, and taxing the income of the transferee apportioned by reference to the related transferor. And the MTC emphasizes that \"these approaches are described here not because [the MTC] contends that they specifically apply to See's, but because all three approaches come to the same result-and therefore demonstrate the accepted standard for clear reflection of income under [ section] 113.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \u00b661 We understand the MTC to argue that states have employed various other mechanisms\n   to prevent related companies from reducing their tax liability by engaging in strategic intercompany transactions. And the Legislature may decide to implement these other mechanisms in the future should it wish to prevent companies like See's from receiving favorable tax treatment from transactions like the one at issue here. But we do not see great interpretive value flowing from the recognition that other states have found ways other than an arm's length transaction standard to curb enthusiasm for these types of related company arrangements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b662 The district court correctly concluded that section 59-7-113 is ambiguous. And the district court properly sought interpretive guidance from section 113 's federal counterpart and its regulations. The Legislature borrowed the phrase \"necessary in order to prevent evasion of taxes or clearly to reflect the income of any of such corporations\" from federal tax law. The \"cluster of ideas\" associated with that language requires an examination of whether a transaction between related corporations yielded a result similar to one that two unrelated companies would reach. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not err in employing the arm's length transaction standard to determine that the Commission improperly allocated See's income.
