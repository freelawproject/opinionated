Initially, the superior court's judgment and sentence prohibited Gossett from having contact with any minor, including his own children. Two months later, though, the superior court entered an agreed order amending and clarifying the judgment and sentence to allow Gossett supervised visitation with his children in the normal course of the visitation process followed by the Department of Corrections (DOC).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 Gossett's wife subsequently submitted visitation applications to DOC on behalf of their children. DOC denied the minor children's applications, among other reasons, because the individual or class of individuals has or have been victimized by the offender. Gossett filed an administrative appeal, but DOC upheld the denial of visitation privileges between Gossett and minors, including his minor aged children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b63 In this personal restraint petition (PRP), Gossett asks us to review DOC's denial of his request for visitation with his minor children. The parties present the following issues on appeal: (1) whether Gossett has a protected liberty interest in visitation with his children under the United States Constitution or the Washington Constitution, (2) whether RAP 16.4(c)(6) precludes us from reviewing Gossett's PRP because DOC argues its policies are not \"laws of the State of Washington,\" (3) whether the superior court's order amending and clarifying Gossett's judgment and sentence did not bind DOC as a matter of law, because the superior court did not have personal jurisdiction over DOC, (4) whether DOC policies addressing visitation and prohibited contact violated a protected liberty interest in Gossett to visit his children, (5) whether DOC's prohibition on visitation between Gossett and his children was arbitrary and capricious, (6) whether Gossett's argument regarding\n   the freedom of speech and the freedom of association warrants consideration, and (7) whether Gossett's claims about visitation with his adult children are moot and, even if not moot, whether dismissal of these claims would be appropriate pursuant to RAP 16.4(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b64 Holding against Gossett on the controlling issues, we deny his PRP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Gossett's Judgment and Sentence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 A jury convicted Gossett of two counts of second degree rape of a child under RCW 9A.44.076 and two counts of second degree child molestation under RCW 9A.44.086. On June 10, 2010, the superior court sentenced him to a 245-month term of total confinement in the custody of DOC. The judgment and sentence specified that Gossett shall have no contact with his child, A.R.G.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   for life, not reside within a community protection zone, and participate in certified sexual deviancy treatment. The judgment and sentence incorporated by reference all conditions contained in its Appendix H. In addition, it specified\n   that Gossett \"shall have no contact with any minor, including his own adopted or biological children.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 7 (emphasis omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Gossett's wife applied for visitation for their children, but DOC denied visitation because of the restrictions specified on Gossett's judgment and sentence. Gossett then requested an amendment and clarification of his judgment and sentence to allow visitation with his children. The superior court granted his request and, on August 4, 2010, entered an order amending and clarifying his judgment and sentence with the following provisions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   MARK GOSSETT is allowed to have visitation with his children, as supervised by the [DOC], during normal visitation in accordance with the rules and regulations of the [DOC]; that the Court having reviewed the files and records contained herein and being otherwise fully advised in the premises, now, therefore, it is hereby\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   ORDERED that the Judgment and Sentence entered by the above entitled Court on June 10, 2010 be and the same hereby is modified and clarified to allow for the Defendant to have visitation with his children at any [DOC] facility in which the Defendant is housed;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   That the children will not have visitation alone with the Defendant and such visitation shall be supervised by [DOC]'s personnel in the normal course of the visitation process followed by the [DOC]'s facility the Defendant is in;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   That the normal supervision of visitation by two or more correctional officers in an open room where numerous other inmates may be exercising visitation privileges, is sufficient supervision for the Defendant to have visitation with his children.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   CP at 25-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b67 At the present time, four of Gossett's five children are legally adults.

The matter was referred for review to the Facility Risk Management Team (FRMT) assigned to Gossett.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b614 The FRMT recommended that Gossett be prohibited contact with his \"adopted/biological children.\" Suppl. Br. of Resp't, App. 2, Decl. of Rohrer, at 5. The FRMT stated that allowing contact would be counter to sound correctional practices or legitimate penological objectives. The FRMT commented that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   [p]er the Presentence Report, Offender Gossett blames the victim (which is also one of his children) and that he is not amenable to treatment. He has a 245 month to LIFE CCB [Community Custody Board] sentence. His first CCB hearing will not [be] heard until 9/8/27.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Suppl. Br. of Resp't, Att.

In another comment FRMT noted, \"His Judgment and Sentence has been amended to allow supervised visits,\n   however supervision by the facility visiting staff does not constitute as supervised visitation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b615 Rohrer upheld the FRMT's recommendation and prohibited contact between Gossett and minors, including his minor aged children. Rohrer stated that the\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   [v]ictim of Offender Gossett's current conviction is the minor aged adopted daughter of the offender. Previous criminal history also shows that offender Gossett was original[ly] charged with an Assault 3rd of a child which was later pled down to an Assault 4th DV [ (Domestic Violence) ]. PSI [ (Presentence Investigation) ] notes that the victim of this crime was Gossett's 10 year old foster son.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Offender has displayed a history of victimizing both sexually and physically minor\n   aged children, both male and female. Original J/S [Judgment and Sentence] noted Defendant shall have no contact with any minor, including his own adopted or biological children. J/S modified months later to read that the offender may have contact with his children as supervised by the DOC personnel in the normal course of the visitation process followed by the DOC facility that the offender is located in and that the normal supervision of visitation by two or more C/O [ (Corrections Officers) ] in an open room is sufficient. However, DOC Policy 450.300 VII. Who May Not Visit: A. 3. Persons rest[ricted] per the Judgment and Se[n]tence. While supervised visits may be allowed per the J/S, supervision by facility visiting staff does not constitute supervised visitation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Suppl. Br. of Resp't, Att. D, Decl. of Rohrer, at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b616 On October 26, 2011, Gossett appealed Rohrer's decision prohibiting contact to the assistant secretary of prisons. In this appeal, DOC staff recommended continuing the prohibition of contact and stated in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   The case has been vetted with the SOTP [Sex Offender Treatment Program] Manager, Sally Neiland. She says: \"I have reviewed the attachments as well as the J &amp; S [Judgment and Sentence], Prohibitive Contact and PSI [Presentence Investigation]. This is a\n   complicated case. I have a long list of concerns which include two items in the J &amp; S. To date, Mr. Gossett has not fulfilled 1) Obtain a sex offender evaluation.... 12) Do not enter into a relationship with any person who has minors in their care or custody without approval of your assigned CCO [Community Corrections Officer] or SOTP (this includes his wife). This alone backs up the current Prohibitive Contact.[\"]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Of concern is that Mr. Gossett['s] ... file material I have had access to indicates that he continues to deny his sexual offending and refer to the victim as a \"liar and a bad Christian.\" In addition, even though his ERD [estimated release date] is very far out, he has not acknowledged his behavior nor has he made attempt to apply for SOTP.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   In addition to that Mr. Gossett not only has 2 ROC [rape of a child] 2 convictions and 2 Child Moles 2 convictions as well as a DV [domestic violence] 4 conviction. In addition file material indicates that his wife \"beat the victim with a belt and spoon.\" I do not believe that DOC visitation staff should hold the responsibility for supervision of these minor children given the circumstances, and the attention they must pay to a full visiting room. The liability for the children, the visiting staff and the DOC seems to outweigh the visit request.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   A suggestion would be to allow for written correspondence to be reviewed both outgoing and incoming so he can maintain safe and observable contact with the children.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Suppl.

The deputy director concurred with Rohrer's decision to prohibit contact between Gossett and minors, including his minor aged children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b617 On October 28, DOC sent a letter to Gossett informing him of its decision to continue the prohibited contact between him and his children. Dan Pacholke, the director of the Prisons Division, explained in the letter:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Thank you for your letter requesting visiting privileges being authorized for your children.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   In your letter, you point out that there was a modification to the original Judgment and Sentence that allows you to participate\n   in visiting with your children. The modification does not mandate visitation. Due to your conviction history and nature of the crime, I am upholding the denial of visiting privileges with your children. If you choose to submit to a sexual deviancy evaluation and participate in Sex Offender Treatment Program during your incarceration, this issue may be reconsidered. Unless this provision is met, all of your appeal opportunities have been exhausted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Suppl.

This distinguishes this situation from a typical sentencing after conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b632 We hold that in this case the superior court lacked personal jurisdiction over DOC related to the issue of supervised visitation while in a DOC facility.

He argues that DOC's prohibition\n   on visitation between Gossett and his children was arbitrary and capricious, violated these policies, and therefore deprived him of his due process interest in liberty. Even assuming that these policies created a liberty interest, which we do not decide, DOC did not violate them or act arbitrarily and capriciously in applying them. Therefore, we disagree with Gossett's arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   1. DOC's Prohibition on Visitation Between Gossett and His Children Did Not Violate DOC Policies\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b634 As set out above, former DOC directive 450.300(VII)(A)(1)-(4) lists categories of individuals who may\n   not visit prison offenders. One of those categories, subsection (A)(4), states, \"Persons prohibited from visiting per DOC 450.050 Prohibited Contact.\" Reply Br. of Resp't, Att. A, at 8. Therefore, we focus our examination on DOC Policy 450.050.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b635 Former DOC Policy 450.050 sets out specific instances in which contact with an inmate is prohibited. First, former directive 450.050(I)(B)(4) provided, \"An offender's contact with specific individuals or classes of individuals may be denied or restricted for reasons including, but not limited to: .... The individual or class of individuals has been victimized by the offender.\" Supp. Br. of Resp't, Att. E, Policy, at 2. DOC reasoned that because Gossett victimized his children, they belong to a class of individuals that have been victimized by Gossett, so this directive provides it the authority to prohibit contact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b636 The Department is correct. Gossett's victim was one of his minor children and DOC's ban on visitation extends only to minors, including his remaining minor aged child. DOC's action was consistent with former directive 450.050(I)(B)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b637 Next, former DOC directive 450.050(I)(C) provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   An offender may be prohibited from contact with his/her own child(ren)\n   <em>\n    only if\n   </em>\n   the offender's Judgment and Sentence and/or a No Contact Order prohibits contact, or if necessary to protect the child(ren) from any specific and documented threat of harm. Documentation\n   <em>\n    includes, but is not limited to\n   </em>\n   :\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   1. A written opinions of mental health professionals or Child Protective Services, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   2.

E, Policy, at 3 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b638 Gossett points out that neither his judgment and sentence nor any no-contact order prohibits his contact with\n   his children. He argues that there is no documentation indicating he poses a threat of harm to his children and that DOC cannot point to any written opinion of a mental health professional or any \"verified incident of harm to the children resulting from contact with [Mr. Gossett] while [he] was incarcerated.\" Suppl. Br. of Pet'r at 9-10. Therefore, Gossett argues, DOC has pointed to neither form of documentation required and has violated its own policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b639 Pointing to the language \"includes, but is not limited to,\" the State argues that \"while specific verified incidents of harm to the children resulting from contact with the offender while s/he was incarcerated in a Department facility is\n   <em>\n    sufficient\n   </em>\n   documentation, it is not\n   <em>\n    necessary\n   </em>\n   documentation.\" Suppl. Br. of Resp't at 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b640 Relevant to former directive 450.050(I)(C) is the declaration of Belinda Stewart, the correction's program administrator for DOC, who declares,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   While a documented history of harm to the children resulting from contact with the offender while she or he was incarcerated in a Department facility is one form of documentation that supports prohibited contact, it is not the only form of documentation that can be used for that purpose. In this case, Mr. Gossett's documented pre-incarceration abuse of both male and female minors and the provisions of his Judgment and Sentence support the Department's decision to prohibit contact between Mr. Gossett and \"C\" while \"C\" is still a minor. Prohibiting Mr. Gossett from\n   visiting \"C\" until \"C\" becomes an adult is, therefore, both appropriate and consistent with Department policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Suppl. Br. of Resp't, App. 3, Decl. of Belinda Stewart, at 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b641 The State also points us to the declaration of Rohrer, who declares,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   It is common in prison for inmates with convictions for child rape, child molestation, or domestic violence against children to be restricted from visiting minor children, including their own children. This is particularly true where, as here, the inmate has victimized his own adopted children. This is not done for\n   arbitrary reasons but rather because of the legitimate fear on the part of Department staff and society at large that permitting such visitation risks further victimization of children. Any individual committing these offenses in Washington can expect that he or she will likely be restricted from visiting minor children, including his own children, as an ordinary incident of prison life.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Supp. Br. of Resp't, App. 2, Decl. of Rohrer, at 11. Rohrer's view is affirmed by the declaration of Stewart, who declares,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   Prohibiting inmates convicted of crimes against children from visiting with minor children-even their own children-is not at all unusual in Department facilities. It is, in fact, a typical part of the incarcerated experience of inmates convicted of such crimes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Suppl. Br. of Resp't, App. 3, Decl. of Belinda Stewart, at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   \u00b642 We agree with DOC. Former directive 450.050(I)(C) does not require documentation of specific verified incidents of harm to the children resulting from contact with the offender while incarcerated. Instead, it requires that the prohibition of contact be \"necessary to protect the child(ren) from any specific and\n   <em>\n    documented threat of harm\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=392%20P.3d%201124\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Further, inclusion of the phrase \"\n   <em>\n    but is not limited to\n   </em>\n   \" makes clear that the specified types of documentation are not intended as exclusive. The record supports that Gossett was convicted of sex crimes against his own minor child, failed to obtain deviancy treatment as required by the judgment and sentence, continues to deny sexual offending, and refers to the victim as a \"liar and a bad Christian.\" Suppl. Br. of Resp't, App. 2, Decl. of Rohrer, at 9. This evidence provides a sound basis for DOC's prohibition of visitation with his minor child, consistently with former DOC Policy 450.050(I)(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   \u00b643 For these reasons, we hold that DOC acted consistently with former policies 450.300 and 450.050.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   2. DOC's Prohibition on Visitation Between Gossett and His Children Was Not Arbitrary and Capricious\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   \u00b644 Both parties argue the arbitrary and capricious standard of review applies.
