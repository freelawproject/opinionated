After two orders by the hearing panel granted her extensions to file an answer, the respondent timely filed an answer to the complaint on April 10, 2017, and an amended answer to the complaint on August 7, 2017. A hearing was held on the complaint before a panel of the Kansas Board for Discipline of Attorneys on September 19-20, 2018, where the respondent was personally present and was represented by counsel. The hearing panel determined the respondent violated KRPC 1.1 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 289) (competence); 1.3 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 292) (diligence); 1.4(a) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 293) (communication); 1.5(d) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 294) (fees); 1.8(e) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 309) (providing financial assistance to client); 1.16 (2018 Kan. S. Ct.

The Disciplinary Administrator and the Respondent stipulate to the following facts:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   a. Respondent represented [G.C.] in an employment case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   b. During the case, [G.C.] was offered a settlement of approximately $40,000.00.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   c. [G.C.] rejected the offer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   d. Later, [G.C.] advised Respondent that he was running short of money because of medical and other expenses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   e. Respondent reviewed the Kansas Rules of Professional Conduct and decided that giving [G.C.] a loan would not violate the KRPC if the loan was an \"arm's length\" transaction. She did not read the Comments to KRPC 1.8.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   f. Respondent loaned [G.C.] $20,000.00 at 8.99% interest with payments of $900.00 due each month with the balance payable upon the settlement of the employment litigation or and [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] of his pending worker's compensation claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   g. Shortly after she provided the loan, Respondent was approached by a bank owner who indicated that the bank would like to support the litigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   h. Respondent advised that [G.C.] could use a loan that he could use to pay off the loan she made to him, plus provide him other needed funds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   i. [G.C.] was given a loan. The loan principal was paid off, however there was interest that was owing and still accruing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   j. Prior to the interview with Respondent, the Attorney Investigator suggested Respondent review both the Missouri and Kansas Rules of Professional Conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   k. After reviewing both, Respondent acknowledged her conduct violated the Rules in both states.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   l. Respondent contended that the KRPC was not implicated because her actions were under her Missouri license.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   m. Respondent acknowledges that KRPC 8.5 provides: \"A lawyer admitted to practice in this jurisdiction is subject to the disciplinary authority of this jurisdiction although engaged in the practice of law elsewhere.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   n. Respondent reported the misconduct to the Missouri Office of Chief Disciplinary Counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   '9. The Disciplinary Administrator and the Respondent agree that the Respondent violated KRPC 1.8(e) [.]'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \"15. As part of the diversion agreement, the respondent agreed to complete a total of sixteen hours of continuing legal education, including a total of six hours of ethics. The respondent agreed to complete the hours within one year. The respondent failed to complete the required continuing legal education hours.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \"16. The diversion agreement also contained the following provision:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   'The Respondent shall not violate the terms of the diversion agreement or the provisions of the Kansas Rules of Professional Conduct or Kansas Supreme\n   Court Rules. If a new complaint is received during the diversionary period, or if within 90 days after the expiration of the agreement a new complaint is received alleging violations of the KRPC during the diversionary period, these acts shall constitute grounds for a request to the Review Committee that the diversion be revoked. The Review Committee has the authority to order revocation of the diversion and order the matter be set for a public hearing, without any other proceedings. In the event that the Respondent violates any of the terms of diversion or any of the provisions of the Kansas Rules of Professional Conduct or Kansas Supreme Court Rules, including registration requirements, at any time during the diversionary period, the Respondent shall immediately report such violation to the Disciplinary Administrator. The Respondent shall cooperate with the Disciplinary Administrator in providing information regarding any investigations relating to her conduct, as required by Kansas Supreme Court Rule 207. Failure to do so, may constitute a violation of KRPC 8.4.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \"17. While the respondent remained on diversion, two new complaints were docketed for investigation against the respondent,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   DA12475 and DA12526 below. The Review Committee of the Kansas Board for Discipline of Attorneys found probable cause to believe that the respondent violated the Kansas Rules of Professional Conduct in DA12475 and DA12526.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \"18. The respondent was given an opportunity to present information to the Review Committee as to whether the diversion agreement in DA12309 should be revoked. The respondent declined to comment or otherwise provide information\n   to the Review Committee. Thereafter, on January 6, 2017, the Review Committee revoked the respondent's diversion in DA12309.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \"19. According to Rule 203(d)(vii):\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   'Failure to Complete the Attorney Diversion Program. If the Respondent fails to complete the agreed tasks in a timely manner at any point in the diversion process, he or she may be terminated from the program. If such a termination occurs, traditional formal disciplinary procedures will resume. When the complaint is returned to the formal disciplinary process, the Respondent's termination from the Attorney Diversion Program may be cited as an additional aggravating factor in recommending discipline and as a violation of Supreme Court Rule 207 and KRPC 8.1.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \"DA12475\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \"20. In 2012, the respondent began representing G.N. and D.N. In order to understand the facts involved in the present disciplinary case, it is necessary to include extensive background facts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \"21. During 1992 and 1993, G.N. and D.N. engaged Ken Liebelt, a licensed independent life insurance agent and licensed securities broker, as their investment adviser. Liebelt was trained to determine the client's insurance objectives, research the client's existing products, run an analysis of the proposed products, and compare the benefits of the existing products to any new products proposed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \"22. At the time, G.N. and D.N. each had a term life insurance policy, however the policies had outlived their purpose of insuring against the untimely death of D.N., the primary breadwinner of the household. G.N. told Liebelt that she wanted to reduce the amount of tax that she and D.N. paid on investments, if possible, through changes in their financial portfolio. Accordingly, Liebelt's goal in 1993 was to see what tax-advantaged products were available in the marketplace to assist G.N. and D.N. in accomplishing this goal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \"23. That same year, Dave Knudson, Liebelt's supervising general manager, called Liebelt and told him of a tax advantaged product that he might want to hear about for his clients. In March, 1993, both Liebelt and Knudson attended a conference for the purpose of learning about 'universal life insurance.' During this conference, they both learned the generalities of a strategy for borrowing out the cash\n   values in a universal life policy, all for retirement portfolio enhancement. Although Liebelt did not learn the specifics of how to operate the borrowing strategy (balanced funding option), Liebelt believed Knudson was very knowledgeable about the strategy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \"24. Liebelt and Knudson each believed that the life insurance policies would lower G.N. and D.N.'s taxes. As such, they agreed to work together to sell the life insurance policies to G.N. and D.N. Liebelt and Knudson were not partners and there was no written contract between them, rather, it was understood that they would each make a commission if the policies were sold.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \"25. G.N. and D.N. relied on the collective advice from Liebelt and Knudson by terminating their existing life insurance policies and applying for universal\n   life insurance policies with Bankers United Life Assurance Company (hereinafter 'Bankers'). Knudson was the managing agent on the policy and Liebelt was the writing agent. Although an insurance professional should assess whether the administrative expenses of a proposed policy are excessively high, Liebelt did not attempt to assess G.N. and D.N.'s existing investments, made no comparison of whether the proposed policies had advantages over their existing policies, and did not research any other life insurance or investment products; he merely ascertained whether they had cash flow to pay the high life insurance premiums necessary for the Bankers' policies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \"26. After determining how much G.N. and D.N. could pay in premiums, Liebelt told Knudson that they 'needed to run the proposal on Knudson's computer software program.' Liebelt did not have the software knowledge to run any proposals. He went to Knudson's downtown office for this purpose. The new policies were based on the maximum amount of premiums G.N. and D.N. could afford to pay. This raised D.N.'s coverage from $150,000 to $442,626 and G.N.'s coverage from $25,000 to $271,000. At the time G.N. and D.N. completed the insurance policy application, they were advised to seek the counsel of a tax professional regarding the potential tax issues of the policy. Later, in 1993, when the policies were issued, G.N. and D.N. were advised of the maximum interest that would be charged on any loans taken from the cash value in the policies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \"27. From 1993 to 2000, G.N. and D.N. built the cash value in the life insurance policies by paying a total of $225,000 in premiums on the two policies. In August, 2000, G.N. and D.N. received notice from Bankers that their insurance policies were the subject of a class action lawsuit involving allegations against the company regarding how the policies were sold and how they performed. Both G.N. and D.N. signed documents agreeing to a settlement with the company regarding those issues.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   \"28. In 2001, Knudson called Liebelt and advised him that G.N. and D.N. could start using the balanced funding option. Liebelt agreed that G.N. and D.N. should move forward with this option. Prior to making arrangements for G.N. and D.N. to start borrowing against the policies, Liebelt failed to run any underlying calculations or make any analysis of whether the interest rate charged on the loans against the policies of 13.9% was reasonable under the market conditions existing at that time. Liebelt also failed to run any data to determine whether G.N. and D.N. were breaking even on the life insurance policy. Finally, Liebelt failed to check to see whether there had been any changes in tax laws that might have rendered the balanced funding option no longer appropriate or advantageous.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   \"29. Knudson and Liebelt met with G.N. and D.N. to explain the details of the balanced funding option. Later, G.N. called Liebelt and advised him that they wanted to go forward with the balanced funding option.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   \"30. Knudson and Liebelt met with G.N. and D.N. a second time. During this meeting, they instructed G.N. on the documentation she would need for tax purposes with the balanced funding option. Liebelt told G.N. that the balanced\n   funding option would work for her if she followed the specific instructions of Knudson.\n   \"31. After the second meeting, Liebelt advised G.N. that he would open a tax-efficient fund in order to maximize G.N. and D.N.'s tax benefits from the balanced funding option. He opened a separate investment account that would be used strictly to house the interest and deposits for the balanced funding option. Liebelt instructed G.N. to refrain from using the account for any other purpose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   \"32. In 2001 and 2002, G.N. took out loans from the cash value in their Bankers' policies, as directed by Knudson. G.N. gave half the loan proceeds to Liebelt to invest in the account he opened for use in conjunction with the balanced funding option. Liebelt invested in mutual funds. G.N. gave Knudson and the other half of the loan proceeds, $73,500, to invest. Knudson put them into LLCs which he had formed. Knudson did not tell G.N. that the LLCs were companies he owned nor did he tell her that the LLCs were illegal, unregistered companies. He simply told G.N. that her money was going into offshore currency exchanges, the silver market, and real estate investments in Las Vegas.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   \"33. As part of the balanced funding option in the life insurance policy which was designed for tax advantages, G.N. and D.N. were to make annual interest payments on the policy loans which could, in turn, offset capital gains tax according to the balanced funding option plan. G.N. and D.N. had been advised when the loans were taken of the details of operating the balanced funding option, their responsibilities under the plan, and the importance of making the annual loan interest payments, including the maximum interest that would accumulate on the borrowed principal under each policy. G.N. and D.N. paid the interest payments due annually on the loans in 2000 and 2001.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   \"34. In 2003, G.N. contacted Knudson and suggested she did not have enough capital gains to offset and thus had no reason to pay the interest due on the policy loans. Knudson agreed she could postpone the interest payment at that time. Liebelt provided no advice or information on this issue. G.N. and D.N. never again paid the annual interest charges on the policy loans.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   \"35. By the end of October, 2003, G.N. knew that the money invested with Knudson was completely lost.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   \"36. In 2005, Liebelt called G.N. to find out why they were not paying the interest due on the loans. When G.N. responded that they were following the advice of Knudson, Liebelt did not instruct her to start paying interest due and did not run any calculations. Relying on Knudson, Liebelt never learned what G.N. and D.N. were required to do to utilize the benefits of the fixed rate loan policy provision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   \"37. Knudson was forced out of the securities business in the mid-2000's.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   \"38. G.N. met with a new investment adviser, David Cox, with the intention of moving their investments from Liebelt. G.N. informed Cox that she held a Bankers' policy and was satisfied with it. She also advised Cox she was uncomfortable with the level of risk and dissatisfied with the performance of funds placed\n   for investment with Liebelt. On June 10, 2010, G.N. hired Cox to manage their investments. Liebelt remained as G.N. and D.N.'s insurance agent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   \"39. In 2012, G.N. and D.N. received notices from Transamerica, the successor in interest to Bankers, advising them that they needed to terminate their policies because the compounding interest and escalating loan balances consumed the cash values of both policies. G.N. and D.N. had been informed of the compounding interest and escalating loan balances on an annual basis from 2003 to 2012 by virtue of the annual statements. G.N. and D.N. ultimately surrendered the policies in 2012.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   \"40. After G.N. and D.N. surrendered the policies, Transamerica conveyed approximately $29,000 as the cash surrender value for G.N. and D.N.'s insurance policies. Transamerica informed them that it would report to the IRS that the policy surrenders had generated $551,000 of taxable income for G.N. and D.N. According to the respondent, G.N. and D.N.'s tax liability would have been $198,000 on the\n   $551,000 of taxable income declared by Transamerica.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   \"41. Each year beginning in 1993, Liebelt had received a copy of the annual statement of values on G.N. and D.N.'s policies. Liebelt did not look at the statements closely. Had he done so, he would have seen that the policies would eventually have a negative value.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   \"42. Cox referred G.N. and D.N. to the respondent for assistance with the tax issues. At the time G.N. and D.N. retained the respondent, they were approximately 77 and 80 years old, respectively.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   \"43. G.N. and D.N. met with the respondent, provided her with documentation, and discussed the details of the life insurance policies. The respondent met with G.N. on many occasions. During those meetings, G.N. told the respondent that she learned that the investments they made with Knudson were a total loss between 2006 and 2009.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   \"44. The respondent researched the tax issue for G.N. and D.N. In August, 2012, the respondent was able to resolve the tax issue by contact with the IRS criminal division. The respondent also told G.N. and D.N. that she believed they had a viable cause of action against Knudson and Liebelt. D.N. asked respondent what he owed her for the assistance with the tax issue. The respondent told G.N. and D.N. that rather than pay her hourly for her work, she would agree to be compensated through a contingent fee lawsuit against Knudson and Liebelt.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   \"45. On approximately August 8, 2012, G.N. and D.N. entered into a contingent fee agreement with the respondent. While the respondent contends that the contingent fee agreement was reduced to writing and that she and G.N. signed it, she was unable to produce a copy of the agreement. D.N. testified that he did not sign a written contingency fee agreement, the terms of the fee agreement were discussed by the respondent and D.N. many times during the representation, and D.N. asked the respondent for a fee agreement on a number of occasions. The respondent never provided D.N. with a written fee agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   \"46. On February 11, 2013, the respondent filed suit against Liebelt and Knudson on behalf of G.N. and D.N. The respondent aggressively pursued G.N.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   and D.N.'s case. According to the respondent, she spent hundreds of hours working on the case and incurred over $19,000 in expenses on the case. The respondent learned that Knudson was judgment-proof.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   \"47. During discovery, G.N.'s deposition was taken. During her deposition, conducted on January 20, 2014, G.N. testified that she learned from Knudson that he lost all of the funds he invested on behalf of G.N. and D.N. in 2003. This was different than what she told the respondent in preparation for filing the case. Following G.N.'s deposition, the respondent did not ask G.N. about the discrepancy between what G.N. told her in their meetings and what G.N. testified to in her deposition. Additionally, the respondent did not explain to G.N. and D.N. that G.N.'s deposition testimony was problematic.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   \"48. On July 1, 2014, Liebelt filed a motion for summary judgment. In his motion, Liebelt argued that the allegations of negligence were time barred because the time for those claims began running a variety of years for different claims, from 1993 through 2010. Liebelt argued that he could not be held liable for the loss of the $73,500 provided to Knudson because G.N. was aware of the loss by 2003. Finally, Liebelt argued that he and Knudson did not enter a joint venture so Liebelt could not be held liable for Knudson's wrongdoing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   \"49. Regarding the claims of negligence, the respondent argued in her response that G.N. and D.N. did not know they had suffered material losses from the loans until 2012 when the policies were forfeited, the cash values were lost, and the tax liability of $551,000 was declared by Transamerica. The respondent argued that G.N. and D.N. did not know they had been defrauded of the $73,500 until the respondent discovered the fraud in 2012.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   \"50. On October 1, 2014, in a one-page journal entry of judgment, the court granted the motion for summary judgment based on the statute of limitations:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   'Defendant Kenneth Liebelt's Motion for Summary Judgment came on for hearing on October 1, 2014. Based on the briefs submitted and oral arguments of counsel, the Court GRANTED Defendant Liebelt's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   'Thus, Defendant Liebelt's Motion for Summary Judgment is granted as to Counts I, II, and V, as Plaintiff's action is untimely based on the statute of limitations. The Court further finds that Plaintiff cannot establish a joint venture as a matter of law, and grants summary judgment in favor of Defendant Liebelt based on Plaintiffs' joint venture claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   'Further, the Court finds that in this case involving multiple defendants, there is no just reason for delay in entering this Summary Judgment on behalf of Defendant Kenneth Liebelt only, in accordance with K.S.A. 60-254(b).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   'WHEREFORE, the Court finds that Summary Judgment is GRANTED in favor of Defendant Kenneth Liebelt on all causes of action against him by Plaintiff herein.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   \"51. After the court entered summary judgment on behalf of Liebelt, on\n   October 17, 2014, the respondent sent G.N. an email message. In that message, the respondent informed G.N. for the first time that G.N. created a statute of limitations problem by her deposition testimony. G.N. responded:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   'This is the first time you have mentioned that there was a problem with my deposition so I am surprised to hear it now. I did the best I could to be honest and accurate. Memory constraints and a multitude of facts to recall have perhaps created these problems.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   \"52. On October 29, 2014, the respondent filed a motion for reconsideration. In her motion, the respondent argued that the negligence and fraud claims against Liebelt should be reinstated because 'there is a question of fact as to whether Liebelt breached duties to [G.N. and D.N.] by failing to warn them of impending disaster while he remained the Agent on their policies after February 11, 2011.' The parties argued the motion on December 12, 2014. The court took the matter under advisement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   \"53. On December 29, 2014, the respondent met with G.N. and D.N. Initially, the respondent was cordial. The respondent explained to G.N. and D.N. how she had lost a great deal of money representing them in their suit against Liebelt and Knudson. The respondent asked G.N. and D.N. if they could think of a way to make it right. When G.N. and D.N. did not volunteer to pay the respondent money, her approach changed. The respondent became aggressive and clearly stated that she would not suffer this financial loss. The respondent indicated that she would be seeking to recover fees from them because G.N. misrepresented a key fact.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   \"54. On December 30, 2014, the respondent followed up their meeting with an email message. In the message, the respondent argued that she could sue G.N. and D.N. for negligent misrepresentation of a material fact, unjust enrichment, and fraudulent misrepresentation. In addition to threatening to sue G.N. and D.N., the respondent threatened to contact their accountant (who works for a financial firm owned by the respondent and the respondent's husband) and the IRS and retract the statements that the $551,000 reported by Transamerica should be considered phantom income.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   'I want you also to be aware of two more significant things: First, if you get audited, you will need me and my files to prove to the IRS that the income Transamerica declared to you was phantom, and caused by a Ponzi scheme. If I have to sue you, I won't be available for that effort until and unless I get paid for my work.

The court accepted Liebelt's argument that the statute of limitations began in 2003, when G.N. knew that the money was lost. The court rejected the respondent's argument that the statute of limitations did not begin to run until the respondent discovered the fraud in 2012.

After the respondent indicated she had not received that message, D.N. forwarded it to her at least twice.

The respondent did, however, include a paragraph that G.N. and D.N. would not be seeking damages regarding the tax exposure. D.N.'s express directions were to 'NOT in any way predicate plaintiffs' damages herein, in whole or in part, on plaintiffs' tax liability, actual or potential.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   \"81. On January 22, 2016, the court took up Liebelt's request for a continuance. During that hearing, D.N. entered his appearance on his own behalf.

The respondent's statements that she was unaware that D.N. was unhappy with the respondent's representation is disingenuous at best and, at worst, a deliberate\n   falsehood. The respondent was the recipient of at least 20 email messages where D.N. made it clear that he was unhappy with the respondent and believed she was unethical.

Additionally, the respondent asserted that she had concerns that D.N.'s judgment may be impaired by a health reason. The respondent alleged that D.N. exerted undue influence or control over G.N. and that G.N. may suffer from the battered wife syndrome. When questioned by the court for the source of her concerns, the respondent stated that she based her concerns on observations made during meetings with G.N. and D.N. when D.N. told G.N. that she could not talk. The respondent stated that D.N. made many irrational statements and had exhibited a pattern of less than full comprehension of the lawsuit.

Even though the respondent was present in the courtroom when the court scheduled the status conference and even though counsel for Liebelt referred to the date of the status conference in her February 25, 2016, letter, the respondent inadvertently recorded the status conference for March 7, 2016.

The respondent also knew that the court dismissed other allegations in the petition based on other time frames.

In April, 2016, the court granted the motions for summary judgment and dismissed the case with prejudice. In doing so, the court acknowledged that it was not proper to grant summary judgment simply because a responsive pleading was not filed. The court made its determination on the merits of the case. For example, the court concluded that the respondent indisputably sought to recover damages for injuries G.C. suffered during the workplace accident which was the subject of his worker's compensation settlement. The court also concluded that the plaintiff failed to show the service letter to any potential employers and he was not refused employment based on the service letter. Regarding the defamation claim, the court further found that the respondent failed to identify a defamatory statement that was published and damaged G.C.'s reputation.

The respondent's lack of competence became clear when she was unable to timely respond to discovery, motions, and claims filed by the defendants. Further, the respondent was found in violation of Rule 1.1 in the Missouri disciplinary action.

The respondent was also given adequate notice of the hearing before the panel and the hearing before this court. She filed exceptions to the hearing panel's final hearing report. At oral argument, the respondent clarified that she is not contesting the allegations against her and she agrees that the facts she contests in her brief to this court are not material to the disposition of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-276\">\n   The respondent does not take exceptions to the panel's\n   conclusions that she violated KRPC 1.1 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 289) (competence); KRPC 1.3 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 292) (diligence); 1.4 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 293) (communication); 1.5 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 294) (fees); 1.8(e) (2018 Kan. S. Ct.

R. 381) (misconduct); 8.4(c) (conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation); 8.4(d) (conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice); and 8.4(g) (conduct that adversely reflects on fitness to practice). The evidence also supports the panel's conclusions of law. We therefore adopt the panel's findings and conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-277\">\n   The only remaining issue before us is the appropriate discipline for the respondent's violations. At the hearing before this court, the office of the Disciplinary Administrator recommended the respondent be suspended indefinitely or, in the alternative, that a reinstatement hearing pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 219 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 264) be held before the respondent could return to the practice of law. The hearing panel recommended that the respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a period of two years, that the suspension be suspended, and that the respondent be put on probation subject to the terms and conditions listed in the final hearing report. The respondent and her designated practice supervisor filed affidavits asserting the respondent is in compliance with the probation plan approved by the panel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-278\">\n   The panel acknowledged that probation is generally not appropriate in cases involving\n   dishonest conduct, but it was persuaded by the mitigating circumstances here. This court is unconvinced that the mitigating circumstances render the respondent's egregious conduct toward her elderly clients amenable to probation. The respondent attempts to explain her threatening conduct toward them as an attorney-to-attorney negotiation because of D.N.'s status as an attorney. But her conduct in threatening to withdraw her statement to the IRS and to file a petition against her clients was simply wrong for several reasons.\n   First, the respondent had special influence over her clients' taxes because she was also co-owner of the financial firm that had prepared their tax returns. She exerted this influence in her December 30, 2014 email, stating, \"First, if you get audited, you will need me and my files to prove to the IRS that the income Transamerica declared to you was phantom, and caused by a Ponzi scheme.\" The email also referenced legal opinions \"on which the accountant relied in completing the tax return that saved you from $198,000 in taxes,\" with both the respondent and the clients aware that the accountant was the respondent's employee, a fact which amplified the threat. Even if her characterization of \"attorney-to-attorney\" negotiation was reasonable, her dual role as financial advisor and attorney gave her unfair leverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-279\">\n   Second, her characterization of \"attorney-to-attorney\" negotiation was unreasonable in light of her recommendation for a guardian ad litem for D.N. at the January 22, 2016 hearing before the district court. The record is not clear on whether the respondent was sincere when she told the district court D.N. might need a guardian ad litem. But it is an aggravating factor either way. If the recommendation for a guardian ad litem was insincere, then the respondent's attempt to discredit her client before the court was unethical. If the recommendation was sincere, then the respondent was unethical for engaging in hardball negotiations with a retired attorney whose capacity she knew to be diminished.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-280\">\n   Moreover, the respondent had an opportunity to show she could satisfactorily perform on diversion but failed. While she was on diversion for loaning $20,000 to her client in violation of Rule 1.8(e), two new complaints were filed. And she did not contest the Disciplinary Administrator's later request to revoke her diversion which was granted in January 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-281\">\n   This court is not bound by the recommendations made by the Disciplinary Administrator or the hearing panel. Supreme Court Rule 212(f) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 255). But this court agrees with the recommendation of the Deputy Disciplinary Administrator and holds indefinite suspension is the appropriate discipline. The respondent's license to practice law in the state of Kansas shall be indefinitely suspended; she will not be eligible for reinstatement\n   for a minimum of three years from the date this opinion is filed; upon petitioning for reinstatement, she must establish the conditions set forth in Supreme Court Rule 219(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   CONCLUSION AND DISCIPLINE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-283\">\n   IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that Linda S. Dickens be and she is hereby disciplined by indefinite suspension in accordance with Supreme Court Rule 203(a)(2) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 234), effective on the date of the filing of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-284\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the respondent shall comply with Supreme Court Rule 218 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 262) (notice to clients, opposing counsel, and courts of record following suspension).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-285\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that in the event the respondent seeks reinstatement, she shall be subject to a reinstatement hearing under Supreme Court Rule 219 (reinstatement).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-286\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the costs of these proceedings be assessed to the respondent and that this opinion be published in the official Kansas Reports.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
