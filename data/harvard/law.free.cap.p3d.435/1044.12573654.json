The victim hired an attorney to assist her during the criminal proceedings. The jury found Reed guilty; he was placed on probation and this court affirmed in a prior appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

After an evidentiary hearing, the superior court awarded the victim attorneys' fees and granted in part and denied in part other requested restitution. Reed timely filed this second appeal challenging that restitution order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The Rule Of Abatement.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b66 The rule of abatement, sometimes called \"abatement\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   ,\" is based on the common law principle that \"all private criminal injuries or wrongs, as well as all public crimes, are buried with the offender.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The argument that Reed was denied this right to appeal fails for several reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b616 Reed's counsel suggests that the right to appeal is, in essence, the right to a specific process or result on appeal. Not so. The right to appeal is not a right to a specific result or even a decision on the merits.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 13-4036(A) (on appeal from conviction, court may \"make any order which is\n   consistent with ... justice and the rights of the state and the defendant\"); 13-4039 (\"If the appellant fails to prosecute the appeal, the appellate court shall dismiss the appeal.\").

This argument, however, is based on the view that a dismissal under Section 13-106 is a decision on the merits of the appeal.

This, however, is not a civil case. Accordingly, as noted in addressing an analogous argument in\n   <em>\n    Griffin\n   </em>\n   , \"[w]hatever merit there may be in this contention, it should not be resolved in this case.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"724881\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/121/538/\">\n    121 Ariz. at 539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"724881\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/121/538/\">\n    592 P.2d at 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Resolution of such arguments would involve superior court proceedings, which apparently have not yet occurred and may never occur, governed by civil or probate procedural rules, applying substantive law other than criminal law and involving individuals not parties here.
