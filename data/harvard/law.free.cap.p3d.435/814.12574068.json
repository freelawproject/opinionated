The court issued an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   FAPA order, and respondent requested a hearing, at which the court continued the restraining order. On appeal, respondent seeks reversal of the FAPA order, arguing that the trial court erred in its decision because petitioner failed to prove that she was in \"imminent danger of further abuse\" or that he presented a \"credible threat to [her] physical safety,\" ORS 107.718(1).

We review the trial court's legal conclusions for errors of law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12412152\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/284/366/#p367\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Before the incident that led to the FAPA order, petitioner and respondent were married and living together with their two-year-old daughter. On May 4, 2017, an argument between petitioner and respondent escalated. Respondent began swearing and screaming at petitioner, approached her with a raised fist, but did not strike her. Instead, he grabbed a pillow from their sofa and pushed her with it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At some point, petitioner left the house with her daughter to get away from respondent. She got into her car and tried to drive away, but respondent prevented her from leaving by getting into her car and taking her cell phone. He eventually got out of petitioner's car but, once she started driving away, he got into his car and followed her down a two-way dirt road. He drove around petitioner so that they were driving side-by-side, at which point petitioner believed\n   that he was attempting to \"run [her] off the road,\" risking her life. He eventually turned around while petitioner drove to her friend's house and called the police. Criminal charges were filed against respondent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After the May 2017 incident, petitioner and respondent continued to live together without further violent altercations. However, the couple separated at the beginning of August 2017, and petitioner and their daughter moved out of the family home. On August 31, petitioner sought an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   FAPA restraining order out of fear of respondent's tendency to escalate arguments to \"frightening and unsafe levels.\" The court granted the order, and respondent requested a hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the contested hearing, petitioner testified about the May 2017 incident, but also described a physical altercation that occurred in 2015-significantly more than 180 days before filing of the petition-which started out as a verbal argument but resulted in respondent grabbing her aggressively. Petitioner stated that when she finally moved out of the couple's home, she agreed to a 50/50 parenting plan. However, out of concern for her own and her daughter's safety, she believed that the parenting plan had to be modified. As evidence supporting her concern, petitioner introduced an email exchange, text messages, and a recorded phone call, all of which occurred after they separated. In the email, respondent admitted his fault during the May 2017 incident. Nevertheless, petitioner still felt unsafe because respondent would not respect her boundaries when they talked. Petitioner also pointed to some text messages which showed that respondent would repeatedly ignore her requests that he stop contacting her until she was ready to talk about the new parenting plan. A day later, petitioner and respondent had a phone conversation where respondent stated that he \"did not try to kill her\" in May 2017 and that he \"could have because [he] was out of control\" but had no intent to kill her on that day. Although petitioner admitted that there had been no \"other violent physical incidents\" since May 2017, she stated\n   that the \"combination of that phone call and those text messages terrified her\" and that she was worried that another fight would occur if she did not obtain a restraining order.\n   Respondent testified that he was wrong in May 2017 and did not dispute that his actions then were dangerous and unsafe. However, he maintained that, since the separation, he had not been a threat to petitioner. He testified that most of the evidence presented by petitioner also showed that he did not interact with her other than through email or by phone-that is, he never went to her home or work. He explained that all he wanted to do was maintain the 50/50 parenting plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The court continued the restraining order after finding that there was\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"more than sufficient evidence by a preponderance to establish the abuse as *** outlined, *** [and] that given the history of the parties, *** petitioner believed that respondent was a credible threat to her physical safety and well-being, *** and that she was in danger of further abuse if the order had not been granted.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Under ORS 107.718(1), a trial court may issue a FAPA restraining order if a petitioner proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the respondent (1) \"abused\" petitioner in the 180 days preceding the filing of the petition, (2) presents an \"imminent danger of further abuse\" to petitioner, and (3) \"represents a credible threat to the physical safety of the petitioner.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    T.

Here, we agree with respondent that the record lacked evidence to\n   support the conclusion that petitioner was in \"imminent danger of further abuse\" or that respondent presented a \"credible threat\" to petitioner's physical safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The court appeared to conclude that, given the parties' volatile history, respondent presented a credible threat. However, the nature of the parties' relationship changed once they no longer lived together, which we have treated as significant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    C. M. V. v.

Since the May 2017 incident, there have been no physical or volatile interactions between the parties; they have had very limited contact, mainly to discuss the parenting plan. We acknowledge that \"[a]n overt threat of physical violence is not required\" to prove that respondent posed a credible threat, and that a trial court \"may consider testimony regarding events outside the 180-day window.\"\n   <em>\n    Hubbell v.

However, given that the parties were living apart without further incident and had very little contact, and given the evidence of prior incidents of violence in this particular case, the record here does not establish an imminent danger of further abuse or that respondent represents a credible threat to petitioner's physical safety.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burns\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12412152\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/284/366/#p367\">\n    284 Or.
