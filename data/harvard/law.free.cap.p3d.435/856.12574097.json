Ecology moved to dismiss the appeal, arguing that the Board did not have jurisdiction over the Certificate of Need. The Board agreed, and dismissed the appeal. The Operators appealed to the superior court and the superior court reversed the Board's order of dismissal. Ecology appealed from the superior court's decision reversing the Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 We hold that the Board did not have jurisdiction to hear the Operators' appeal of the Petition's Certificate of Need.

The Operators did not appeal the application as a whole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 Ecology moved to dismiss the Operators' appeal, arguing that the Board did not have jurisdiction over the Petition's Certificate of Need.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Operators argued that because the Petition's Certificate of Need was a \"certificate,\" the Board has jurisdiction to hear their appeal under RCW 43.21B.110(1)(d).

In contrast, the Board found that the \"EPA's use of the word 'certificate' in its regulations to describe the items required in a Petition for a [no-discharge zone] from a state [was] not determinative of the Board's jurisdiction.\" AR at 719.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 The Board noted that Washington had discretion under the Clean Water Act (CWA)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   to determine that it wants to protect its waters at a higher level than the federal standards provide.

Specifically, they argue that the Board (1) has jurisdiction because RCW 43.21B.110(1)(d) grants the Board jurisdiction over \"certificates,\" (2) has heard other appeals over certificates issued by Ecology related to \u00a7 401 of the CWA and to the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (3) relied on inapplicable authority, (4) is the only available forum to review the Certificate of Need, and (5) erred by finding that there are no objective standards for reviewing \"Ecology's actions.\" Br. of Resp't at 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b613 The Board's power to hear appeals is limited to adjudication-that is, resolving the specific rights of a specific person or persons. Because the portion of the Petition under the heading Certificate of Need does not address the specific rights of specific persons, it does not fall within the Board's jurisdiction. Consequently, the Board correctly dismissed the Operators' appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Legal Background-Clean Water Act &amp; Vessel Discharge\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b614 The CWA prohibits states from adopting or enforcing regulations related to sewage\n   discharge from vessels.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201322\">\n    33 USC \u00a7 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(1)(A).

The Operators contend that Ecology has sought to \"draw out the litigation,\" evidenced by Ecology opposing the Operators' motion to stay and moving to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. Suppl. Br. of Resp't at 9. The Operators appear to suggest that it was unfair for Ecology to engage in the adversarial proceeding that the Operators initiated in the forum that the Operators chose. The Operators have not provided any evidence that Ecology failed to do something it was required to do or that Ecology did something that it was not permitted to do. Thus, the Operators' policy argument fails.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
