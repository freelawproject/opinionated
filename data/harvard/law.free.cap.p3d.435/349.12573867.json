Appeals S-18-0091 and S-18-0092 relate to Rolly Redland's counterclaim to remove his sister, Lisa Kimsey, as co-trustee for allegedly breaching her fiduciary duties and interfering with trust administration. Appeal S-18-0093 concerns Ms. Kimsey's request to terminate the trust because she claims it is invalid and otherwise fails to achieve the settlors' intended purposes. After a five-day trial, the district court decided not to remove Ms. Kimsey as co-trustee or terminate the trust.

In his complaint, Robert requested temporary and permanent injunctions to preclude Mr. Heiser from acting as the third co-trustee and to prohibit further trustee meetings pending further order of the court. Robert also requested a declaratory judgment that the Redland Family Trust is dysfunctional, or alternatively, that the beneficiaries select a new trustee to replace Mr. Heiser.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rolly filed a counterclaim to remove Robert as co-trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [\u00b68] Robert resigned as co-trustee in September 2013, appointed Lisa as his successor, and added Lisa as a co-plaintiff in the litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lisa moved to terminate the trust, claiming it was impossible to administer due to dysfunction caused by the two factions within the family-Robert and Lisa on one side, and the remaining Redland children on the other. Lisa further argued the trust could no longer achieve its purposes because the family members could not work together, and the family could not obtain preferential tax treatment for a business trust. Rolly opposed the motion, asserting res judicata barred Lisa's claim because the district court previously\n   determined the trust, as amended, was valid. The district court reserved Lisa's motion for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b69] Later in the proceedings, Rolly moved to dismiss the complaint as moot; the district court partially granted Rolly's motion. With the court's permission, Robert and Lisa filed an amended complaint\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   on May 6, 2015, which named the other beneficial owners as defendants and asserted the following causes of action: (1) Dissolution of the Trust,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) Injunction,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (3) Declaratory Judgment, (4) Adoption of Operating Agreement, (5) Appointment of Third Trustee, and (6) Enforcement of Trust Agreement Provision on Distribution. Rolly filed a counterclaim seeking Lisa's removal as co-trustee and attorney's fees and costs. Kendrick, Roalene, and Teresa answered separately, but did not assert a counterclaim to remove Lisa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [\u00b610] Prior to trial, Robert moved the court to compel the trustees to create and distribute funds to a marital trust as required by the amended trust. After a hearing on Robert's motion, the district court ordered the trustees to create and fund the marital trust, provide an accounting to the beneficiaries and the court from the date of Irene's death through the present, and provide transcripts of all future trustee meetings. In compliance with the court's order, Robert and Lisa filed an accounting on January 4, 2017, along with a transcript of the most recent trustees' meeting, wherein Lisa advocated to approve Robert's request for distributions to the marital trust and reimbursement for trust expenses Robert personally paid through the years. The court took no further action on Robert's motion prior to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [\u00b611] A five-day bench trial commenced on February 27, 2017. At the trial's conclusion, the district court requested additional briefing on the tax issues raised, whether Robert and Lisa could challenge the validity of the trust post-\n   <em>\n    Redland I\n   </em>\n   , and whether the Uniform Trust Code (UTC) or common law governed the trust. The parties complied and also submitted written closing arguments and extensive proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [\u00b612] The district court issued its decision letter on November 3, 2017. With respect to the issues on appeal, the district court did not remove Lisa as co-trustee because it determined Lisa did not violate any fiduciary duties and Rolly failed to show gross and willful misconduct to justify Lisa's removal. The district court also did not terminate the Redland Family Trust, concluding: (1) Lisa's claims that the trust is invalid should have been raised in the original trust challenge; (2) \"the main and most important reason for the Trust, i.e., to keep the lands and leases together for the Redland family, has not been frustrated\" regardless of any adverse tax consequences; (3) \"although progress is slow in light of the positions of the Trustees, it is functional from an administration standpoint;\" and (4) the trust is not \"unlawful, contrary to public policy, or impossible.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court entered an order and judgment incorporating its decision letter on December 13, 2017.

There has been hostility between the desires Lisa Kimsey has and the desires for the Trust that Rolly Redland has. While there were only two Trustees they were at an impasse. Since the third Trustee has been appointed by the Court that impasse has been eliminated. It is true the Trustees have the sole obligation to manage the Trust assets. The Trustees could kick everyone off the holdings and require bids from the beneficial owners or third parties, or require the Trust beneficiaries or third parties to negotiate for utilization of the Trust property. They however have chosen to allow usage by the beneficiaries. That is but one of the options available to them. It has been difficult for the Trustees to accommodate other beneficial owners' usage along with their own. They have essentially resorted to what has worked in the past. They have found that to be workable, albeit not to everyone's satisfaction. The fact that the Trustees consult from time to time with the beneficiaries is their decision. It's not right it's not wrong. The fact that they sometimes don't consult with the beneficiaries is their decision. It's not right, it's not wrong. They have an obligation to manage the Trust as they can agree.\n   <strong>\n    Great weight is given to the selection of Lisa Kimsey as Trustee since her selection was made by Robert Redland, one of the original settlors.\n   </strong>\n   Likewise, Rolly Redland was appointed to replace Irene Redland.

Duty of Impartiality\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   [\u00b634] Rolly contends Lisa improperly advocated for Robert over the other beneficiaries. First, Rolly points to Lisa's failure to assist him (after many demands) in obtaining Robert's signature on assignment documents to convey trust property to the trust as ordered by the district court. Lisa testified that she did not ask Robert to sign the transfer documents as Rolly requested because Robert moved to stay the district court's order pending an appeal. Lisa admitted that she did not assist Rolly after the district court denied the stay but claimed her assistance was unnecessary because Rolly already took steps to transfer the property. The district court weighed the conflicting evidence on this issue and reasonably concluded that Lisa's inaction did not amount to a violation of her fiduciary duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   [\u00b635] Moreover, Rolly failed to demonstrate that Lisa's inaction seriously harmed the trust.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   Mismanagement of the estate arising from a misconception or misunderstanding of the trustee's duties may be a ground for removal, but not if\n   <strong>\n    no serious harm has been done\n   </strong>\n   and no dishonesty or want of capacity is indicated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <em>\n    Forbes\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 32,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6895410,6895467\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/341/1041/\">\n    341 P.3d at 1052-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted) (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shriners Hosps. for Children\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 94,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6800356\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/373/392/\">\n    373 P.3d at 415-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Forbes\n   </em>\n   ). Rolly, as co-trustee, successfully transferred all of the state leases and BLM allotments by providing to the agencies a copy of the court order and copies of the amended trust, and he obtained a contempt order to transfer the Manderson Farm. Thus, even if Lisa should have actively participated in transferring trust property while Robert appealed the district court's order, the record supports the district court's determination that Lisa's inaction did not hamper transfer of the trust property or otherwise seriously harm the trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   [\u00b636] Rolly also claims Lisa's request to fund the marital trust and her insistence that the trust reimburse Robert for alleged trust expenses he personally paid reflected her lack of impartiality.

The 1995 Amendment required the trustees to establish a marital trust to provide income for the survivor of Robert or Irene. The record shows that the trustees did not establish or fund the marital trust as required by the trust's terms. Lisa advocated for compliance with the trust's terms and for reimbursement of trust expenses Robert personally paid so that the trustees could determine if funds were available to make distributions of net\n   income to all of the beneficial owners. The district court correctly determined that these circumstances did not reflect partiality or rise to the level of gross and willful misconduct as required to justify Lisa's removal as a settlor-appointed co-trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

In light of Lisa's and Rolly's allegations and testimony concerning hostility, dysfunction, and difficulty administering the trust, and in the absence of any authority to suggest Lisa's request as a co-trustee to terminate the trust amounts to a breach of loyalty, the district court's determination that Lisa did not violate her duty of loyalty stands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Hostility\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   [\u00b639] Finally, Rolly claims Lisa's hostility toward the other beneficiaries and failure to communicate with them has hampered trust administration and therefore warrants her removal. As the district court correctly noted, \"[h]ostility between the trustee and the beneficiaries of the trust alone is insufficient to require the removal of the trustee. To be sufficient to require removal, the hostility must interfere with the proper administration of the trust.\"\n   <em>\n    Forbes\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 96,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6895410,6895467\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/341/1041/\">\n    341 P.3d at 1065\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). The district court found that even though Rolly and Lisa were at an impasse over some trust matters at times, Mr. Frank's appointment as the \"tie-breaker\" trustee alleviates deadlocked situations. The record supports this finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   [\u00b640] At trial, both Rolly and Lisa discussed the hostility between the two factions of beneficial owners. Despite such hostility, the evidence at trial demonstrated the parties were able to resolve their differences to the extent necessary to permit the beneficiaries to utilize the trust property both before and after the appointment of a tie-breaker trustee. Specifically, Mr. Frank, the third (tie-breaker) trustee, testified that, although there is tension over usage of trust property, the beneficiaries follow the decisions made by the majority of the trustees even if disagreement exists with respect to the decision. One of the beneficiaries, Kendrick, testified that trust administration has improved with the appointment of Mr. Frank:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   A. ... since Dan Frank, that third trustee has come on, he has a very real understanding of how to run this type of an operation, and they are making good strides now of rolling this sucker back in and making it work.

For example, the district court required the trustees to set procedures for trustee meetings and file transcripts of those meetings with the court. The district court ordered the trustees to retain an impartial CPA within 60 days and set additional deadlines to pay out any net income for 2013 through 2016 after learning the trustees failed to determine and distribute the trust's net income for those years. The district court also ordered the trustees to establish and fund the marital trust, determine whether Robert is entitled to reimbursement for alleged trust expenses he personally paid, and determine whether the trust has an obligation to pay prior uncashed divided checks.

Depending on when the violation occurred, the trust may be invalid at its inception or it may become invalid at a later date. The invalidity may also affect only particular provisions. Generally, a trust has a purpose which is illegal if\n    <strong>\n     (1) its performance involves the commission of a criminal or tortious act by the trustee; (2) the settlor's purpose in creating the trust was to defraud creditors or others; or (3) the consideration for the creation of the trust was illegal.\n    </strong>\n    See Restatement (Third) of Trusts Section 28 cmt. a (Tentative Draft No. 2, approved 1999); Restatement (Second) of Trusts Section 60 cmt. a (1959). Purposes violative of public policy include those that tend to\n    <strong>\n     encourage criminal or tortious conduct, that interfere with freedom to marry or encourage divorce, that limit religious freedom, or which are frivolous or capricious.\n    </strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Restatement (Third) of Trusts Section 29 cmt. d-h (Tentative Draft No. 2, 1999); Restatement (Second) of Trusts Section 62 (1959).\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    <em>\n     Shriners Hosps. for Children\n    </em>\n    , \u00b6 47,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6800356\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/373/392/\">\n     373 P.3d at 407\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added).

She notes that the tax accountant included the value of Irene's one-seventh share of trust assets in Irene's federal estate tax calculations because federal regulations treated the trust as a \"grantor trust\"-as opposed to an irrevocable trust-due to the initial trustees' power to control the trust assets and Irene's right to possess and enjoy the trust property during her lifetime. Irene passed in 2007 and the parties were apprised of the taxation issues related to her estate at that time. Since then, none of the parties have requested modification of the trust terms to meet tax objectives as we would expect if, as Lisa argues, failing to meet those objectives defeated the dominant purpose of the trust.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%204-10-417\">\n     Wyo.
