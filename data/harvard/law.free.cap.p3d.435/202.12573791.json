The State charged him with three first-degree felonies in juvenile court. After a preliminary hearing, the juvenile judge bound over Van Huizen to the district court to be tried as an adult. There, Van Huizen pled guilty to lesser charges and the district court judge sentenced him to prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 While he was serving his prison sentence, Van Huizen discovered that the juvenile judge who presided over his preliminary hearing was married to the Chief Criminal Deputy for the Weber County Attorney's Office-the office that prosecuted him on behalf of the State. Van Huizen moved to reinstate the time to appeal his bindover order, which the district court granted. He argued on appeal that the juvenile judge should have recused herself from his case because of her spouse's position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 The court of appeals agreed and vacated the juvenile judge's bindover order. In its ruling, the court made two holdings that are the subject of this petition. First, the court did not require Van Huizen to show either that he had preserved his judicial bias claim in the trial court or that an exception to preservation applied. The court reasoned that Van Huizen did not need to preserve his claim because he was not aware of the judge's conflict and was therefore unable to\n   raise it. Second, the court held that Van Huizen was entitled to have the bindover decision vacated, even without showing that the judge's conflict caused him prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 We must first determine whether it was error to excuse Van Huizen from preserving his claim of judicial bias. Because we conclude it was, we do not reach whether such a claim can be successful without a showing of prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 We reverse the decision of the court of appeals and reinstate Van Huizen's conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 At sixteen years old, Cooper Van Huizen participated in an armed robbery with four other individuals: a 17-year-old friend and three men he did not know who were all 18. Together, they took two revolvers and one airsoft gun from Van Huizen's house and threatened their way into the home of an acquaintance. They stole a small amount of marijuana, a wallet, and a phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 Though the victim and a co-defendant variously claim that Van Huizen brandished one of the guns, carried a knife, or was the one who stole the wallet and phone, the record is not conclusive as to any of these facts. Van Huizen denies carrying a gun or knife. Though Van Huizen did not plan the robbery, the record shows that he participated in a text conversation about the robbery before it occurred, participated in the robbery, and obtained his father's guns for the group to use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    A. Bindover from Juvenile Court\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68 The Weber County Attorney's Office charged Van Huizen in juvenile court with two counts of aggravated robbery and one count of aggravated burglary-crimes that qualified as serious felonies under the Serious Youth Offender Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 78A-6-702 (2013).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Van Huizen was sixteen or older and accused of offenses listed in the Act, the statute required the State to charge Van Huizen in a criminal information rather than a petition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78A-6-702(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b69 At a preliminary hearing, the juvenile judge found the State had met its burden of proving there was probable cause to believe Van Huizen committed the offenses charged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78A-6-702(3)(a). Under the Serious Youth Offender Act, the judge then had to determine whether Van Huizen could establish by clear and convincing evidence that \"it would be contrary to the best interest of the minor and the best interests of the public\" to bind Van Huizen over to the district court to be tried as an adult.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The judge ultimately concluded Van Huizen should be bound over to district court.

District Court Plea, Sentencing, and Post-Conviction Motions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b610 In the district court, represented by new counsel, Van Huizen pled guilty to two counts of robbery as second degree felonies.\n   <em>\n    Van Huizen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12341041\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/392/933/\">\n    2017 UT App 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12341041\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/392/933/\">\n    392 P.3d 933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The other charges were dismissed. The district court sentenced Van Huizen to two concurrent sentences of one to fifteen years in prison.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b611 Van Huizen filed several post-trial motions in the district court, including a motion to reinstate his time to appeal the bindover order and a motion to quash the bindover order. The district court denied most of Van Huizen's motions, but did reinstate his opportunity to appeal the bindover order with the agreement of the State. Van Huizen appealed the district court's decisions on all his post-conviction motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    C. Court of Appeals Decision\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b612 Before the court of appeals, Van Huizen argued that the juvenile judge should have recused herself under rule 2.11 of the Utah Code of Judicial Conduct because she\n   was married to the Chief Criminal Deputy of the office that prosecuted him.\n   <em>\n    Van Huizen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12341041\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/392/933/\">\n    2017 UT App 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12341041\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/392/933/\">\n    392 P.3d 933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Van Huizen also raised two additional grounds to vacate the bindover order-ineffective assistance of his juvenile court counsel and plain error of the juvenile court with respect to the application of the Serious Youth Offender Act.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. The court of appeals addressed only the appearance of partiality issue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b613 The court of appeals held that the juvenile judge's undisclosed marriage to the Chief Criminal Deputy-an attorney in the \"chain of command\" at the prosecuting county attorney's office-created an appearance of partiality.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46. It is undisputed that Van Huizen did not raise this issue in the juvenile court, and the juvenile judge did not have an opportunity to address it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50 n.15. But the court of appeals concluded that the usual rules of preservation did not apply to this claim because the judge had not disclosed the relationship on the record and therefore Van Huizen did not know about it and could not have raised it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court also held that Van Huizen did not need to show he was prejudiced by the judge's alleged partiality to prevail on his claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59. The court vacated the bindover order and remanded for a new hearing in juvenile court before a different judge.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b614 The State and Van Huizen cross-petitioned for certiorari. We granted the State's petition on two issues: (1) whether the court of appeals erred in concluding that preservation did not apply to Van Huizen's judicial bias claim, and (2) whether it was error to allow Van Huizen to prevail on this claim without a showing of prejudice because the judge did not disclose the relevant facts on the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b615 Although we did not grant Van Huizen's cross-petition for certiorari, we permitted him to raise the issues he included in his petition as alternative grounds for affirmance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We have jurisdiction to hear this case pursuant to Utah Code section 78A-3-102(3)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b616 \"On certiorari, we review the court of appeals' decision for correctness.\"\n   <em>\n    PC Riverview, LLC v.

PRESERVATION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b617 We must decide as a preliminary matter whether Van Huizen's judicial bias claim is exempt from the preservation requirement. We conclude it is not. As with any other claim, Van Huizen must have raised this issue in the trial court or be able to show that an exception to preservation applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b618 Before the court of appeals, the State argued that the court must review Van Huizen's judicial bias claim for plain error because he did not raise it in the juvenile court. The court of appeals rejected the State's contention, reasoning that Van Huizen need not have preserved his claim because he did not have the opportunity to raise the issue in the juvenile court.\n   <em>\n    State v. Van Huizen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12341041\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/392/933/\">\n    2017 UT App 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 50 n.15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12341041\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/392/933/\">\n    392 P.3d 933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court concluded that the juvenile judge had the \"duty to disclose facts relevant to disqualification in the first instance\" and, because she did not, the preservation rule did not apply to Van Huizen's claim of judicial partiality.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12341041\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/392/933/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This was error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b619 We agree that judges are obligated to disclose facts relevant to disqualification. But when a litigant alleges undisclosed judicial bias for the first time on appeal, such a claim is not immune from preservation rules. Rather, when a litigant was truly\n   <em>\n    unable\n   </em>\n   to raise a claim-including a claim of judicial bias-at the trial level, the litigant is likely to be able to show that an exception to preservation applies. But a preservation analysis must still take place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b620 While the court of appeals' contrary holding is incorrect, it is understandable. The court of appeals relied on our decision in\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. D.B.\n   </em>\n   , in which we stated that a juvenile defendant had \"no obligation to preserve a claim of which he received no notice.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6980372\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/289/459/\">\n    2012 UT 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6980372\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/289/459/\">\n    289 P.3d 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, we note that even under a proper exceptional circumstances analysis, Van Huizen has not sufficiently shown that he was unable to raise an objection to the juvenile judge's participation in his case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b624 Van Huizen submitted affidavits from his parents and himself stating that they did not become aware of the identity and position of the juvenile judge's spouse until after Van Huizen's conviction and after the time to appeal the bindover order had expired. But the record suffers from a significant inadequacy-there is no affidavit from Van Huizen's juvenile court counsel that he did not know of the juvenile judge's marriage to the Chief Criminal Deputy. Aside from some circumstantial indications in the record that the juvenile judge and counsel were unacquainted, Van Huizen does not support his assertion that his counsel could not have raised the issue of partiality in the juvenile court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b625 The State argued in the court of appeals that the juvenile judge could have made an off-the-record disclosure to Van Huizen's counsel or assumed counsel knew of the relationship.\n   <em>\n    Van Huizen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12341041\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/392/933/\">\n    2017 UT App 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 37 n.11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12341041\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/392/933/\">\n    392 P.3d 933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But while the term \"officer\" would likely include the elected County Attorney, it does not unequivocally encompass the Chief Criminal Deputy. As the court of appeals correctly noted, \"it is unclear whether he was 'elected or appointed' to his position ... as understood by the term's definition.\"\n   <em>\n    Van Huizen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12341041\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/392/933/\">\n    2017 UT App 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 26,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12341041\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/392/933/\">\n    392 P.3d 933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Indeed, no matter what the result of the bindover, Van Huizen would have still been subject to a criminal trial in juvenile court and a conviction could have been obtained there.

ALTERNATIVE GROUNDS FOR AFFIRMANCE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b638 Van Huizen raises two alternative grounds for reversal of the bindover decision. First, he argues that his counsel was ineffective at the bindover hearing for failing to inform the court of the 2013 amendments to the Serious Youth Offender Act and for failing to prepare and present a case for retention. Second, Van Huizen argues that the juvenile judge misinterpreted the Serious Youth Offender Act by failing to adequately consider factors for retention that existed in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b639 The State argues that we do not have jurisdiction to consider these additional grounds. Both grounds were raised and expressly not addressed in the court of appeals.\n   <em>\n    Van Huizen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12341041\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/392/933/\">\n    2017 UT App 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12341041\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/392/933/\">\n    392 P.3d 933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For this reason, we decline to reach these arguments and remand to the court of appeals for consideration of Van Huizen's additional claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b641 Preservation rules apply to all claims. If a litigant fails to raise a claim in the trial court because the litigant does not know of the claim, or is otherwise unable to raise it, on appeal the litigant still must show that an exception to preservation applies. If circumstances truly prevented a party from raising a claim, it is likely that the party could successfully invoke an exception to preservation. But the party has the burden of making this showing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b642 Van Huizen did not preserve his claim that the juvenile court judge who handled his case should have recused herself because she was married to the Chief Criminal Deputy of the prosecuting attorney's office. This is not necessarily fatal to his claim. But he did not show that any exception to preservation applies, and that is fatal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b643 We reverse the decision of the court of appeals, reinstate Van Huizen's conviction, and remand to the court of appeals to consider the merits of Van Huizen's additional claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Having recused himself, Justice Pearce does not participate herein; District Judge Brian G.
