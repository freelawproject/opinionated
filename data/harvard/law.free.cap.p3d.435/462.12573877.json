Spooner argues the trial court erred by precluding her from using Brown's grand jury testimony to impeach Brown's credibility at trial and directing a verdict on her simple negligence claim. We affirm the preclusion of Brown's grand jury testimony and hold that a law enforcement officer is not subject to civil liability for simple negligence arising from an investigation into criminal activity. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 In 2009, Brown, a detective with the Phoenix Police Department, began investigating Spooner's financial relationship with ninety-five-year-old Mary B. At a 2011 grand jury proceeding, Brown testified about her investigation, and the grand jury indicted Spooner for three counts of theft from a vulnerable adult and one count of unlawful use of a power of attorney. The State later dismissed the criminal charges, and Spooner then filed suit against the City asserting purported constitutional violations, simple negligence, gross negligence, intentional infliction\n   of emotional distress, and malicious arrest. Spooner supported these claims with allegations that Brown lied to the grand jury, withheld exculpatory evidence, and failed to properly investigate Spooner's relationship with Mary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 After the close of evidence in an eight-day civil jury trial, the trial court entered judgment as a matter of law in the City's favor on Spooner's claims for simple negligence, malicious arrest, and constitutional violations. The jury then found for the City on the claims for gross negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Spooner timely appealed the final judgment, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to Arizona Revised Statutes (A.R.S.) \u00a7\u00a7 12-120.21(A)(1)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and -2101(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

She argues, however, that the trial court deprived her of due process when it precluded her use of Brown's grand jury testimony for impeachment purposes at trial. The court precluded the testimony after finding both: (1) that \"allowing introduction of the grand jury testimony ... would effectively operate to circumvent the absolute immunity of [a grand jury] witness,\" and (2) that the probative value of the testimony was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice and confusion of the issues-namely, \"the appropriate scope of the use of the grand jury testimony relative to the remaining liability claims.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 Spooner argues that evidence of Brown's purported false testimony to the grand jury is relevant to Brown's credibility, relying upon\n   <em>\n    Marshall v.
