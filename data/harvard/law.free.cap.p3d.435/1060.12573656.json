On September 29, 2017, while monitoring surveillance video, a retail store's loss-prevention employee saw Morris select a pair of sunglasses from a display, cut off and discard the price tag, and put them on. The employee called police to report that Morris was shoplifting. She continued to watch Morris and saw him select a package of condoms and an energy drink from the store's shelves and put them in his shopping cart on top of his backpack, which he had placed there after wearing it into the store. Later, she saw Morris manipulate the backpack, and the condoms and energy drink were no longer visible; the employee believed Morris had placed the items into the backpack. When police arrived, the loss-prevention employee showed the officer video of Morris cutting the price tag off the sunglasses. She also told the officer she had seen Morris conceal items in his backpack and showed him the portions of the surveillance video she believed showed the concealment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 In that video, Morris selected two small boxes from shelves in the pharmacy and placed them in the cart with the backpack. One of the boxes-purple with a white side panel-was visible in front of the backpack as Morris later navigated through the toy department.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Morris remained in view as he pushed the cart out of the toy department and down a main aisle to the electronics department. As he traveled through the electronics department for the next eighty seconds, Morris and the cart were obscured behind displays most of the time, and when the cart was briefly visible during that time, the view of the purple and white box was obscured. Morris then pushed the cart down an aisle towards the camera and came back into view; his hands were manipulating the backpack, and when the place where the purple and white box had been came into view, the box was missing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Morris put several other items in the cart's basket during the two hours he was in the store, but he returned many of them to the store's displays before approaching the store's self-checkout registers. Once at a register, Morris scanned the items remaining in the cart but not the sunglasses, energy drink or condoms. He then attempted to pay for the items he had scanned, but the credit card he used was declined several times. While Morris was still at the register, police officers approached him, told him they suspected him of shoplifting and escorted him to the loss-prevention office. There, they formally placed him under arrest for shoplifting based on his failure to pay for the sunglasses and concealment of items in the backpack.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 After a check of Morris's criminal history revealed previous convictions on similar charges, police decided to arrest Morris for a felony. They then searched the backpack and found the condoms and energy drink, and also narcotics, drug paraphernalia and a loaded handgun. A grand jury indicted Morris on counts of prohibited possession of a weapon, possession of methamphetamine, possession of heroin and possession of drug paraphernalia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 Morris filed a motion to suppress the items police had found in his backpack, arguing his arrest was unlawful and that, in any event, the search was not valid as incident to the arrest. After an evidentiary hearing, the trial court granted the motion to suppress, finding there had been no probable cause to arrest Morris for shoplifting and the evidence from the backpack was inadmissible as fruit of the unlawful arrest. The court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant did not conceal the sunglasses, but instead, placed the sunglasses in plain view on his head. Furthermore, neither the deputies, nor the loss prevention officers, saw Defendant conceal the [condoms and energy drink], and therefore had not yet been able to determine if they were, in fact, concealed. In fact, it appears that loss prevention personnel took no steps to determine whether the [condoms and energy drink] were among the many\n   items that Defendant had apparently returned to store shelves.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Because Defendant was still at the point of sale, he had not yet taken the items from the store without paying the purchase price. In fact, he maintained the ability to pay for all of the items, return the items, or leave the items at the register when the debit card was declined. While he had removed a price tag, Defendant could have sought assistance to pay the purchase price, returned the glasses, or taken any other action that did not constitute theft. In short, because Defendant was detained before either leaving or attempting to leave the store with unpaid items, there was no probable cause to arrest him for shoplifting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 After the trial court granted the state's subsequent motion to dismiss the case without prejudice, the state timely appealed the court's grant of Morris's motion to suppress. We have jurisdiction pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-120.21(A) and 13-4032(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Probable Cause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68 The state argues police had probable cause to arrest Morris for shoplifting the sunglasses and the items found in the backpack, contending that a person need not attempt to leave a store without paying to commit shoplifting. As to the sunglasses, the state notes that Morris cut off and discarded the price tag, put the glasses on his head, and attempted to pay for other items without paying for the sunglasses, and concludes that \"[a] reasonable person, applying common sense, would understand\" that Morris was shoplifting them. The state also argues it was reasonable to believe that Morris had committed shoplifting by concealing items in the backpack because the condoms and energy drink were in the cart, Morris was then seen doing something with his backpack, and the items were no longer there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b69 The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects against \"unreasonable searches and seizures.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Morris asserts that \"goods are only 'obtained' once the person passes the point of sale because it is at that point that the ownership interest in the property transfers to [the] customer.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13-1805(A) (requiring shoplifting offender to \"knowingly obtain[ ]\" goods); A.R.S. \u00a7 13-1801(A)(10) (defining \"[o]btain\" as \"to bring about or to receive the transfer of any interest in property, whether to a defendant or to another\"). Therefore, according to Morris, the customer must pass the point of sale to commit shoplifting under any\n   of the alternatives in \u00a7 13-1805(A). Because Morris had not passed the point of sale, he contends police were only permitted to conduct a brief investigatory stop pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Terry v.

The plain language of \u00a7 13-1805(A)(5) expressly contemplates a situation where \"the person ... obtains ... goods by ... [c]oncealment.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The crime of shoplifting by concealment under \u00a7 13-1805(A)(5) derives from common-law larceny, and the elements of the crimes are substantially similar.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sulavka v.

As support for this contention, Morris notes that \u00a7 13-1805(A)(1)-(3) all explicitly contemplate some deficiency in payment for goods, which, according to Morris, cannot be determined until the person passes the point of sale. He concludes that a point-of-sale requirement should therefore also be read into \u00a7 13-1805(A)(4) and (5). While Morris cites various rules of statutory construction in support of this contention, he does not explain why they support it, and we are unaware of any that do. If anything, the absence of payment language in \u00a7 13-1805(A)(5) expressly included in \u00a7 13-1805(A)(1)-(3) suggests that the absent language should\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be read into \u00a7 13-1805(A)(5).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Moreover, reading such a requirement into \u00a7 13-1805(A)(5) would render it superfluous, because \u00a7 13-1805(A)(1) provides for guilt when a person passes the point of sale with unpurchased items, whether the items are concealed or not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ariz.

Morris contends-and we obviously agree-that such a result would be absurd.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Winegardner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=243%20Ariz.%20482\">\n    243 Ariz. 482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 32,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12565698\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/413/683/\">\n    413 P.3d 683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018) (Lopez, J., dissenting in part and concurring in the result) (discussing shoppers' implied license to handle goods in retail stores). Morris's argument presumes, however, that any time a customer places an item in a shopping bag such that the item is out of view it must constitute \"concealment\" under \u00a7 13-1805(A)(5). While the word \"concealment\" can, in some contexts, simply mean removing an item from sight, it can also mean removing an item from notice or hiding it.\n   <em>\n    Concealment\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). A customer who uses a reusable shopping bag to carry his items from the display area to the point of sale is not hiding the fact that he has the store's merchandise in his bag, even if the individual items are not readily visible. We have no trouble distinguishing the conduct of such customers from Morris's conduct here: enclosing some of the store's goods in his own backpack containing his personal effects, in circumstances where he had no need to do so to carry the items within the store, as they were already in his shopping cart.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    Disposition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b619 Because police had probable cause to arrest Morris for shoplifting by concealment under \u00a7 13-1805(A)(5),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   we vacate the trial court's ruling and remand this matter for further proceedings consistent with this decision.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Because the other box is not distinct in the video, our analysis focuses on the purple and white box.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    While we generally defer to the trial court's factual findings, \"[b]ecause the trial court [was] in no better position to evaluate the video than the appellate court, we have conducted an independent review of the video evidence.\"\n    <em>\n     State v.
