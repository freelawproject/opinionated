Selin served 11 days of jury duty. Bednarczyk obtained a letter\n   from\n   her employer explaining that Bednarczyk would not be able to work or be paid during her jury service and that jury service would create a hardship for both Bednarczyk and her employer. Bednarczyk requested an economic hardship excusal from the court. The court granted Bednarczyk's request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 3 The Appellants filed a complaint against King County, alleging that King County's jury pay disparately excluded jurors from service based on economic status and that jurors were entitled to be paid minimum wage for their service.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Appellants also sought a declaratory judgment ruling that (1) King County's current jury compensation was causing jurors to be disparately excluded based on economic status and (2) King County was violating wage and hour laws by failing to pay jurors minimum wage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 4 King County filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the disparate impact and wage claims and that the Appellants did not have standing for their declaratory judgment action. The superior court granted King County's motion for summary judgment and dismissed the Appellants' disparate impact and wage claims. The superior court did not specifically address the Appellants' standing to bring their declaratory judgment actions.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    The appellants filed a class action complaint against King County. However, no classes were certified in this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    Ryan Rocha also filed additional claims based on racial discrimination under the Washington Law Against Discrimination. Appellants assert that Rocha has moved to Florida and his claims have been voluntarily dismissed. There is no record of a voluntary dismissal in the record before this court. However, because the Appellants do not make any arguments in support of Rocha's claims based racial discrimination, we do not address them.

DISPARATE IMPACT\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    \u00b6 7 The Appellants argue that the superior court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of King County on the disparate impact claim because RCW 2.36.080(3) allows for a disparate impact claim based on economic status. We hold that the superior court properly granted summary judgment on the Appellants' disparate impact claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    1. Disparate Impact Claim Based on Economic Status\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    \u00b6 8 There are two types of disparate impact claims: disparate impact under the Washington Law Against Discrimination (WLAD), chapter 49.60 RCW, and disparate impact under constitutional equal protection principles. The Appellants may not bring a disparate impact claim under the WLAD because the WLAD does not include economic status as a protected class for the purposes of WLAD claims, and the Appellants did not bring an equal protection claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    \u00b6 9 Economic status is not recognized as a protected class under the WLAD. RCW 49.60.030(1). WLAD only protects the \"right to be free from discrimination because of race, creed, color, national origin, sex, honorably discharged veteran\n    or military status, sexual orientation, or the presence of any sensory, mental, or physical disability or the use of a trained dog guide or service animal by a person with a disability.\" RCW 49.60.030(1). Protection from discrimination\n    based on economic status is not enumerated in the WLAD. Therefore, as a matter of law, Appellants cannot bring a disparate impact claim based on economic status under the WLAD.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    \u00b6 10 Disparate impact claims may be brought under the equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 12 of the Washington Constitution.\n    <em>\n     State v. Johnson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451639\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/194/304/#p307\">\n     194 Wash.App. 304\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 307-08,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=374%20P.3d%201206\">\n     374 P.3d 1206\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2016). The Appellants did not plead a disparate impact claim under the equal protection clause in the superior court nor do they argue a constitutional disparate impact claim on appeal. Instead, the Appellants merely cite to a voting case addressing a constitutional equal protection claim. Therefore, we decline to address whether the Appellants established a constitutional disparate impact claim. RAP 10.3(a)(6) ;\n    <em>\n     Cowiche Canyon Conservancy v. Bosley\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1372147\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/118/801/#p809\">\n     118 Wash.2d 801\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 809,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=828%20P.2d%20549\">\n     828 P.2d 549\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1992).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    \u00b6 11 Thus, as a matter of law, the Appellants have failed to show they can bring a disparate impact claim based on economic status under the WLAD or as an equal protection claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    2. Implied Disparate Impact Cause of Action under RCW 2.36.080(3)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    \u00b6 12 Appellants argue that the amount jurors are paid under the jury pay statute ( RCW 2.36.150 )\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    creates a disparate impact based on economic status and violates the\n    no juror exclusion statute ( RCW 2.36.080(3) ). But Appellants did not bring a disparate impact claim under the juror pay statute. Instead, Appellants' disparate impact claim seems to be rooted in the no juror exclusion statute.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    \u00b6 13 The underlying premise of the Appellants' argument is that the amount jurors are paid causes jurors of lower economic status to not be able to serve, and, therefore, the amount jurors are paid has a disparate impact on people of lower economic status. This premise is not disputed. But this premise does not give rise to an implied disparate impact claim under RCW 2.36.080(3).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    \u00b6 14 RCW 2.36.080(3) provides, \"A citizen shall not be excluded from jury service in this state on account of ... economic status.\" However, RCW 2.36.080 does not provide a remedy for alleged violations of this provision. Therefore, the Appellants must show that RCW 2.36.080(3) creates an implied cause of action under the test set out by the Supreme Court in\n    <em>\n     Bennett v. Hardy\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1172067\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/113/912/\">\n     113 Wash.2d 912\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=784%20P.2d%201258\">\n     784 P.2d 1258\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1990).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    \u00b6 15 A cause of action may be implied when a statute \"provides protection to a specified class of persons but creates no remedy.\"\n    <em>\n     Bennett\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1172067\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/113/912/\">\n     113 Wash.2d at 920\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=784%20P.2d%201258\">\n     784 P.2d 1258\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . To determine if an implied cause of action exists, we engage in a three-part inquiry,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n    first, whether the plaintiff is within the class for whose \"especial\" benefit the statute was enacted; second, whether legislative intent, explicitly or implicitly, supports creating or denying a remedy; and third, whether implying a remedy is consistent with the underlying purpose of the legislation.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 920-21,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=784%20P.2d%201258\">\n     784 P.2d 1258\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    \u00b6 16 With regard to the first part of the inquiry, the plain language of the statute protects people from being excluded from jury service based on economic status.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    Therefore, the plaintiffs would be within the class for whose benefit RCW 2.36.080(3) was enacted. Accordingly, the first part of the\n    <em>\n     Bennett\n    </em>\n    inquiry is satisfied.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    \u00b6 17 As to the second part of the inquiry, the legislative intent expressed in RCW 2.36.080(1) and RCW 2.36.080(2) shows that implying a remedy based on juror pay is not consistent with legislative intent. RCW 2.36.080(1) protects the opportunity and obligation for jury service:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n    It is the policy of this state that all persons selected for jury service be selected at random from a fair cross section of the population of the area served by the court, and that all qualified citizens\n    <em>\n     have the opportunity\n    </em>\n    ...\n    <em>\n     to be considered for jury service\n    </em>\n    in this state and\n    <em>\n     have an obligation to serve as jurors when summoned\n    </em>\n    for that purpose.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    (emphasis added). RCW 2.36.080(1) demonstrates that the legislature intended to protect the opportunity to be considered for jury service and to impose the obligation to serve as a juror when summoned, not guarantee the right to actually serve on a jury when summoned.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    \u00b6 18 And RCW 2.36.080(2) specifically expresses the legislature's intent to minimize the burden of jury service-notably without reference to financial considerations. RCW 2.36.080(2) provides,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n    It is the policy of this state to maximize the availability of residents of the state for jury service. It also is the policy of this state to minimize the burden on the prospective jurors, their families, and employers resulting from jury service. The jury term and jury service should be set at as brief an interval as is practical given the size of the jury source list for the judicial district. The optimal jury term is one week or less. Optimal jury service is one day or one trial, whichever is longer.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    RCW 2.36.080(2) demonstrates the legislature's intent to minimize the burden to jurors by limiting the length of jury\n    service, not by focusing on compensating jurors for potential financial burdens.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    \u00b6 19 Read together, the legislature's intent is to ensure that state residents have the opportunity to be considered for jury service, that state residents have an obligation to serve as a juror when summoned, and that any burden is minimized by limiting the amount of time that must be spent in jury service. The legislature did not intend to guarantee jurors be able to serve by providing adequate financial compensation. Therefore, it would be inconsistent with the legislative intent to imply a remedy based on jurors' financial compensation for alleged violations of RCW 2.36.080(3). The second part of the\n    <em>\n     Bennett\n    </em>\n    inquiry is not satisfied.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    \u00b6 20 As to the third part of the inquiry under\n    <em>\n     Bennett\n    </em>\n    , the underlying purpose of the legislation relied on by Appellants is to ensure that state residents have the opportunity to be considered for jury service and the obligation to serve when summoned for jury service. The implied cause of action and remedy sought here-increase in juror pay-is not consistent with the underlying purpose of RCW 2.36.080(3). It is undisputed that the Appellants were included in the master jury pool and continue to be eligible to be summoned for jury service. Therefore, the third part of the\n    <em>\n     Bennett\n    </em>\n    inquiry is not satisfied.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    \u00b6 21 Because an implied cause of action and remedy of increased juror pay is not consistent with the legislative intent or the underlying purpose of the statute, the Appellants have failed to demonstrate that RCW 2.36.080(3) creates an implied disparate impact cause of action based on jury pay. Moreover, RCW 2.36.080(3) prohibits conduct that excludes persons from the opportunity to be considered for jury service based on economic status. Therefore, even if RCW 2.36.080(3) allows for an implied cause of action, which we hold it does not, the Appellants must establish some conduct by King County that excluded them from the opportunity to be considered for jury service based on their economic status.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    \u00b6 22 Here, the Appellants assert that King County's jury pay caused them to ask for an economic hardship excusal, which the court granted. But economic hardship excusals are not exclusions for the purpose of the protections provided by RCW 2.36.080(3). As discussed above, RCW 2.36.080(1) clarifies that the legislature intended to protect the\n    opportunity for people to be considered for jury service and to impose the obligation to serve as a juror when summoned. It is undisputed that the Appellants were, and continue to be, included in the master jury list, and, therefore, the Appellants continue to have the opportunity to be considered for jury service.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    Because economic hardship excusals do not prevent potential jurors from being summonsed for jury duty or from being included in the master jury list, they are not exclusions for the purposes of RCW 2.36.080(3).\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    \u00b6 23 Therefore, King County was entitled to judgment as a matter of law and the superior court properly granted King County's motion for summary judgment dismissing the Appellants' disparate impact claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    C. MINIMUM WAGE\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    \u00b6 24 The Appellants also argue that the superior court erred by granting summary judgment on their claim that King County violated the Washington Minimum Wage Act (MWA), chapter 49.46 RCW. We disagree.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    \u00b6 25 The MWA requires employers to pay certain minimum amounts of compensation to their employees.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    RCW 49.46.020.

According to the evidence summarized in the appellant's amended brief, at pages 5-6, many such requests are granted. Neither the County nor the majority opinion dispute that the lower a citizen's income, the greater the economic hardship caused by these low rates.

This cap on expense payments in no way licenses the effective exclusion of low income citizens from jury service through the absence of other reasonable compensation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    \u00b6 49 The County and the majority counter with the holding in\n    <em>\n     State ex rel.

RCW 2.36.080(3) prohibits excluding jurors on account of economic status. These two provisions are most easily harmonized by reading each by their plain language: the former caps the reimbursement of expenses and the latter prohibits the effective exclusion of citizens on account of low income or assets. Where, as here,\n    exclusion is caused by the absence of any compensation beyond the allowed expense reimbursement, the cap on expenses does not somehow take the prohibition of exclusion out of effect. Each can be given full effect by requiring reasonable compensation beyond the reimbursement of expenses.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    B.\n    <em>\n     The Low Rates of Remuneration Effectively and Directly Exclude Low-Income Citizens from Jury Service\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    \u00b6 52 The County argues that there can be no exclusion under RCW 2.36.080(3), because the economically distressed jurors asked to be excused.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    \u00b6 53 The law is meant to apply to human conduct, not in a linguistic vacuum removed from the realities of that conduct. As Justice Holmes said, \"The life of the law has not been logic: it has been experience.\" Oliver Wendell Holmes, THE COMMON LAW 1 (1881). Jury service is a full time job that can extend from less than a day to weeks. For those with low paying jobs without leave for this purpose, the cost of jury service may be a missed rent payment or skipped meals. For those without understanding employers, jury service may come at the cost of a job. Faced with such risk, the choice to exclude oneself is hardly voluntary.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    \u00b6 54 The source of these Hobson's choices, it must be stressed, is the choice by the County to afford such negligible remuneration for jury service. That structural element of the justice system, the absence of compensation beyond the allowed reimbursement for expenses, makes jury service untenable for many lower income citizens. To say that one voluntarily excludes oneself by declining jury service instead of risking, say, eviction or loan default, is to search the law with blinders. The lack of reasonable compensation compels their self-exclusion from this high privilege of citizenship. The justice system itself excludes many low income citizens on account of economic status in violation of RCW 2.36.080(3).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    III. THE LAW IMPLIES A CAUSE OF ACTION TO ENFORCE THE RIGHT ESTABLISHED BY RCW 2.36.080(3) NOT TO BE EXCLUDED FROM JURY SERVICE ON ACCOUNT OF ECONOMIC STATUS\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    \u00b6 55 It seems odd even to ask whether one deprived of a central right of citizenship guaranteed by statute may enforce that right in the courts. We presume, after all, that the legislature does not intend to engage in futile actions.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Davis v. Wash.

Br. of Resp't at 13. Rather, the County urges, it is more likely the statute was intended to benefit litigants.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    \u00b6 58 This argument is belied by the expressly stated policy behind RCW 2.36.080(3) :\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n    It is the policy of this state that all persons selected for jury service be selected at random from a fair cross section of the\n    population of the area served by the court, and that all qualified citizens have the opportunity ... to be considered for jury service in this state and have an obligation to serve as jurors when summoned for that purpose.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    RCW 2.36.080(1) (citation omitted). The second clause of this provision expresses the legislative design that \"all qualified citizens\" are to have the opportunity for jury service. Qualified, prospective jurors, therefore, are within the class for whose especial benefit RCW 2.36.080(3) was enacted. The majority is correct in concluding that the first element of the\n    <em>\n     Bennett\n    </em>\n    inquiry is satisfied.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    \u00b6 59 The second\n    <em>\n     Bennett\n    </em>\n    inquiry is \"whether legislative intent, explicitly or implicitly, supports creating or denying a remedy.\"\n    <em>\n     Bennett\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1172067\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/113/912/\">\n     113 Wash.2d at 920\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=784%20P.2d%201258\">\n     784 P.2d 1258\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The majority concludes this inquiry is not satisfied for a number of reasons.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    \u00b6 60 First, the majority argues that RCW 2.36.080(2) demonstrates that the legislature's intent in adopting RCW 2.36.080(3) is to minimize the burden to jurors by limiting the length of jury service, not by focusing on compensating jurors for potential financial burdens. The minimization of juror burdens from long trials, though, is not the only purpose of RCW 2.36.080(3) expressly identified by the legislature. As already noted, RCW 2.36.080(1) observes the core policy of ensuring that all qualified citizens have the opportunity for jury service. More to the point, RCW 2.36.080(2) expressly identifies a policy other than minimization of burden. It states:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n    It is the policy of this state to maximize the availability of residents of the state for jury service. It also is the policy of this state to minimize the burden on the prospective jurors, their families, and employers resulting from jury service. The jury term and jury service should be set at as brief an interval as is practical given the size of the jury source list for the judicial district. The optimal jury term is one week or less. Optimal jury service is one day or one trial, whichever is longer.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    \u00b6 61 Thus, just before \"also\" noting the policy of minimizing the burden, the legislature expressly identified the\n    policy of maximizing the availability of residents of the state for jury service. This policy comprehends much more than concern about the length of trials. It, along with the policy of ensuring all qualified citizens the opportunity to serve, is directly served by the prohibition of exclusion on account of economic status found in RCW 2.36.080(3).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    \u00b6 62 Second, the majority contends the second\n    <em>\n     Bennett\n    </em>\n    consideration is not satisfied because the legislature intended to protect the opportunity to be considered for jury service, rather than guarantee the right to actually serve on a jury when summoned. The majority would thus conclude that RCW 2.36.080(3) is met as long as the individual is summoned for jury service, even though financial straits would prevent actual service. In support, the majority draws on the statement of policy in RCW 2.36.080(1) that \"all qualified citizens\n    <em>\n     have the opportunity\n    </em>\n    ... to be considered for jury service.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    \u00b6 63 This contention fails for several reasons. To begin with, the appellants are not demanding a guarantee that they will actually serve on a jury. They ask, rather, that\n    they have the same opportunity to serve as those for whom service does not pose an economic threat.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    \u00b6 64 My principal disagreement, though, lies in the meaning of the phrase \"opportunity to be considered\" in RCW 2.36.080(1). The key language, again, is \"have the opportunity ... to be considered for jury service.\" If this policy is met simply by summoning potential jurors without regard to economic status, then a subsequent express, de jure exclusion on account of poverty from actually serving on a jury would not violate RCW 2.36.080(3). That, of course, would bluntly contradict the plain words of RCW 2.36.080(3) that \"[a] citizen shall not be excluded from jury service in this state on account of ... economic status.\" The essence of this guarantee would be subverted if it is deemed merely a rule of summoning.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    \u00b6 65 The corollary argument is that one is \"considered\" for jury service by being summoned and by being part of the\n    jury pool. Any surface sheen to this argument is lost once the world outside the covers of the dictionary is examined. The policy of RCW 2.36.080(1) is to protect the \"opportunity ... to be considered for jury service.\" Presence in a jury pool is not jury service. The opportunity to be in a jury pool is not the opportunity to sit on a jury when one cannot afford to do so. The opportunity to be in a jury pool is not the opportunity to be considered for jury service for those from whom the law itself exacts a severe economic penalty for that service.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    \u00b6 66 The low rates of remuneration create a structural incentive to self-exclusion from this dignity of citizenship on the part of those who cannot afford to serve with those rates. In some cases, they create the unequivocal need to exclude oneself from this eminent privilege. In the face of this, to say that the opportunity to be considered for jury service is preserved by the opportunity to be in the jury pool leaves little of logic and even less of RCW 2.36.080(3). That argument should be spurned.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    \u00b6 67 The policies of RCW 2.36.080(1) and (2) and the terms of RCW 2.36.080(3) show that the latter is violated by the low rates afforded jurors in King County. Without a right of action, those deprived of the right and privilege guaranteed by RCW 2.36.080(3) are left without recourse. The second\n    <em>\n     Bennett\n    </em>\n    inquiry is met.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    \u00b6 68 The third\n    <em>\n     Bennett\n    </em>\n    inquiry is whether implying a remedy is consistent with the underlying purpose of the legislation. The majority contends this is not met based on the same \"opportunity to be considered\" argument presented above. That argument should not prevail for the reasons set out above. For the same reasons the second\n    <em>\n     Bennett\n    </em>\n    inquiry is satisfied, so is the third.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    \u00b6 69 Each of the considerations in\n    <em>\n     Bennett\n    </em>\n    speak strongly in favor of an implied cause of action. To keep the right established by RCW 2.36.080(3) something more than a hollow linguistic exercise, those deprived of that right must have the ability to vindicate it through legal action.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    IV. THE APPELLANTS HAVE STANDING\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    \u00b6 70 The majority argues the appellants have not shown the injury in fact needed to have standing to seek a declaratory judgment that the County is violating RCW 2.36.080(3). This follows, the majority argues, because if the appellants seek to be excused from jury duty due to economic hardship, they will have been excused due to their own request, not because of the County's actions. Thus, appellants cannot show injury in fact resulting from King County's actions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    \u00b6 71 This argument fails for the reasons set out above. For those with low paying jobs lacking leave for this purpose, serving on a jury with such minute payment may come at the cost of missed payments or a lost job. Excluding oneself from jury service may be the only way to shelter oneself or one's family from these sobering risks. With such realities, the decision to exclude oneself cannot be called voluntary. That decision, rather, is the product of the County's choice to afford such negligible remuneration for jury service. The justice system itself excludes those in such straits on account of their economic status.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    \u00b6 72 When the government causes a citizen, in this manner, to forego a right guaranteed by law, that citizen has suffered an injury in fact. That injury, especially to a\n    right as elemental as jury service, is more than sufficient to warrant recourse to the courts to protect the integrity of the right. The appellants have standing.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    \u00b6 73 Neither the United States nor the Washington constitution announces an economic system. Rather, they prescribe a system of governance and of rights under law. Even in our compromised democracy, the ultimate sovereignty in that system rests with the people. That, in turn, demands a sense of civic engagement and responsibility\n    by the citizenry. The more those are lost, the fainter is that ultimate sovereignty. Jury service nurtures those civic values. It allows the citizen to don an invisible robe and for a time take his or her place in the judicial system, affording a profound source of civic engagement and, one may hope, the lessons that come from it.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    \u00b6 74 RCW 2.36.080(3) means that no one shall be denied that invisible robe due to economic status. The low rates of juror remuneration afforded by King County do just that. They make jury service economically impossible as a practical matter for many low income citizens, thus placing many already near the margins of society even further from the sense of belonging to it. Just as damaging, this failure also robs juries of the perspective of the struggling and the outcast, allowing the interests of the privileged even more purchase in a system we claim is one of equal justice under the law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    \u00b6 75 The low remuneration by King County excludes citizens from jury service in violation of RCW 2.36.080(3). Those injured by this exclusion have recourse to the courts to vindicate their rights under that statute.\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n    Therefore, I dissent.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"*\">\n    <p id=\"p-150\">\n     Judge Bjorgen is serving as a judge pro tempore for the Court of Appeals, pursuant to RCW 2.06.150.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"7\">\n    <p id=\"p-151\">\n     The more difficult issue of the amount of juror compensation needed to avoid such exclusions is not within the scope of this appeal.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
