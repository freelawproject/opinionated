We affirm the tax court's application of Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") section 42-14153(C) and hold that a statutory amendment enacted after the valuation date that changes the method of valuation requires retroactive application to apply to the corresponding tax year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 The parties do not dispute the facts in this case. Siete, Mesquite, Perrin, and Arlington\n   (collectively \"Taxpayers\"), operate electric generation facilities that use renewable energy equipment. As part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Taxpayers received either an investment tax credit or a cash grant in lieu of the credit (either referred to as \"tax incentive\") for a portion of the costs to build their respective facilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 In February of each year, the Department provides a form to facility owners requesting information necessary for the valuation of property. A.R.S. \u00a7 42-14152(A). The Department then calculates the value of renewable energy equipment pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 42-14155 and A.R.S. \u00a7 42-14156 (collectively the \"valuation method\"). Before an amendment in 2014, A.R.S. \u00a7 42-14155(B) directed the Department to value renewable energy equipment at \"twenty per cent of the depreciated cost of the equipment,\" but provided no definition of \"cost.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 In 2013, Siete, Mesquite, and Perrin (the \"2014 Appellants\") each submitted an annual report to the Department for the 2014 tax year reporting the cost of their facilities. The 2014 Appellants' respective reports calculated their cost of the energy equipment by subtracting the amount received in tax incentives from the actual cost. However, the Department disallowed the deducted tax-incentive amounts before applying the valuation method to determine the properties' full cash value (the \"final valuation\"). The Department's refusal to deduct the tax-incentive amounts from the actual cost increased the 2014 Appellants' tax liability. The 2014 Appellants appealed to the State Board of Equalization, which upheld the Department's final valuation. The 2014 Appellants appealed the Board's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 While the 2014 Appellants' appeal was pending in the superior court, the legislature enacted an amendment to A.R.S. \u00a7 42-14155 (the \"2014 Amendment\"). The 2014 Amendment altered the valuation method by specifically allowing taxpayers to deduct tax incentives from the cost of renewable energy equipment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 42-14155(C)(4) (2014). Because the 2014 Amendment did not contain an emergency provision or a retroactivity clause, it became effective on July 24, 2014, the general effective date for legislation enacted during the 2014 session.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. Const. art. 4, pt. 1, \u00a7 1 (3). Eventually, the 2014 tax year dispute resulted in an appeal to this court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Siete Solar, LLC v. Ariz. Dep't of Revenue\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Siete I\n   </em>\n   ), 1 CA-CV 15-0126,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%208620672\">\n    2015 WL 8620672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ariz. App. Dec. 10, 2015) (mem. decision). On appeal, the 2014 Appellants argued the 2014 Amendment should apply to their tax appeal because it became effective before the taxes in question were assessed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3, \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 In August 2014, while the dispute over the 2014 tax year valuations continued, the Department issued the final valuations for the 2015 tax year. Taxpayers had again reported their cost as the actual cost minus the tax incentives. The Department, applying the pre-amended version of A.R.S. \u00a7 42-14155, again disallowed the tax incentive amounts to be deducted from the actual costs before computing the Taxpayers' final valuations. Taxpayers timely appealed the 2015 final determination directly to the tax court pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 42-16204. Taxpayers moved for summary judgment, asserting the Department was obligated to use the valuation method prescribed in the 2014 Amendment for their final valuations. Because the 2014 Appellants' appeal was still pending, the tax court stayed the 2015 tax-year proceedings pending a decision in the prior case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 In\n   <em>\n    Siete I\n   </em>\n   , we concluded that the 2014 Amendment was not retroactive-nor was it a clarification of the law-and thus, it did not apply to the 2014 tax year.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%208620672\">\n    2015 WL 8620672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4, \u00b6 18. After the decision, the Department moved to dismiss the 2014 Appellants' complaint for the 2015 tax year based on issue preclusion and for summary judgment on Arlington's claims. The tax court denied Taxpayers' motion for summary judgment and granted the Department's motions. Taxpayers timely appealed, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 12-2101(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 Taxpayers argue on appeal that the tax court erred by: (1) granting the Department's motion to dismiss the 2014 Appellants' claims based on issue preclusion and granting\n   the Department's summary judgment motion against Arlington based on the decision in\n   <em>\n    Siete I\n   </em>\n   ; and (2) not applying the 2014 Amendment to the 2015 tax year, resulting in the improper denial of Taxpayers' motion for summary judgment on all claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 We review the tax court's dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim,\n   <em>\n    Zubia v.

Although Taxpayers' appeal presents several procedural issues regarding the dismissal of the claims, we confine ourselves to the one substantive issue that is dispositive-whether the Department was required to calculate the 2015 tax year final valuations in accordance with the 2014 Amendment, which was enacted after the valuation date but prior to the date when the Department must determine the final valuation. Statutory interpretation raises questions of law and is reviewed\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Calpine Constr. Fin. Co. v. Ariz.

Taxpayers assert the Department was not required to apply the law as it existed\n   <em>\n    on\n   </em>\n   the valuation date. Instead, they contend, A.R.S. \u00a7 42-14153(C)\"merely fixes the date the parties must use to determine full cash value.\" We understand the Taxpayers' argument to be that the legislature may change the valuation method at any time during the valuation year and the application of the new valuation method to property-as it existed on the valuation date-is not a retroactive application of the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Unless the Legislature States Otherwise, the Law Governing the Valuation Method and Classification of Property is the Law in Effect on the Valuation Date.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 The Department is charged with determining a property's full cash value in accordance with A.R.S. Title 42, Chapter 14. The applicable statutes read as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   On or before August 31 of each year the department shall find the full cash value of the property of each [electric generation facility] that operates in this state.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 42-14153(A).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [T]he department shall determine the full cash value of taxable renewable energy equipment in the manner prescribed by this section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 42-14155(A).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   The valuations required by this section are the values determined as of January 1 of the valuation year.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 42-14153(C).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \"Valuation year\" means ... the calendar year preceding the year in which the taxes are levied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 42-11001(19)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Under these provisions, on or before August 31 of each year, the Department must determine the final valuation of taxable renewable energy equipment as it existed on January 1 of the same year, the valuation date.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The final valuation is then used to assess the tax for the upcoming year-the tax year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b612 Taxpayers make several arguments to support their contention that the valuation date does not \"set\" the law in effect on that date, it is merely a point in time to base the valuation. We disagree for the following reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Final Valuation May be Altered Only Pursuant to Statute.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b613 Taxpayers argue that because the final valuation may be altered after the valuation date, A.R.S. \u00a7 42-14153(C) does not require the Department to use the law that is in effect on that date. As support, they cite A.R.S. \u00a7 42-14004 and A.R.S. \u00a7 42-15105(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   But these statutes do not support Taxpayers' contentions. Although the legislature instructs the Department on the manner and method of valuation, it allows county assessors some discretion.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 42-14155(A) (\"[T]he department shall determine the full cash value of taxable renewable energy equipment in the manner prescribed by this section.\"),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 42-13051(B)(2) (an assessor must determine the full cash value \"using the manuals furnished and procedures prescribed by the department\"),\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Berge Ford, Inc. v.

The statutory framework which provides for the assessment of property contemplates that the assessor will exercise much discretion in deciding classification and valuation.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b614 The Department values renewable energy equipment pursuant to statute. The legislature left no room for the Department to exercise its discretion when it determines the valuation of renewable energy equipment. Although Taxpayers' cited statutes do allow for an alteration of the final valuation, the legislature has only authorized specific tax officers to revalue property under certain circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 42-14004 (the Department may only change the valuation to properly reflect the property's full cash value); A.R.S. \u00a7 42-15105(1) (the county assessor may change a property's classification and value if the nature of the property has changed). Taxpayers have not pointed to-nor have we found-a statute that authorizes the Department to revalue property to account for a change in the valuation method after the valuation date.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

They attempt to separate the valuation method from the valuation characteristics of the property, which are used to classify and appropriately value the property under the applicable valuation method.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aileen H.
