The alleged violation of Defendant's right to a speedy trial arises in a unique context. During the pendency of Defendant's case, the New Mexico Supreme Court determined that multiple counts of possession of child pornography (like those in Defendant's indictment) could only be charged as one count.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Olsson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4239073\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nmsc/2014/012/4239073/\">\n    2014-NMSC-012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=324%20P.3d%201230\">\n    324 P.3d 1230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Consequently, the district court merged the twenty counts of possession of child pornography Defendant faced into one count, dramatically reducing Defendant's exposure from thirty years of incarceration to eighteen months of incarceration. Because we determine that Defendant's right to a speedy trial was not violated, we affirm the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {2} For simplicity, we outline the pertinent timeline here based on the testimony presented at the hearing on Defendant's speedy trial motion, as well as the record and available hearing transcripts. The only testimony offered at the speedy trial hearing was that of Anne Keener, former assistant district attorney who was the prosecutor on the case for most relevant time periods. More details will be included in our discussion as needed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Time Line of Events\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {3} March 7, 2012: Defendant arrested and charged with possession of child pornography.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   March 29, 2012: Defendant indicted on twenty identical counts of possession of child pornography based on his alleged possession of twenty photographs, retrieved\n   by law enforcement from his computer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   April 11, 2012: Defendant arraigned and held in custody on cash bond.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   May 29, 2012: First judge reassignment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   July 20, 2012: Defense counsel, Peter Ortega, entered an appearance and pro forma demand for speedy trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   December 19, 2012: Pretrial conference held for trial set in January 2013, at which the State requested a continuance. Although it was not on the record, Ms. Keener testified that defense counsel stipulated to the continuance. The State represented that the case was not ready for trial and plea negotiations were ongoing. The State further represented that if a plea agreement was not reached, then a superseding indictment with 900 additional counts of possession of child pornography would be filed. The State requested a plea status in thirty days to see if the case could be resolved. The district court took the case off the trial docket and set a hearing for January 30, 2013.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   January 8, 2013: Defendant filed a pro se motion to dismiss his attorney, Mr. Ortega.

Defendant complained that Mr. Ortega was not ready for trial and had not hired an investigator.

The plea agreement called for Defendant to plead guilty to all twenty counts, leaving a sentence of zero to thirty years of incarceration up to the judge; in return, the State would not pursue the additional counts. According to Ms. Keener, Defendant did not reject the plea offer but requested additional time to consider it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   January 6, 2014: The district court held a very brief hearing and permitted Mr. Ortega to withdraw as counsel.

Likewise, in the absence of any explanation from the State whether the listed witnesses would be called at trial, the State's supplemental witness list, which was filed prior to the merger of the counts and listed some thirty-three witnesses, is of little assistance in our analysis. Ms. Keener, however, did testify that proof at trial would require calling multiple witnesses with expertise pertaining to the extraction of data from Defendant's computer. There also was a fairly large volume of discovery from the State in this case (342 pages and two CDs). And Ms. Keener discussed the difficulty and lengthiness of jury selection in child pornography cases.

Defendant first points to the fact that he was arrested on March 7, 2012, but he was not indicted until March 29, 2012. Defendant appears to have been arrested on a magistrate court warrant and therefore was entitled to have a preliminary hearing on or before March 21, 2012.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 6-202(A)(1) NMRA ; Rule 6-104(A)(2) NMRA. The State, however, obtained an enlargement of time from the magistrate court for good cause shown until March 29, 2012, pursuant to the rules.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 6-202(A)(2). The eight-day delay in having a probable cause determination in this case was negligible, was justified by the State before the magistrate court, and will not be held against the State here. Defendant next points to the fact that the case was reassigned to a different judge on May 29, 2012. Defendant does not argue that this reassignment actually caused any delay, nor is it apparent from the record that it did. As such, we do not weigh this period against either party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Upon the State's request at the pretrial conference in December 2012, the trial in January 2013 was vacated, and it does not appear that the trial was reset until after the denial of Defendant's speedy trial motion. During the December 2012 pretrial conference, the State explained that the parties were in plea negotiations and that the case was not ready to go to trial in January. Further, if plea negotiations were not successful, the State planned to add 900 counts through a superseding indictment. Ms. Keener testified that defense counsel was in agreement with the requested continuance. A status hearing then was held in late January 2013, at which it again was represented that the parties were in plea negotiations. In July 2013, the State sent defense counsel a written plea agreement. In December 2013, Ms. Keener, along with defense counsel, personally met with Defendant at the jail to go over the plea and the fact that a superseding indictment would be filed if an agreement was not reached. Additionally, sometime during this period, Ms. Keener met with Defendant's family about the plea, and they expressed that they did not want the State to pursue additional charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {15} During this entire one-year period in which plea discussions were ongoing, Ms. Keener testified that defense repeatedly asked for additional time to consider the plea offer and Defendant apparently did not reject\n   the plea. Defendant, however, expressed his dissatisfaction with his attorney in two pro se motions to dismiss counsel and specifically described his displeasure with his attorney's \"unsavory tactics\" in attempting to persuade him to take a plea. During the December 2013 meeting with Ms. Keener, Defendant, nevertheless, personally requested additional time from the State to consider the plea offer and to postpone the State's pursuit of a superseding indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {16} While the State represented that it continued to leave the plea offer open at the request of the defense and for Defendant's benefit, the State still was under a duty to \"affirmatively seek to move the case to trial, even while plea negotiations [were] pending.\"\n   <em>\n    Maddox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4242786\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/145/242/\">\n    2008-NMSC-062\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 26,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4242786\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/145/242/\">\n    145 N.M. 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4242786\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/145/242/\">\n    195 P.3d 1254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The State argues that the bulk of this time period should be weighed against Defendant because it was time necessary for his newly appointed counsel, Greg Gaudette, to become familiar with the case and discuss the plea offer with Defendant. Without citing to any authority, Defendant argues that this period of time should be weighed neutrally. In support of the State's position, Ms. Keener testified that, after Mr. Gaudette entered his appearance, he needed additional time to review the discovery and requested that the State not file a superseding indictment and not withdraw the plea offer. \"[D]elays sought or caused by defense counsel are ordinarily attributed to the defendant[.]\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The day after the speedy trial motion was filed, the district court set a hearing on the motion for August 4, 2014. The State's response to Defendant's motion was due on July 14, 2014; but the State did not file its response until the day of the scheduled hearing, which was three weeks late.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 5-120(E) NMRA ; Rule 5-104(C) NMRA. A judge reassignment occurred on August 1, 2014, and it is unclear from the record whether the hearing set for August 4, 2014, actually was held, and there is no record of this hearing on appeal. The district court apparently continued the hearing to September 8, 2014, the same date the State filed an amended response to Defendant's speedy trial motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {20} This final two and one-half-month period of delay was not discussed by the parties before the district court; and the record is devoid as to why the district court permitted the late filing of the State's response or why the court continued the speedy trial hearing. The continuance could have been a result of the State's late response or the judge reassignment, or it could have been a result of a stipulated continuance or some other normal delay.

Defendant benefitted from this decision when the district court granted his motion to merge the twenty counts of possession of child pornography into one count.

We, therefore, conclude that Defendant was not deprived of his right to a speedy trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4243125\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/146/499/\">\n    2009-NMSC-038\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 24, 30, 34, 40,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4243125\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/146/499/\">\n    146 N.M. 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4243125\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/146/499/\">\n    212 P.3d 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that the defendant's speedy trial rights were not violated when the first three factors weighed in his favor to some degree, but he failed to put on evidence of particularized prejudice);\n   <em>\n    Montoya\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4250449\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/150/415/\">\n    2011-NMCA-074\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 24,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4250449\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/150/415/\">\n    150 N.M. 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4250449\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/150/415/\">\n    259 P.3d 820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same);\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4246275\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/147/706/\">\n    2010-NMCA-018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 50,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4246275\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/147/706/\">\n    147 N.M. 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4246275\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/147/706/\">\n    228 P.3d 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {28} For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's denial of Defendant's motion to dismiss for violation of his right to a speedy trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {29}\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   WE CONCUR:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   STEPHEN G.
