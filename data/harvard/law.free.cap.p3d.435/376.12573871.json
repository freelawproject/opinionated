Mellott, pled guilty to one felony count of Medicaid fraud related to improper record-keeping, ten felony counts of Medicaid fraud for making false or misleading statements in Medicaid claims when the value of the medical assistance is $500 or more, and two counts of felony forgery. Ms. Mellott appeals her judgment and sentence and the district court's denial of her W.R.A.P 21(a) motion to withdraw her pleas due to ineffective assistance of trial counsel. She argues the State unlawfully charged her with ten felony counts of submitting false statements for more than $500 of medical assistance based on the aggregated values of multiple reimbursement claims of less than $500 each. Ms. Mellott claims her trial counsel provided ineffective assistance because he did not challenge those charges and, instead, advised Ms. Mellott to accept a plea agreement under which she pled guilty to all charges. She also claims her trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to fully investigate all of the charges against her. We conclude there was no factual basis for Ms. Mellott's guilty plea as to Counts 2 through 11 and her trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by advising her to accept the plea agreement. We therefore reverse and remand to the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ISSUES\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b62] Ms. Mellott presents the following issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   1. Does the Wyoming Medicaid Fraud Statute-which denominates every\n   false claim violation as a \"separate offense\"-allow for aggregation of multiple monthly reimbursement claims of less than $500, in order to create a felony charge for a false claim in excess of $500, extending over years of time?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   2. Was there a structural error in using an \"aggregated\" theory of loss to achieve felony charges, that lowers the burden to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   3. Did appellant's appointed attorney, without conducting an investigation, and with inadequate legal analysis, render ineffective assistance of counsel by advising guilty pleas to all the charges lodged below?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b63] When the alleged crimes occurred, Ms. Mellott was a registered nurse and a Medicaid provider through a home healthcare business she owned and operated. Among other services, she served as a case manager for Medicaid Waiver clients and submitted claims for payment to the state Medicaid office for the services she provided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b64] On December 18, 2015, the State charged Ms. Mellott with a total of fifteen felony counts related to her actions as a Medicaid provider. Through an amended information, the State later altered its factual allegations, but did not substantively change the number of counts or the applicable statutes. Count 1 alleged Ms. Mellott violated\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2042-4-111\">\n    Wyo. Stat.

The State alleged Ms. Mellott submitted claims for payment for services that she had not actually provided, specifically, required home visits. Finally, Counts 12 through 15 alleged Ms. Mellott forged two of her clients' signatures on client choice of service and client responsibility forms, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%206-3-602\">\n    Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 6-3-602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(ii) and (b) (LexisNexis 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b65] Ms. Mellott was assigned a public defender (trial counsel), and on June 22, 2016, she changed her pleas to guilty on her trial counsel's advice and pursuant to an oral plea agreement. Under the agreement, Ms. Mellott would plead guilty to all charges, but could argue for any sentence she saw fit. In exchange, the State would recommend a sentence of 3 to 6 years of imprisonment for the inadequate record-keeping charge (Count 1) and concurrent sentences for the false statement and forgery charges (Counts 2 through 11 and Counts 12 through 15, respectively) of 3 to 6 years of imprisonment. The State would recommend suspending the concurrent sentences for Counts 2 through 15 in favor of 6 years of probation, which would run consecutive to the sentence for Count 1. The State also would request restitution in the amount of $107,632.18. Ms. Mellott pled guilty to Counts 1 through 11 and Counts 14 and 15, but she expressed concerns to her trial counsel that she could not truthfully plead guilty to Counts 12 and 13. The State agreed to dismiss those two counts and the district court accepted Ms. Mellott's guilty pleas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b66] At the beginning of its September 27, 2016, sentencing hearing, the district court revisited the plea colloquy to ensure there was a factual basis to support Ms. Mellott's guilty plea as to Counts 5 through 7. The court then sentenced Ms. Mellott to 18 to 24 months of confinement for Count 1 and concurrent suspended sentences of 3 to 6 years of confinement for Counts 2 through 11, 14, and 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b67] Ms. Mellott timely appealed the judgment and sentence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Mellott also moved\n   under W.R.A.P. 21(a) to withdraw her pleas based on the ineffective assistance of her trial counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, Ms. Mellott asserted her trial counsel was ineffective because he did not challenge the legality of the State's basis for Counts 2 through 11, the ten false statement charges under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2042-4-111\">\n    Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 42-4-111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and (b)(i). She claimed the State improperly aggregated the values of numerous Medicaid claims by client to reach the value of $500 necessary to charge Ms. Mellott with felony violations of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2042-4-111\">\n    Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 42-4-111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). As a result, the district court arguably accepted her guilty plea as to felony Counts 2 through 11 without a sufficient factual basis under W.R.Cr.P. 11(f). Second, Ms. Mellott claimed her trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to adequately investigate the case before recommending that Ms. Mellott accept the plea agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b68] At the evidentiary hearing on the W.R.A.P. 21 motion, the district court heard the parties' arguments and testimony from Ms. Mellott, her trial counsel, and several other witnesses. The district court also received exhibits, including a spreadsheet from the State listing information from a database on the Medicaid claims related to the charges against Ms. Mellott.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b69] In the district court's decision letter incorporated into its order denying Ms. Mellott's W.R.A.P. 21 motion, the court characterized the dispositive issue as: \"Whether assistance provided by Appellant's trial counsel was ineffective so as to allow Appellant to withdraw her plea pursuant to W.R.A.P. 21.\" The district court considered and rejected Ms. Mellott's argument that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2042-4-111\">\n    Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 42-4-111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   prohibited the aggregation of individual claims to support Counts 2 through 11; accordingly, the court determined trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise that argument. The district court also found trial counsel was not deficient in investigating the case. Having concluded that trial counsel's performance was not deficient, the district court did not evaluate whether Ms. Mellott was prejudiced by trial counsel's performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b610] Ms. Mellott timely appealed the district court's denial of her W.R.A.P. 21 motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   W.R.A.P. 21(e).

She next argues the State's statutory violation constituted jurisdictional and structural error in the proceedings and that her guilty plea as to Counts 2 through 11 was invalid because, without aggregating multiple Medicaid claims, the evidence in the record did not support her felony convictions under Counts 2 through 11. She further argues her trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by recommending that she plead guilty to all charges instead of challenging the legality of, or factual basis for, Counts 2 through 11.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Ms. Mellott's claims all arise from her interpretation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2042-4-111\">\n    Wyo.

Each count specified a different client regarding whom Ms. Mellott allegedly filed unlawful claims and the applicable period-ranging from 25 to 66 months-during which Ms. Mellott allegedly submitted the unlawful claims. She argues the State could not base each charge-or her conviction for each charge-on the sum value of all alleged unlawful claims for a client because the State must charge each such claim separately to comply with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2042-4-111\">\n    Wyo.

Ms. Mellott challenges the factual basis for her guilty plea as to felony Counts 2 through 11 by arguing the information in the record did not show that the value of any individual alleged statutory violation met the felony threshold. Our review of the record when the district court accepted Ms. Mellott's guilty plea compels us to agree. Because the district court, Ms. Mellott's trial counsel, and the State proceeded under the shared misunderstanding that Ms. Mellott could be convicted of a felony based on the client-aggregated values of multiple Medicaid claims, no one presented or requested evidence of the value of individual, allegedly-unlawful Medicaid claims. At her change of plea hearing, Ms. Mellott's trial counsel conducted the plea colloquy by asking leading questions that simply quoted the charges. At the sentencing hearing, the district court similarly relied on the language of the charges when it revisited the colloquy to cover some portions of the charges defense counsel had inadvertently failed to mention. As a result, Ms. Mellott admitted only that, for each of Counts 2 through 11, the total aggregated value of medical assistance for each client was $500 or greater. Trial counsel therefore recommended that Ms. Mellott plead guilty to charges with no factual basis to support them under the plain meaning of the statutes. As such, Ms. Mellott has established that her trial counsel performed deficiently.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doggett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9182163\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/687/97/#p102\">\n    687 N.W.2d at 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B.

It should analyze the root of the problem with trial counsel's deficient performance-whether the record, viewed in its entirety, contains a factual basis to support Ms. Mellott's guilty plea as to felony Counts 2 through 11 under the correct interpretation\n   of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2042-4-111\">\n    Wyo.

The client-aggregated totals the State provided in a document to support its restitution request at the sentencing hearing did not contain this information. Neither did the evidence the district court received in the W.R.A.P. 21 proceedings, which included testimony from a Department of Health employee regarding a spreadsheet (State's Exhibit D) she had compiled listing every Medicaid claim the State alleged was either a false statement in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2042-4-111\">\n    Wyo.

However, it does not clearly identify the claims where a home visit did not occur (the alleged false statements). The spreadsheet includes two columns that purport to show this information, but the columns conflict. Where one column might indicate a home visit did not occur, the other column might not. The State's witness confused the matter by testifying that each column correctly showed which claims were false statements-an impossible conclusion given the contradictions within the document. The witness also testified that the spreadsheet showed eleven felony-level and 278 misdemeanor-level claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   [\u00b636] The State argues that if it had not aggregated claims to support Counts 2 through 11, the spreadsheet and witness's testimony show the State could have charged Ms. Mellott with eleven felony and 278 misdemeanor false statement charges. Because the district court did not address the exhibit or the witness's testimony in its factual findings, we are left to review that evidence on its face. The clear contradictions in State's Exhibit D preclude any reasonable inference that Ms. Mellott submitted eleven false claims of $500 or more. Nor does State's Exhibit D show there was a false statement of $500 or more for each of the ten clients identified in Counts 2 through 11. We therefore conclude that Ms. Mellott's guilty plea to felony violations of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2042-4-111\">\n    Wyo.

Applying the material prejudice analysis we used in\n   <em>\n    Nguyen\n   </em>\n   , we conclude Ms. Mellott was materially prejudiced by her trial counsel's deficient performance because the district court could not have entered judgment based on Ms. Mellott's guilty plea as to Counts 2 through 11.

In fact, all of the evidence is to the contrary. Starting with Ms. Mellott's affidavit attached to her motion to withdraw her guilty pleas, nowhere does she assert she would have insisted on going to trial if the aggregation issue had been raised. The closest she comes is in paragraph 64, where she asserts, \"If I had known that individual monthly claims for less than $500.00 could have been characterized as misdemeanors, I would never have pleaded guilty to making any false claim that spanned over years, as to each case management client.\" This statement is not an assertion that she would have insisted on going trial. Rather, she simply states that she would not have pleaded guilty to counts with aggregated claims to reach the felony threshold. It also does not mention Counts 1, 14, and 15, which are felonies and are not affected by the aggregation issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   [\u00b646] Ms. Mellott's testimony at the Rule 21 hearing makes the lack of prejudice even more obvious. On seven occasions, she testified that she never wanted to go to trial and that she \"wanted it to be done.\" For example:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   I repeatedly told anyone that would question me or listen to me that I didn't want to go to trial. ... I didn't want to waste the State's money prosecuting me. ... I didn't want my family to have to go through any of it, I didn't want these clients to have to go through any of it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   And, as another example:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   I was tired. I was done fighting. Enough resources had been spent. I needed to move on. It needed to be over for my family, it needed to be over for my community, it needed to be done.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   When the State asked her if she would have insisted on going to trial if she had faced more charges, the necessary alternative if aggregation had not occurred, she replied:\n   <strong>\n    \"I have no idea\"\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    \"I don't know.\"\n   </strong>\n   (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   [\u00b647] The trial court found and relied on these facts in its decision. The district court stated: \"Appellant told (Defense counsel), on several occasions, she wanted to avoid a trial.\" That was a reasonable position for Ms. Mellott to take, because, as the district court found, \"(Defense counsel) ... pointedly asked her if she provided the services for which she billed and which were at issue.

It is unlikely that any defendant who pleads guilty and later wishes to withdraw that plea based on ineffective assistance of counsel would have known of and evaluated counsel's deficient performance before pleading guilty. Instead, this standard requires Ms. Mellott to prove what would have happened if counsel had not made the alleged error. Here, if counsel had not been mistaken about the meaning of the statute, we have no idea what would have ensued because Ms. Mellott failed to offer any evidence on the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   [\u00b651] The majority opinion concludes Ms. Mellott's prejudice is that she faces \"conviction and punishment for a crime she did not commit.\" If that is the prejudice involved, Ms. Mellott had the obligation to prove those things, and she did not. She did not point to any defense she would have raised and did not even show that she would have faced fewer felonies had the State not aggregated the amounts. She never showed that she did not commit the crimes to which she pled guilty. At the hearing on Ms. Mellott's motion to withdraw her guilty pleas, the State's investigator walked through the false claims and testified that, had each fraudulent claim been prosecuted individually, there were still eleven claims that were over $500-sufficient to prosecute as felonies. The remaining claims, if they were prosecuted individually, would have been sufficient for 278 misdemeanors. This testimony came before Ms. Mellott testified, and she did not dispute it. On cross examination of this witness, Ms. Mellott's attorney acknowledged that there were at least eleven, and potentially fourteen, felony claims. Ms. Mellott's attorney asked the State's investigator:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   Q: .... So you would agree that if Claims 2 through 11 had not been aggregated, that there would be 14 potential felony claims?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   A: ...

The non-aggregable claims still exist. The failure to demonstrate what the actual, non-aggregated charges are must weigh against Ms. Mellott, not against the State. She has the burden to establish prejudice and she has failed to carry that burden. Based on her testimony, we can only assume she thought she could have negotiated a better or different deal. Nothing in the record supports that conclusion. And, in any event, it is not the standard we must apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   [\u00b654] The majority opinion equates Ms. Mellott's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel with a claim that there was an insufficient factual basis for her pleas under W.R.Cr.P. 11(f).

However,\n   <em>\n    Nguyen\n   </em>\n   was not based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and did not involve the standards for prejudice based on such a claim. Ms. Mellott, on the other hand, only raised a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.

So are various kinds of state interference with counsel's assistance. Prejudice in these circumstances is so likely that case-by-case inquiry into prejudice is not worth the cost.\n   <strong>\n    Moreover, such circumstances involve impairments of the Sixth Amendment right that are easy to identify, and for that reason and because the prosecution is directly responsible, easy for the government to prevent.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   [\u00b658] This case does not fit within\n   <em>\n    Strickland's\n   </em>\n   description of situations where there is no need to show prejudice. There was no denial of counsel altogether. The situation does not obviously indicate something fundamentally interfered with Ms. Mellott's Sixth Amendment right. To presume prejudice here, or to find it implicit, weakens the requirement that appellants prove prejudice in ordinary ineffective assistance of counsel situations.

Because she did not meet her burden of proving that, had her defense counsel correctly interpreted the statute, she would not have pled guilty and would have received a better outcome than she obtained with her guilty pleas. She has not shown this to be a situation \"which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice.\" I would affirm the trial court's denial of her motion to withdraw her guilty pleas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   [\u00b660] I recognize that by this opinion we have found the statutory basis for some of\n   Ms. Mellott's guilty pleas to be incorrect. If we determine that such a situation permits timely withdrawal of those guilty pleas as \"manifest injustice,\" then perhaps we should adopt such a rule.
