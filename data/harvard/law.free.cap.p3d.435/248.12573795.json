When Karlie Kidd met an undercover Salt Lake City police officer at the Grand America Hotel and asked him for a \"show-up\" fee, she did not possess such a license. She did, however, have an escort services license from Midvale City. Salt Lake City nevertheless cited Kidd for offering escort services without a valid license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 State law authorizes Salt Lake City and Midvale, as well as any other municipality, to impose licensing requirements on employees of sexually oriented businesses. This results in a regulatory scheme where escorts must obtain licenses in each jurisdiction in which they want to operate, if the jurisdiction requires a license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 To Kidd, the statute promotes regulatory overkill and burdens her constitutional rights because the license Midvale issued to her satisfies Salt Lake City's requirements and any legitimate interest the City might have in regulating her profession. Kidd claims that the imposition of multiple licensing requirements violates her First Amendment and Equal Protection rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Because Kidd's First Amendment argument is inadequately briefed and because her Equal Protection claim was not properly raised in the district court, we affirm her conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Kidd and the escort service agency that employed her were licensed to provide sexually oriented business services in Midvale. Kidd was not, however, licensed by Salt Lake City to provide sexually oriented business services in that municipality. To obtain that license, Kidd would have been required to pay a fee and provide her social security number, fingerprints, and criminal history, as well as other personal information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH, CODE \u00a7 5.61.110.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 An undercover Salt Lake City police officer answered Kidd's online advertisement and arranged to meet her at the Grand America Hotel. Upon arrival, Kidd requested a \"show-up\" fee or \"donation.\" The officer provided the payment; additional officers then entered the room. They informed Kidd that they were police, ran a records check, and ascertained that Kidd did not have a Salt Lake City-issued sexually oriented business license. They cited Kidd for violating Salt Lake City Code section 5.61.100.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 Section 5.61.100 provides that \"[i]t is unlawful for any sexually oriented business to employ, or for any individual to be employed by a sexually oriented business in the capacity of a sexually oriented business employee, unless that employee first obtains a sexually oriented business employee license.\" The Salt Lake City Code, like the Utah Code, deems escorts to be employees of sexually oriented businesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 The City defines \"sexually oriented business\" as \"[n]ude entertainment businesses, sexually oriented outcall services, adult businesses, 'seminude dancing bars' and seminude dancing agencies.\" SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH, CODE \u00a7 5.61.040. While this definition does not expressly mention escorts, the City's definition of \"sexually oriented business employees\" does, specifying that \"[a]ll persons making outcall meetings under this chapter, including escorts, ... shall be considered sexually oriented business employees.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Utah Code is also explicit that escort service agencies are \"sexually oriented businesses.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 10-8-41.5(1)(f)(i) (defining \"[s]exually oriented business\" as \"a business at which any nude or partially denuded individual ... performs any service for compensation\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 10-8-41.5(1)(f)(ii) (noting that the term \" '[s]exually oriented business' includes ... an escort service\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 Section 10-8-41.5 of the Utah Code expressly prohibits escorts from providing sexually oriented business services in a city, if the city requires that the employee be individually licensed and the employee has not obtained such a license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 10-8-41.5(2) (\"A person employed in a sexually oriented business may not work in a municipality: (a) if the municipality requires that a person employed in a sexually oriented business be licensed individually; and (b) if the person is not licensed by the municipality.\"). Section 10-8-41.5 therefore mandates that escorts obtain a license in each city in which they want to provide services, if that city requires a license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 Kidd challenged this regulatory framework before the justice court. Kidd asserted that section 10-8-41.5 unconstitutionally prohibited individuals from providing sexually oriented services if they did not satisfy the license requirement of each city in which they wanted to work. Kidd first raised these challenges in justice court, without success. In a trial de novo before the district court, Kidd reiterated her constitutional arguments.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 78A-7-118(1) (providing that, upon timely appeal following sentencing, criminal defendants are generally entitled to trial de novo in district court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 More precisely, Kidd moved to dismiss the charges against her, asserting that section 10-8-41.5 infringed her freedom of expression by authorizing a city to impose \"repetitive licensing requirements\" upon an escort already licensed in a \"neighboring city.\" Kidd acknowledged she \"did not have a Salt Lake City [e]scort license at the time of this incident,\" but asserted she \"did have a license in the neighboring cit[y] of Midvale.\" She claimed her Midvale license was \"sufficient to meet the requirements of\" the Salt Lake City ordinance, and there was \"no valid reason\" for imposition of \"duplicative and expensive licensing procedures.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b612 In support of her argument, Kidd referenced several First Amendment cases, but she did not connect them to the facts of her case. Other than asserting that \"[e]scorts are protected in their profession by the First Amendment,\" Kidd did not address what speech was allegedly infringed. And with even less specificity, Kidd asserted that section 10-8-41.5 violated her \"rights to Equal Protection of the Law.\" She did not cite or apply equal protection authorities to the facts of her case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b613 The district court denied the motion and Kidd entered a conditional plea of no contest preserving her right to appeal the constitutional questions. And the court of appeals certified the case to this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b614 \"The grant or denial of a motion to dismiss is a question of law [that] we review for correctness, giving no deference to the decision of the trial court.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Hamilton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9117039\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/70/111/\">\n    2003 UT 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9117039\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/70/111/\">\n    70 P.3d 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted) (cleaned up).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   I. Jurisdiction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b615 Before we turn to the merits of the case, we need to address a jurisdictional question. Utah Code section 78A-7-118 provides that when justice court proceedings are followed by a trial de novo in district court, as was the case here, \"[t]he decision of the district court is final and may not be appealed unless the district court rules on the constitutionality of a statute or ordinance.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 78A-7-118(8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b616 The only written ruling in the record with respect to Kidd's motion to dismiss, and the constitutional arguments contained therein, is the district court's notation that Kidd's motion was \"[d]enied.\" While this matter was pending in front of the court of appeals, but prior to transfer to our court, the court of appeals questioned whether the district court's denial constituted a \"rul[ing] on the constitutionality of a statute or ordinance\" as section 78A-7-118 requires.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b617 Kidd then supplemented the record with a transcript. The court of appeals subsequently certified the case, but did not address the jurisdictional question it had raised.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b618 In her briefing to this court, Kidd responds to the court of appeals' concern and argues that we have appellate jurisdiction because the district court ruled on the statute's constitutionality. The City does not appear to disagree. Although this might seem to resolve the question, \"acquiescence of the parties is insufficient to confer jurisdiction.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    First Nat'l Bank of Layton v. Palmer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20UT%2043\">\n    2018 UT 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12570375\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/427/1169/\">\n    427 P.3d 1169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). We must be \"satisfied that we have jurisdiction before reaching the merits.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12570375\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/427/1169/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b619 With the transcript in the record, we are assured that we have jurisdiction because the district court \"rule[d] on the constitutionality of a statute or ordinance\" as required for purposes of section 78A-7-118.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We are therefore satisfied that appellate jurisdiction exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   II. First Amendment\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b620 Kidd first asserts that Utah Code section 10-8-41.5\"violates [her] first amendment right to free speech, and particularly violates\" her right to \"commercial speech.\" We cannot reach the merits of this claim, however, because Kidd does not identify the speech at issue in this case, much less demonstrate that any such speech is protected by the First Amendment. Kidd's argument is inadequately briefed and, as a result, she has failed to carry her burden of persuasion on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b621 As an initial matter, \"it is the obligation of the person desiring to engage in assertedly expressive conduct to demonstrate that the First Amendment even applies.\"\n   <em>\n    Clark v. Cmty. for Creative Non-Violence\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338073\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/288/\">\n    468 U.S. 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 293 n.5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338073\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/288/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3065\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338073\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/288/\">\n    82 L.Ed.2d 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984). Here, Kidd needed to start by pointing this court to the speech she claims the statute burdens. Yet Kidd does nothing more than recite that, while employed as an escort, she arrived at a hotel room and demanded a \"show-up\" fee. Her argument assumes that the licensing requirement has infringed her ability to engage in constitutionally protected speech, whatever that speech might have been. In other words, Kidd leaves it to this court to fill in the blanks about what speech or expressive conduct might have occurred but for her failure to obtain a license. We are not in a position to do that for Kidd. We could speculate on what Kidd would do but for the statute, but judicial speculation cannot overcome the presumption of constitutionality that we afford legislation. \"[A]ll statutes are presumed to be constitutional and the party challenging a statute bears the burden of proving its invalidity.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Angilau\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6990650\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/245/745/\">\n    2011 UT 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6990650\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/245/745/\">\n    245 P.3d 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). This Kidd did not do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b622 As noted above, Kidd characterizes her claim as resting primarily-or perhaps entirely-on the infringement of her commercial speech. But again, Kidd does not identify the commercial speech at issue. She does make a passing assertion that First Amendment protection has been afforded to escort service agencies on what appears to be artistic (as opposed to commercial) speech grounds. We express no opinion as to whether, or to what degree, the First Amendment may protect escort services generally or escort service providers individually.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   We simply\n   note that to assert a First Amendment claim, Kidd needs to start by identifying and characterizing the speech at issue. And Kidd has failed to do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b623 Kidd would then have needed to demonstrate what level of protection the speech at issue receives and how the statute burdens it. Kidd compounds this problem by citing cases applying various First Amendment frameworks without explaining how those distinctive legal principles might apply, either alternatively or in combination. Kidd's main contention appears to be that section 10-8-41.5 fails as a regulation of commercial speech, and in support she relies on\n   <em>\n    Pacific Frontier v. Pleasant Grove City\n   </em>\n   , which addresses a First Amendment challenge involving commercial speech.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8973228\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/414/1221/#p1231\">\n    414 F.3d 1221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1231-35 (10th Cir. 2005). But Kidd also relies on\n   <em>\n    United States v. O'Brien\n   </em>\n   , which addresses regulation of conduct that implicates protected expression.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767540\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/367/#p376\">\n    391 U.S. 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 376-77,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767540\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/367/#p376\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767540\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/367/#p376\">\n    20 L.Ed.2d 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1968). She also cites\n   <em>\n    FW/PBS, Inc. v. City of Dallas\n   </em>\n   , which addresses whether a regulation constitutes an unconstitutional prior restraint due to inadequate procedural safeguards.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11331158\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/493/215/#p223\">\n    493 U.S. 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 223,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11331158\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/493/215/#p223\">\n    110 S.Ct. 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11331158\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/493/215/#p223\">\n    107 L.Ed.2d 603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990) (plurality opinion). And while Kidd references other cases, she does little with them. For example, she cites, without meaningful analysis,\n   <em>\n    Tollis Inc. v. San Bernardino County\n   </em>\n   , which analyzes whether an ordinance may be upheld as a content-neutral time, place, and manner regulation and justified on the basis of secondary effects.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1753932\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/827/1329/#p1332\">\n    827 F.2d 1329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1332-33 (9th Cir. 1987).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b624 Undifferentiated citation to various First Amendment frameworks will almost inevitably lead to inadequate briefing.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Cheek v. Clay Bulloch Constr. Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12145877\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/387/611/\">\n    2016 UT App 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 30-33,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12145877\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/387/611/\">\n    387 P.3d 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that an argument was inadequately briefed, due in part to the undeveloped assertion of \"multiple contractual theories, some of which are contradictory\"). And requiring Kidd to develop a cogent First Amendment argument is more than making her run an appellate gauntlet before she can obtain relief. When a party advances proto-arguments without developing them into actual arguments, that party essentially asks this court to develop those arguments for her. And then rule on those arguments, often without the benefit of adversarial briefing because the opposing party was not given a focused target at which to aim. This is not the way we aspire to operate nor is it fair to the opposing party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b625 Because of the lack of clarity in Kidd's legal argument, as well as the absence of factual development noted above, we are unable to reach the merits of her claim. In short, Kidd has failed to develop an argument \"that we can respond to\" and has not demonstrated that Utah Code section 10-8-41.5 is an unconstitutional intrusion on First Amendment rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rose v. Office of Prof'l Conduct\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20UT%2050\">\n    2017 UT 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 82,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12569459\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/424/134/\">\n    424 P.3d 134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b626 Although unnecessary to the resolution of this case, we note two additional shortcomings of Kidd's argument, as these issues may arise in future cases. First, any First Amendment claim should specify the breadth of the challenge, as well as the specific relief sought. Yet Kidd never asserts whether she has raised a facial statutory challenge or a challenge that the statute is unconstitutional as applied to her, and her brief sometimes reads as if she is raising a facial challenge and sometimes uses language usually associated with an as-applied argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b627 The distinction matters, both in terms of the tests applied and the available remedy.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Gillmor v.

The distinction may also inform a court's ability to reach the merits. \"Particularized facts are what allow a court to issue a narrowly tailored and circumscribed remedy\" in response to an as-applied claim\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Justice v.

Kidd was cited for violation of a city ordinance but challenged only the state statute authorizing that ordinance. Whether Kidd could succeed on such a challenge without also challenging the city ordinance, we need not and do not address. Nor do we opine on whether the analytical framework might shift depending on whether Kidd challenges the statute, the ordinance, or both.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   We simply note these issues and caution parties to keep them in mind in future cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b629 For the reasons set forth above, Kidd has failed to persuade us that the district court erred in denying her motion to dismiss with respect to her First Amendment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   III.

But we disagree with Kidd's reasoning. Kidd asserts that by certifying this case, the court of appeals \"settled\" the question of whether jurisdiction exists. Kidd misunderstands the import of certification.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Utah Code section 78A-4-103 empowers the court of appeals to assign cases within its original jurisdiction to this court. Utah Code \u00a7 78A-4-103(3). By rule, the court of appeals may certify cases that \"will govern a number of other cases involving the same legal issue or issues,\" that present questions of \"first impression under state or federal law which will have wide applicability,\" or that otherwise \"should be decided by\" this court and on which this court would \"probably grant a petition for writ of certiorari.\" Utah R. App. P. 43(c). Certification is thus a procedural mechanism aimed toward efficient resolution of matters of significant jurisprudential importance.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12569459\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/424/134/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    It accomplishes only the transfer of a case from one appellate court to another; it does not constitute a ruling on any other issue.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Likewise, when a case otherwise appears to fit rule 43 's criteria, our inability to reach the merits is not a conclusion that the case was improperly certified. Certification usually occurs early in the appellate process, and the existence or outcome of jurisdictional or procedural issues on which resolution ultimately turns may not have been sufficiently apparent in the briefing before the court of appeals. Thus, although we hope certified cases have been vetted for jurisdictional and preservation issues, certification should not be viewed as a court of appeals plebiscite on those questions.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     FW/PBS, Inc. v.
