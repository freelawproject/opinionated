The Chancellor decreed for the defendant, and complainant has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">This Court is without jurisdiction to entertain this appeal in view of the limitations imposed by Section 10, Chapter 100 of the Acts of 1925, conferring jurisdiction on the Court of Appeals, except in cases \u201c which have been finally determined in the lower court on demurrer or other method not involving a review or determination of the facts, <em>or in which all the facts have bee\u00a1n stipulated.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>It is obvious that the trial of this case involved a review of the facts, and if it is within the exception at all, it must be because it comes within the provision we have italicized. Learned counsel bring the cause here on this theory, but while the record contains a stipulation that \u201cthis case shall be tried, heard and determined on the following agreed statement of facts,\u201d this paper calls for consideration, in its different paragraphs, of the deposition of Morris Bart, previously taken in this cause, the deposition of EL L. Dulin taken in another cause, all the \u201cpetitions, reports, and orders in this cause,\u201d etc. The record also contains certain \u201cexhibits\u201d introduced with a stipulation that they are introduced and to be considered by agreement, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-3\">Counsel call attention to this recital in the decree of the Chancellor allowing the appeal to this Court, \u2014 \u201cthere being no controversy whatever as to the facts of the case,\u201d which follows, however, a recital in the opening-part of the decree in these words:</p>\n<p id=\"ATy\">\u201cThis cause came on to be heard before the Hon. Robert M. Jones, Chancellor, this day upon the original, bill of the complainants, the answer of the defendants the deposition of Morris Bart, the agreed statement of facts, including the deeds of trust and promissory notes taken and filed in the case of <em>Harriet W. Ransom, Executrix, etc., </em>v. <em>Knoxville Investment Corporation, </em>No. 23365, on the Rule Docket of the Chancery Court of Knox County, Tennessee, and the pleadings and process and decrees in said case, showing that Morris- Bart and wife were parties defendant therein, and the answer of the Cumberland Trust Company filed in said case, together with mortgages of the Cumberland Trust Company and notes which the same secure, and upon briefs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>and argument of counsel for both parties. Upon consideration of all 'which, it is accordingly ordered, adjudged and decreed by the Court that the allegations\u2019 of the complainants\u2019 bill are fully met by the answer and tiie amendment to the answer allowed at the time of the trial and are not sustained by the proof in the case; but on the other hand the Court is of opinion that the merits of the case are with the defendant. It is, therefore, accordingly ordered, adjudged and decreed that the bill of the complainants be and it is hereby dismissed,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-3\">It appears, then, that the case was not determined in the lower court in the manner prescribed by the statute as quoted above. It was not a hearing before the Chancellor in which all of the facts had been stipulated. The situation here presented is, that after reviewing the facts brought before him by the depositions and the agreements, he found that there was no controversy or dispute as to the facts, and to this counsel appear to agree on this appeal and present to this Court the questions of law. A distinction must be recognized between a stipulation of what the facts' are, and an agreement that certain depositions, exhibits, etc., shall be looked to as showing or establishing what the facts are. This is done, in effect, whenever counsel rest in the presentation of their respective proof. They thereby submit the case' for determination on the evidence adduced to the exclusion of other evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">As emphasized in several of our cases, jurisdiction on appeal turns on the method of trial in. the lower court, and cannot be conferred by agreement or a stipulation of the facts following that trial. <em>Creasy </em>v. <em>Comargo Coal Co., </em>154 Tenn., 372, is much in point, and in the same volume see <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>page 369, and <em>Garmany </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>v. <em>Ryan, </em>page 432; also, <em>Garrett </em>v. <em>Garrett, </em>156 Tenn., 253, wherein it was pointed ont that, \u201cthe jurisdiction of this Court is not saved by the circumstance that no question of fact is involved on appeal.\u201d In the instant case, it appears that no facts are in dispute here, and, as before suggested, when the case had been heard below, court and counsel were apparently agreed that the record presented \u201cno controversy whatever as to the facts of the case,\u201d but, nevertheless, the case was heard not on a stipulation of all of the facts, but on a record made up of stipulated items of evidence which were to be looked to by the Chancellor in determining the \u2022 law and the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The case must be transferred to the docket of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
