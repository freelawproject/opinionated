Contrary to the plaintiffs contention, the verbal telephonic complaint which was reduced to a complaint ticket did not satisfy the prior written notice requirement <em>(see Dalton v City of Saratoga Springs, </em>12 AD3d 899, 901 [2004]; <em>Cenname v Town of Smithtown, </em>303 AD2d 351 [2003]).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s remaining contentions are without merit. Miller, J.P, Schmidt, Ritter and Angiolillo, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
