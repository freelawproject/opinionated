See <em>Murphy v. State Roads Comm., </em>159 Md. 7, 15; <em>State Roads Comm. v. Redmiles, </em>176 Md. 677, 681; <em>Johnson v. Gas &amp; Electric Co., </em>187 Md. 454, 463; <em>Lustine v. State Roads Comm., </em>217 Md. 274, 278. Closely in point are the cases of <em>Webster v. Pole Line Co., </em>112 Md. 416; <em>Potomac Power Co. v. Birkett, </em>217 Md. 476; and <em>Jeweler v. Potomac Elec. Pow. Co., </em>217 Md. 458. Cf. Code (1957), Art. 23, sec. 197, and Code (1957), Art. 33A, sec. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>A careful review of the testimony demonstrates, we think, that the condemner in the instant case acted upon the advice of a qualified and independent engineer, who testified that it would not be practical to permit mining operations under the surface of the strip, and that such operations would create a hazard to the transmission lines. There was also testimony that the condemner was influenced to some extent by its desire to avoid possible complications, such as extinguishment of an easement by tax sale, and possible additions and changes in the structures. Apparently the company had decided as a matter of policy that the rights of way for the whole line should be acquired in fee. Upon this record, we think there was no showing that the condemner\u2019s choice was so arbitrary or unreasonable as to require that it be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
