When the State moved to amend the indictment the defendant moved to dismiss it. The trial court granted the motion to amend and overruled the motion to dismiss, whereupon the defendant pleaded not guilty. At the trial of the issue by a jury the defendant was convicted, and, from the judgment and sentence entered on the verdict, he has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">There is no dispute as to the facts and the sole question is whether the indictment was defective and, if so, whether the defect involved a matter of substance [precluding amendment except by the grand jury], or a matter of form [permitting amendment before trial]. See <em>Gray v. </em>State, 216 Md. 410, 140 A. 2d 643 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">The pertinent pai'ts of the indictment as returned by the grand jury, and as amended by interlineation, read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-8\">\u201cThe Grand Jurors * * * do on their oath present that [Jjarrell Lank * * * on or about the 15th day of November, 1957, * * * did commit fornication with Sylvia Timmons <em>[and a bastard child upon the body of Sylvia </em>Timmons] then and there did beget, of which child the said Sylvia Timmons was afterward, to wit: on the 15th day of August, 1958, * * * delivered, and which child was then and there born alive and is still living * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">The misnomer of the given name of the defendant was cured, pursuant to the provisions of Code (1957), Art. 27, \u00a7 603, without objection, by inserting \u201cJarrell\u201d in the place of \u201cDarrell\u201d erroneously set forth in the indictment. The italicized phrase within the brackets constitutes the amendment allowed by the trial court on the motion of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">The State, claiming that the amendment was a mere matter of form, contends that the granting thereof was proper. The defendant, claiming that the amendment concerned a matter of substance, moved to dismiss the indictment pursuant to the provisions of Maryland Rule 725 a, b 2, contend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>ing that the indictment was fatally defective. As to what constitutes substance and what is merely formal in an indictment, it may be said that all facts which must be proved to make the act complained of a crime are matters of substance, and that all else\u2014including the order of arrangement and precise words, unless they alone will convey the proper meaning\u2014is formal. 27 Am. Jur., <em>Indictments and Informations, </em>\u00a7 H7.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Since a prosecution for bastardy, although civil in purpose, is a criminal proceeding in Maryland it is subject to the same constitutional guarantees as affect and control the trial of other criminal cases. <em>Kisner v. State, </em>209 Md. 524, 122 A. 2d 102 (1956); <em>Leister v. State, </em>136 Md. 518, 111 A. 78 (1920). Cf. <em>Fiege v. Boehm, </em>210 Md. 352, 123 A. 2d 316 (1956). Thus, every defendant in a bastardy proceeding has a right to be \u201cinformed of the accusation against him.\u201d Article 21 of the Declaration of Rights. It has been stated that the purpose of a criminal charge\u2014be it a state warrant, an information or an indictment\u2014is twofold, that is, the charge must so characterize the crime and describe the particular offense \u201cas to put the accused on notice of what he is called upon to defend and to prevent a future prosecution for the same offense.\u201d <em>Gray v. State, supra, </em>The real question then, is whether the indictment in this case met that test before it was amended. We believe it did. As was pointed out in <em>State v. Wheatley, </em>192 Md. 44, 63 A. 2d 644 (1949), modern courts disregard extremely technical rules and require only that an indictment shall fully allege the essential elements of the offense charged. See also <em>Shelton v. State, </em>198 Md. 405, 84 A. 2d 76 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The defendant points out\u2014and the State did not disagree\u2014 that the essential elements of bastardy are: (i) that the putative father and the mother committed unlawful sexual intercourse together; (ii) that as a result of such intercourse a child was begotten on the body of the mother; and (iii) that the child so begotten was born alive and is still living. The State asserts that all three of these elements are present in the indictment. On the other hand, the defendant insists that the indictment is defective (a) because it failed to allege that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>the fornication was unlawful; (b) because it failed to charge that the alleged fornication resulted in the begetting of a child on the body of the prosecutrix; and (c) because it failed to allege that the subsequently born child was a bastard.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">It is conceded by both parties that the indictment complied with the <em>third </em>essential element in that it alleges that the \u201cchild was then and there born alive and is still living.\u201d Since the indictment states that the defendant \u201cdid commit fornication with\u201d the prosecutrix, it appears that the <em>first </em>essential element was adequately set forth. As was stated in <em>Sheay v. State, </em>74 Md. 52, 21 A. 607 (1891), the offense the law punishes is <em>fornication, </em>which means \u201cunlawful sexual intercourse.\u201d The more important question in this case\u2014 the subject of the <em>second </em>essential element\u2014is whether the indictment sufficiently alleges that a child was begotten on the body of the prosecutrix as a result of the unlawful sexual intercourse. We think it does. It is true, of course, that the imperfectly worded indictment alleges only that the commission of fornication \u201cthen and there did beget\u201d a child, but that was enough despite its imperfections and lack of expert draftsmanship. The effect of this allegation, when read with other parts of the indictment, was to charge that the <em>unlawful sexual intercourse </em>resulted \u201cin begetting a child\u201d <em>[Sheay v. State, supra,] </em>of which child the prosecutrix was afterwards delivered, which, it is evident, fully satisfies the requirements of the second essential element.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The omission of the term \u201cbastard\u201d from the indictment did not constitute a fatal defect. While its inclusion therein would have been proper, and even desirable, it was not absolutely necessary. In this case the defendant was charged with having committed fornication with a person obviously not his wife and with begetting a child of which she was afterward delivered. The indictment alleges that the prosecuting witness had a surname different from that of the putative father at the birth of the child, as was the case when the child was alleged to have been begotten. That was sufficient to charge that the child which resulted from the unlawful sexual intercourse <em>is </em>in law a bastard, <em>i. e., </em>a child born out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>of wedlock. Cf. <em>Greenback v. </em>State, 169 Okla. 616, 36 P. 2d 882 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">That which was omitted from the indictment did not involve a matter of substance, and the lack of expert draftsmanship did not make the indictment invalid. Since the omitted phrase, although proper and desirable, was not necessary to validate the indictment, the amendment allowed by the trial court was not improper. See <em>State v. Wheatley, supra, </em>at p. 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">For the reasons assigned the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, the appellant to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
