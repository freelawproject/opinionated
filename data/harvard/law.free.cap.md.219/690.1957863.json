We do not reach these points because the lower court made no finding as to indigency, which was alleged and sworn to, and did not appoint counsel as the Act requires in cases of indigency. As a result the case must be sent back. \u201cWe read the statute as requiring counsel to be appointed in every case in which the court is satisfied that the allegation of the petitioner that he is unable to pay the cost of the proceedings is true (unless petitioner voluntarily and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>intelligently waived the right to counsel).\u201d <em>Byrd v.
