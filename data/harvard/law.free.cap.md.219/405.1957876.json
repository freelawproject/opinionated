We find nothing before this Court for review. No motion for a directed verdict was made during the trial below and we are precluded from passing on the contention as to the sufficiency of the evidence. \u201cIn the absence of any request for an instruction there can be no review of the sufficiency of the evidence.\u201d <em>Auchincloss v. State, </em>200 Md. 310, 315, <em>Reynolds v. State, 219 </em>Md. 319, No. 151, this term, just decided. There was no exception to, nor request for amplification of, the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury, so that no question of law is presented. Maryland Rule 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">We deem it fitting to say that our scrutiny of the record persuades us that the result would not be different were we free to pass on the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-11\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
