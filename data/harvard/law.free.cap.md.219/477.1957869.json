The child and her parents sued the city for alleged negligence, the city\u2019s demurrer was sustained and the plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">We think that this case is governed by <em>Conrad v. City of Takoma Park, 208 </em>Md. 363, 118 A. 2d 497, which is very similar on its facts. The plaintiffs\u2019 allegations in the instant case are more specific than those in the <em>Conrad </em>case, but we do not think that they differ materially from what was stated to be the substance of the allegations in that case. The more detailed allegations in the instant case smack strongly of the doctrine of attractive nuisance. Though the appellants disclaim reliance on that doctrine, their principal authorities appear to be founded upon it. That doctrine is not accepted in this State <em>(Conrad v. City of Takoma Park, supra; State v. Baltimore Fidelity Warehouse Co., </em>176 Md. 341, 4 A. 2d 739). We think that here, as in the <em>Conrad </em>case, the allegations are insufficient to show the use of flare pots was of itself negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
