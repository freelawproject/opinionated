Y. 349; <em>Kronman &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Public Nat. Bank, </em>218 App. Div. 624.)

The business was unsuccessful and they assigned all their assets to trustees for the benefit of creditors. A copy of the agreement by which this assignment was made is annexed to the complaint and marked Exhibit <em>\u201c </em>B.\u201d In this action to recover from defendant his proportionate share of the losses sustained by the partnership, plaintiff alleges that he contributed capital in the sum of $13,854.50 and that defendant contributed only the sum of $4,600. In the answer this allegation respecting the amount of plaintiff\u2019s contribution is denied and by way of a second separate defense the answer alleges: <em>\u201cSixth. </em>Alleged on information and belief that as a condition of the execution of the Settlement Agreement Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit \u2018 B,\u2019 by the plaintiff and defendant, it was agreed by and between them that they would and did release each other from any and all liability arising out of the copartnership agreement, plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit \u2018 A.\u2019 \u201d This defense has been stricken out as insufficient but we think that, as matter of pleading, it is good. If the fact be proved on the trial that these parties agreed, to release and forego whatever right each might possess against the other, the contract will be shown to be supported by a valid consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The order of the Appellate Division and that of the fpecial Term should be reversed and the motion denied, with costs in all courts and the questions certified answered as follows: first question, \u201c no; \u201d second question, \u201c yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Cardozo, Ch.
