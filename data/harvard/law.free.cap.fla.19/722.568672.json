And for the same reasons the deed of Z. Kingsley to Elora for life and to Charles and James in remainder, dated in 1831, was inoperative. These rulings are the basis of the first and second assignments of error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b725-5\">The referee also held that the deed dated June 26,.1829, of Z. Kingsley to the trustees for the use of Elora for life, and remainder to Charles and his heirs and assigns, and on his death without issue then to any other \u201c quarteroon \u201d children she may have, and if she have none such issue then to the use of her heirs and assigns, was inoperative to confer an estate upon her illegitimate children to be thereafter begotten, and that these plaintiffs as such children took no estate under such deed.

The identity of the property in controversy is admitted by stipulation of counsel on file.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b725-9\">2. What interest in said land was conveyed by Elora H. Kingsley, through her attorney in fact, George C. Gibbs, to Charles Cutter, from whom John Broward in his lifetime derived title ? Certainly nothing more than Elora H. Kingsley possessed at the time of the conveyance from her to Cutter as aforesaid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b725-10\">3. What estate in said land was vested in Flora H. Kingsley ? To answer this we must look at the deeds Nos. 1, 2 and 3.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b726-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>Deed Eo. l,from Zephaniah Kingsley to Z. C. Gibbs and George Kingsley, trustees, conveyed said land to them in trust for Flora H.

Kingsley might have.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b726-5\">Even if this deed controls, and is not superseded by the subsequent deeds, Eos. 2 and 3, Flora only took a life estate, and on her death Charles, or any other quarteroon child or children surviving her, became the owners of the fee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b726-6\">By deed Eo. 2, from said trustees to Zephaniah Kingsley of same land, which conveyance is consented to and approved in writing under seal of Flora H. Kingsley, all interests in the land were surrendered or conveyed to Zephaniah Kingsley; except, perhaps, the remainder interest in fee, of the infant Charles, which fact becomes immaterial in the present investigation, as it is in proof that Charles died without issue before the life estate terminated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b726-7\">Then we find all the right, title and interest which Z. Kingsley conveyed out of himself in and to said land, back again in him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b726-8\">4. This brings us to the consideration of Deed Eo. 3, conveying same land by Zephaniah Kingsley \u201c to Flora H. Kingsley during her natural life ; remainder in fee simple absolute to Charles and James Kingsley, natural children of the aforesaid Flora and such other natural or legitimate children or child which may be born of her body during her life and of quarteroon breed,\u201d &amp;e.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b726-9\">This is the deed under which the plaintiffs claim James Kingsley is one of the donees named in said deed, and therefore' takes directly.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b726-10\">. The other plaintiffs are the children of Flora H. Kings<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>ley, \u201c of quarteroon breed,\u201d as proven by the testimony of John S. Sammis and George K. Sammis, and answer the description in the said deed of the remaindermen were who should take, in fee simple, on the expiration of the life^estate of Flora H. Kingsley.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b727-5\">Flora H. Kingsley died February 18, 1875, in San Domingo. At that time the life estate terminated and the fee simple vested in the plaintiffs, being the only surviving children of Flora H. Kingsley \u201c of quarteroon breed,\u201d <em>in esse </em>at the time of her death.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b727-6\">5. Let us consider the objections to plaintiffs\u2019 claim urged by defendants\u2019 counsel.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b727-7\">If deed No. 1 has not been suspended by the subsequent conveyance referred to, and is valid and binding, then we hold that plaintiffs are equally <em>rectus in curia </em>as if they took the fee under deed No. 3. And the objection made by defendants that the limitation \u201c quarteroon child or children \u201d is void for uncertainty, &amp;e., is equally applicable to said plaintiffs, whether they take under deed No. 1 or deed No. 3. But is it a <em>good valid legal </em>objection, so as to defeat the claim of the plaintiffs, and so as to have vested the fee in Flora H. Kingsley, under and from whom defendants admit they derive title? We think not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b727-8\">Plaintiffs take <em>as </em>purchasers, <em>not as heirs. </em>They claim under direct conveyances from Zephaniah Kingsley by the operation of said conveyances, and not by the operation of <em>law. </em>Hence all the argument based on the idea of <em>\u201cpedigree\u201d \u201c legitimacy\u201d \u201c bastardy\u201d </em>&amp;c., has no application to the case whatever. It matters not whether Flora was Z. Kingsley\u2019s wife or mistress, or whether her <em>\u201c </em>quarteroon children \u201d were her offspring by Kingsley, or with some other white man, or whether said \u201c quarteroon children \u201d were born in lawful wedlock or were bastards.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b727-9\">But was the limitation referred to too remote, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>description \u201c quarteroon child or children \u201d too uncertain to vest the fee in said land in the plaintiffs ? See \u201c Eearne on Contingent Bemainders,\u201d page *465. The chapter cited begins: \u201c It has already been shown that a legal remainder must vest either during the existence of the particular estate, <em>(in esse </em>or in right of entry,) or at the very instant of its determination ; otherwise it will never take effect at all.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b728-5\">Bow the plaintiffs were <em>in esse </em>and capable of taking when the particular life estate to Elora was determined, and this is all that is necessary under that head. It was not necessary that they should have been <em>in esse </em>when the particular estate was created, <em>only when it determined.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b728-6\">But could the <em>remainder </em>have been destroyed by the conveyance from Elora through G-. C. Gibbs her attorney in fact to Charles Cutter ? Certainly not, if the purchaser had notice of the existence of the remainder interest. He then bought subject to the rights of the remaindermen, or in other words could only buy, <em>and did only </em>buy, the life estate held by Elora in and to the lands in controversy. Elora having the right of the enjoyment and possession of the land during her natural life, (under both deed 1 and 3,) became a trustee for her children of quarteroon breed, so as to preserve the remainder for them. She could not alienate or destroy the remainder; and if she sold with the intention of defeating the remainder in fee, suppoi\u2019ted as it was by her particular life estate, she perpetrated a fraud by committing a breach of trust.</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b728-7\">Eearne on Contingent Bemainders, 478 and 479, says: \u201c The legal estate, thus limited to the trustees during the life of tenant for life, is a good remainder vested in them ; under which they will have such a right of entry, in case of any forfeiture or tortuous alienation by the tenant for life, as will support the contingent remainders expectant on his decease. Bow, it seems if such trustees to support con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>tingent remainders, join in a conveyance to destroy the contingent uses or remainder which they were entrusted to preserve, a court of equity will consider it breach of trust. And in general, if the purchaser under such conveyance comes in for valuable consideration, and without notice, then will the remedy of the person claiming under the contingent remainders be against the trustees, who shall be decreed to purchase lands with their own money, equal in value to the lands sold by them, and to hold them upon the same trusts and limitations as they held the other. But if the conveyance <em>be with notice </em>of the uses, whether with or without consideration, in that case the <em>purchaser </em>shall hold the lands <em>subject to </em>the former trusts. * * * <em>Such purchaser-holds the land </em>subject to the same trusts as the trustees themselves did.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b729-5\">6. Did Broward, the purchaser from Flora, have <em>notice </em>of the tenure of her claim or interest in the land, and the fact that she held said land subject to the remainder interest in fee of her quarteroon children ? All the deeds (1, <em>2 </em>and 3) were duly recorded ; although defendants question the record of deed 3, because, as they allege, there are no witnesses to Z. Kingsley and Z. C. Gribbs\u2019 execution of same.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b729-6\">It is very evident from the appearance of the paper that B. S. Sanchez and John Mabe witnessed both the execution of the deed by Greorge Kingsley and Z. O. Gribbs, and the consent and approbation claimed by Flora Kingsley and Z. Kingsley, the whole being but one transaction; and the said trustees, grantor and grantee under said deed, for her natural life, being all parties to said transaction, and executing the indentures in succession, as their names appear, at one and the same interview, the subscribing witnesses certifying that the said paper was signed and sealed, &amp;e., in their presence, <em>not stating by </em>whom, but clearly meaning by <em>all </em>the parties to it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b730-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>But even if deed Ho. 2 was never legally executed and recorded, deed Ho. 1 is admitted to have been both regularly executed and recorded.

Their rights not being the least effected by the subsequent transfers, that resulted in settling the fee in the remaindermen \u2014 divested of the trust in the trustees Kingsley and Gibbs, and giving the possession and enjoyment of the property to Flora during her natural life, (without the intervention of trustees,) remainder as aforesaid. So that the proper execution and record of either of said deeds would be sufficient for our purposes, and <em>record is notice. </em>Thompson\u2019s Big., p. 180; 1 John.

Was the description of the unborn children so vague and uncertain that they could not take under either of the deeds referred to, as remaindermen? We see that Charles and James were <em>in being </em>at the time deed Ho.'3 was made, and are named as remaindermen in said deed. Charles died before the life estate determined; James still lives and is one of the plaintiffs to this suit. His estate in said land then was not a <em>contingent </em>remainder, but a <em>vested </em>remainder to take effect on the determining of the life estate.

How much more so in cases like this, involving remainder interests in realty ? The only diffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>culty in the consideration of these cases cited seemed to have been to have assimilated remainder interests in <em>personalty </em>to similar interests in realty. The principles set forth having been admitted and treated as axiomatic when applied to remainder interest in realty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b731-5\">So much for <em>James. </em>If by any possibility the other complainants are not \u201c <em>rectus in curia,\u201d </em>there is no doubt <em>James </em>is entitled to recover the entire fee in said land, <em>Charles being dead.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b731-6\">8. But are the other complainants (that is the \u201cquarteroon \u201d children of Flora not in being at the time of the making of deed No. 3, but in being at the time of the determination of the life estate,) not \u201c <em>rectus in curia </em>\u201d as complainants ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b731-7\">The defendants say they are not; \u201c that the limitation to them is void</p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b731-8\">1st.

We admit that the remainders to said quarteroon children were contingent, as they were not in being at the time of the creation of the life estate, and therefore the limitation was conditional, and depended on an event that was <em>uncertain </em>at the time referred to. Yet if the contingency ever happened before the expiration of the life estate the remainder in fee was <em>good. </em>And because vested as soon as the remaindermen were <em>in esse. </em>Fearne, page 4, divides contingent remainders into four classes. The fourth class is: \u201c When the person to whom the remainder is limited is not yet ascertained, or not yet in being.\u201d On page 5 he gives as illustrations of this class two cases \u2014 first,as if a lease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>be made to one for life remainder to the <em>right heirs </em>of F. S., and second, \u201c where a remainder is limited to the first son of B., who has no son then born.\u201d Row the \u201c <em>quarteroon children </em>\u201d of <em>Flora </em>is not' more uncertain than the \u201c right heirs of F. S.,\u201d or, \u201c the first son of B.\u201d If the persons intended can be ascertained by the description then the limitation is not void for uncertainty. The term \u201c <em>quarteroon </em>\u201d is one susceptible of application. Its meaning is fixed and well understood, and requires no explanation. It is used as \u201c <em>descriptio </em>personae,\u201d and it is to the heirs <em>special </em>of Flora. And the designation \u201c quarteroon children \u201d is to distinguish them from her heirs <em>general. </em>As analagous and applicable to the case at bar is the illustration found on the 30th page of Fearne. These will be found to be much more numerous, as they depend on one hand on a general rule of law respecting limitations to the heirs general or special, where the ancestor takes an estate of freehold in the same conveyance; and on the other, upon the <em>respect which is paid </em>to the intent of a testator, where it can be plainly collected from his will, that he used the words heirs of the body, &amp;c., as a \u201c <em>descriptio </em>personae.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b732-5\">Row the only difference in facts between the case cited and the case at bar are: The case in Fearne is one where the conveyance is by <em>will; </em>and the remaindermen are described as the \u201c <em>heirs of the body </em>\u201d of the ancestor or person who took the particular estate \u201c in the same conveyance.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARE\">The case at bar. is a conveyance by deed, and the remaindermen are described as \u201c <em>quarteroon children </em>\u201d of the person who took the particular estate \u201c in the same conveyance.\u201d \u201c Heirs of the body \u201d in the first were decided to have been used as <em>\u201cdescriptio </em>personae.\u201d In the other we hold that \u201c <em>quarteroon children </em>\u201d is used also as <em>\u201c descriptio </em>personae.\u201d In the first it was ruled that \u201c respect should be paid to the intent of a <em>testator </em>where it can be plainly collected from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>his <em>will.\u201d </em>In the other we say <em>that respect should be paid to the intent of the donor or grantor where it can be </em>plainly collected <em>from his deed.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b733-5\">The second objection to the limitation, as urged by the defendants, to-wit: it being a limitation to bastards not in being, we meet by saying, as we have already said, that the remaindermen need not be in being at the time of the creation of the life estate. So that they (the remainder-men described) are <em>in esse </em>at the time of the determination of the particular estate. This we have already shown by our citations from \u201c Eearne on Contingent Remainders.\u201d Defendants insist that said quarteroon children are bastards, and insist further that to be effectual (that is the remainder in fee to them) the <em>legitimacy </em>of such quarteroon child or children must be proved. We reply that said \u201c quarteroon children \u201d take by <em>purchase and not by descent. </em>Hence, as we have said before, their legitimacy or illegitimacy has nothing to do with their being remaindermen. They take the fee in remainder to said lands, not as the <em>heirs </em>of Z. Kingsley, hut as the <em>grantees </em>of Z. Kingsley. They do not take by operation of law, hut by the act of the grantor. Even supposing that they were bastards, there is nothing in the laws of Florida prohibiting bastards from purchasing property or from receiving property by gift or devise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b733-6\">Legitimacy and bastardy are not involved in this suit, and cannot be considered. Nothing is involved except were these persons in being at the time of the determination of the life estate answering the description of \u201c quarteroon child or children of Flora H. Kingsley,\u201d (not whether they were born in lawful wedlock or not.) If so, then they took the fee in said land, the particular estate having ended. \u201c <em>Only </em>this, <em>and. nothing more.\u201d </em>If legitimacy or pedigree had anything to do with the power and right of a pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>chaser or donee to take under a deed, the question of legitimacy and pedigree might become <em>the </em>important one in every transfer or conveyance of property, which would be absurd.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b734-5\"><em>M M.

By deed numbered one the estate devolved first on Elora Kingsley for her life, remainder to her infant son Charles. A contingent limitation was attempted to be created in favor of \u201c any other quarteroon child or children \u201d of Elora, to take effect after the death of Charles without issue. But that limitation is void for uncertainty in the description of the persons ; \u201c quarteroon children \u201d not being a sufficiently definite and certain description. It is void also as being a limitation to bastards not in being. To be effectual the legitimacy of such \u201c quarteroon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>child or children \u201d must be proved. In the absence of such proof the estate would be held to vest absolutely in Flora on the death, before her, of Charles without issue. 1 Fearne on Remainders, 255, citing Mildmay\u2019s Case, 6 Rep.; Ib., 249, citing Edwards vs. Blodwell, 1 Cro.; Metham vs. Duke of Devonshire, 1 Pere Williams\u2019 Rep., 529 ; Cartwright vs. Vawdry, 5; Sumner\u2019s Vesey Jr. R., 534, b; Earle vs. Wilson, 17 Sumner\u2019s Vesey Jr. R., 528 ; Perry on Trusts, (Ed. 1872) p. 38, and cases cited in n. 3 ; Ib., pp. 12, 54, 59.</p>\n<p data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b735-5\">No attempt has been made to prove the legitimacy of the plaintiffs, but the contrary appears by the testimony of John S. Sammis and by the will of Zephaniah Kingsley. The eleventh clause of that will is as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b735-6\">\u201c Eleventh. I do hereby appoint. Kingsley B. Gibbs, George Kingsley and Benjamin A. Putnam as guardians to my natural children, amongst which I acknowledge all those of Flora II. Kingsley, of Camp New Hope; also Sarah Murphy\u2019s mulatto child, Micanopy, now in Hayti. I do also solemnly enjoin my colored and natural children that, seeing the)\u00a1illiberal and inequitable laws of this Territory will not afford to them and to their children that protection and justice which is due in civilized society to every human being, always to keep by them a will ready made and legally executed, directing the disposition of their property after their death until they can remove themselves and property to some land of liberty and equal rights, where the conditions of society are governed by some law less absurdjthan that of color. This I strongly recommend. Nor do I know in what light the law may consider my acknowledged wife Anna Madgigine Jai, as our connubial relation took place in a foreign land, where our marriage was celebrated and solemnized by her native African custom, although never celebrated according to the forms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>Christian usage. Yet she has always been respected as my wife, and as such I acknowledged her. Yor do I think that her truth, honor, integrity, moral conduct or good sense will lose in comparison with any one.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b736-5\">Second. The plaintiffs offered deed Yo. 8 as the commencement of their title.

To the admission of this document the defendants objected, because it does not appear that its execution was ever acknowledged or proved in the manner provided by the statutes, and that, consequently, the clerk was not authorized to record it. If not entitled to record a certified copy from the record is not admissible as evidence under our statute. Thompson\u2019s Digest, 180; Sanders vs. Pepoon, 4 Fla., 465.</p>\n<p data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b736-7\">They attempted to overcome deed Yo. 1 by offering in evidence a certified copy of deed Yo. 2.

It appears affirmatively by deed Yo. 1 that the grantors had no estate which they could convey, they being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>trustees merely to hold the legal title tor prescribed uses, (one of the <em>cestuis que trust </em>being an infant,) and without power of sale. Perry on Trusts 74, and cases cited in notes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b737-5\">Deed No. 3 is inoperative also, because it appears affirmatively that Zephaniah Kingsley, the grantor, had no estate which he could convey, having parted with whatever he had by deed No. 1, and never having re-acquired it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b737-6\">In so far as two o\u00ed the plaintiffs, William and Osceola, are concerned, they can claim no right under this deed, because they are not mentioned in it by their names, and they cannot take under the limitation attempted to be made to bastards not <em>in esse. </em>It is in proof that all of the plaintiffs are bastards, and there is no evidence that any but James was in being at the time of the making of deed No. 3.</p>\n<p data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b737-7\">The testimony of Sammis, showing the paternity of the plaintiffs, is inadmissible, and the motion to strike it out was well made after it had been developed on the cross-examination that the parents were never married. The fact of the marriage of the parents is the basis of all hearsay testimony to show paternity in establishing pedigree.</p>\n<p data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b737-8\">This testimony of the witness is, however, altogether immaterial to the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b737-9\">The identity of the land described in the pleadings, with that described in the copies of the deeds, is not established. But the defendants <em>do not make the objection. They will concede </em>for the purposes of this action that the lands mentioned in the pleadings and in all of the <em>documentary evidence are the same.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b737-10\">I will refer again to the arguments of uncertainty in the description of the persons and of illegitimacy, as plaintiffs\u2019 counsel seems not to have understood them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b737-11\">In addition to the term \u201c quarteroon child or children \u201d being insufficient in itself, we say that if Elora Kingsley had been married to Z. Kingsley and that fact had been es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>tablished, Sammis\u2019 testimony as to plaintiffs\u2019 paternity would have been admissible, and by such testimony the plaintiffs might have been shown to be \u201c quarteroons.\u201d But in the absence of such proof of marriage the plaintiffs\u2019 paternity cannot be so proved. They are <em>nullius filii, </em>and there is no competent testimony to show that they are \u201cquarteroons.\u201d That is, popularly speaking, offsprings having three-fourths white and one-fourtli negro blood. [In this respect we differ from the finding of the referee.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b738-5\">We do not contend that the plaintiffs claim by descent from Elora. If they did they might have no difficulty in sustaining their claim. We admit and assert that they claim and can claim only by purchase; and we submit that under the law one of two facts must be shown to give plaintiffs a standing in court, viz: Either that, being illegitimate children, they were in being when the deed was made; or that, not being <em>in esse </em>when the deed was made, they are legitimate children of Elora Kingsley, because a limitation to bastards not in being is void.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"139\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b738-6\">The Chief-Justice</author>\n<p id=\"AhI\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">It is established by the evidence that Z. Kingsley was not married to Flora H. Kingsley, and that she was never married; that at the date of the deed to the trustees, (1829) Charles, her only child then living, was about six months old; that Flora lived with Z. Kingsley and these plaintiffs were born during such cohabition, he being their putative father; that he was a white man and Elora a person of African or negro blood, the result of all which is that the plaintiffs are the illegitimate children of Elora. Charles died in 1852 and Flora in 1875 in San Domingo, where plaintiffs reside.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">The deed of June 1829 to the trustees gave to Elora an estate for life and remainder to Charles.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>A remainder is defined by Lord Coke to be a remnant of an estate in lands or tenements, expectant on a particular estate, created together with the same at one time. This imports that the remainder must commence or pass out of the grantor at the time of the creation of the particular estate. Thus, where an estate is conveyed to A for life, remainder to B in fee: B\u2019s remainder in fee passes from the grantor at the same time as A\u2019s life estate in possession. (Fearne on Remainders, 3 and note.) A vested remainder exists \u201c when there is a person in being who would have an immediate right to the possession of lands upon the ceasing of the intermediate or precedent estate.\u201d (4 Kent\u2019s Comm., 202.) By the terms of this deed the termination of the life estate of Flora would give the right of possession to Charles. His estate was therefore from the moment of its creation a vested remainder. \u201c It is the present capacity to take effect in possession, if the precedent estate should determine, which distinguishes a vested from a contingent remainder. Where an estate is granted to one for life, and to such of his children as should be living after his death, a present right to the future possession vests in such as are living, subject to open and let in after born children, and to be divested as to those who shall die without issue. A vested remainder is an estate recognized by law, and is grantable by any of the conveyances operating by force of the statute of uses.\u201d Croxall vs. Shererd, 5 Wal., 268, 288 ; Jackson vs. Sublett, 10 B. Monroe, 467; 4 Kent, 202 ; Fearne, 216, 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">The remainder being then vested in Charles from the moment the estate was created by the deed of 1829, no act of the trustees could affect his right. He had a present estate with a fixed right of future possession which vested estate was, in law, alienable by him on arriving at maturity, though the life estate had not then terminated. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>deed which the trustees attempted to make, however, was not executed in due form of law, not being attested by witnesses, and no further consideration need be given to it. Of course it follows that the deed of Z. Kingsley of 21st July, 1881, conveyed no estate as none remained in him nor had been conveyed to him by the trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">But it is claimed by plaintiffs in error that the deed of 1829 created a contingent remainder in the plaintiffs, to-wit: that in the event that Charles should die without issue \u201c then to have and to hold the said property to any other quarteroon child or children that she may have,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">A contingent remainder may fail of effect, and the law will never adjudge a grant good by reason of a possibility or expectation of a thing which is against law, and upon this principle it was decided at a very early day, and is a settled rule of the common law, that \u201c a limitation to a bastard not <em>in esse </em>is held to be void; for the law does not favor such generation, or expect that such should be.\u201d Fearne, 248, 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">The late Earl of Devonshire devised three thousand pounds to all the natural children of his son by Mrs. Heneage, and the question was whether the natural children born after the will should take a share, and it was decided by the Lord Chancellor that they could not.

If he had no such issue, and he had an estate of inheritance under the deed, the property escheated to the State, or was transmitted to his mother by force of the above mentioned statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>In the following cases it was held, under this precise statute, that the property would go to his lawful children, but would not go to his mother if he had no such children, nor to his illegitimate brothers: Bent\u2019s Heirs vs. St. Vrain, 30 Mo., 268 ; Doe <em>ex dem. </em>Crawle vs. Bates, 6 Blackf., 533: Scroggin vs. Allan, 2 Dana, 363 ; Remington vs. Lewis, 8 B. Monroe, 606 ; Stevenson\u2019s Heirs vs. Sullivant, 5 Wheaton, 207; and this whether the property came to him through the mother or by purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">In the case of Stover vs. Boswell\u2019s Heirs, 3 Dana, 233, it was decided (conflicting with the above cases in 2 Dana and 8 B. Mon.) that under this statute the mother might \u201c inherit from and transmit an inheritance to her bastard chil- _ dren.\u201d In Ohio, Little vs. Lake, 8 Ohio R., 290, the court says that if the illegitimate son had died before his mother she would have inherited the estate from him; but the law has not removed all the disabilities of bastards. It has permitted an inheritance from or to the mother; but it has not permitted it from or to collaterals merely because they are connected with the mother. In Virginia, Garland vs. Harrison, 8 Leigh, 358, and Hepburn vs. Dundas, 13 Grat., 219, it is decided that under this statute bastards might transmit inheritance to bastard brothers and sisters, the mother being dead. The court in this case refuses to be governed by the ruling of the court in Stevenson\u2019s Heirs vs. Sullivant upon the same statute upon the ground that the court in the latter case had construed the Ohio law and not the Virginia statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">If we adopt the view of the last named cases, the result will be that Flora, on the death of her son Charles without issue, was his heir and invested with whatever interest he had in the property. But if he died without issue the words of the deed make his estate a remainder for his life only.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>Looking again at the language of the deed we find that it provides that if Charles dies without issue and \u201c Elora should die without issue of the aforesaid description, (quarteroon children) then my trustees aforesaid are to hold this property to and for the use of her heirs and assigns forever.\u201d The law construes such \u201c issue \u201d to be legitimate and not illegitimate children.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">The logical result of this is that Elora dying <em>without issue capable of taking under this deed </em>the property is held by the trustees \u201c for the use of her heirs <em>and assigns </em>forever in other words, the fee is ultimately vested in her grantee. She conveyed, after Charles\u2019 death, to Cutter, who conveyed to John Broward, the original defendant in this suit. The deed gave her a power of appointment which she has executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">In any aspect upon the facts disclosed, and the law applicable thereto, the plaintiffs have shown no title as against the defendants in this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">It must not be understood that in thus disposing of this case we decide the question whether, under the circumstances and the law, the title in fee vested in Charles, or that he had any estate transmissible by inheritance; nor whether, his mother surviving him, if he died without issue, she would inherit from him; nor whether if she had died without conveying the land the plaintiffs here would not have taken title as her heirs. We have cited conflicting authorities upon some points for the purpose of illustration, and to show. that whichever of them be adopted the plaintiffs are in no better position.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
