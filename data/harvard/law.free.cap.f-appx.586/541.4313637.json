No. 111-148, \u00a7 1556, 124 Stat. 119, 260 (2010), after failing to prevail on a first claim for benefits under a provision that conditioned the dependent\u2019s eligibility for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>benefits on her ability to prove that pneu-moconiosis was a cause of the deceased miner\u2019s death. Drummond Company, Inc., petitions for review of a decision of the Benefits Review Board that affirmed an award of survivors\u2019 benefits to \u00d3llie P. Gardner after she filed a subsequent claim for automatic derivative benefits under section 1556. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">In 1992, Melvin Gardner applied for benefits under the Black Lung Benefits Act based on his work as a coal miner between 1956 and 1983. In 1995, an administrative law judge found that Melvin was totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis and awarded him benefits. Drummond did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Melvin died in April 2001, and his widow, Ollie Gardner, filed a claim for survivors\u2019 benefits under the Act. Under the version of the Act then in effect, Ollie could receive benefits only if she proved that her husband\u2019s death was due at least in part to pneumoconiosis. <em>See 30 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 932(Z) (1981); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.205(c)(2) (1984). In 2003, an administrative law judge decided that Gardner was a surviving dependent, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 720.201(a)(2), but she was ineligible for benefits because she failed to prove that pneumoconiosis was a cause of her husband\u2019s death, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 718.205(c)(2). Gardner did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">In March 2010, Congress reinstated a former provision of the Act, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 932(Z) (1978), that awarded derivative benefits automatically to deceased miners\u2019 dependents. Pub.L. No. 111-148, \u00a7 1556(b), 124 Stat. at 260. Until 1982, the dependents of a deceased miner were entitled to automatic derivative benefits if the miner \u201cwas determined to be eligible to receive benefits under this title at the time of his or her death,\u201d 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 932(Z) (1978); Pub.L. No. 95-239, \u00a7 7(h), 92 Stat. 95, 100 (1978). Section 932(Z) eliminated any duty imposed on \u201celigible survivors of a miner ... to file a new claim for benefits, or refile or otherwise revalidate the claim of such miner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When Gardner filed her first claim, Congress conditioned a dependent\u2019s eligibility for benefits on an ability to prove that the deceased minor\u2019s death was due to pneu-moconiosis, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 932(Z) (1981), but section 1556 eliminated that condition. Under that provision, the restored right to automatic benefits, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 932(Z) (2012), applies to \u201cclaims filed ... after January 1, 2005, that are pending on or after [March 23, 2010],\u201d Pub.L. No. 111-148, \u00a7 1556(c), 124 Stat. at 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">In May 2010, Gardner filed a second claim for survivors\u2019 benefits, and the Director of the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs in the Department of Labor issued a proposed decision that awarded benefits to Gardner. The Department determined that Gardner\u2019s claim for benefits was governed by section 1556. The Department ruled that Gardner was entitled to benefits, under amended section 932(Z), because she was a surviving dependent of a miner who had received benefits under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">Drummond objected to the decision on three grounds. First, Drummond argued that Gardner\u2019s second claim was a \u201csubsequent claim\u201d because it was filed \u201cmore than one year after the effective date of a final order denying [her 2001] claim,\u201d and it was barred because \u201cthe applicable conditions of entitlement in such claim ... [was] [ ]related to [her husband\u2019s] physical condition at the time of his death.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.309(d) (effective until October 24, 2013). In other words, Gardner\u2019s subsequent claim was barred because her-2001 claim was denied on the ground that her husband\u2019s death was not due to pneu-moconiosis, and his physical condition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>could not change. Second, Drummond argued that restored section 932(Z) did not apply to Gardner for three reasons: (1) the provision applied to the claim filed by Gardner\u2019s husband in 1992, not to Gardner\u2019s subsequent claim; (2) Gardner\u2019s subsequent claim was not pending on or after March 23, 2010; and (3) Gardner\u2019s 2001 claim was adjudicated before the coverage period in section 1556. Third, Drummond argued that Gardner\u2019s subsequent claim was barred by res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The administrative law judge awarded survivors\u2019 benefits to Gardner. The administrative law judge ruled that Gardner\u2019s claim was a \u201csubsequent claim,\u201d by which she could pursue benefits because \u201cthe applicable condition[] of entitlement ... [ \u2014 the restoration of automatic derivative benefits under section 1556 \u2014 was] unrelated to [her husband\u2019s] physical condition at the time of his death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And Gardner was entitled to benefits, the administrative law judge determined, because she was an \u201cunremarried widow of a miner who had been awarded compensation benefits under the Act during his lifetime, and ... she filed her current claim in May 2010,\u201d within the covered period.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Drummond appealed, and challenged the decision of the administrative law judge on three grounds. First, Drummond argued that Gardner\u2019s claim was a \u201csubsequent claim\u201d that was barred by res judicata and by section 725.309(d) of the regulations. Second, Drummond argued that the \u201cclaim\u201d mentioned in restored section <em>932(l) </em>referred to a miner\u2019s claim and could not apply to Gardner\u2019s subsequent claim because survivors are not required to file a claim. <em>See </em>30 U.S.C. \u00a7 932(i) (2012); Pub.L. No. 111-148, \u00a7 1556(c), 124 Stat. at 260. Third, Drummond argued that, even if Gardner could proceed under restored section 932(Z), she had to prove that her husband\u2019s death was due to pneu-moconiosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">The Benefits Review Board affirmed the decision to award benefits to Gardner. The Board ruled that Gardner\u2019s subsequent claim was not barred by res judicata because her entitlement to benefits was not \u201ctied to relitigation of the prior finding that [her husband\u2019s] death was not due to pneumoconiosis.\u201d The Board also ruled that Gardner did not have to prove the cause of her husband\u2019s death because section 1556 eliminated the causation requirement contained in the 1981 version of section <em>932(l). </em>And the Board determined that Gardner qualified for automatic benefits under section 932(1) based on the undisputed finding of the administrative law judge that Gardner was an eligible dependent of a deceased miner who was receiving benefits under the Act when he died and that her claim was pending after March 23, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>questions of statutory interpretation.\u201d <em>U.S. Steel Mining Co., LLC v. Director, OWCP, </em>719 F.3d 1275, 1280 (11th Cir.2013). The application of res judicata is also a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Vasquez v. YII Shipping Co., Ltd., </em>692 F.3d 1192, 1196 n. 3 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-11\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b571-12\">Drummond challenges the decision of the Board on three grounds. First, Drum-mond argues that Gardner\u2019s claim for benefits is barred by res judicata and the principles of finality embodied in section 725.309(d) of the Code of Federal Regulations. Second, Drummond argues that restored section <em>932(l) </em>applies to miners\u2019 claims and not to a subsequent claim of a surviving spouse that was not pending on March 23, 2010. Third, Drummond argues that, even if restored section 932(1) applies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>to survivors\u2019 subsequent claims, Gardner still must prove that her husband\u2019s death was due to pneumoconiosis. All of these arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Res judicata does not bar Gardner\u2019s subsequent claim for benefits. \u201cUnder res ju-dicata, also known as claim preclusion, a final judgment on the merits bars the parties to a prior action from re-litigating a cause of action that was or could have been raised in that action.\u201d <em>In re Piper Aircraft Corp., </em>244 F.3d 1289, 1296 (11th Cir.2001). To determine whether res judicata bars Gardner\u2019s subsequent claim, we must compare it to the \u201csubstance of [her first claim], not [its] <em>form.\u201d See id. </em>at 1297. Gardner\u2019s two causes of action are the \u201csame\u201d only if her subsequent claim \u201carises out of the same nucleus of operative fact, or is based upon the same factual predicate, as [her] former [claim for benefits]\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Ragsdale v. Rubbermaid, Inc., </em>193 F.3d 1235, 1239 (11th Cir.1999)). Gardner\u2019s first claim turned on whether she could prove that her husband died due to pneumoconiosis, but her subsequent claim concerns only whether her husband was eligible to receive benefits when he died. Because Gardner\u2019s claims are based on entirely different methods of recovering survivors\u2019 benefits, her subsequent claim is not barred by res judicata. Our analysis is unaffected by <em>Pittston Coal Group v. Sebben, </em>488 U.S. 105, 109 S.Ct. 414, 102 L.Ed.2d 408 (1988), where the Supreme Court held that res judicata applies to some claims for benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 121-23, 109 S.Ct. at 424-25. Unlike the claimants in <em>Pittston, </em>Gardner is not seeking to \u201cre-open\u201d or to disturb a decision to deny an earlier claim for benefits. Gardner seeks benefits on a basis of entitlement that was previously unavailable to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Our conclusion is consistent with the principles of finality embodied in section 725.309(d). Section 725.309(d) bars a subsequent claim for benefits \u201cunless the applicable eondition[ ] of entitlement ... includes at least one condition unrelated to the miner\u2019s physical condition at the time of his death.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.309(d). Gardner\u2019s subsequent claim is unrelated to the health of her deceased husband. <em>See Jim Walter Resources, Inc. v. Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, </em>No. 13-13185, 766 F.3d 1333, 1337, 2014 WL 4476171, at *4 (11th Cir. Sept. 12, 2014). Her subsequent claim is based on the restoration of automatic benefits, under section 1556, to beneficiaries whose spouses were found \u201cto be eligible to receive benefits under this title at the time of ... [their] death,\u201d 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 932(Z) (1978); Pub.L. No. 95-239, \u00a7 7(h), 92 Stat. 95, 100 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">The additional arguments made by Drummond are foreclosed by our precedents. We held in <em>U.S. Steel Mining </em>that \u201c[t]he plain meaning of \u00a7 1556(c) is that anyone \u2014 miner or survivor \u2014 who filed a claim for benefits ... can receive the benefit of the amendments.\u201d 719 F.3d at 1285. And in that opinion, we squarely rejected the argument that a dependent seeking derivative benefits under restored section 932(\u00a3) is required to prove that the deceased miner died due to pneumoconiosis. <em>Id. </em>at 1280-84. A dependent is obliged to prove a cause of death only if she cannot establish that she is an \u201celigible survivor\u201d and that the deceased miner was receiving benefits when he died. <em>Id. </em>at 1284. We also have concluded that section 1556 applies to a subsequent claim that is filed after the effective date of the enactment. <em>Jim Walter Resources, </em>766 F.3d at 1334-35, 2014 WL 4476171, at *1-3. Section 1556 and restored section 932(Z) do not \u201cdistinguish between first-time claims and subsequent claims,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1335, 2014 WL 4476171 at *3, and encompass claims that are pending after March 23, 2010, as a result of being filed after that date, <em>id. </em>at 1335, 2014 WL 4476171 at *2. That does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>not render meaningless the time limitations in section 1556. Those deadlines mean that a claimant whose initial claim was denied before January 2005 must file a subsequent claim and that the Department of Labor is obliged to award automatic derivative benefits only for a claim filed during or after 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The Board did not err in affirming an award of derivative benefits to Gardner. Gardner complied with section 1556 by filing a subsequent claim after January 1, 2005, that was pending after March 23, 2010, and it is undisputed that she is an eligible dependent widow of a deceased miner who received benefits during his lifetime. And neither res judicata nor section. 725.309(d) of the governing regulations bars her subsequent claim based on a new cause of action that was created by the restoration of automatic derivative benefits under section 1556.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">We DENY the petition of Drummond to review the award of derivative benefits to Gardner.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
