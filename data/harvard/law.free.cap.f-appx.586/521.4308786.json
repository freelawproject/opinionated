Briefly stated, Eyre argues that the ALJ erred by giving \u201csignificant weight\u201d to the opinion of Dr. Olin Hamrick, a non-examining physician, and by giving \u201cno weight\u2019\u2019 to the opinion of Dr. Felix Toro, whom Eyre asserts is her treating psychiatrist. Eyre also argues that substantial evidence did not support the ALJ\u2019s finding that she performed her past jobs as a kitchen helper and a hotel housekeeper at the level of substantial gainful activity, as determined by the average monthly wages she earned over the time she was employed as a kitchen helper and a hotel housekeeper.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-14\">We review the ALJ\u2019s decision when the ALJ denies benefits and, as is the case here, the Appeals Council denies review of the ALJ\u2019s decision. <em>Doughty v. Apfel, </em>245 F.3d 1274, 1278 (11th Cir.2001). We review the ALJ\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and \u201cwe review the resulting decision only to determine whether it is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005). Substantial evidence requires more than a scintilla of evidence and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as sufficient to support a conclusion. <em>Winschel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1178 (1 1th Cir.2011). We do \u201cnot decide the facts anew, reweigh the evidence, or substitute our judgment for that of the [ALJ].\u201d <em>Id. </em>As long as the decision is supported by substantial evidence, we will defer to the ALJ\u2019s decision, even if the evidence may preponderate against it. <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158-59 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-15\">Eligibility for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income requires that the claimant is under a disability. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 423(a)(1)(E), 1382(a)(1). In relevant part, a claimant is under a disability if she is unable to engage in substantial gainful activity because of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>medically determinable impairment that can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last continuously for at least 12 months. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 423(d)(1)(A), 1882c(a)(3)(A). The claimant bears the burden of proving her disability. <em>Ellison v. Barnhart, </em>355 F.3d 1272, 1276 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">To determine whether a claimant is disabled, the ALJ applies a \u201cfive-step sequential evaluation.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a), 416.920(a). This process includes an analysis of whether the claimant (1) is currently engaged in substantial gainful activity; (2) has a severe and medically-determinable impairment; (3) has such an impairment that meets or equals a Listing, and meets the duration requirements; (4) can perform her past relevant work, in the light of her residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d); and (5) can make an adjustment to other work, in the light of her RFC, age, education, and work experience. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4), 416.920(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">In assessing medical opinions, the ALJ must consider a number of factors in determining how much weight to give to each medical opinion, including (1) whether the physician has examined the claimant; (2) the length, nature, and extent of a treating physician\u2019s relationship with the claimant; (3) the medical evidence and explanation supporting the physician\u2019s opinion; (4) how consistent the physician\u2019s \u201copinion is with the record as a whole\u201d; and (5) the physician\u2019s specialization. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(c), 416.927(c). These factors apply to both examining and non-examining physicians. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(e), 416.927(e). A treating physician\u2019s opinion must be given \u201csubstantial or considerable weight,\u201d unless \u201cgood cause\u201d is shown to the contrary. <em>Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1179; <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(c)(2), 416.927(c)(2) (giving controlling weight to the treating physician\u2019s opinion unless it is inconsistent with other substantial evidence). \u201cGood cause exists when the (1) treating physician\u2019s opinion was not bolstered by the evidence; (2) evidence supported a contrary finding; or (3) treating physician\u2019s opinion was conclusory or inconsistent with the doctor\u2019s own medical records.\u201d <em>Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1179 (quotations omitted). The ALJ owes no deference to the opinion of a physician who conducted a single examination: as such a physician is not a treating physician. <em>McSwain v. Bowen, </em>814 F.2d 617, 619 (11th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">In addition, the ALJ, not a claimant\u2019s physician, is responsible for determining whether a claimant is statutorily disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(d)(1), 416.927(d)(1). <em>\u201cA </em>statement by a medical source that [a claimant is] \u2018disabled\u2019 or \u2018unable to work\u2019 does not mean that [the ALJ] will determine that [the claimant is] disabled.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b551-12\">Upon considering medical opinions, \u201cthe ALJ must state with particularity the weight given to different medical opinions and the reasons therefor.\u201d <em>Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1179.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-13\">Here, Dr. Toro was unentitled to the status of a \u201ctreating physician,\u201d because he did not treat Eyre on a regular basis before the ALJ\u2019s decision. <em>See McSwain, </em>814 F.2d at 619. Moreover, Dr. Toro\u2019s opinion on Eyre\u2019s mental impairments was not consistent with the record as a whole. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(c), 416.927(c). Accordingly, we affirm the ALJ\u2019s decision to give \u201cno weight\u201d to his opinion. Further, the ALJ\u2019s decision to give \u201csignificant\u201d weight to Dr. Hamrick\u2019s opinion is supported by substantial evidence contained in Eyre\u2019s medical records. <em>See Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1178.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-15\">A claimant will be found not disabled if she can return to her past relevant work. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iv), 416.920(a)(4)(iv). A \u201cclaimant has the burden of showing that certain work experience is not past relevant work.\u201d <em>Barnes v. Sullivan, </em>932 F.2d 1356, 1359 (11th Cir.<em>1991). </em>\u201cPast relevant work is work that [a claimant has] done within the past 15 years, that was substantial gainful activity, and that lasted long enough for [the claimant] to learn to do it.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1560(b)(1), 416.960(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">The federal regulations define \u201csubstantial gainful activity\u201d as \u201cwork activity that is both substantial and gainful.\u201d <em>Id. \u00a7\u00a7 </em>404.1572, 416.972. \u201cSubstantial work activity\u201d is work \u201cthat involves doing significant physical or mental activities,\u201d even if on a part-time basis. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 404.1572(a), 416.972(a). \u201cGainful work activity,\u201d in turn, is work activity done for pay or profit. <em>Id. \u00a7\u00a7 </em>404.1572(b), 416.972(b). If the claimant is an employee, the ALJ will rely on certain guides to determine if the claimant is substantially gainfully active. Important criteria in this regard include the nature of the claimant\u2019s work, how well she performed, how much time she spent at work, and whether her work was done under special conditions. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 404.1573, 416.973.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">In evaluating work activity for substantial gainful activity purposes where the claimant was an employee in the past, the chief consideration is the claimant\u2019s earnings from the work activity. ' <em>Id. \u00a7\u00a7 </em>404.1574(a)(1), 416.974(a)(1). The ALJ ordinarily will consider that the claimant either was or was not engaged in substantial gainful activity if her average monthly earnings are above or below a certain amount established by the Social Security Administration\u2019s earnings guidelines. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 404.1574(b)(2)-(3), 416.974(b)(2)-(3); <em>see also Johnson v. Sullivan, 929 </em>F.2d 596, 598 (11th Cir.1991) (noting that earnings on income tax returns create a rebuttable presumption that the taxpayer was gainfully employed).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Earnings, however, are not dispositive. Even where the claimant\u2019s average monthly earnings were below the amount established by the earnings guidelines, if other evidence indicates that the claimant was engaged in substantial gainful activity or that the claimant was in the position to control the amount of wages she was paid, the ALJ can consider other information, including whether the work performed was \u201ccomparable to that of unimpaired people in [the claimant\u2019s] community who [were] doing the same or similar occupations as their means of livelihood, taking into account the time, energy, skill, and responsibility involved in the work.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1574(a)(1), (b)(3)(ii)(A), 416.974(a)(1) (b)(3)(ii)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">Here, the record did not indicate that Eyre earned enough money as a kitchen helper and a hotel housekeeper for the work to be ordinarily considered substantial gainful activity. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1574(b)(2), 416.974(b)(2). But other evidence on the energy, skill, and physical activity of her past work showed that Eyre engaged in substantial gainful activity as a kitchen helper and a hotel housekeeper. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 404.1572(a), 404.1574(a)(1), (b)(S)(ii), 416.972(a), 416.974(a)(1), (b)(3)(ii). Furthermore, Eyre offered no evidence to rebut the ALJ\u2019s reasonable determination that she had engaged in substantial gainful activity as a kitchen helper and a hotel housekeeper. <em>See Barnes, </em>932 F.2d at 1359.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination. The ALJ properly found that Eyre\u2019s kitchen helper and hotel housekeeping jobs were past relevant work. <em>See Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1211; <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iv), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>404.1560(b)(1), 416.920(a)(4)(iv), 416.960(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
