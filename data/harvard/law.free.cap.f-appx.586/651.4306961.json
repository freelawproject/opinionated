She argues that the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) and the Immigration Judge (IJ) misapplied the law in denying her applications. Contreras does not renew her argument that she is entitled to relief under the Convention Against Torture; therefore, any such argument is deemed waived. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number><em>Thuri v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 788, 793 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">We review the conclusion that Contreras is not eligible for asylum or withholding of removal for substantial evidence, and reversal is not proper unless \u201cany reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.2006). Because the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision, we may review both the decisions of the BIA and the IJ. <em>Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 536 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">A discretionary grant of asylum may be afforded to a \u201crefugee,\u201d which is defined as a person who is outside of his country who is unable or unwilling to return \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution,\u201d and who has demonstrated that \u201crace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion was or will be at least one central reason\u201d for the persecution. <em>See Orellana-Monson v. </em>Holder, 685 F.3d 511, 518 (5th Cir.2012) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 (a) (42) (A)); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). To obtain withholding of removal, an applicant must meet the higher burden of showing that it is more likely than not that his life or freedom would be threatened by persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>Orellana-Monson, </em>685 F.3d at 518. Because the showing required to establish eligibility for withholding of removal is higher than that required to establish eligibility for asylum, the failure to establish eligibility for asylum forecloses eligibility for withholding. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">For the first time in this petition for review, Contreras argues that the BIA and the IJ erred in finding that she was not a member of a protected group because she is a member of a social group made up of young females targeted by criminal organizations for sexual abuse. Contreras failed to raise this contention before the BIA; therefore, it is not exhausted and this court lacks jurisdiction to consider it. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). Further, as it is her sole assertion of membership in a protected group, Contreras cannot show persecution \u201cbecause of,\u201d or \u201con account of\u2019 her membership in a particular social group. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Orellana-Monson, </em>685 F.3d at 518-19. Accordingly, we find it unnecessary to consider Contreras\u2019s additional argument that she has a well-founded fear of persecution if she returns to El Salvador. <em>See, e.g., Gonzalez-Hernandez v. Ashcroft, </em>98 Fed.Appx. 345, 346-47 (5th Cir.2004) (declining to address issue of future persecution where petitioner failed to show membership in a protected group). The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b679-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
