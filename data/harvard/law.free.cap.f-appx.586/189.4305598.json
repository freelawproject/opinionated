Defendants-Appellees filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The district court granted the motion and entered judgment in Defendants-Appellees\u2019 favor. Ayanbadejo moved for a new trial, which the district court denied. Ayanbadejo filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">This court reversed the decision of the district court in part, concluding that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over the denial of the 1130 petition and remanded for further proceedings consistent with the opinion. <em>Ayanbadejo v. Chertoff, </em>517 F.3d 273, 279 (5th Cir.2008) (per curiam). After remand, Defendants-Appellees filed a motion for summary judgment on Ayanbadejo\u2019s 1-130 petition claim. The district court granted the motion and entered judgment in Defendants-Appellees\u2019 favor. Ayanbadejo filed an untimely appeal, which this court dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Almost four years after the district court entered final judgment, Ayanbadejo filed the motion for relief from judgment presently at issue. The district court denied the motion, finding that it was untimely and meritless. Ayanbadejo timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">\u201cThe district court\u2019s denial of [Ayanba-dejo\u2019s] Rule 60(b) motion constitutes a final, appealable order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Thompson, </em>638 F.2d 801, 803 (5th Cir. Unit B Mar.1981); <em>see also Cadle Co. v. Neubauer, </em>562 F.3d 369, 371 (5th Cir.2009) (concluding that the district court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion was a final order over which the court had jurisdiction); 15B Charles Alan Wright <em>&amp; </em>Arthur R. Miller, <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure </em>\u00a7 3916 (\u201cThe general rule that appeal can be taken from final denial of a motion to vacate a judgment is well settled.\u201d). We review the district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>Edward H. Bohlin Co., Inc. v. Banning Co., Inc., </em>6 F.3d 350, 353 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-12\">The district court denied Ayanbadejo\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion \u2014 filed almost four years after the entry of final judgment \u2014 as untimely. Further, the district court found that Ayanbadejo\u2019s argument that the district court\u2019s judgment was void under Rule 60(b)(4) was without merit. Specifically, the district court reasoned that there was no deprivation of his due process rights resulting from his attorney\u2019s failure to timely appeal <em>after </em>the district court entered judgment. Moreover, the unfavorable entry of summary judgment did not deprive him of his constitutional right to a jury trial. On appeal, Ayanbadejo asserts the same arguments determined by the district court to be meritless.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-13\">After considering the parties\u2019 arguments as briefed on appeal, and after reviewing the record, the applicable law, and the district court\u2019s orders and reasoning, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s orders and adopt its analysis in full.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b217-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b218-9\">. For the same reasons, the district court denied Ayanbadejo\u2019s motion for leave to file excess pages and his verified motion for reconsideration of the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for relief from judgment. Ayanba-dejo challenges these orders on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
