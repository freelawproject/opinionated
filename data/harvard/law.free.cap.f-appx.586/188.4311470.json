Siebert concedes that a prisoner has no constitutional right to be incarcerated in any particular facility, but he argues that the BOP\u2019s decision to deny his transfer request based on his past criminal history was arbitrary and capricious and that the decision violated 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.12. He also argues that the district court failed to address his argument that the failure to apply \u00a7 541.12, which has been rescinded, would result in an ex post facto violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-22\">In reviewing the denial of habeas relief, we review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law de novo and findings of fact for clear error. <em>Wilson v. Roy, </em>643 F.3d 433, 434 (5th Cir.2011). The district court\u2019s denial of relief may be affirmed \u201con any ground supported by the record.\u201d <em>Scott v. Johnson, </em>227 F.3d 260, 262 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>\u201cThe Due Process Clause does not, by itself, endow a prisoner with a protected liberty interest in the location of his confinement.\u201d <em>Yates v. Stalder, </em>217 F.3d 332, 334 (5th Cir.2000) (citing <em>Meachum v. Fano, </em>427 U.S. 215, 225, 96 S.Ct. 2532, 49 L.Ed.2d 451 (1976)). Moreover, a prisoner has no liberty interest or right to be housed in any particular facility, <em>see Olim v. Wakinekona, </em>461 U.S. 238, 244-45, 103 S.Ct. 1741, 75 L.Ed.2d 813 (1983), and the BOP has wide discretion in designating the place of a prisoner\u2019s imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Although Siebert contends that \u00a7 541.12 created a protected liberty interest in being treated respectfully, impartially, and fairly, the relevant statutory language is discretionary and did not create a liberty interest in being assigned to a particular facility. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3621(b); <em>Richardson v. Joslin, </em>501 F.3d 415, 419 (5th Cir.2007). Further, although Siebert may disagree with the outcome of the BOP\u2019s assessment of his eligibility for transfer, he is not entitled to habeas relief based upon his disagreement with that assessment, which was based upon relevant statutory criteria. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3621(b). Finally, because the district court did not base its decision to deny \u00a7 2241 relief on the fact that \u00a7 514.12 has been rescinded, the district court\u2019s failure to address Siebert\u2019s ex post facto argument does not constitute reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The district court did not err in denying Siebert\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b216-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
