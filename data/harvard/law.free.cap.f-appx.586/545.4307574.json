On appeal, Jackson first argues that the district court clearly erred in finding him responsible for the entire intended-loss amount of $1,718,089 that the court calculated under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(I). He then argues that the district court clearly erred in finding that a video showing his assault of his girlfriend was related to his convictions for fraud offenses, rendering the court\u2019s consideration of that evidence improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">Upon review of the record and after consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">The district court\u2019s determination of loss amount is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Barrington, </em>648 F.3d 1178, 1197 (11th Cir.2011). Clear error will be present when we are \u201cleft with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1177 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted). The district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>Barrington, </em>648 F.3d at 1197.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-12\">\u201cThe Guidelines do not require a precise determination of loss,\u201d and a court \u201cneed only make a reasonable estimate of the loss, given the available information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Nevertheless, a sentencing court \u201cmay not speculate about the existence of a fact that would result in a higher sentence, and the government must support its loss calculation with \u2018reliable and specific evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-13\">Section 2B1.1 of the Guidelines provides for a 16-level increase for a fraud offense involving a loss amount that is more than $1,000,000, but less than $2,500,000. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(I). Application notes clarify that \u201closs is the greater of actual loss or intended loss.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.3(A)). \u201cIntended loss\u201d is \u201cthe pecuniary harm that was intended to result from the offense.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment, (n. 3(A)(ii)). The Guidelines acknowledge that a sentencing court \u201cis in a unique position to assess the evidence and estimate the loss,\u201d and, therefore, \u201cthe court\u2019s loss determination is entitled to appropriate deference.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment. (n.3(C)). Conduct relevant to sentencing includes all acts that a defendant \u201ccommitted, aided, [or] abetted.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-14\">The district court did not clearly err in holding Jackson responsible for the entire intended-loss amount because Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) Special Agent Christopher Forte\u2019s testimony at sentencing provided \u201creliable and specific evidence\u201d both about how the loss amount was calculated and about Jackson\u2019s responsibility for that amount. Moreover, even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>accepting Jackson\u2019s contention that he personally did not file all of the false tax returns attributed to him, his storage of the information necessary to file those returns was a sufficient basis for holding him responsible for the loss amount stemming from them under the principles of relevant conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">A district court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error and its application of the Guidelines to those facts is reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. McGuinness, </em>451 F.3d 1302, 1304 (11th Cir.2006). Notwithstanding an error, we are not required to vacate the sentence and remand a case if the district court likely would have sentenced the defendant the same way without the error. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>441 F.3d 1322, 1329 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">When determining what sentence to impose within the guidelines range, a district court \u201cmay consider, without limitation, any information concerning the background, character and conduct of the defendant, unless otherwise prohibited by law.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">The district court must impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law,\u2019provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). In imposing a particular sentence, the court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guidelines range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">The district court did not clearly err in finding that Jackson\u2019s assault of his girlfriend was related to his fraud scheme because testimony at sentencing indicated that the disappearance of materials needed to continue the fraud was the motivation for the attack. Moreover, even if the district court did clearly err in finding that the assault was related to the fraud, any error was harmless because the district court likely would have sentenced Jackson the same way in considering evidence of the assault under \u00a7 1B1.4 and \u00a7 3553(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
