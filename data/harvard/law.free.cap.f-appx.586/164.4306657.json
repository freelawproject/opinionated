He argues that he should not have received an eight-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) because his Texas conviction for burglary of a motor vehicle is not an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for purposes of that guideline. He also appeals the revocation of a prior term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Morales\u2019s arguments challenging the eight-level enhancement are foreclosed by this court\u2019s holdings in <em>United States v. Ramos-Garcia, </em>95 F.3d 369, 371-72 (5th Cir.1996), and <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Guzman, </em>56 F.3d 18, 20-21 (5th Cir.1995), <em>overruled on other grounds, as recognized in United States v. Turner, </em>305 F.3d 349, 350 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Morales presents no claims of error with respect to the revocation proceeding or sentence. Thus, he has abandoned any issues on appeal regarding the revocation judgment. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b192-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
