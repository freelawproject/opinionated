Johns has moved for leave to withdraw and has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Johns has filed a response asserting that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and challenging the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress, the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction, and the district court\u2019s denial of his pretrial pro se motion for the appointment of new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-24\">The record is not sufficiently developed to allow us to make a fair evaluation of Johns\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel; we therefore decline to consider the claims without prejudice to Johns raising them on collateral review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Johns\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b191-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
