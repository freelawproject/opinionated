After a series of administrative appeals in which Lieutenant Colonel Patel challenged the validity of the investigation and decision, the Army Board for the Correction of Military Records (\u201cABCMR\u201d) declined to remove one of the violations from her record, which then ultimately resulted in her removal from the Army\u2019s promotion list. Lieutenant Colonel Patel appealed that denial to the district court, which found the ABCMR\u2019s decision to be supported by substantial evidence and granted summary judgment in favor of Secretary McHugh. Lieutenant Colonel Patel now appeals that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">We review an order granting summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard the district court employed. <em>Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Fla. v. United States, </em>566 F.3d 1257, 1264 (11th Cir.2009). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). We may set aside a final agency decision only if it is \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law....\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). As we previously have stated, \u201cthis standard is exceedingly deferential.\u201d <em>Fund for Animals, Inc. v. Rice, </em>85 F.3d 535, 541 (11th Cir.1996). We may not reweigh the evidence, but must review \u201cthe entire record to determine if the decision reached is reasonable and supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Fields v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Labor Admin. Review Bd., </em>173 F.3d 811, 813-14 (11th Cir.1999). We view the record \u201cin the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">The district court applied this deferential standard, and we find no error in its well-reasoned order entered on March 11, 2014. Accordingly, for the reasons stated in that order, we affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of Secretary McHugh and the denial of Lieutenant Colonel Patel\u2019s cross motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b612-6\">. In its March 11, 2014 order, the district court comprehensively described the procedural history of this case. Because we affirm based on the district court\u2019s thorough opinion, we need not recite that history in detail here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
