He contends the sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He asserts the advisory Guidelines-sentencing range is too high because Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2 (unlawfully entering or remaining in the United States) is not empirically based, and effectively double-counts his criminal record. He also contends the Guidelines-sentencing range overstates the seriousness of his nonviolent-reentry offense (only \u201can international trespass\u201d) and fails to account for his personal history and characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-22\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the advisory Guidelines-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, for issues preserved in district court, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). Barrera does not claim procedural error. He claims only that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. As stated, that claim is reviewed for abuse of discretion. In doing so, a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness is applied to a within-Guidelines sentence. <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 367 (5th Cir.2009) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-23\">Relying on <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 109-10, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), and to preserve the issue for possible further review, Barrera' claims the presumption of reasonableness should not apply because Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2 lacks an empirical basis. As Barrera concedes, however, this claim is foreclosed. <em>E.g., United States v. Duarte, </em>569 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009); <em>see also Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 366-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Our court has consistently rejected \u201cdouble-counting\u201d claims and assertions that Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2 results in excessive sentences because it is not empirically based. <em>E.g., Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-31. We also have rejected Barrera\u2019s only \u201can international trespass\u201d contention. <em>E.g., United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 212 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The district court considered Barrera\u2019s request for a lower sentence. Barrera, furthermore, has not shown that his sentence: fails to account for a \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factor that should receive significant weight, gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or represents a clear error in judgment in balancing sentencing factors. <em>E.g., United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009) (citation omitted). Mere disagreement with the propriety of his sentence or with the weight given to \u00a7 3553(a) factors does not suffice to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to a within-Guidelines sentence. <em>E.g., United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b221-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
