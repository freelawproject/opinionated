The district court ruled that Williams was not entitled to equitable tolling of the one-year statute of limitation. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-20\">The district court did not err by dismissing Williams\u2019s motion to vacate. A movant \u201cis entitled to equitable tolling only if he shows (1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented him from timely filing.\u201d <em>Holland v. Florida, </em>560 U.S. 631, 649, 130 S.Ct. 2549, 2562, 177 L.Ed.2d 130 (2010) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Williams argued that prison violence thwarted him from preparing his motion, but \u201clockdowns and periods in which a prisoner is separated from his legal papers are not \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 in which equitable tolling is appropriate,\u201d <em>Dodd v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1273, 1283 (11th Cir.2004). And even if we were to assume that the purported failure of Williams\u2019s trial counsel to respond to his requests for information about his appeal was an extraordinary circumstance, the district court did not clearly err in finding that Williams failed to pursue postconviction relief with diligence. Williams did not inquire about the status of his direct appeal for more than year after it was filed, and after he learned of that decision, he waited an additional two months before filing his motion to vacate. <em>See San Martin v. McNeil, </em>633 F.3d 1257, 1270-71 (11th Cir.2011). Williams\u2019s motion was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-21\">We AFFIRM the dismissal of Williams\u2019s motion to vacate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
