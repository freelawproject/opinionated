In support, Adams argues that the ALJ\u2019s consideration of two of the physician opinions in the medical record was improper, and that the ALJ\u2019s determination that she was not disabled was not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">In a social security case, we review the agency\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo, </em>and its factual findings to determine whether they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Ingram v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>496 F.3d 1253, 1260 (11th Cir.2007). Substantial evidence is defined as \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Miles v. Chater, </em>84 F.3d 1397, 1400 (11th Cir.1996) (quotations omitted). We do not reweigh the evidence or substitute our own judgment for that of the agency. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf the [agencyj\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence we must affirm, even if the proof preponderates against it.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">An individual claiming Social Security disability benefits must prove that she is disabled. <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005). The Social Security regulations establish a five-step, \u201csequential\u201d process for determining whether a claimant is disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a)(1). Throughout the process, the burden is on the claimant to introduce evidence in support of her application for benefits. <em>Ellison v. Barnhart, </em>355 F.3d 1272, 1276 (11th Cir.2003). If an ALJ finds a claimant disabled or not disabled at any given step, the ALJ does not go on to the next step. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4). At the first step, the ALJ must determine whether the claimant is currently engaged in substantial gainful activity. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.920(a)(4)\u00ae, (b). At the second step, the ALJ must determine whether the impairment or combination of impairments for which the claimant allegedly suffers is \u201csevere.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(h), (c). At the third step, the ALJ must decide whether the claimant\u2019s severe impairments meet or medically equal a listed impairment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(iii), (d). Where, as here, the ALJ finds that the claimant\u2019s severe impairments do not meet or eq\u00faal a listed impairment, the ALJ must then determine, at step four, whether she has the residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) to perform her past relevant work. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(iv), (e)-(f). \u201c[RFC] is an assessment ... of a claimant\u2019s remaining ability to do work despite [her] impairments.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1440 (11th Cir.1997). Finally, if the claimant cannot perform her past relevant work, the ALJ must then determine, at step five, whether the claimant\u2019s RFC permits her to perform other work that exists in the national economy. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(v), (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">A treating physician\u2019s opinion must be given substantial or considerable weight unless \u201cgood cause\u201d is shown to the contrary. <em>Winschel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1179 (11th Cir.2011). The ALJ may reject the opinion of any physician if the evidence supports a contrary conclusion. <em>Sryock v. Heckler, </em>764 F.2d 834, 835 (11th Cir.1985). In assessing medical evidence, an ALJ is required to state with particularity the weight he gave the different medical opinions and the reasons therefor. <em>Sharfarz v. Bowen, </em>825 F.2d 278, 279 (11th Cir.1987). However, \u201cthere is no rigid requirement that the ALJ specifically refer to every piece of evidence in his decision, so long as the ALJ\u2019s decision\u201d enables the district court \u201cto conclude that the ALJ considered [the claimant\u2019s] medical condition as a whole.\u201d <em>Dyer v. Barnhart, </em>395 F.3d 1206, 1211 (11th Cir.2005) (quotations and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">Additionally, the Commissioner, not a claimant\u2019s physician, is responsible for de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>termining whether the claimant is statutorily disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(1). Specifically, \u201c[a] statement by a medical source that [a claimant is] \u2018disabled\u2019 or \u2018unable to work\u2019 does not mean that [the Commissioner] will determine that [the claimant is] disabled.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Adams could perform light exertional work was supported by multiple opinions in the medical record, including the opinions of two examining physicians and two state agency physicians. Thus, the ALJ\u2019s determination that Adams was not disabled, but rather had the RFC to perform light exer-tional work, was supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Miles, </em>84 F.3d at 1400.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Additionally, the ALJ did not err in weighing the opinions of Adams\u2019s neurologist and her consulting physician. The record demonstrates that the ALJ, as required, articulated with particularity the weight he gave to all of the physician assessments in the medical record. <em>See Sharfarz, </em>825 F.2d at 279. The ALJ indicated that he placed \u201cgreat weight\u201d on Adams\u2019s neurologist\u2019s opinion to the extent that he concurred with the other physicians that Adams\u2019s physical impairments did not prevent her from performing light exertional work. Thus, substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s consideration of the neurologist\u2019s opinion. <em>See Sryock, </em>764 F.2d at 835. Moreover, the ALJ did not err by failing to specifically address Adams\u2019s neurologist\u2019s opinion that she should avoid frequent overhead reaching, and that she needed to take 5-minute breaks every 45 minutes, as his written decision made clear that he considered both the neurologist\u2019s opinion and Adams\u2019s medical condition as a whole. <em>See Dyer, </em>395 F.3d at 1211.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">Finally, the ALJ also did not commit any error in considering the opinion of Adams\u2019s consulting physician. The ALJ\u2019s decision to give little weight to the physician\u2019s opinion that Adams \u201cmay not be able to do any kind of job\u201d was supported by substantial evidence, given the other evidence in the medical record indicating that Adams could perform light exertional work. Further, despite Adams\u2019s argument to the contrary, the ALJ did not reject or ignore the consulting physician\u2019s opinion that Adams may not be able to do any kind of job merely on the ground that it was on an issue reserved for the Commissioner. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
