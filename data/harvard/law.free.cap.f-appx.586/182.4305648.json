He contends that the district court erred in treating his prior conviction for indecency with a child under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 21.11(a)(1) as a crime of violence within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) and an aggravated felony within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). His arguments are foreclosed by our decisions in <em>United States v. Elizondo-Hernandez, </em>755 F.3d 779, 781-82 (5th Cir.2014), and <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>711 F.3d 541, 560, 562 n. 28 (5th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 512, 187 L.Ed.2d 365 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"AqG\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b210-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R.. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
