Because Trejo submitted evidence with his motion to reconsider, the BIA construed the motion as both a motion to reconsider and a motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-22\">Trejo has filed a timely petition for review of only the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reconsider. Accordingly, we have jurisdiction to review that decision and do not have jurisdiction to review earlier orders entered in Trejo\u2019s removal proceedings. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995); <em>Kane v. Holder, </em>581 F.3d 231, 237 n. 14 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-23\">Trejo asserts that the BIA abused its discretion by ruling that he had not shown exceptional circumstances warranting the favorable exercise of discretion. Because Trejo\u2019s underlying motion to reopen was untimely, however, the BIA only considered whether Trejo had shown exceptional circumstances in deciding whether it should sua sponte reopen Trejo\u2019s removal proceedings. As this argument challenges only the BIA\u2019s refusal to sua sponte reopen the removal proceedings, we do not have jurisdiction to consider it. <em>See Enriquez-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 246, 249-50 (5th Cir.2004). Accordingly, this portion of Trejo\u2019s petition for review is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>dismissed. <em>See Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, </em>543 F.3d 216, 220 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Trejo argues that the BIA violated his due process rights by upholding his removal based upon a charge that was based upon a fact, his illegal entry into the United States in 2004, that was later shown to be incorrect. He acknowledges that an alien is usually bound by his counsel\u2019s admissions, but asserts that being bound by the admission that he illegally entered the United States in 2004 in this case would b\u00e9 improper. He maintains that the BIA abused its discretion by refusing to reopen his removal proceedings because he demonstrated prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status by presenting the approved Form 1-130 visa petition that his wife had filed on his behalf. He asserts that the BIA abused its discretion by failing to consider his motion to reconsider unopposed because the Department of Homeland Security did not file a response. Tre-jo contends that the BIA erroneously ruled that he had not presented new evidence when he had presented new evidence that Citizen and Immigration Services had approved the visa petition that his wife had filed on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">We have jurisdiction to consider denials of motions to reopen or reconsider. <em>Nolos v. Holder, </em>611 F.3d 279, 281 (5th Cir.2010). Such motions are disfavored, <em>see Lara v. Trominski, </em>216 F.3d 487, 496 (5th Cir.2000), and we review the denial of a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider under a \u201chighly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 303 (5th Cir.2005). The BIA\u2019s ruling will stand, even if erroneous, \u201cso long as it is not capricious, racially invidious, utterly without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so irrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 304 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The BIA determined that Trejo\u2019s underlying motion to reopen was untimely and that Trejo had not shown that this determination was incorrect in his motion to reconsider. It further ruled that to the extent that Trejo\u2019s motion to reconsider was properly construed as a motion to reopen, it was untimely and numerically barred. Trejo does not challenge these rulings in this court or argue that any exception to the time and numerical limitations apply, and he has therefore waived any such challenge he could have raised. <em>See Chambers v. Mukasey, </em>520 F.3d 445, 448 n. 1 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Trejo\u2019s motion to reconsider challenged the denial of his underlying motion to reopen. As Trejo does not dispute that his underlying motion to reopen was untimely, the only relief available to him was sua sponte reopening of his removal proceedings. <em>See Ramos-Bonilla, </em>543 F.3d at 219. As noted above, however, we do not have jurisdiction to consider challenges to the denial of sua sponte reopening. <em>See Enriquez-Alvarado, </em>371 F.3d at 249-50. Accordingly, even if his challenges to the various alternative rulings made by the BIA were meritorious, Trejo could not obtain relief. <em>See Ramos-Bonilla, 543 </em>F.3d at 219. Accordingly, we need not consider Trejo\u2019s challenges to the alternative rulings of the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">Furthermore, Trejo\u2019s due process claim is without merit; while Trejo presented evidence that he legally entered the United States in 1999, this is not inconsistent with his admission that he had illegally entered the United States in 2004 as Trejo could have legally resided in the United States in 1999, returned to Mexico, and illegally entered the United States in 2004. Accordingly, Trejo has not shown that the BIA\u2019s factual determination that he illegally entered the United States in 2004 was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>an abuse of discretion. <em>See Zhao, </em>404 F.3d at 303-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b199-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
