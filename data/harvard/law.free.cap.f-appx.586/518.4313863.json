He was forced to stop working in 2009 when he was diagnosed with black lung disease. On October 23, 2009, Warren filed with the Department of Labor (DOL) a claim for black lung benefits. As part of that claim, he completed a standard DOL questionnaire that requested information about his employment history. Warren wrote that he had been self-employed as a truck driver for his own business \u2014 Gary Warren Trucking \u2014 before he was forced to stop working. During the time that he was self-employed, Warren worked on an independent-contractor basis hauling coal for various companies. He used his own truck to transport the coal, and he did not have a supervisor. Before he worked as an independent contractor, Warren was employed by Fleetwood Trucking Company. When he worked for Fleetwood, he used the company\u2019s trucks and equipment to haul coal, his work was supervised by Fleet-wood\u2019s owner, and the company deducted payroll taxes from his wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">On January 12, 2010, a DOL claims examiner sent a letter to Fleetwood\u2019s owner, Lee Sellers. The letter notified Sellers that Fleetwood might be the \u201cresponsible operator\u201d for Warren\u2019s claim,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and it asked Fleetwood to submit financial information that would allow it to determine whether the company would be financially able to assume liability for the payment of Warren\u2019s benefits. The letter also stated, in bold print, that failure to respond within 30 days would result in a finding that Fleetwood was the proper \u201cresponsible operator\u201d and was financially able to assume liability for any benefits Warren was entitled to receive. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.408(a). Accompanying the letter was a \u201cnotice of claim,\u201d which explained how Fleetwood had been identified as the potential \u201cresponsible operator\u201d and included Warren\u2019s self-reported employment history. Fleetwood never responded to the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">On August 31, 2010, the same DOL claims examiner issued a \u201cschedule for the submission of additional evidence\u201d related to Warren\u2019s claim. A copy was mailed to Fleetwood and was received by the company on September 9, 2010. The schedule indicated that Fleetwood had been designated as the responsible operator liable for the payment of benefits. Pursuant to DOL regulations, it stated that Fleetwood had until September 30, 2010, to accept or reject the designation. If Fleetwood failed to respond, it would be deemed to have conceded its status as the \u201cresponsible operator\u201d and to have \u201cwaive[d] its right to contest its liability in any further proceedings.\u201d <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.412(a)(2). Though Fleetwood did eventually respond to the DOL\u2019s notice, it did so more than three weeks after the September 30 deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">Warren\u2019s claim was referred to an ALJ for a hearing. After that hearing, the ALJ determined that Warren had established entitlement to black lung benefits. The judge also found that Fleetwood could not challenge its designation as the \u201cresponsible operator\u201d liable for those benefits because it had failed to respond to the DOL\u2019s notices and failed to submit evidence with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>in the timeframes provided for in DOL regulations. Fleetwood appealed the ALJ\u2019s decision to the BRB, asserting that it was not Warren\u2019s last coal-related employer. It also contended that the DOL had failed to sufficiently investigate whether the most recent company Warren had worked for as an independent contractor should be the responsible operator. The BRB affirmed the ALJ\u2019s determination. It found that the ALJ\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence and that Fleetwood had waived its right to contest liability by failing to do so within the prescribed time periods.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Fleetwood raises several arguments on appeal. First, it contends that it was denied due process and the BRB\u2019s decision must be reversed because the DOL violated its own regulations by failing to adequately investigate whether Fleetwood was the proper \u201cresponsible operator.\u201d <em>See Gov\u2019t of Canal Zone v. Brooks, </em>427 F.2d 346, 347 (5th Cir.1970) (\u201cIt is equally well established that it is a denial of due process for any government agency to fail to follow its own regulations providing for procedural safeguards to persons involved \u00edn adjudicative processes before it.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Second, it asserts that the DOL regulations on which the ALJ relied to conclude that Fleetwood had conceded liability should not apply because the DOL failed to perform an adequate investigation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Those arguments present legal questions that we review <em>de novo. Coleman, </em>345 F.3d at 865.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">Fleetwood\u2019s arguments necessarily fail because their underlying premise \u2014 that the DOL failed to perform an adequate investigation \u2014 is flawed. Under DOL regulations, a person seeking black lung benefits must provide the DOL with \u201ca complete and detailed history\u201d of his employment. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.404(a). That employment history forms the foundation of the DOL\u2019s investigation and enables it to identify a potentially liable operator for the applicant\u2019s claim. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 725.407(a). The regulations do not identify any specific steps that the DOL must take to determine the potentially liable operator.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">The administrative record makes clear that the claims examiner engaged in a thorough investigation. She interviewed Warren on several occasions to determine the nature of his work while he was self-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>employed and while he was working for Fleetwood. She asked Warren whether he had a supervisor while he was working as an independent contractor. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 725.493(a)(1) (noting that an operator qualifies as a former employer of the claimant if it \u201cretain[ed] the right to direct, control, or supervise the work performed by\u201d the claimant). The examiner also corroborated Warren\u2019s employment history by reviewing his social security earnings record. That record confirmed that Fleet-wood had been Warren\u2019s last employer before he became self-employed. Finally, the claims examiner also sought information directly from Fleetwood to determine whether it was the responsible operator. Fleetwood never responded to that request for information. In light of all the evidence, the DOL did not fail to comply with its own regulations and it sufficiently investigated whether Fleetwood was the liable operator for Warren\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">For the reasons explained, the BRB\u2019s decision is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b547-7\">. The Black Lung Benefits Act provides benefits to coal miners who are \"totally disabled due to\u201d black lung disease, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 901(a), and regulations provide that in most circumstances the responsible operator for the payment of benefits is the worker's most recent coal-related employer. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 725.494, 725.495. Neither side disputes that Warren could not have been the \"responsible operator\u201d based on his time working as an independent contractor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b548-6\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), we adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down before October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b548-7\">. Fleetwood also asserts that its due process rights were violated because the BRB's decision was based on a presumption that Fleet-wood was the responsible operator, which \"relieve[d] the Government of having to adduce ... evidence\u201d that Fleetwood actually was the responsible operator. We find Fleet-wood's argument meritless. The BRB's decision did nothing to relieve the DOL of its obligation to find evidence concerning the identity of the responsible operator for Warren's claim. The administrative record demonstrates that the DOL relied on probative evidence to identify the responsible operator, supplied that evidence to Fleetwood, and afforded Fleetwood multiple opportunities to dispute the designation. Fleetwood failed to take advantage of those opportunities. As the respondents note, Fleetwood \"was not deprived of due process\u201d but instead \"simply neglected to exercise its rights under the regulations.\u201d <em>See also Coleman </em>v. <em>Dir., OWCP, </em>345 F.3d 861, 865 (11th Cir.2003) (finding no due process violation where petitioner was given \"notice and an opportunity to respond to the Director's argument that her claim was legally barred\u201d); <em>Nash v. Auburn Univ., </em>812 F.2d 655, 661 (11th Cir.1987) (\"An elementary and fundamental requirement of due process ... is notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
