He argues that his waiver of conflict-free counsel was invalid. Stewart asserts that the district court did not comply with <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>517 F.2d 272 (5th Cir.1975), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Flanagan v. United States, </em>465 U.S. 259, 263 &amp; n. 2, 104 S.Ct. 1051, 79 L.Ed.2d 288 (1984), and should have conducted a more thorough inquiry regarding his waiver of the right to conflict-free counsel. He contends that a conflict became apparent at sentencing and resulted in him being sentenced to a lengthier sentence than his similarly situated codefendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-23\">Stewart does not establish the existence of an actual conflict, and, thus, has not shown that the district court was required to conduct a <em>Garcia </em>hearing. He therefore has no basis to challenge the thoroughness of the district court\u2019s inquiry. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>690 F.3d 613, 618-19 (5th Cir.2012). Even if a <em>Garcia </em>hearing was required, the record supports that the district court complied with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number><em>Garcia </em>and that Stewart knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to conflict-free counsel. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Jasso, </em>472 F.3d 239, 243 (5th Cir.2006). Accordingly, his argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"A_G\">Stewart also contends that counsel'rendered ineffective assistance at the sentencing hearing by not securing documents and favorable witnesses and not objecting to the district court\u2019s sentencing decision. The record is not sufficiently developed to permit review of these claims on direct appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Isgar, </em>739 F.3d 829, 841 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 123, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-(2014).</p>\n<p id=\"A3d\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b206-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Aqo\">. Stewart argued these grounds as a basis for \u00e1n ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion seeking to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence. In that same motion, Stewart also argued that his counsel\u2019s failure to perfect a timely appeal constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. Finding that Stewart's counsel failed to file a timely notice of appeal, the district court vacated and reinstated the judgment of conviction to afford Stewart the chance to appeal but dismissed Stewart\u2019s other claims without prejudice. Because the district court dismissed his other claims without prejudice, Stewart is \u201centitled to an adjudication of all the claims presented in his earlier\u201d habeas application without seeking authorization to file a second or successive application. <em>See Stewart v. Martinez-Villareal, </em>523 U.S. 637, 643-44, 118 S.Ct. 1618, 140 L.Ed.2d 849 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
