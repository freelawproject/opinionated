Amos asserted claims for breach of contract and violation of his constitutional right to substantive due process. Following cross motions for summary judgment filed by the parties, the district court denied Amos\u2019s motion and granted the City\u2019s motion in part by dismissing Amos\u2019s action with prejudice, but the court denied the part of the City\u2019s summary judgment motion that sought attorneys fees. We affirm for essentially the same reasons patiently and logically set forth in the court\u2019s Ruling of May 21, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-22\">As emphasized by the district court, this is not an employment discrimination case. Rather, it is a straightforward breach of contract action arising under the Collective Bargaining Agreement (\u201cCBA\u201d) between the City and Local 2388 of the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Workers (the \u201cUnion\u201d) of which Amos was a member at all relevant times.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-23\">After the City noticed a job opening for the position of Trash Superintendent, which specified, <em>inter alia, </em>that current employees of the City would be given ten working days to fill the position before it would be opened to the public, Amos and one other City employee, Tommy Landers, applied for the position. At that time, Amos had been an employee of the City for twelve years and Landers for two years. The City\u2019s Sanitation Superintendent, Don Hopkins, eventually selected Landers for the position. Amos proceeded through all steps of the CBA\u2019s specified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>grievance procedure without success, then brought this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">The parties filed competing motions for summary judgment on the same day in February 2014. Amos asserted in his motion that, as a matter of law, he was qualified for the position and had worked for the City continuously for much longer than had Landers, so the City violated the CBA in promoting Landers over Amos and was arbitrary and capricious in so doing. The City\u2019s motion pleaded that, as a matter of law, (1) it did not breach the CBA in failing to promote Amos, (2) Amos had failed to state a substantive due process claim, and (3) the City is entitled to attorneys fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b). Following various filings by the parties in March and April of 2014, the court ruled as earlier stated. Amos appeals the dismissal of his suit with prejudice and the City appeals the denial of attorneys fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">BREACH OF CONTRACT</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">The record on appeal reflects Amos\u2019s lengthy history of warnings and reprimands for excessive absenteeism \u2014 79 days in 2006, 85 days in 2007 and 41 days in 2010 \u2014 as well as disciplinary actions for failure to follow job instructions and disputes regarding whether he was required to work overtime. In the end, the City\u2019s mayor suspended Amos for a week without pay instead of firing him as recommended. It is within the framework of Amos\u2019s job history that he was not chosen for the position of Trash Superintendent.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">The district court properly applied Louisiana contract law in deciding the competing claims of the parties rather than deciding the case under the Labor Management Relations Act (\u201cLMRA\u201d) as urged by Amos. The court noted that the LMRA exempts states and their political subdivisions, such as the City, from the reach of that Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">Turning to the CBA, the Court\u2019s analysis focused on provisions that entitle the City (1) to \u201chire, promote, classify\u201d any employee \u201cwithout negotiations\u201d and (2) to \u201cfill the opening by promoting from among the qualified applicants the employee with the longest continuous service.\u201d None contests that Amos\u2019s continuous service was much longer than Landers\u2019s, so the court\u2019s rejection of Amos\u2019s claim for breach of the CBA turns on the term \u201cqualified applicants.\u201d As carefully and correctly analyzed by the district court, the implicit determination by the City\u2019s Sanitation Superintendent that Amos was not a \u201cqualified\u201d applicant for the position of Trash Superintendent survives Amos\u2019s arguments and carries the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">We agree with the court that the City was \u201cnot restricted to the \u2018Minimum Qualifications\u2019 and \u2018Examples of Duties\u2019 [described in the job opening notice] when determining whether an applicant is qualified.\u201d We also agree that the list entitled \u201cExamples of Duties\u201d is not an exclusive list of all duties, just as the list of \u201cMinimum Qualifications\u201d is not an exclusive list of qualifications for the job. Hopkins was well within his authority to consider \u201cAmos\u2019 initiative, leadership qualities, work history, disciplinary record, absenteeism, a perceived failure to \u2018step-up\u2019 and statements concerning working alone as well as those on the non-exclusive list.\u201d And, Hopkins acted well within his discretion in concluding that Amos was not qualified for the job at issue, rendering the length of his service irrelevant. As the court stated: \u201cThus, Article VII\u2019s seniority provision was not applicable, and the City did not breach the CBA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-12\">SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS</p>\n<p id=\"b202-13\">The failure of Amos\u2019s breach of contract claim and his concomitant failure to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>that the City was arbitrary and capricious in that regard eliminates any possibility of success on his substantive due process claim. The court correctly rejected Amos\u2019s constitutional claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">ATTORNEYS FEES</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that Amos\u2019s action was not frivolous. It therefore did not err in denying the City\u2019s claim for attorneys fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">Accordingly, the May 21, 2014 Judgment of the district court dismissing Amos\u2019s lawsuit with prejudice and denying attorneys fees to the City is, in all respects,</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b201-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
