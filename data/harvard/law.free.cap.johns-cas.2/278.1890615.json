The trustees sold all the right, title and interest of the Company to certain lands at public auction, and three of the lots were conveyed by the trustees <em>to </em>John B. Murray.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-5\">An action of ejectment was afterward? brought by Murray and others, who purchased of the trustees, against persons who claimed title to part of the lands, *and they recovered only 14-18th parts of the land so purchased by them. (See 1 Johns. Cas. 372, 377.) Murray claimed to be refunded 4-18th\u2019s of the purchase money paid to the trustees. And,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b478-6\">Pendleton,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASVy\">in his behalf, now moved for an order under the 27th section of the act, to refund 4-18th's of <em>the </em>purchase money, and to pay the costs of the action of ejectment. He \u2022 cited 2 Eq. Cas. Abr. 688. 1 Ves. 126.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b478-7\"><em>Harison, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFD\">admitted the power of the court under the act to interfere; but he contended, that in cases of executors, trustees and others, acting <em>in auter droit, </em>they can never be liable, unless in cases of fraud, or on an express covenant. That the trustees sold only the right and title of the company, and it was incumbent on the purchaser to look to the goodness of the title. The old maxim of <em>caveat emptor, </em>is applicable to them. He cited Doug. 630. 3 Ves. jun. 235.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b478-8\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AkJE\">It is unnecessary to decide, whether this application is within the 27th section of the act, since w\u00a9 are clearly of opinion that it is unfounded on the merits. The trustees in selling the land, acted <em>in auter droit, </em>and the covenants in the deed are expressly confined to their own acts, and do not warrant the title. They merely sold all the right and title of the Ringwood Company, and it was incumbent on the purchaser to look <em>to </em>the goodness of the title. There is neither an express nor an implied warranty on the part of the trustees ; and the rule of <em>caveat emptor </em>strictly . applies. The motion must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">Rule refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
