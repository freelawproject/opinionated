Rep. 536.) Not so, however, where the sentence after stating one sufficient cause of condemnation, proceeded to condemn the vessel for that cause, adding, <em>and for other sufficient causes. </em>In this ease, the sentence was held conclusive against the insured as to the ground specially set forth. <em>(Baxter </em>v. <em>The New England Mar. Ins. Co. </em>6 Mass. Rep. 277. See S. C. 7 id. 275.)</p>\n\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"b\">\n<p id=\"b694-12\">(b) See <em>supra, </em>144, n. (b) to <em>Vandenheuvel </em>v. <em>The United Ins.

The facts contained in the special verdict were the same as those stated in the report of this case, and that of <em>Goix </em>v. <em>Knox, </em>1 Johns. Cas. p. 337 \u2014 341.</p><p id=\"b693-8\">After argument, the court reversed the judgment of the court below, on the ground, that being condemned as <em>lawful prize, </em>afforded no <em>judicial inference </em>of the vessel\u2019s being <em>enemy\u2019s property,(</em><footnotemark><em>a</em></footnotemark><em>) </em>as there may be other just causes of condemnation ; and the sentence of the court of admiralty not being conclusive.(<footnotemark>b</footnotemark>) there were no circumstances in the case, authorizing a condemnation, nor showing a breach of warranty.</p><p id=\"b694-5\">Judgment of reversal.(<footnotemark>c</footnotemark>)</p><p id=\"b693-9\"><em>(a) </em>Mr. Phillipps, in the eighth edition of his work on Evidence, states that \u201c If no special ground is stated, and the ship is condemned generally as lawful prize, it is to be presumed from the condemnation, as no other cause appears, that the sentence proceeded on the ground of the property belonging to an enemy ; and the sentence, in such a case, has been held to be conclusive evidence that the property was not neutraland he cites <em>Saloucci </em>v. <em>Woodmas </em>to support the position. Mr. Justice Radcliff, in his opinion above, (1 Johns. Cas. 342,) observes, \u201c I think the sentence is to be considered as proceeding on the want of neutrality. Its silence will not authorize a different conclusion. Enemy property forms the general ground of condemnation. If founded on a special or different ground, it would probably have been stated, or might be made to appear from the libel, or the proceedings upon it, to which it must have referred. No other being shown, an extraordinary cause of condemnation cannot be presumed. This interpretation of silent sentences was adopted in the case of <em>Saloucci </em>v. <em>Woodmas, </em>and appears to be natural and just.\u201d</p><p id=\"b693-10\">This doctrine, however, has been expressly denied in <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>South Carolina Ins. Co. </em>(1 Nott &amp; M\u2019Cord, 544, n. <em>h,) </em>and Nott, J. after reviewing the English cases, came to the conclusion that the weight of authority in England was against <em>Saloucci </em>v. <em>Woodmas. </em>Messrs. Cowen &amp; Hill, in their Notes, (vol. 2, p. 884,) remark: \u201c In Pennsylvania, where the question was whether certain property was <em>American, </em>conformably to a warranty in a policy of insurance, held, that inasmuch as the libel stated contradictory causes of condemnation, and the decree was general, so that the precise grounds of it could not be ascertained, evidence was admissible on the part of the plaintiff, <em>to show that the </em>property was <em>American: </em>and it distinctly appearing from the proof that such was the character of the property, Shippen, J. said: \u2018We cannot presume that the judge of a foreign court has perjured himself, by declaring that property <em>to be French, </em>which we <em>know to </em>be <em>American; </em>and of course we must assume the position, that his decree proceeded upon the other allegations in the libel,\u2019 viz. those which conceded the property to be American. <em>(Vasse </em>v. <em>Ball, </em>2 Dall. Rep. 270, 275. S. C. 2 Yeates\u2019 Rep. 178. See <em>Croussillat </em>v. <em>Ball, 3 </em>id. 375.)</p><p id=\"b694-7\">\u201c And in South Carolina, where the libel alleged one ground of condemnation, and the sentence another, held, that it was such a case of ambiguity, as to afford ground for opening the decree and suffering the parties to go into evidence on both sides. <em>(Blacklock </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>2 Bay\u2019s Rep. 363. See S. P. <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Tunno, </em>id. 388.)</p><p id=\"b694-8\">\u201c The same doctrine was held in Maryland, where the decree was ambiguous, so that the precise grounds of it could not be gathered from it. <em>(Gray </em>v. <em>Swan, </em>1 Har. &amp; Johns. 142.)</p><p id=\"b694-11\">\u201c In New York, we have already seen that the sentence of a foreign admiralty court, is conclusive to change the property, but is only <em>prima facie </em>evidence to affect a warranty or representation in a policy of insurance. (See 2 Cowen &amp; Hill\u2019s Notes, p. 883, note 626.) And where the libel alleged various and inconsistent causes of condemnation, and the sentence pronounced the vessel as forfeited \u2018 for a breach of some or one of the laws relating to trade and navigation ;\u2019 Spencer, Senator, regarded it as equivalent to saying that the condemnation was for some cause or other, and consequently proved nothing as between the insured and underwriter. <em>(The Ocean Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Francis, 3 </em>Wend. Rep. 64, 74; and see per Walworth, Ch. id. 69, 70.)\u201d</p><p id=\"b694-13\">(c) [Old note.] From the cases of <em>Pollard </em>v. <em>Bell, Bird </em>v. <em>Appleton, </em>(8 Term Rep. 434, 562;) <em>Price </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>(1 East, 663 ;) and <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Ogle, </em>(1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Campb. N. P. Cases, 418,) it seems now to be the opinion of the English courts, that where the sentence of the foreign court of admiralty condemns merely as <em>good and lawful prize, </em>without adverting to the question, whether it is neutral or enemy\u2019s property, such sentence is not conclusive.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
