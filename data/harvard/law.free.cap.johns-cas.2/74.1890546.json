B. In January term last, judgment was obtained against them, and in March, an execution issued thereon. The proceedings against them were by writs of <em>scire facias, </em>which were returned <em>nihil; </em>and it appeared, that the second <em>scire facias </em>had not been four days in the sheriff\u2019s office. On this ground,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A64\">\n<em>Van Vechten</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARN\">moved to set aside all the subsequent proceedings, for irregularity.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b112-7\"><em>Woodworth, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b112-8\">\n<em>Per Curiam,</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AGu\">There has been a great <em>laches </em>on the part of the defendants. They must be presumed to have had actual notice of the proceedings against them, at or before April term last, for the execution issued in March. Two terms have since intervened, and they now come too late to object to these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">Motion denied.(<footnotemark>a</footnotemark>)</p>\n<footnote label=\"a\">\n<p id=\"b112-10\"><em>(a) </em>It is a general rule in regard to applications to set aside proceedings oil the ground of irregularity, and \u201cit has been uniformly held, in regard <em>to </em>applications of this nature, that the party must present his application to the court, at <em>the </em>first opportunity after the irregularity <em>has </em>taken <em>place, and before </em>any further proceedings have been had in the cause, by the party complaining of it; 3 T.

Where a party moves on a <em>mere irregularity </em>he must be held to the rule strictly, and move at the first opportunity or he will be too late. <em>Cagger </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>1 Howard, N.
