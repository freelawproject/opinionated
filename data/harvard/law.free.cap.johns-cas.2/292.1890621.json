The 7th, 8th, and 9th rules of April term, 1796, require, in all cases, whether the defendant enters his appearance, or files common or special bail, that a <em>rule </em>to declare must be entered, and <em>notice </em>thereof given to the plaintiff, or his attorney, before a judgment of nonsuit can be entered. As no such rule has been entered, or notice given, the judgment must be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Rule granted.(<footnotemark>a</footnotemark>)</p>\n<footnote label=\"a\">\n<p id=\"Ana\">lo) See Graham\u2019s Practice, 2d ed. p. 191, 622.
