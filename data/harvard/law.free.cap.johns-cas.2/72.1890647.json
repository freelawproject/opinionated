Upon a writ of error, the court above may not only <em>reverse, </em>but give such judgment as the court below ought to have given.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">Motion denied.(<footnotemark>a</footnotemark>)</p>\n<footnote label=\"a\">\n<p id=\"b110-11\"><em>(a) </em>A <em>mandamus </em>is only proper where a party has a legal right, without any other appropriate legal remedy, and where in justice a remedy ought to be granted. <em>The People </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>5 Hill, 616 ; <em>Ex parte Lynch, </em>2 id. 45; <em>Boyce </em>v. <em>Russel, </em>2 Cowen, 444 ; <em>Ex parte Nelson, </em>id. 417, 423 ; <em>The People </em>v. <em>Supervisors of Albany, </em>12 Johns.
