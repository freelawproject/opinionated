(Co. Litt. 139, b.) At common law, on every continuance or day given, at or before judgment, the plaintiff or demandant might have been nonsuited ; and before the stat. of Henry IY. after verdict, if the court gave a day to be advised, at that day *plaintiff was demandable, and, therefore, might have been nonsuited, if he did not then appear; but that is remedied by our statute. After an award to answer, however, or a demurrer in law joined, the plaintiff for not ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>pearing shall still be nonsuit, for he is not helped by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Judgment of nonsuit.(<footnotemark>b</footnotemark>)</p>\n<footnote label=\"b\">\n<p id=\"b159-12\">(b) See n.
