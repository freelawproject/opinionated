The <em>equity </em>between the parties is now equal. The plaintiff \u2022regularly obtained a judgment by default. The defendant has regularly obtained a discharge of that judgment. As the money has been levied on the judgment, and is now in the hands of the plaintiff, we will not order him to pay it back to the defendant; but it must be brought into court to abide the final event of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">Motion denied.(<footnotemark>a</footnotemark>)</p>\n<footnote label=\"a\">\n<p id=\"b396-13\">(a) Grah.
