I. Bogert, for the defendant, moved to set aside a judgment by default, on <em>scire </em>facias, entered at the last term. The defendant\u2019s affidavit stated that she had a good defence, and that, during the time for pleading, her attorney was dangerously ill, she herself residing in Connecticut.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b486-7\"><em>Hamilton, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWG\">contended that the judgment, at least, ought to stand as security for the assets.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AGC\">\n<em>*Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Aeeo\">The defendant ought not to be made liable beyond the assets remaining in her hands, after satisfying the other judgments which <em>she confessed. </em>Not having sufficient to discharge all the judgments, she was obliged to give some a preference. Her election in favor of other creditors, therefore, is not to be charged to any misapplication of the assets ; and she ought not to be made liable for more than what remains, after satisfying those judgments. Her excuse, too, for not pleading, appears sufficient ; but as the judgment is regular, it ought to stand as security for the assets in her hands, beyond the amount of the other judgments, and for other assets <em>quando acciderint; </em>and she must disclose, by affidavit, the state of the assets at the time, and since.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">Rule accordingly.(<footnotemark>a</footnotemark>)</p>\n<footnote label=\"a\">\n<p id=\"b486-10\">(a) See <em>Russel </em>v. <em>Ball, infra, </em>vol. 3, p. 92. <em>McKinstry </em>v. <em>Edward, supra, </em>p. 113, and n.
