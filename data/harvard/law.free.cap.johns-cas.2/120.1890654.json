On the 15th April, 1798, the vessel, and all her cargo, except two casks of nails, were acquitted, and on the 29th April, restored to the captain. The two casks of nails, under the name of scupper nails, were condemned as good and lawful prize, as being articles contraband of war, or otherwise subject and liable to confiscation. No disclosure was made to the defendants, that any contraband articles were on board. On the 4th May, a survey of the vessel was made, at the request of the captain, under the authority of the court, and the brig, on the report of the surveyors, was condemned as unfit for sea, and was sold.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-8\">The vessel and cargo were abandoned to the insurers, on the 5th May, 1798.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b169-9\">Harison, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b169-10\"><em>Hamilton, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKl\">declined arguing the cause.
