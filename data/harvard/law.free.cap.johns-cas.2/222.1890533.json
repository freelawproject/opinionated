There is no statute on the subject. The act of congress, granting a compensation to members during their going or returning, allowing twenty miles travel to a day, does not apply to the question of privilege. This privilege is to be taken strictly, and is to be allowed only while the party is attending congress, or is actually on his journey, going or returning from the seat of government. The case of <em>Colvin </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>(1 Johns. Gas. 415, and notes,) is in point. The motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">Motion denied.(<footnotemark>a</footnotemark>)</p>\n<footnote label=\"a\">\n<p id=\"b397-9\"><em>(a) By the </em>constitution of the United States, (art. 1, \u00a7 6,) senators and representatives in congress are privileged from arrest in all cases, except treason, felony, and breach of the peace, during their attendance at the session of their respective houses, and in going to and returning from the same. This privilege (\u201c indispensable for the just exercise of the legislative power in every nation,\u201d) has always been enjoyed by both houses of the British parliament, and by all the legislative bodies which exist, or have existed, in America. (2 Story\u2019s Comm, on the Const. 325, \u00a7 856. 1 Black. Comm. 164, 165. Com. Dig. Parliament, D. 17. Jefferson\u2019s Manual, \u00a7 3, Privilege. <em>Benyon </em>v. <em>Evelyn, </em>Sir O. Bridg. R. 334. 1 Kent Comm. p. 221. <em>Bolton </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>1 Dall. R. 296. <em>Coffin </em>v. <em>Coffin, </em>4 Mass. R. 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">This privilege is a shield against all process, such as a <em>subpoena ad respondendum </em>and <em>testificandum </em>or a summons to serve on a jury, the disobedience to which is punishable by attachment of the person. The reason is well stat-by Justice Story, (2 Comm, on Const, p. 325, \u00a7 857.) <em>\u201c </em>When a representative is withdrawn from his seat by a summons, the people, whom he represents, lose their voice in debate and vote, as they do in his voluntary absence. When a senator is withdrawn by summons, his state loses half its voice in debate and vote, as it does in his voluntary absence. The enormous disparity of the evil admits, of no comparison. The privilege, indeed, is deemed not merely the privilege of the member, or his constituents, but the privilege of the house also. And every man must at his peril take notice, who are the members of the house returned of record.\u201d This privilege has been stated to be co-extensive with that of witnesses, suitors and jurors, <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>4 Dall. 341; <em>King </em>v. <em>Coil, 4 </em>Day, 133 ; <em>Gibbs </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>2 Bay,</p>\n<p id=\"ABX\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>406 ; see also 1 Graham\u2019s Prac. 3d ed. 511, 512,) which embraces a reasonable time, <em>cundo, morando et redeundo, </em>instead of being limited by any precise time. <em>(Harris v. Grantham, </em>Coxe, 142. <em>Blight </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>Peters\u2019 C. C. 41. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ronald, </em>4 Call, 97. <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Goodson, </em>2 Virg. Cas. 381. <em>Hurst\u2019s case, </em>4 Dall. 387. 4 Yeates, 124, note. 1 Wash. C. C. 186. <em>M\u2019Neil\u2019s case, </em>6 Mass. R. 245, <em>264. Meekins </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>1 H. Black. 636. <em>Walpole </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>3 Doug. 45. <em>Anon. </em>Lofft, 34. See the New York cases, 1 Grah. Pr. 3d ed. 515, 516.) I The effect of this privilege is, that the arrest of the member is unlawful, and a trespass <em>ah initio, </em>for which he may maintain an action, or proceed against the aggressor by way of indictment. He may also be discharged by motion to a court of justice, or upon a writ of habeas corpus ; (Jefferson\u2019s Manual, \u00a7 3 ; 2 Str. 990 ; 2 Wilson\u2019s R. 151; Cas. Temp. Hard. 28 ;) and the arrest may also be punished, as a <em>contempt of </em>the house. (1 Black. Comm. 164, 165, 166. Com. Dig. Parliament, D. 17. Jefferson\u2019s Manual, \u00a7 3.) In respect to the time of going and returning, the law is not so strict in point of time, as to require the party to set out immediately on his return ; but allows him time <em>to settle </em>his private affairs, and to prepare for his journey. Nor does <em>It </em>nicely scan his road, nor is his protection forfeited, by a little deviation from that which is most direct; for it is supposed that some superior convenience or necessity directed it. (Jefferson\u2019s Manual, \u00a7 3. 2 Str. 986,987.) The privilege from arrest takes place by force of the election, and before the member has taken his seat, or is sworn. (Jefferson\u2019s Manual, \u00a7 3 ; but see Com. Dig. Parliament, D. 17. 2 Story\u2019s Com. on Const. 327, \u00a7\u00a7 860, 661.) Where a member of congress, who had been surrendered by his hail, claimed to be discharged on the ground of privilege, and the counsel for the bail proposed to remain responsible for surrendering him within four days after the session of congress, which the counsel for the plaintiff agreed to, the court declared their approbation of the compromise, as affording a good precedent for future cases of a similar kind. <em>(Coxe </em>v. <em>M\u2019Clonachan, </em>3 Dall. 478.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
