Abr. 183, (B). 2 Hawk. Plea. Cr. 214. He further insisted, that there must be a demand made of the costs, after the bill has been regularly taxed, before the party can be considered as in contempt. (Barnes, 120. 1 Lilly\u2019s Abr. 162.) Besides, he insisted, that according to 1 Salk. 83, no attachment will lie at all for the costs of putting off a trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b161-5\">\n<em>L.

Had he been regular in this, he would have been entitled to his attachment instantly, without a previous notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">The notice in this case having been served on counsel, and the taxation having been made on the same day notice was given, the taxation and all proceedings founded on it were irregular.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">The case mentioned from Salkeld is anonymous, and standing alone, we think it not entitled to weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">The attachment must be set aside with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">Rule granted.(<footnotemark>c</footnotemark>)</p>\n<footnote label=\"b\">\n<p id=\"b161-11\"><em>(b) </em>See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hassenfratts, </em>3 Cowen, 26; <em>Howland </em>v. <em>Ralph, </em>3 Johns. 20 ; <em>St. John </em>v. <em>Hubbard, </em>1 Wend. 194; <em>Burns v.

And these costs should be- paid <em>instanter, </em>that is, within twenty-four hours; Rule 60 ; and for this purpose, it is the duty of the defendant to seek the plaintiff, and tender the costs after taxation, 2 Wend. 293, without waiting for a formal demand; 19 Johns. 270 ; <em>et vide </em>1 Johns. Cas. 396 ; although, perhaps, the rule should express that the costs are to be paid <em>instanter, </em>it being provided by rule 60, that in all cases where a motion shall be granted on payment of costs, or on the performance of any condition, or where the order shall require such payment or performance, the party, whose duty it shall be to comply therewith, shall have twenty days for that purpose, unless otherwise directed in the order. This rule is probably intended to apply to motions in bank ; but to avoid any question, the judge at <em>nisi prius </em>would, upon suggestion, direct an express provision in the rule, as to the time of payment.\u201d Grah.
