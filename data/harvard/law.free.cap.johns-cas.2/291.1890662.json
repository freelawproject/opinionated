Wood hull, in the name of Butter-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>worth, the present plaintiff. It appeared that Butterworth never was either the payee or holder of the note, nor in any way interested therein ; and that Woodhull never had any authority to bring the suit in his name, and that the plaintiff knew nothing of the suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-5\">The plaintiff was nonsuited at the last circuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b491-6\">\n<em>Baldwin</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALh\">now moved for a rule on Woodhull, to show cause why an attachment should not issue against him for the costs, on the ground of a contempt of the process of the court.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b491-7\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"ANN\">This is evidently an abuse of the process of the court. It is a contempt to bring a <em>fictitious </em>suit, or to use the name of another, without his privity or consent. If we do not interfere, the nominal plaintiff may be materially injured ; and when it is in our power to afford him relief, in this summary mode, as for a contempt, we ought to do it, and reach the real person who has perverted the process of the court. We therefore grant the rule. <em>(Coxe </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>Cas. temp. Hardw. 237. 4 Bl. Com. 285.)</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Rule granted.
