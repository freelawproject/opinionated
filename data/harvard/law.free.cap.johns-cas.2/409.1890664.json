(Signed,) John R. Livingston, for 1000 dollars, and by others.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-5\">At the trial, the advancement of the loan by the plaintiffs was proved ; when the same became due, the committee were called upon by the plaintiffs for payment, which was refused, as they had no funds. The plaintiffs then gave notice in writing to the defendant of such refusal, and required of him the payment of the sum affixed to his name, agreeably to the contract. A verdict was found for the plaintiffs, with the interest.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b618-6\"><em>E. </em>Livingston, for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Azdd\">now moved to set aside the verdict, and for a new trial. He contended that the plaintiffs, before they could be entitled to an action against the defendant, ought to have sued the committee, to whom the credit was given by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b618-7\"><em>jHarison, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b618-8\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"ARs9\">The members of the committee were mere agents in this transaction, and there was no necessity of suing them. The defendant absolutely guarantied the payment of the sum subscribed by him. He stands as surety at least, and is liable, in the first instance, to the plaintiffs. It is unnecessary to decide whether the plaintiffs could maintain an action against the agents. If they could, the defendant is collaterally liable, and the plaintiffs have done all that was necessary to make the defendant responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">Motion denied.(<footnotemark>a</footnotemark>)</p>\n<footnote label=\"a\">\n<p id=\"b618-10\"><em>(a) </em>See Theobald on Principal and; Surety, 1, 2, 45, <em>et seq. </em>Pitman on Principal and Surety, 26, <em>et seq. </em>Burge on Principal and Surety, 40, <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
