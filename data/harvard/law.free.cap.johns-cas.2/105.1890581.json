It appear that the original cause was commenced in July vacation, 1797 ; that in November, an accommodation was made between the parties, and the plaintiff then directed the proceedings to be stayed, on payment of costs. The costs remaining unpaid, a suit was instituted on the bail-bond, in April \u2019Vacation, 1799, and the defendant put in a plea of <em>non est factum, </em>in October vacation following.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b151-7\">\n<em>Ten Broeck,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AnV\">in reply, offered <em>counter-supplementary </em>affidavits, but <em>the Court </em>would not suffer them to be <em>read; </em>obsefving, that a party can never support his motion by any affidavits but those on which he originally grounds it.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"a\">\n<p id=\"b150-13\">(a)S.
