The application was denied October 1, 1935, and this appeal was duly taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The denial of the application was upon the ground that the place operated by the applicant was not a restaurant within the contemplation \u2022 of the Liquor Control Act because hot meals are not served in the premises as the principal business, and this result is arrived at because the gross re' ceipts from sales of beer under the permit he held averaged, monthly, $550., while the gross receipts from the sale of hot food averaged, monthly, $365. No other question in the case is raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">I have repeatedly held in cases in which this question was raised, two of which are reported in Connecticut Law Journal\u2014Gruett\u2019s Appeal, Connecticut Law Journal, issue of December 12, 1936, page 6, and Borisza\u2019s Appeal, issue of December 30, page 3, that the term \u201cprincipal business\u201d as used in the Act is vague and incapable of definite construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">The fact that the gross receipts from sales of liquor under the permit exceed the gross receipts from the sales of hot foods, which foods are served twice daily, does not take the premises out from the contemplation of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">The cases referred to, supra, are determinative of the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">The appellant is found to be a suitable person to receive the permit applied for and the premises are suitable premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">Judgment may be entered for the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
