Wales Lines Company, 119 Conn. 603 at 612.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">As to the allegations of paragraph 3 of the plea to the jurisdiction, that the property attached is not such as to come within the provisions of Section 5718 and that attachment thereof without removal or actual physical possession thereof is not effective\u2014this-phase of the matter is decided in favor of the plaintiff and it is found that the property attached was such as to come within the provisions of Section 5718.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">As to the allegations of paragraphs 1 and 2 of the plea to the jurisdiction, that no true and attested copy of the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>plaint was at any time left with the defendant, as ordered by the Court in the order of notice, it is found that this is true and that the defendant at no time received nor had served upon him a true and attested copy of the complaint and of the opder of notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Section 5714, Revision 1930, prescribes the definite procedure for attachment against non-residents.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">In the ninth line of that section it is prescribed that \u201cif there be no person in charge or possession of the estate attached the Court before which such action is returnable may order such notice of the commencement or pendancy of such, action to be given to the defendant therein as the Court may deem reasonable, and such notice, having been given and proved, shall be deemed sufficient service of process in such action, and such action shall thereupon become effective against such estate and the defendant in such action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">In the 12th line of that Section\u20145714\u2014it is provided that the notice shall be ordered by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">Whether the notice was actually ordered by the Court does not appear nor is there any plea to the jurisdiction for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">Fosdick vs. Roberson, et al. 91 Conn. 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">It is specifically alleged that the order of notice dated April 25, 1935, was not complied with in that a true and attested copy of the complaint and of the order,of notice was not left with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">This has been found to be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-12\">The Statute specifically provides that reasonable notice shall be given by the Court \u201cand such notice, having been given, and.proved, shall be deemed sufficient service, etc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-13\">Our Supreme Court has repeatedly and consistently held that there must be strict compliance with the provision of the Statute.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-14\">\u201cOur Statutes provide a special procedure for the attachment of estate within this State belonging to defendants not residing within the State. This Statute is and was exclusive. Being in derogation of both common right and common law, it is one to be strictly interpreted and pursued. Its provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>and requirements may not be disregarded with impunity, nor waived or changed by Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Munger, Admr. vs. Doolan, 75 Conn. 656 at 659.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">In the same case, at page 660, our Supreme Court further said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">\u201cThe Statute requires that a specified course be pursued, if a man\u2019s property is to be taken from him without jurisdiction of his person. It recognises no equivalents and admits of no evasions. Nothing less than, or different from, that which the Statute prescribes can satisfy its requirements, even though the same substantial ends are accomplished.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">\u201cThe law requires an attestation of the copy by the officer. Webster defines the word \u2018attest\u2019 as follows: \u2018To bear witness to; to certify; to affirm to be true or genuine; to make a solemn declaration in words or writing to support a fact; appropriately used for the affirmation of persons in their official capacity, as to attest the truth of a writing, to attest a copy of record.\u2019 .... It is clear that there was no attestation of the copy, and consequently no such copy as the law requires or recognises was left with the defendant in the original suit or at his usual place of abode. It follows therefore that no attachment of the property of the defendant was made in that case, for an important part of the attachment was the leaving with the defendant or at his usual place of abode \u2018a true and attested copy\u2019 of the writ. But it is said that the defendant in that case appeared in Court and answered to the proceeding, and that a legal judgment was rendered against him. But that did not attach his property. The attachment was made by the officer, if it was made at all, before the process was returned to court. The defendant could waive the formality of the service of process by appearing in Court and answering to the case, but this no more creates a lien on his property to secure the judgment that might be lawfully rendered, than the acknowledgment of a debt creates a lien on the property of the debtor. The waiver in such case extended no further than to make the judgment valid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">McGuire vs. Church, 49 Conn. 248 at 249, 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">See also Fosdick vs. Roberson, et al., 91 Conn. 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>The Court may properly refuse to proceed with the matter when the question of jurisdiction has been raised, until that issue is determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Palmer vs. Reeves, 120 Conn. 405 at 409.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The defect in service did not appear upon the record be' cause in the return of the alleged indifferent person made to this Court under date of April 11, 193? it was recited that the alleged indifferent person deposited in the Post Office at New London, postage prepaid and registered \u201ca true and attested copy of the above mentioned complaint, citation and of the foregoing order addressed to S. Levine, 1441 Broadway, New York City, N. Y.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Upon the hearing of the issues raised by the plea' to the jurisdiction the pretended copies which were sent to the de' fendant were introduced in evidence and it plainly appears that there was no attestation on any of the copies received by the defendant and that no attempt was made to make any attestation.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">Although the point is not raised upon the pleadings it should be observed that, although this action was returnable to the Superior Court on the first Tuesday of March, 193? that no attempt to obtain any order of notice was made until the 10th day of. April, 193?. There appears to be no reason or warrant for such delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">The defendant was entitled to exercise dominion over his property until he was duly prevented from exercising domin'ion by due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">Upon the pleadings filed in connection with the plea to the jurisdiction the issues are found for the defendant and judg' ment may enter accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
