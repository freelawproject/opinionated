Sup. 1933, now Sec. 375c, Cum. Sup. 1935, formerly Sec. 1201, G. S.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">The defendant demurs upon the ground that it is not alleged and it does not appear in the amended complaint that the tax has not been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">The prayer for relief is that the valuation of the assessed property be reduced to its actual fair valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-13\">The action is not brought to restrain the collection of a claimed illegal tax, and an allegation that the tax has not been paid would be immaterial to a determination of the grievance plaintiffs claim relief from. The complaint as now amended sets up a cause of action under the statute herein-before referred to.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-14\">\u201cThe demurrer being addressed to the substance of the complaint, if any facts which are provable under its allegations would support the cause of action relied upon, the demurrer would of necessity fail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-15\">Cashman vs. Meriden Hospital, 117 Conn. 585, 586, 169 Atl. 915; Blakeslee vs. Water Commissioners, 106 Conn. 642, 649 139, Atl. 106.; Mathews vs. Converse, 83 Conn. 511, 515, 77 Atl. 961; Wildman, 72 Conn. 262, 270, 44 Atl. 224; O\u2019Donnell vs. Sargent, 69 Conn. 476, 483, 38 Atl. 216.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-17\">The demurrer is overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
