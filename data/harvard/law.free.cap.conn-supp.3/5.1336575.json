The mortgagee is chargeable to account only on redemption. Id. Page 954.</p>\n<p id=\"b10-16\">\u201cHe (the mortgagee) is not chargeable so long as the premises are not redeemed. . . . After the mortgage is extinguished the right to an accounting is also extinguished\u201d. Jones on Mortgages, Volume 2, Section 1427, Pages 914-915.</p>\n<p id=\"b10-17\">If the statement of account were made more specific what would it avail the defendant? This is a pertinent question.</p>\n<p id=\"b10-18\">\u201cThe right (to an account) must be enforced in equity and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>not in law.\u201d Thompson on Real Property, Volume 5, Section 4740, Page 954.</p>\n<p id=\"b11-4\">If the motion for an accounting had been made before the redemption day it would have served the useful purpose of aiding the defendant, mortgagor, to ascertain the amount required for payment of the foreclosure judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b11-5\">The defendant might waive this right. By failing to file the motion for an account before the redemption day the defendant has waived this right. This failure to file the motion at the required time constitutes an election which, when exercised, is exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b11-6\">The ascertainment of the items of the account at this time would avail nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b11-7\">The order to make more specific would not, ultimately, be enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b11-8\">It would not be based upon any part of the pleadings, nor would it furnish a basis for any judgment in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b11-9\">The judgment has been entered and is complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b11-10\">Under the statute it may not now be opened\u2014certaintly not for this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b11-11\">The motion to make more specific is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
