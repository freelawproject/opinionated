These marks, according to uncontradicted testimony were left by plaintiff\u2019s car and pre sumably by its rear wheels.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-17\">To have been made at the point in question the front wheels must have been turned to the left very sharply at a time immediately before, or at the latest, at the time they had reached the center line of Dwight Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>This deduction militates against the acceptance of the testimony of the driver of plaintiff\u2019s car insofar as the latter places plaintiff\u2019s vehicle at a point whereat the radiator of it had about reached the west curb of Dwight Street in a position north of the center line of Elm Street when the defendant car was still ten feet away and going about twice as fast as was plaintiff\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">It is, of course, possible that a collision might have occurred if both cars continued from these respective points to proceed in the directions toward which they were then headed, but the point of such collision would have been further to the west and would have left little, if any, opportunity for either of the cars to have followed their respective admitted courses after the contact and to have come to rest at their respective admitted places.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Moreover, had the cars occupied the respective positions attributed to them by the plaintiff\u2019s driver when it first appeared to him that a collision was imminent, it is not reasonable to believe that plaintiff\u2019s operator would have been intent upon turning to his left to avoid it, but rather upon increasing his speed to get out of the way of the defendant car.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Eliminating plaintiff\u2019s driver\u2019s testimony as not credible on the point referred to, it does not matter insofar as the result is concerned whether the testimony of another occupant of the plaintiff\u2019s car or that of the defendant be accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">The former stated that when the front end of the plaintiff\u2019s vehicle was about even with the east curb line of Dwight Street (and he in the rear seat, about ten feet east of it) the defendant car was about 25 feet away from them and moving at a speed about twice that of the plaintiff\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">In such a situation it would be apparent to any person using a minimum of care that if both cars continued at the same speed in their respective directions, a collision would be almost unavoidable.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">If it be conceded that such a close calculation as such circumstances would require to reach that conclusion, conferred the right of way on the plaintiff car to enter and pass through the intersection ahead of the defendant\u2019s it at the same time enjoined upon the driver of it that he use that reasonable care which a reasonably prudent man would, under similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>circumstances, having knowledge that he had the right of way. Neither by maintaining a proper lookout nor in the control of the car, did plaintiff's driver discharge the duty imposed upon him in this respect. In this he was, of course, guilty of negligence of a character which was a substantial factor in producing the collision. This same conclusion results if defendant\u2019s account of the events leading up immediately to the accident be accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Further analysis lends additional support for these determinations, 0but nothing would be gained by setting it down here.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Judgment for defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
