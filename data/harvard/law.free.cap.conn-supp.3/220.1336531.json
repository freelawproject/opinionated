And concretely the question is this: Does the provision of the statute that \u201ceach driver or operator of a vehicle approaching any intersecting public street or highway shall grant the right of way at such intersection, to any vehicle approaching from his right, provided such vehicles are arriving at such intersection at approximately the same time,\u201d apply in the case of a pedestrian and vehicle, as here, or only to the case of two vehicles involved?</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">It is my conclusion that this provision is only applicable in the latter case, and so does not apply in the principal case. The wording of the first sentence and the second sentence of Section 1639 makes clear that as to the rules of the road therein laid down, they are applicable to pedestrians and to vehicles. The wording of the third and fourth sentences thereof clearly indicates that they are applicable only to the drivers of vehicles, as distinguished from pedestrians. In so far as its wording goes, the fifth sentence of this section might be applicable either to pedestrians or the driver of a vehicle, although I take it that the recognised construction is that it is applicable primarily at least to the drivers of vehicles only. But be this as it may, the sixth sentence, which is the provh sion of the statute above quoted and here in question, by its wording is expressly limited in its application to vehicles and their drivers or operators, and is not applicable to a pedestrian.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Nor can the clause demurred to, be saved as merely de' scriptive, or, to put it in the words of the plaintiff\u2019s brief, because it \u201csimply states the situation of the vehicle and its relation to the plaintiff at the point of contact between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>two\u201d, for as above pointed out, it is specifically set forth as a violation of the rules of the road and as such a cause of action relied upon in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">For the reasons stated, the demurrer is sustained.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
