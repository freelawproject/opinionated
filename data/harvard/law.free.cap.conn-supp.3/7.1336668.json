He further alleges the attorney was without authority to accept payment to himself but in fact did this, concealed this fact from the plaintiff over a period of years, and when pressed in the matter, gave the plaintiff his own check in part payment. He further alleges the attorney appropriated the original payment to his own uses. He sues the original defendant presumably on the debt, claiming the money was paid to his attorney without authority and sues the bank on a theory that the court will not at this time attempt to elucidate.</p>\n<p id=\"b12-5\">The complaint may be characterised by most of the adjectives used in the defendant\u2019s motion but not by all. It apparently is traversable and sets up facts that may be met by demurrer or answer. It is not, therefore, subject to a motion to strike out. The motions are denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
