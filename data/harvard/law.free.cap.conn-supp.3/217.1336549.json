It adds: \u201cAlso in or to the promissory note .... described in the condition of said mortgage deed and secured thereby.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">The note in question was not produced at the trial because it could not be found.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">No question that there was a note executed by defendants, however, is raised since defendants admit it in their answer to the Substituted Complaint as, also, the fact that the note so executed was secured by a mortgage on the land now sought to be foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">There is, however, a discrepancy between the description of the character of the note as it appears in the mortgage and that from testimony adduced at the trial. The former states the instrument to be negotiable; the latter non-negotiable.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">However, this may be ignored, since the action is between the immediate parties; the existence of the amount of the original indebtedness is undisputed, and it appears from the mortgage deed that the only office which the note performed was to evidence an admitted obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">It is, of course, evident from the written assignment that it was plaintiff\u2019s intention as administratrix to transfer to herself, individually, her husband\u2019s interest in both the debt and the mortgage which secured it, although it fails to say so, since it is in the interest in the \u201cnote\u201d which is assigned and that the note described in the mortgage, which latter is not the note described in the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-12\">The reference to the mortgage in plaintiff\u2019s husband\u2019s estate is, however, rather vague in that all that is said on the subject is \u201cOne-half interest in mortgage deed on land situated in the State of Connecticut (first mortgage) in the Town of Wallingford, $3000.\u201d The only incidents in common between-this description and the mortgage in suit is the reference to-the place where the land is situated and the figure of $3000. which latter is, however, disputed. Otherwise, there is noth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>ing to identify the mortgage in which plaintiff s husband\u2019s interest is transferred to her as the one mentioned in the inventory</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">It is true, of course, that as an interest in land, title to her husband\u2019s interest in the mortgage descended to plaintiff by operation of law upon the latter\u2019s death, s\u00fabject to its being appropriated, if his personal estate proved insufficient to the payment of any ante-mortem claims\u2014of which latter, however, the evidence shows none. The assignment, however, is not plaintiff\u2019s individually to another based on the theory that she already owned her husband\u2019s interest in it, but is made by her as administratrix and so has reference to a mortgage that formed part of the estate but does not appear in the inventory thereof because of lack of adequate description.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Again, it may be pointed out that the only interest listed in the inventory of plaintiff\u2019s husband\u2019s estate is one in a mortgage deed\u2014nothing, whatever, is said about the mortgage debt, which is a necessary part of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Of course, the \u201cdebt is the thing\u201d and the mortgage security only. It is elementary that the assignment of the debt carries the mortgage which secures it with it but it does not follow invariably that the assignment of the mortgage carries the debt with it. And, of course, where a mortgage is assigned but no transfer of the debt is made, extrinsic evidence is usually required to determine whether it was the intention to include the debt on the obligation representing it within the term \u201cmortgage\u201d. No such evidence has been introduced here to show that the interest in the \u201cmortgage deed\u201d listed in the inventory includes the mortgage \u201cdebt\u201d which is not listed as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">The defendant here should not be placed in the position of being compelled to redeem and then after having done so, required to resort to proceedings if his title to the property is later questioned, to establish facts beyond doubt which are easily within the plaintiff\u2019s ability to make manifest now.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">This will make the second occasion that it has been found necessary to return the file in this case since the trial\u2014the first for questionable pleading and this for such action as the plaintiff may see fit to take to remedy the difficulties, pointed out, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>The court cannot reasonably be expected to make any fur' ther observations or suggestions; when the matter again comes back for decision it will be decided upon the pleadings and facts\u2014documentary and otherwise\u2014as they then present themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">No suggestion is made as to what measures or in what manner the defects noted, supra shall be corrected\u2014only that the matter be taken care of with as little delay as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The file and exhibits are being returned with this memoran' dum to the office of the clerk, for the convenience of counsel.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
