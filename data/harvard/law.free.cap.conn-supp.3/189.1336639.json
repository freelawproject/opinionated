This is another way of saying that the Mayor\u2019s judgment was not reasonable or logical and evidences an abuse, rather than a use of the discretion confided in him.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">Omitting reference to all the other evidence, it admittedly appears that Whalley Avenue is what may be termed a \u201cbusy\u201d thoroughfare; that on Norton Street, facing Elm, about a block away from the location of plaintiff\u2019s property and on the side of Norton Street opposite from that on which plaintiff\u2019s property is, there is a public school.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">From the minutes taken at the hearing before the Mayor, introduced in evidence by plaintiff, it appeared that a large number of children pass plaintiff\u2019s property and cross the intersection of Whalley Avenue and Norton Street where traffic is regulated by a light.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">From this the Mayor could have found, as he testified in this court that he did, that the proposed location of a gasoline filling station at the location in question would add to the traffic hazard both to pedestrians and on the adjacent highways. In this he was supported by the chief of police who testified to the same effect, at the hearing in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-12\">This is one of the factors which the statute mentions that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>the Mayor might take into account in approving or disap' proving an application of this kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">It is possible, of course, that other men using fair and reasonable judgment might disagree with the Mayor in the decision at which he arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">That, however, does not establish that his conclusion is arbitrary, illogical or unreasonable. It is only when it appears that such a decision is characterised by qualities of the latter character that it can be found that a wrong has been done an applicant which it is within the province of the court to correct. DeFlumeri vs. Sunderland, 109 Conn. 583; Holley vs. Sunderland, 110 Conn. 80, 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Such a finding cannot be made here, since there was evh dence upon which the Mayor\u2019s judgment might be predi' cated, reasonably and fairly, notwithstanding the fact that another mind might have viewed the matter differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">Judgment for defendant dismissing the appeal, will be entered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
