It is known as a quasi-contractual obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">The facts alleged in the complaint do not set up an express contract, either written or oral.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-8\">\u201cNeither do they establish a quasi-contract, which is not a contract at all but an obligation which the law creates out of the circumstances present, although the contractor did not assume the obligation, and may not have intended it but in fact actually dissented from it. Unjust enrichment is said to be the most important source of quasi-contractual obligations.\u201d Bartlett vs. Raidart, 107 Conn. 691, 694, 142 Atl. 398.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">The demurrer is overruled upon all of its grounds.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
