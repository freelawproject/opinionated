The court cannot look back to the allegations of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">And for the purpose of disposing of the question presented, it is to be remembered that the demurrer admits the facts well pleaded in the plea in abatement and if any of those facts are capable of proof the demurrer should not be sustained. In other words, the question presented by the plea in abatement cannot be determined upon the demurrer. It should be upon an issue joined.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-8\">\u201cThe demurrer being addressed to the substance of the complaint, if any facts which are provable under its allegations would support the cause of action relied upon, the demurrer would of necessity fail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-12\">Blakeslee vs. Water Commissioners, 106 Conn. 642, 649, 139 Atl. 106; O\u2019Donnell vs. Sargent <em>&amp; </em>Co., 69 Conn. 476, 483, 38 Atl. 216; Wildman vs. Wildman, 72 Conn. 262, 270, 44 Atl. 224; Mathews vs. Converse, 83 Conn. 511, 515, 77 Atl. 691.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-13\">This demurrer being addressed to the substance of the plea in abatement if any facts which are provable under its allegations would support the ends sought to be obtained by the plea in abatement, the demurrer would of necessity fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-14\">The demurrer is therefore overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
