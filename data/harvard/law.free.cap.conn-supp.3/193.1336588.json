As does paragraphs II (1), II 2, II (3), II 4a, II 4b, II 4c, II 4d and III, except insofar as the latter alleges that the facts stated therein do not appear from the records of the Probate Court. Whether this latter is a competent allegation is a question not within the scope of this memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">At any rate, as a practical matter, what \u201cappears in the records of the Probate Court\u201d is a fact easily ascertainable by counsel for the appellant and if it is found that the records of that court are barren of the facts referred to, it may be that appellant will want to test the sufficiency of such allegation, too, by demurrer rather than to raise a question of fact which can result in but one determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">The desirability that the question raised be disposed of in orderly fashion suggests the propriety of permitting the appellant to withdraw his answer and to file another and different pleading. This may be done.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
