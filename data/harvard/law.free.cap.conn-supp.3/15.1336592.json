Nor was it proved that the plaintiff was the owner of the claim sued on. Furthermore, the State in its contract expressly prohibited this kind of a subcontract, and actually did not know DiMauro was a subcontractor. It had every reason to believe, and did believe, that he was one of Di Martino\u2019s men. To hold that the State cannot protect itself by contract from, or provide against, subcontractors it does not wish to employ and expressly refuses to employ, is a ruling this Court would not care to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>There is an allegation that the State was protected by a bond conditioned for the faithful performance of the contract according to its provisions. One of its provisions excluded Di Mauro.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-4\">The Statute, 1113 B, giving the right to file a claim against the State, gives it to \u201cany person having any claim for ma' terials and labor used in the execution of such contract.\u201d This plaintiff, in my opinion, is not such a person.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-5\">Assuming, without'deciding, that the Statute gives a right to sue the State, I conclude that this plaintiff is not one to whom such a right was given, and that if he was, he has not fulfilled the requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-6\">Judgment is for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
