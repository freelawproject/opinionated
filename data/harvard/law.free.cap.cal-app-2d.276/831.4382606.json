The amended complaint alleges a cause of action against the sureties on a statutory undertaking. Appellant therein alleges that it held legal title to an automobile as security for a loan which it made to one Hohnhorst and his wife. The sheriff seized the automobile under attachment against the Hohnhorsts, who were the registered owners. Appellant filed a third party claim under the provisions of section 689b of the Code of Civil Procedure. Respondents, as sureties, gave the sheriff an undertaking in the sum of $1,800 to enable the sheriff to hold and sell the automobile pursuant to the provisions of section 689b, subdivision (9), of the Code of Civil Procedure.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 833\">*Supp. 833</page-number>Said undertaking was not accompanied by the verified statement asserting grounds of invalidity of the third party claim as required by the referenced code section. Neither party asked for a hearing to determine title under the third party claim. The sheriff sold the vehicle free and clear of appellant\u2019s lien. Meanwhile, the Hohnhorsts went through bankruptcy, owing plaintiff $614.14. Appellant, by this action, sought to recover this sum from the sureties, together with attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">The summary remedy available through sections 689 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 834\">*Supp. 834</page-number>689b is not exclusive. A number of remedies are open, including that - employed in the instant case of a suit for damages upon the statutory undertaking. <em>Cory </em>v. <em>Cooper </em>(1931) 117 Cal.App. 495, 503 [4 P.2d 581<em>] Retailers\u2019 Credit Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1937) 19 Cal.App.2d 457 [65 P.2d 937].</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">It is clear that where there has been a hearing, the court\u2019s determination would be res judicata, as to any collateral action concerning the property rights involved. <em>Embree Uranium Co. </em>v. <em>Liebel </em>(1959) 169 Cal.App.2d 256 [337 P.2d 159],  The law is also clear that when 15 days have run from the filing of the third party claim and no petition for hearing has been filed,, the trial court in which the suit was brought loses jurisdiction to hear the summary proceeding. <em>Ballagh </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1942) 50 Cal.App.2d 303 [122 P.2d 343].. However, no ease has been cited to the court holding that the parties are foreclosed from bringing an independent action. Respondents contend that once having elected to file a third party claim, appellant must proceed by way of- the summary hearing under section 689b, subdivision (10). This contention is not supported by any case law. Neither does the statutory language require such an election. If the attaching creditor desired to have its sureties discharged, the creditor also had the right to petition for a summary hearing under section 689b, subdivision (10).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Failure to demand a hearing within 15 days under the summary proceedings authorized by these code sections does not discharge the sureties on an undertaking filed pursuant to section 689b, subdivision (9). To hold otherwise might well destroy property rights without an adjudication on the merits. The language of sections 689 and 689b cannot be construed to operate as a discharge of the liability of the sureties unless a summary determination of title is demanded within 15 days. Appellant was entitled to a trial for the purpose of determining his right, title or interest in the automobile in question. If he was, in fact, th\u00e9 legal owner and held that title as security for \u00e1 balance due from the Hohnhorsts, he was entitled to recover against respondents as sureties on the undertaking in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">\u25a0 Judgment reversed and the cause is remanded with directions to overrule the demurrer to the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">Quayle, P.
