On February 19, 1969, the trial court granted the respondent\u2019s motion to transfer. On February 24, 1969, the appellants filed a notice of appeal with the Appellate Department of the Superior Court for Los Angeles County.from the order of the municipal court transferring this cause to the superior court for trial</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">The respondent filed a motion before the appellate department of the superior court to dismiss the appeal on the grounds that an order transferring a matter from the municipal court to the superior court on subject matter jurisdictional grounds is non-appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-12\">Legal Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b618-13\">Is an order transferring a matter from the municipal court to the superior court on the ground that the complaint prays for an amount in excess of the former\u2019s statutory jurisdiction reviewable on appeal ?</p>\n<p id=\"b618-14\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b618-15\">The right of appeal is wholly statutory. No judgment or order can be appealed unless the right of appeal is expressly authorized by the. Constitution or by statute <em>(Hennigan </em>v. <em>Boren, </em>243 Cal.App.2d 810, 815 [52 Cal.Rptr. 748]; see also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number><em>Title Ins. &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>California Dev. Co., </em>159 Cal. 484, 486 [114 P. 838].)</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Section 904.2 of the Code of Civil Procedure specifies the types of municipal court judgments or orders which can he reviewed on appeal. Section 904.2 provides as follows: \u201cAn appeal may be taken from a municipal court in the following cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-7\">(a) From a judgment, except (1) an interlocutory judgment, or (2) a judgment of contempt which is made final and conclusive by Section 1222;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-8\">(b) From an order made after a judgment made appealable by subdivision <em>(a);</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-9\">(c) From an order changing or refusing to change the place of trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-10\">(d) From an order granting a motion to quash service of summons;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-11\">(e) From an order granting a new trial or denying a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-12\">(f) From an order discharging or refusing to discharge an attachment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-13\">(g) From an order granting or dissolving an injunction, or refusing to grant or dissolve an injunction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-14\">(h) From an order appointing a receiver;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-15\">(i) From a judgment of the small claims court as provided in Chapter 5A (commencing with Section 116), Title 1, Part 1 of this code. \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-16\">An order transferring an action from the municipal court to the superior court for the reason that the municipal court lacks jurisdiction over the subject matter is not expressly authorized by section 904.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-17\">The appellants contend that an order transferring a cause on subject matter jurisdictional grounds is \u201can order changing . . . the place of trial\u201d and therefore an appealable order within subdivision (c) of section 904.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-18\">Critical to the resolution of the question presented to us is a resolution of the meaning of the words \u201cplace of trial\u201d as used in subdivision (c) of section 904.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-19\">The respondent relies on the case of <em>Arganbright </em>v. <em>Good </em>(1941) 46 Cal.App.2d Supp. 877 [116 P.2d 186], In <em>Arganbright </em>v. <em>Good, supra, </em>the court held that a statute expressly authorizing the right to appeal from \u201can order changing or refusing to change the place of trial\u201d does not include the right to appeal from an order transferring or refusing to transfer a cause from the municipal court to the superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>court where the motion in the court in which the complaint was filed is predicated on a lack of jurisdiction. In so ruling; the court construed the term \u201cplace of trial\u201d as synonymous with \u201cvenue\u201d and thereby restricted subdivision (c) of section 904.2 to appeals, from an order changing or refusing to change venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">In <em>Muller </em>v. <em>Reagh </em>(1957) 150 Cal.App.2d 99 [309 P.2d 826], the court reached a contrary conclusion. In <em>Muller, supra, </em>the reviewing court held that an order transferring a cause from the superior court to the municipal court was an appealable order and was encompassed within the express statutory authorization for an appeal from an order changing or refusing to change the place of trial. At the time the <em>Muller </em>case was decided subdivision 2 of section 963 permitted an appeal from an order of the superior court changing or refusing to change the place of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">The <em>Muller </em>court arrived at the conclusion that an order transferring or refusing to transfer a matter from the superior court to the municipal court was appealable based on its construction of section 397. Prior to 1933 section 397 provided that \u201cthe court may . . . change the place of trial in the following cases: 1. When the comity designated in the complaint is not the proper county; . . .\u201d In 1933 the word \u201ccourt\u201d was substituted for county in subdivision 1. The <em>Muller </em>court concluded that by making this change \u201cthat quite logically characterizes an order transferring a cause from one court to another (at least when predicated upon lack of jurisdiction in the former court and possession of jurisdiction in the latter) as \u2018an order . . . changing . . . the place of trial\u2019 as used in section 963 of the code, and thus an appealable order.\u201d We disagree with this interpretation of section 397 on the following grounds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-7\">One. Section 396 authorizes a transfer of an action from a court lacking jurisdiction of the subject matter to a court which has such jurisdiction. When such a transfer occurs the court designated in the complaint is not the \u201cproper\u201d court insofar as the name of the court (justice, municipal, or superior) and the jurisdiction of the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-8\">Two. If subdivision 1 of section 397 of the Code of Civil Procedure is construed as authorizing a transfer of an action from the court designated in the complaint which lacks jurisdiction over the subject matter to a court which has such jurisdiction, then subdivision 1 of section 397 merely repeats that which is already authorized by section 396. Such an in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>terpretation renders subdivision 1 of section 397 (as amended in 1933) totally redundant and a meaningless exercise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Section 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure imposes upon us the duty to liberally construe the provisions thereof \u201cwith a view to effect its objects and to promote justice.\u201d It is our view that in amending subdivision 1 of section 397 the Legislature intended to authorize a change of the place of trial from the court designated in the complaint to a court in a different geographical location (within or without the county) possessing the same subject matter jurisdiction as the trial court improperly designated.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Our construction of the term \u201cproper court\u201d is compatible with the manner in which these words are employed in subdivision (2) of section 395. There the code provides the \u201cproper\u201d municipal or justice court for the trial of an action is that municipal or justice court having jurisdiction over the subject matter in which the defendant resides, or the injury to person or property occurred, or where the obligation was contracted to be performed. Thus, the proper court for an action for damages in the amount of $2,500 for breach of a contract to be performed in- Alhambra and where the defendant also resides in Alhambra is in the municipal court for Alhambra Judicial District. If the plaintiff erroneously designates the municipal court for the Pasadena Judicial District as the place for trial, the Pasadena Municipal Court, may, under subdivision 1 of section 397 transfer the cause to the Alhambra Municipal Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">An examination of the remaining subdivisions of section 397 discloses that in each one, the term place of trial is used to mean a change of \u201cvenue\u201d rather than a transfer of \u201cjurisdiction. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\"><em>Muller </em>v. <em>Reagh, supra, </em>was decided in 1957. In 1961 the Legislature repealed section 963 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Section 904.1 of the Code of Civil Procedure now sets forth the types of superior court judgments and orders which can be appealed. Subdivision 2 of section 963 which was relied upon by the court in <em>Muller </em>v. <em>Reagh, supra, </em>was omitted from section 904.1. Therefore, under the present law an order of the superior court changing or refusing to change the place of trial is not an appealable order, since no order or judgment is appealable unless expressly authorized by statute <em>(Hennigan </em>v. <em>Boren, </em>243 Cal.App.2d 810, 815 [52 Cal.Rptr. 748]). Under section 400 of the Code of Civil Procedure (also enacted in 1961), an order of the superior court granting or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>denying a motion to change the place of trial is reviewable solely by a writ of mandate <em>(Hennigan </em>v. <em>Boren, </em>243 Cal. App.2d 810, 815 [52 Cal.Rtptr. 748]). Thus, the Legislature has nullified the actual holding in <em>Muller </em>v. <em>Reagh, supra, </em>insofar as the appealability of transfers from the superior court to the municipal court. However, if; despite the action of the Legislature, <em>Muller </em>v. <em>Reagh, supra, </em>can be said to have any present vitality as authority for the proposition that the language'\u201can order changing or refusing to change the place of trial\u201d as used in section 904.2 concompasses an order transferring or refusing to transfer a cause from the superior court to the municipal court, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Historically the term \u201cplace of trial\u201d has been used synonymously with \u201cvenue\u201d to denote the geographical location and political subdivision within which is situated the courthouse which will hear the cause (92 C.J.S. 667). \u201cVenue\u201d or \u201cplace of trial\u201d refers to the place from which the jury is summoned (51 Cal.Jur.2d 6). \u201cPlace of trial\u201d does not \"refer to the judge or the particular trial court (justice, municipal, or superior) which has \u201cjurisdiction\u201d over the subject matter of the action. \u201cJurisdiction\u201d refers to the power to decide a case on the merits <em>(Pacific States Sav. &amp; Loan Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>217 Cal. 517, 521-522 [19 P.2d 977]; <em>In re Chandler, </em>36 Cal.App.2d 583, 585 [97 P.2d 1048]; <em>Arganbright </em>v. <em>Good, </em>46 Cal.App.2d Supp. 877, 878 [116 P.2d 186]).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">We can find no reason to depart from the commonly accepted meaning given to the term \u201cplace of trial.\u201d Accordingly, we hold that, in the absence of express statutory or constitutional authority, no appeal can be taken from an order transferring a cause from the municipal court to the superior court because of the jurisdictional amount alleged in the pleadings. We construe, subdivision (c) of section 904.2 of the Code of Civil Procedure as authorizing an appeal from an order of the municipal court changing or refusing to change venue from one court with jurisdiction of the subject matter of the action to another court in a different locality with the same \u201cjurisdiction\u201d or power to decide the matter on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">This matter is remanded to the appellate department of the superior court with instructions to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">Fleming, Acting P. J., and Wright, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b618-16\"> Assigned by the Chairman of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b618-17\">Rule 63(a) provides: \u201cThe superior court on application of a party or on its own motion may certify that the transfer of a case to the Court of Appeal appears necessary to secure uniformity of decision or to settle important questions of law. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
