The facts, when viewed in the light most favorable to respondent, are these;</p>\n<p id=\"b89-14\">Appellant\u2019s brother, Thomas Chavarria, and Homero Hendi\u00f3la were driving their respective automobiles on the afternoon of June 26, 1967, when they almost collided at an inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>section in Corcoran, California. At the time appellant and Alinardo Rodriguez were riding in the Chavarria vehicle. An exchange of hot words and profanity ensued. Both Hendi\u00f3la and appellant claim that the other called him a \u201cque\u00e9r.\u201d After the altercation, Thomas Chavarria followed Hendi\u00f3la home.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Later that evening Hendi\u00f3la was in the front yard of his home when Thomas Chavarria drove up and parked his car in \u25a0front of the gate. Thomas Chavarria informed Hendi\u00f3la that he, appellant and Alinardo Rodriguez were coming into Hendi\u00f3la\u2019s yard. Hendi\u00f3la answered that he would not allow them to enter. Then Thomas Chavarria reached into the hack seat of the car and picked up a short-handled hoe. Appellant armed himself with an iron bar. Alinardo Rodriguez picked up a chain.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">As the three men entered the yard, Hendi\u00f3la picked up a small stick about the size of a broom handle to defend himself. However, Thomas Chavarria struck him on the head and hand with the short-handled hoe. Appellant struck Hendi\u00f3la with the iron bar. Hendi\u00f3la then att\u00e9mpted to retreat to the rear of the house, hut the trio continued to rain blows on his body with the bar, chain and hoe, inflicting serious injuries, including a fractured wrist. The vicious attack was witnessed by Dell Porter and Lillian Hata.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">After the beating, appellant, Thomas Chavarria and Alinardo Rodriguez were arrested and jailed. While in custody appellant signed a written statement prepared by Officer Albert Bans. He admitted striking Hendi\u00f3la with the iron bar but claimed that the fight was started by Hendi\u00f3la and two other adults of Hexican extraction. He said his brother had no part in the fight.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">At the commencement of his jury trial, appellant claimed that the written statement he gave to Officer Bans was involuntary because it was induced by a promise of leniency. Thus, the court convened out of the presence of the jury to determine the issue pursuant to Evidence Code section 405. Officer Bans testified that appellant volunteered to make the statement without any solicitation on Ban\u2019s part and that no force, pressure, promises or coercion of any kind were used. He also said that before taking the statement he advised appellant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and appellant freely and intelligently waived these rights. In rebuttal, appellant asserted that the officer told him that if he and Rodriguez gave statements to the police, appellant\u2019s brother \u201cwould have a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>better chance, \u2019 \u2019 and that he might be free that very night or the next morning. Appellant said the promise was repeated on the following day and that he made his statement primarily to help his brother gain his freedom.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court then ruled that appellant\u2019s statement was voluntary and admitted it into evidence. However, before doing so the court made the following remarks: \u2018 \u2018 The court hereby finds that the prosecution has the burden of proving and of producing the evidence and the burden of proof on the issue as to whether or not it was voluntary; whether or not he was informed of his rights and that he knowingly and intelligently waived his rights. The court finds that the prosecution did meet this burden; that the admission or confession, whichever, it is, . . . is admissible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Appellant does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain his conviction. His main contention for reversal is that the court did not require respondent to prove that his signed written statement was voluntary \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Stated in a slightly different manner, appellant maintains that respondent had the burden of proving that his extrajudicial, admission was voluntary and apparently asserts that we must reverse the judgment because the trial judge did not specifically state that he was satisfied that the statement was voluntary \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">It is settled that the trial judge must make the preliminary determination as to whether a confession or admission was voluntary before admitting the confession or admission into evidence <em>(Jackson </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>378 U.S. 368 [12 L.Ed.2d 908, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 1 A.L.R.3d 1205]). Moreover, since the burden of proof on this preliminary issue is on the People, the degree of proof is \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">As we stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Stroud, </em>273 Cal.App.2d 670, 678 [78 Cal.Rptr. 270], \u201c. . . . to hold that a trial judge\u2019s ruling is to he grounded upon anything less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt would seem to be anomalous in a legal system that requires the People to prove a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. \u2019 \u2019 However, the trial judge is not required to use the specific language, 111 believe beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Thus, we must uphold his ruling even if he has failed to use this, or similar, language if it is clear from the record that he applied the correct standard <em>(People </em>v. <em>Stroud, supra, </em>273 Cal.App.2d 670.)</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>In the case at bench, the trial judge was not called upon to weigh and consider bits and pieces of complicated evidence in order to arrive at his decision as to whether appellant\u2019s statement was voluntary. On the contrary; he was faced with an outright conflict between the testimony of appellant and Officer Albert Bans. And, since the judge obviously believed the officer\u2019s testimony that appellant volunteered to make the statement without solicitation and that no promises of leniency of any kind were made, it is hardly likely that he had any lingering doubt in this respect. Moreover, under Evidence Code section 405, the judge must not only indicate which party has the burden of proof on the disputed preliminary issue, but he must also resolve the issue \u2018 \u2018 as required by the rule of law under which the question arises.\u201d Manifestly, since the trial judge stated that respondent had the burden of proving that appellant\u2019s statement was voluntary, he must have also understood that the degree of proof was \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d In short, since the court understood that the People had the burden of proving that appellant\u2019s extrajudicial statement was voluntary, in the absence of a contrary declaration, we must also assume that he understood that respondent was required to do so \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Appellant also suggests that we should reweigh the evidence and reverse the judgment if we are not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that his statement was voluntary. However, appellant misconstrues the scope of appellate review. While it is true that we must make \u201can independent investigation of the whole record\u201d in order to determine whether a confession or admission was voluntary, we do not weigh or resolve conflicts in the evidence <em>(People </em>v. <em>Aikens, </em>70 Cal.2d 369 [74 Cal.Rptr. 882, 450 P.2d 258] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Massie, </em>66 Cal.2d 899 [59 Cal.Rptr. 733, 428 P.2d 869]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wein, </em>50 Cal.2d 383 [326 P.2d 457]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Stroud, supra, </em>273 Cal.App.2d 670).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Appellant\u2019s final contention that the court erred in admitting into evidence the hoe which appellant\u2019s brother used to strike Mendiola is devoid of merit, and no further comment is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">Stone, P.
