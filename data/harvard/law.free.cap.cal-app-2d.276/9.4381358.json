He contends, on several grounds, that the court erred in treating as community property a farm located in the State of Illinois, and certain funds accumulated from income produced by the farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">Before the marriage, Kenneth owned (as tenant in common with his brother John) two farms in Illinois which we shall identify as the Ohio Township farm and the Walnut Township farm. Three days prior to the marriage the parties acting at Kenneth\u2019s instance, executed an agreement providing that all of the separate property of Kenneth was to remain his personal estate; Rosalind waived all right and interest in any of. Kenneth\u2019s property which she might acquire as his wife. About four years later, Kenneth traded his one-half interest in the Walnut Township farm for John\u2019s one-half interest in the Ohio Township farm. At the same time John sold the Walnut Township farm to Kenneth for $105,000. Kenneth obtained a $113,685 loan from the Federal Land Bank to cover the purchase price and incidentals, including a required $5,685 purchase of stock in the Federal Land Bank. The note to the Federal Land Bank was signed by both Kenneth and Rosalind; it was secured by a mortgage upon both farms, also signed by both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">Payments on the note between the date of Kenneth\u2019s acquisition of the Walnut Township farm and the parties \u2019 divorce were made from farm income. The farms were operated by tenants under the supervision of a professional farm manager; there was no substantial evidence that Kenneth contributed his time, energy or talent to the operation of the farms.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-10\">By terms of the judgment, Kenneth was ordered to pay to Rosalind the sum of $20,000 as her share of the community property (less the actual cash value of Rosalind\u2019s interest in her retirement fund). This provision depends upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>court\u2019s finding that the Walnut farm, as well as all bank balances and other assets traced to farm income, was t-o be treated as community property.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Appellant first contends that treatment of the Walnut farm as community property was incorrect because the California community property system may not be applied to Illinois real property. In relevant part, section. 164 of the Civil-Code provides as follows: \u201cAll other real property situated in this state and all other personal property wherever situated acquired during the marriage by a married person while domiciled in this state is community property; ...\u201d Appellant contends that the quoted definition of community property is inapplicable to out-of-state real property. But California courts have long applied community property rules to out-of-state realty acquired with community funds <em>(Rozan </em>v. <em>Rozan </em>(1957 ) 49 Cal.2d 322 [317 P.2d 11]; <em>Riggs </em>v. <em>Riggs </em>(1963) 223 Cal.App.2d 594 [35 Cal.Rptr. 793] ; <em>Tischhauser </em>v. <em>Tischhauser </em>(1956) 142 Cal.App.2d 252 [298 P.2d 551].) Nothing in the 1961 amendment of section 164 indicates an intention to change the doctrines which had evolved in the eases.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">Appellant also contends that the acquisition of the Walnut Township farm could not have benefited the community estate because the antenuptial agreement \u201cwaived marital property rights of respondent.\u201d But the agreement purported only to affect property owned by appellant \u2018 \u2018 at the time of the marriage or acquired <em>by him, </em>at any time thereafter, ...\u201d (Italics added.) The natural inference arising from the quoted language, that the agreement did not anticipate a surrender of any community or other interest acquired <em>by the wife </em>under California law, was supported by the testimony of the lawyer who prepared the document: \u201cI think we intended his separate property.\u201d Appellant\u2019s testimony to the contrary merely created a conflict in the extrinsic evidence of intent. We uphold the trial court\u2019s resolution of that conflict. <em>(Parsons </em>v. <em>Bristol Dev. Co. </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 861 [44 Cal.Rptr. 767, 402 P.2d 839].)</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">The trial judge found that the equity hi the Walnut farm (worth approximately $33,500 including $5,700 in Federal Land Bank stock) was community property. The judge also found that the community interest in other assets derived from farm income totaled $3,350. Thus a determination of the character of the farm itself controls the disposition of the other assets derived from farm income.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>The trial court\u2019s finding as to the community or separate character of property is binding upon- .us if supported by substantial evidence; although clear and convincing evidence must be presented in order to rebut the presumption, created by section 164, that post-nuptial acquisitions are community property, that standard is to be applied by the trial court; it does not affect our review of the trial court\u2019s determination <em>(Somps </em>v. <em>Somps </em>(1967) 250 Cal.App.2d 328, 336 [58 Cal.Rptr. 304]; <em>Thomasset </em>v. <em>Thomasset </em>(1953) 122 Cal.App.2d 116, 123 [264 P.2d 626], overruled on other grounds, <em>See </em>v. <em>See </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 778, 786 [51 Cal.Rptr. 888, 415 P.2d 776]). Respondent cites four items of evidence to support these findings: the wife\u2019s signature on the mortgage and promissory note; the lender\u2019s supposed reliance upon respondent\u2019s income as security for the,loan; references to. the Walnut property as \u201cour farm\u201d by appellant; and pictures taken of respondent and appellant at the farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">Respondent does not -contend that the parties entered into any agreement to change the character of the farm property after its purchase. But if money for the purchase of property is obtained on the credit of the community estate, the result is a community purchase. The <em>intent of the lender </em>with respect to the credit upon which the loan was made is determinative. <em>(Gudelj </em>v. <em>Gudelj </em>(1953) 41 Cal.2d 202, 210-211 [259 P.2d 656].; <em>Somps </em>v. <em>Somps, supra, </em>250 Cal.App.2d 328, 336-337). Therefore the evidence pointed to by respondent must be evaluated for any bearing it may have on the Federal Land Bank\u2019s intentions in extending credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">The photographs of the parties at the Walnut and Ohio farms throw no light- upon the intention of the lender of the purchase price. The references to \u201cour farm\u201d by respondent likewise do not -refer- to the credit decision of the Federal Land Bank. Respondent argues that \u201c [i] t is quite probable that the bank did know of respondent\u2019s occupation and income and this was one of the strong considerations in malting the loan\u201d; but the only evidence cited to support-this contention is the claimed fact that appellant\u2019s attorney prepared income tax returns which showed the occupation and income of respondent. This evidence has no tendency to show knowledge and intent on the part of the loan officer at the Federal Land. Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">The single item of evidence which gives any support to the finding is respondent\u2019s signature \u25a0 upon the mortgage and promissory'note. No one from the Federal Land Bank testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>as to the intention of that institution in making the loan. There was a suggestion that respondent\u2019s signature on the note and mortgage was obtained in order to satisfy the lender that the encumbrance would prevail over any right of common law dower which respondent might have under Illinois law. But the objective of subjecting any interest of the wife to the mortgage could as well have been met by an instrument waiving dower, or by respondent\u2019s signing the mortgage alone. <em>(Matthews </em>v. <em>Hinton </em>(1965) 234 Cal.App.2d 736, 741-742 [44 Cal.Rptr. 692]; also see 36 Am.Jur., Mortgages, \u00a7\u00a7 58, 59; 1 Glenn, Mortgages, p. 23.) When she signed the note she assumed personal liability for payment of the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>The state of mind of the seller (or, as in' this case, the lender) is of course a question of fact. The circumstance that in this case the lender required respondent\u2019s signature on the note and mortgage raises an inference that if she had not been willing to execute the documents credit would not have been extended. That inference -is not unreasonable even though the substantial value of the two farms made subject to the mortgage, as compared with the modest community estate and earning capacity, might indicate that the security given on appellant\u2019s separate property was the more weighty factor in inducing the Federal Land Bank to grant a; loan. Nevertheless, it might seem that these considerations all properly fell within the province of the trial court in determining the question of fact which we have identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">Appellant, however, points to two early decisions of the Supreme Court <em>(Flournoy </em>v. <em>Flournoy </em>(1890) 86 Cal. 286 [24 P. 1012, 21 Am.St.Rep. 39], and <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Martin </em>(1877) 52 Cal. 235) which hold that the signature of one spouse on a note and purchase money mortgage encumbering separate property of the other spouse \u2018 \u2018 cannot affect the rights of the parties\u201d (52 Cal. at p. 237) as to the community or separate character of the proceeds. (Cf. <em>Estate of Neilson </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 733, 746 [22 Cal.Rptr. 1, 371 P.2d 745].) It is difficult to- reconcile the <em>Flournoy </em>and <em>Martin </em>decisions with the <em>Gudelj </em>idea that the character of loan proceeds may be determined according to the intent of the party extending credit. We note also that <em>Hie Flournoy </em>and <em>Martin </em>decisions do not mention the generally applicable presumption, created by the statutory definition of community property, that property acquired during the marriage is community (4 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (1960) <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 25, p. 2731). But it is not our function to overrule decisions of the Supreme Court even if they are old. It is our duty to follow and apply the law as expounded in the decisions of higher courts until change has been lawfully accomplished by legislation or by later decision. We therefore hold, under compulsion of the <em>Flournoy </em>and <em>Martin </em>decisions, that respondent\u2019s execution of the note and mortgage could not affect the rights of the parties. According .to the evidence, the only other inducement to the Federal Land Bank\u2019s extension of credit was the security given upon appellant\u2019s separate property. Accordingly, the Walnut Township farm and the rents and profits it produced appear to have been separate property. But a further showing may be attempted by respondent on retrial.-</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>The award of property which the trial court attempted to make may well have influenced the court\u2019s appraisal of the total relative circumstances of the parties which determined its denial of alimony to respondent. Justice therefore requires that the question of alimony be set at large.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The judgment is reversed with directions to the trial court to enter a new interlocutory decree of divorce in favor of respondent after taking further proceedings, consistent with the views expressed herein, concerning property and support. Neither party will recover costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Devine, P. J., and Rattigan, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied October 3, 1969, and respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied October 29, 1969.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
