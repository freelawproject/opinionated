During the court hearing on her petition to determine heirship it was established that decedent was a naturalized citizen of the United States of America and at the time of his death was a resident of the County of Los Angeles.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>We adopt certain portions of the Memorandum of Opinion of the trial judge, the Honorable Joseph H.

(Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-6\">\u201cIt was further held that sections 259 and 259.2 of the California Probate Code were not unconstituitional as an extension of State power into the field of foreign affairs exclusively reserved to the federal government, and that California had not entered into the forbidden domain of negotiating with a foreign country or of making a compact with it contrary to article I, section 10 of the federal Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-7\">\u201cIn the <em>Estate of Knutzen </em>(1948) 31 Cal.2d 573 [191 P.2d 747] a case involving the construction of section 259 of the Probate Code, et seq., the California Supreme Court carefully analyzed and recognized the holding in <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Allen, supra. </em>In that connection it is important to note paragraph 5 of the ruling of California Supreme Court at page 578 in which the court states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-8\">\u201cParagraph 5: \u2018While \u00a7259.2 as enacted in 1941, and as reenacted in 1947, provided for escheat if no heirs were found eligible to take the property, the primary purpose of the legislation was not to establish a procedure for escheat or for defeasance of any interest of nonresident aliens to inherit. Hence the proper construction is that sections 259 et seq., are laws of succession, that they constitute limitations on the power of aliens to inherit and the nonresident aliens are made ineligible to inherit, and acquire no rights in the estate in the absence of reciprocal rights of American citizens to inherit property in the country in which such aliens are resident.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-9\">\u201cIn the case of <em>Zschernig </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(1968) 389 U.S. 429 [19 L.Ed.2d 683, 88 S.Ct. 664] the United States Supreme Court resolved a factual and a legal situation very much conforming to the case at issue. The <em>Zschernig </em>case involved proceedings by East German next-of-kin of an Oregon intestate against the administrator and Oregon officials for determination of heirship in favor of the next-of-kin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-10\">\u2018 \u2018 The Oregon State Board had requested that the property be escheated to the State of Oregon. The Circuit Court in Multnomah County decreed that the property be escheated to the State, and the next-of-kin appealed; the Oregon Supreme Court (243 Oregon p. 567) modified the decree, but held that the next-of-kin could take the <em>realty </em>involved but not the <em>personalty, </em>and the next-of-kin appealed. The appellants, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>next-of-kin, are the sole heirs of the decedent, and the decedent was a resident of Oregon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-5\">\u201cJustice Douglas speaking for the majority of .the United States Supreme Court, in analyzing the Oregon Revised Statute, which stated conditions under which an alien not residing in the United States or its territories can take property in Oregon through succession or testamentary disposition, held that the Oregon Revised Statute, section 111.070<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>constituted an intrusion by the State into the field of foreign affairs which the Constitution entrusts to the President and Congress. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-6\">\u201cIn arriving at this conclusion it was pointed out by Justice Douglas among other things that the Oregon Revised Statute, <em>supra, </em>provides for escheat where the' nonresident claims real or personal property unless the nonresident establishes certain requirements. One of the requirements is, the existence of a reciprocal right of a United States citizen to take property on the same terms as a citizen or resident of the foreign country. (See footnote 5(1) (a).)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-7\">\u201cIn this respect it is to be noted that this requirement is a substantial restatement or duplication of the requirement set forth in section 259 of the Probate Code of the State of California.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-8\">\u201cThe Oregon Supreme Court had held that the next-of-kin in East Germany could take the Oregon realty involved by reason of Article IV, of the 1923 Treaty with Germany. (Footnote 3, supra.) But by reason of the same article as construed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>in <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Allen </em>the next-of-kin in East Germany <em>could not take the personalty located, in the United States. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-6\">\u201cJustice Douglas, speaking for the majority of the Court, points out that the United States Department of Justice, appearing as amicus, submitted that although the 1923 Treaty is still in force, <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Allen </em>should be overruled insofar as it construed the personalty provision of Article IY. The portion of Article IY requested to be overruled by the Justice Department speaks of the right of \u2018nationals of either High Contracting Party\u2019 to dispose of \u2018their personal property of every kind within the territories of the other. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-7\">\u201cIn this connection the Court reaffirmed its position that such literal language and its long consistent construction as held in <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>\u2018. . . does not cover <em>personalty </em>located in this country and which an American citizen undertakes to leave to German nationals. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-8\">\u201cIt is significant to note that the Court refused to accept the invitation to re-examine their ruling in <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>stating that, \u2018For we conclude that the history.and operation of this Oregon statute makes clear that \u00a7 111.070 is an intrusion by the State into the field, of foreign affairs which the Constitution entrusts to the President and the Congress. \u2019 (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-9\">\u201cThe Supreme Court then, referring to <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>stated that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-10\">\u201c \u2018We held in <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Allen </em>that a general reciprocity clause did not on its face intrude on the federal domain. ... We noted that the California statute, then a recent enactment, would have only \u201csome incidental or. indirect effect in foreign countries.. . .\u201d\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-11\">\u2018 \u2018 The Court then proceeds to state:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>caprice of government officials, whether the representation of consuls, ambassadors, and other representatives of foreign nations are credible or made in good faith, Avhether there is in the actual administration in the particular foreign system of law any element of confiscation.\u2019 (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-5\">\u2018\u2018 And of special interest respecting the above quotation see the recent cases of <em>Estate of Larkin </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 60 [52 Cal.Rptr. 441, 416 P.2d 473], and <em>Estate of Chichernea </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 83 [57 Cal.Rptr. 135, 424 P.2d 687], In the <em>Larkin </em>ease, and in the <em>Ghiehernea </em>case our California Supreme Court upheld the right, in contemplation of section 259 of the Probate Code, of Californians to leave their estates to beneficiaries residing in the Soviet Union, and in the <em>Ohichernea </em>case the Court likewise upheld the right of Californians to leave their property to persons residing in Romania. In coming to this conclusion in the <em>Larkin </em>case the California Supreme Court stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-6\">\u201c \u2018Section 259 does not require that foreign governments have the same judicial system as ours, nor even an independent judiciary. All that it requires is that there be no discrimination shoAvn.in inheritance matters as between the nationals of that 'country and the residents and citizens of our oavu. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-7\">\u201cThe conclusions, however, of the United States Supreme Court in the <em>Zschernig </em>case are that such statutory restrictions do constitute an intrusion by that State into the field of foreign affairs which the Constitution entrusts to the President and the Congress, and further the Court stated that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-8\">\u201c \u2018. . . Yet, such forbidden state actiAdty . . . has infected <em>each </em>of the three provisions of Section 111.070 as applied by Oregon. \u2019 (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-9\">\u201cIt must again be remembered that subdivision 1, of the Oregon Revised Statutes respecting reciprocal rights is, in substance, a restatement of section 259 of the California Probate Code and if State activity has infected subdivision 1 of the Oregon Revised Statute it has certainly infected section 259 of the California Probate Code. And it might be further pointed out that the United States Supreme Court in <em>Zschernig </em>v. <em>Miller, supra, </em>in coming to this conclusion further states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-10\">\u201c \u2018As we read the decisions that followed in the wake of <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>we find that they radiate some of the attitudes of the \u201ccold war,\u201d where the search is for the \u201cdemocracy quotient\u201d of a foreign regime as opposed to the Marxist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>theory.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> . . . And this has led into minute inquiries concerning the actual administration of foreign law, into the credibility of foreign diplomatic statements, and into speculation whether the fact that because some received delivery of funds should \u201cnot preclude wonderment as to how many may have been denied \u2018 the right to receive.\u2019 . . .\u201d \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-6\"><em>\u2018\u2018 </em>The Court, thereafter, goes on to state:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-7\">\u201c \u2018As one reads the Oregon decisions, it seems that foreign policy attitudes, the freezing or thawing of the \u201ccold war,\u201d and the like are the real desiderata.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Yet they, of course, are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>matters for the Federal Government, not for the probate courts. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-5\">\u201cIt may be noted that in footnote 8, as just indicated, the Court indicates that such attitudes are not confined to the Oregon courts, and states that representative samples from other states include statements from the New York courts, Pennsylvania courts, as well as California. In the latter respect the footnote is quoted as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-6\"><em>\u201c \u2018A </em>California Judge, upon being asked if he would hear argument on the law, replied, \u2018No, I won\u2019t send any money to Russia!\u2019 The judge took \u2018judicial notice that Russia kicks the United States in the teeth all the time,\u2019 and told counsel for the Soviet claimant that \u2018I would think your firm would feel it honor bound to withdraw as representing the Russian Government. No American can make it too&gt; strong.\u2019 Berman, <em>Soviet Heirs in American Courts </em>(1962) 62 Colum. L.Rev. 257, fn. 3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-7\">\u201cThereafter, the Court in the <em>Zschernig </em>case in again discussing all three parts of section 111.070 (Oregon Revised Statute) concludes as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-8\">\u201c \u2018This is as true of (1) (a) of \u00a7 111.070 as it is of (1) (b) and (1) (e).\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-9\">\u201cAnd thereafter in paragraphs 4 and 5 the United States Supreme Court further concludes that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-10\">\u201c \u2018 It seems inescapable that the type of probate law that Oregon enforces affects international relations in a persistent and subtle way. The practice of state courts in withholding remittances to legatees residing in Communist countries or in preventing them from assigning them is\" notorious.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The several States, of course, have traditionally regulated the descent and distribution of estates. But those regulations must give way if-they impair the effective exercise of the Nation's foreign policy. . . . The Present Oregon law is not as gross an intrusion in the Federal domain as those others might he. Yet, as we have said, it has a direct impact upon foreign relations and may well adversely affect the power of the central government to deal with those problems. The Oregon law does indeed illustrate the dangers which are involved if each State, speaking through its probate courts, is permitted to establish its own foreign policy. \u2019 \u2018Reversed. \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>\u201cFrom this holding it is clear that the United States Supreme Court has clearly held that the Oregon Revised Statute section 111.070, <em>and each subdivision or part thereof, </em>. is an intrusion by the State into the field of foreign affairs which the Constitution entrusts to the President and the Congress. \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">\u201cAnd consequently, under the same rationale, section 259 of the Probate Code of the State of California,, which is substantially a restatement of subdivision 1 of the Oregon Revised Statute, must also fall, and for the same reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">\u201cIt was held in' <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Allen </em>that the rights secured by the 1923 Treaty, as to <em>realty, </em>were in terms of a right to sell within a specified time, with a right to withdraw the proceeds . . . and that these rights extended to German heirs of \u2018any person\u2019 holding realty in the United States, regardless of citizenship, . . . and the disposition of <em>realty </em>is governed by the treaty, and its provisions prevail over any conflicting provision of California law. It was further held that as to <em>personalty, </em>that the treaty refers only to the rights of nationals of either country to dispose of their personal property in the other country, and that it does not cover <em>personalty located in the United States </em>which a United States citizen undertakes to leave to German Nationals. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">\u201cIt follows that the right of alien heirs under the Treaty, \u2014 \u2018Nationals of either High Contracting Party . . .\u2019 to dispose personal property of every kind within the territories of the other, . . does not cover personalty located in <em>this country </em>and which an American citizen-national undertakes to leave to German nationals.\u2019  On the other hand, if the decedent is a citizen-national (oT non-citizen-national) of the United States of America, and the personalty is located in this country, the question of its inheritance or succession then, is determined by local or State law, <em>Lyeth </em>v. <em>Hoey, </em>305 U.S. 188 [83 L.Ed. 119, 59 S.Ct. 155, 119 A.L.R. 410]; and <em>Irving Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Day, </em>314 U.S. 556 [86 L.Ed. 452, 62 S.Ct. 398, 137 A.L.R. 1093]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Roach, </em>76 Cal. 294 [18 P. 407].</p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">\u201cWhere these rights may be affected by an overriding fed-' eral policy, as where the Treaty makes different or conflicting arrangements, the State law must give way. But, as in this case, where there is no treaty governing the rights to succession to the personal property the disposition or the right of succession is governed by the laws of the State of California.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>\u2018 \u2018 Section 671 of the Civil Code respecting the taking hold, or disposing of real or personal property provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-5\">\u201cWho May Own Property. Any person, whether citizen or alien, may take, hold and dispose of property real or personal, within this state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-6\">\u2018\u2018 Section 225 of the Probate Code respecting\"succession provides in part as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-7\">\u201cNo Surviving Spouse Nor Issue. If the decedent leaves neither issue nor spouse, the estate goes to his parents in equal shares, or if either is dead to the survivor. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-8\">\u201cSection 1026 of the Probate Code respecting the succession by a nonresident alien to property in California provides as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-9\">\u201cAlien Succeeding To Property. A nonresident alien who becomes entitled to property by succession must appear and demand the property within five years from the time of succession <em>; </em>otherwise, his rights are barred and the property shall be disposed of as escheated property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-10\">\u201cFrom these sections it is clear that Ida Kraemer, the mother of decedent and Petitioner for Determination of Heir-ship, is entitled to full distribution of the within estate of Harry Kurt Kraemer, and that the State of California is entitled to no right or title therein or distribution thereof.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-11\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-12\">Stephens, Acting P.

In the international sense every person in the world is either a national of a state or an alien. Prior to the adoption of the United States Nationality Code of 1940 (some 17 years after the ratification of this treaty with Germany in 1923) there existed much confusion concerning, surrounding, and pertaining to the identification of persons included in the generalized term of \u2018nationals,\u2019 \u2018citizen-nationals\u2019 and \u2018noncitizen-nationals.\u2019 It was, however, generally understood that nationals of the United States were divided into two classes: 1. Those nationals known as citizen-nationals; and, 2. Those nationals known as noncitizen-nationals.</p>\n<p id=\"AxI\">\u201cBy way of explanation at this juncture it may be pointed out that <em>all citizens </em>of the United States are <em>nationals </em>of the United States. However, not all nationals of the United States are citizens of the United States. An illustration of this during the time involved could be citizens of the Philippine Islands who owed allegiance to the United States. Also, a person born in the United States whose parents are French nationals is, by the Law of France, \u00e1 French National, \u00e1nd by the Law of the-United States an American National.</p>\n<p id=\"A-b\">\u2018 \u2018 A great deal of this confusion was cleared up by the adoption of the Nationality Code of 1940. And under the Nationality Code it has been since 1940 provided by statute that:</p>\n<p id=\"ASQ\">\u201c (a) The term \u2018national\u2019 means a person owing permanent <em>allegiance </em>to a state;</p>\n<p id=\"AzEa\">\u201c(b) The term \u2018National of the United States\u2019 means (1) a citizen of the United States; or (2) a person who, though <em>not </em>a citizen of the United States, owes permanent allegiance to the United States.

If the rights are the same, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>then California allows the nonresident alien seeking distribution of real property here to get it; if the rights are dissimilar, then the nonresident alien will not get distribution of the real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\"><em>Zschernig </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>389 U.S. 429 [19 L.Ed.2d 683, 88 S.Ct. 664], I feel, would not condemn Probate Code section 259 if, under it, all that could be done by local trial courts, to determine if the other country involved treated its own resident citizens and nonresident United States citizens alike, was to read the applicable written law of that country (presumably through an authenticated translation) and possibly hear expert interpretive testimony where the credibility of the foreign expert was not put into question. However, if through legislative language or through subsisting court interpretation, trial court inquiry into how the. law is administered (such as to learn that officials and- the courts of the country do not interpret its inheritance statute literally and sanction discrimination against nonresident United States citizens) is allowed, then the code section is disapproved by <em>Zschernig. </em>For example, if our courts hold that section 259 allows trial court inquiry to determine if distribution to a United States heir turns on the whim or caprice<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of an official (other, perhaps, than by what the written law says), it is defective. Inquiry into this subject would involve the delicate area of foreign relations and would put into balance the credibility of officials and experts from the foreign country. <em>Estate of Larkin, </em>65 Cal.2d 60, 65 [52 Cal.Rptr. 441, 416 P.2d 473], suggests that even if it were found that the right of the local citizen of the other country also turned on the whim of an official (so that theoretically<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he was in no better position than the United States citizen), California would consider the nonresident citizen heir disqualified to receive distribution of real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">Although the language of <em>Larkin </em>makes it clear that section 259 allows no inquiry into the so-called \u201cbalance of inheritances\u201d (p. 81) or \u201cdemocracy quotient\u201d (p. 83) of the foreign countries whose laws of inheritance (as they relate to local and United States citizens) are concerned,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the opinion further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>states (p. 65) : \u201c Though section 259 requires only the demonstration of a \u2018reciprocal right\u2019 on the part of our citizens \u2018to take property upon the same terms and conditions\u2019 as residents of the foreign country itself, we doubt that'mere equality of treatment would suffice. We would almost certainly not find the requisite reciprocity with respect to a country which permitted no inheritance at all. . . [apparently meaning to either the local citizens or to nonresident United States citizens], or which made the enforcement of inheritance rights subject to official whim or caprice [again, apparently meaning as such would relate to both the local citizens and nonresident United States citizens]. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Also, <em>Estate of </em>Chichernea, 66 Cal.2d 83, 102 [57 Cal.Rptr. 135, 424 P.2d 687], states that <em>Larkin </em>recognizes that section 259 impliedly requires that the right accorded by the foreign country to the United States citizen (presumably equivalent to the right accorded the local citizen) meet some minimal standard of economic substantiality.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">If these expressions in <em>Larkin </em>and <em>Chichernea </em>are the present guidepost for the trial courts and Courts of Appeal, then it must be said that section 259 opens the door into inquiry as to how official whim (even if allowed by written law) is exercised as between local and United States citizens, and this would amount to state intrusion into foreign affairs, the exclusive province of the federal government. The <em>Larkin </em>language is the last word on section 259 and is emphatic enough not to be ignored. Therefore, I am constrained to be in accord with the result of the written opinion of the trial judge which is being adopted as the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied December 3, 1969. Peters, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b749-8\">See quotation on page 721 of our opinion for language of Mr. Justice Douglas in <em>Zschernig </em>that states have launched inquiries into whether United States citizens have, not rights, but merely dispensations turning on the \"whim or caprice\u201d of government officials.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b749-9\"> Praetieally there is the likelihood that the whim would more often be exercised favorably toward him than toward the United States citizen.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b749-10\">Such evidence does not truly relate to the issues . . . [and] introduces factors which section 259 and the United States Constitution exclude from . . . consideration.\u201d (Pp. 82, 84.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b750-8\"><em>Chichernea </em>holds that this does not have to include the right to remove the value of the foreign country real property from its confines.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
