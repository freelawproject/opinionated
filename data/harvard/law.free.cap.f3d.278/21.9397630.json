We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-22\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b79-23\">The underlying proceeding before the Commission arose from the application of Hillview Investment Trust II and its investment advisor Hillview Capital Advis-ors, LLC (collectively, \u201cHillview\u201d) seeking exemption from 15 U.S.C.\u00a7 80a-15(a) which provides that no person may serve as an investment advisor of a registered investment company \u201cexcept pursuant to a written contract [which] has been approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities\u201d of the company. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-39(a) requires the Commission, before issuing orders, to provide notice to \u201cinterested persons.\u201d 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 270.0-5 provides that after the issuance of such notice the Commission needs to order a hearing on the matter, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cupon the request of an interested person.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Fund Democracy request<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>ed such a hearing, explaining that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>\u201cserves as an advocate and information resource for mutual fund shareholders through a multi-faceted advocacy and educational program.\u201d The SEC rejected the request for a hearing and granted the exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Before us the Commission moved for dismissal on the grounds that Fund Democracy has no standing under Article III of the Constitution to bring this petition. Under Article III, federal courts only have jurisdiction to resolve cases and controversies. <em>See, e.g., Chicago and Grand Trunk Ry. Co. v. Wellman, </em>143 U.S. 339, 12 S.Ct. 400, 36 L.Ed. 176 (1892). Therefore, in order to bring an action within our jurisdiction, the party must demonstrate that it has standing to bring that action. <em>See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, <em>560, </em>112 S.Ct. 2130, 2136, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). To satisfy this requirement a plaintiff or petitioner must, at an \u201cirreducible constitutional minimum ... demonstrate that it has suffered a concrete and particularized injury that is: (1) actual or imminent, (2) caused by or fairly traceable to an act that the litigant challenges in the instant litigation, and (3) redressable by the court.\u201d <em>Florida Audubon Soc\u2019y v. Bentsen, </em>94 F.3d 658, 663 (D.C.Cir.1996) (en banc) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Fund Democracy does not meet this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">\n<em>Associational Standing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">Petitioner argues that it has associational standing to bring this action. That theory fails. An association only has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members when its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right, the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization\u2019s purpose, and neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit. <em>See Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., </em>528 U.S. 167, 181, 120 S.Ct. 693, 704, 145 L.Ed.2d 610 (2000). Fund Democracy stumbles on the first step. It does not appear that Fund Democracy actually has any members. In any event, Fund Democracy has not shown that any of the individual mutual fund investors it claims as \u201cmembers\u201d have standing to sue in their own right.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">First, it is not clear that Fund Democracy has either members or any equivalent affiliates. Fund Democracy admitted in another pleading that it is a one-person business, run by its CEO Mercer E. Bul-lard, who is also the attorney representing Fund Democracy in this court. Bullard does not argue that he personally has standing. Instead, he argues that Fund Democracy \u201crepresents\u201d an \u201cinformal consortium\u201d of various groups whose members are individual mutual fund investors and are threatened with injury by the SEC order. Fund Democracy describes in detail several examples of how it has worked closely in the past with other groups to conduct various \u201cadvocacy initiatives\u201d such as challenging applications for exemptions, petitioning the SEC to adopt rules, and lobbying against proposed legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">Fund Democracy\u2019s past work with various groups of individual investors does not render these groups the equivalent of members of Fund Democracy. In determining whether an organization that has no members in the traditional sense may nonetheless assert associational standing, the question is whether the organization is the functional equivalent of a traditional membership organization. <em>See Hunt v. Washington State Apple Adver. Comm\u2019n, </em>432 U.S. 333, 342-45, 97 S.Ct. 2434, 2441-42, 53 L.Ed.2d 383 (1977); <em>American Legal Found. v. FCC, </em>808 F.2d 84, 89-90 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>(D.C.Cir.1987) (\u201cALF\u201d). In <em>Hunt, </em>the Court held that a state commission had standing to assert the claims of apple growers and dealers. The Court identified three reasons for treating the state commission like a traditional membership organization. First, the commission \u201cserve[d] a specialized segment of the State\u2019s economic community which is the primary beneficiary of its activities, including the prosecution of this kind of litigation.\u201d 432 U.S. at 344, 97 S.Ct. at 2442. Second, the apple growers and dealers possessed \u201call of the indicia of membership in an organization.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For example, the growers and dealers elected the members of the state commission, they alone could serve on the commission, and they alone financed the commission\u2019s activities, albeit through mandatory assessments rather than voluntary contributions. <em>See id. </em>at 344-45, 97 S.Ct. at 2442. Third, the fortunes of the commission were closely tied to those of its constituency. <em>See id. </em>at 345, 97 S.Ct. at 2442.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">In <em>ALF </em>we held that a media watchdog group lacked standing to assert claims on behalf of members of the public who regularly watch the news. Fund Democracy\u2019s case falls much closer to <em>ALF </em>than to <em>Hunt. </em>In <em>ALF, </em>we noted that ALF did not serve a \u201cdiscrete, stable group of persons with a definable set of common interests.\u201d 808 F.2d at 90. Indeed, ALF could purport to serve all who read newspapers, watch television, or listen to the radio. <em>See id. </em>Similarly, Fund Democracy purports to represent \u201ctens of millions of individual investors.\u201d Moreover, ALF did not show that its \u201csupporters\u201d played any role in selecting its leadership, guiding its activities, or financing those activities. <em>See id. </em>Similarly, because Fund Democracy\u2019s course is steered entirely by Bullard, and Fund Democracy does not claim to receive funding from its purported members, it may have reasons for instituting suit other than to assert the rights of these alleged supporters. <em>See id. </em>Indeed, Fund Democracy\u2019s assertion of standing appears even weaker than ALF\u2019s. ALF specifically identified certain \u201csupporters\u201d who swore that ALF represented their views and that they approved of the ALF\u2019s activities. <em>See id. </em>at 88. Fund Democracy has not identified a single individual investor who fills such a role.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">In any event, Fund Democracy lacks associational standing. Petitioner attempts to fill this gap by alleging that it has \u201cworked closely\u201d with Institutional Shareholder Services (\u201cISS\u201d), an entity which does have identifiable clients and which also objected to the Commission\u2019s action though it did not join the present petition. Even assuming that the mutual fund investors who are clients of ISS or members of the other groups with whom Fund Democracy has \u201cworked\u201d are properly considered \u201cmembers\u201d of Fund Democracy, petitioner still cannot qualify for associational standing. Fund Democracy has not sufficiently established that any of these individuals would have standing to sue in his own right. The harm alleged by Fund Democracy is that investors or prospective investors will be misled about the true single-manager nature of the Hillview fund and will suffer a diminution of voting rights as a result of the SEC order granting an exemption. Therefore, it appears that the only people who will be directly affected by the SEC\u2019s order granting Hill-view\u2019s request for an exemption are those who have purchased shares in Hillview or are at least considering doing so. Yet Fund Democracy presents no evidence that any of these \u201cmembers\u201d own, intend to purchase, or are even considering purchasing shares in Hillview. <em>See Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 563, 112 S.Ct. at 2138 (organization must submit evidence that one or more of its members would be directly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>affected apart from their special interest in the subject).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">In a similar case in the Second Circuit, an association sought to challenge the grant of exemptions under the Act to certain investment companies. <em>See Independent Investor Protective League v. SEC, </em>495 F.2d 311 (2d Cir.1974). The court held that petitioner failed to demonstrate standing by merely alleging that \u201cit is quite conceivable that, in the future,\u201d its members will be investors in the companies at issue. <em>Id. </em>at 312. Similarly, Fund Democracy asserts in cursory fashion that \u201ccurrent and prospective ISS clients who are current or prospective clients of the Hill-view Funds,\u201d are at risk of harm. Fund Democracy also alleges that \u201cinvestors who are not shareholders of the Hillview Funds, including ISS clients, may be misled by the Funds\u2019 names.\u201d Notably, Fund Democracy does not identify a single affiliate who has invested or is considering investing in Hillview Funds. Nor has Fund Democracy even alleged that it is likely that any ISS clients will consider investing in Hillview. For these reasons, Fund Democracy lacks Article III standing to challenge the SEC\u2019s decision to grant Hillview\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">\n<em>Procedural Interest</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Similarly, Fund Democracy lacks Article III standing to challenge the SEC\u2019s refusal to hold a hearing on Hill-view\u2019s application. The mere violation of a procedural requirement does not authorize all persons to sue to enforce the requirement. <em>See Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 571-78, 112 S.Ct. at 2142-46; <em>Florida Audubon Soc\u2019y, </em>94 F.3d at 664. A party has standing to challenge an agency\u2019s failure to abide by a procedural requirement only if the government act performed without the procedure in question will cause a distinct risk to a particularized interest of the plaintiff. <em>See Florida Audubon Soc\u2019y, </em>94 F.3d at 664. Because Fund Democracy has no actual members, and has not even shown that any of its purported members will be affected by the grant of Hillview\u2019s application, Fund Democracy has not shown a distinct risk to its particularized interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">\n<em>Standing as an \u201cInterested Person\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">Fund Democracy argues that it has standing because it is an \u201cmterested person\u201d for purposes of Rule' 270.0-5, which allows \u201cinterested persons\u201d to request a hearing on an application. That petitioner is an \u201cinterested person\u201d is a most tenuous proposition. <em>See </em>footnote 1, <em>supra. </em>But, even assuming that Fund Democracy is an \u201cinterested person\u201d under the rule and therefore eligible to participate in the SEC proceedings, this does not mean that Fund Democracy has Article III standing. Participation in agency proceedings is alone insufficient to satisfy judicial standing requirements. <em>See ALF, </em>808 F.2d at 89. Because agencies are not constrained by Article III, they may permit persons to intervene in the agency proceedings who would not have standing to seek judicial review of the agency action. <em>See Envirocare of Utah, Inc. v. NRC, </em>194 F.3d 72, 74 (D.C.Cir.1999). For this reason, we agree with the Second Circuit which has expressly rejected the argument that an individual\u2019s status as an \u201cinterested person\u201d is sufficient to confer standing to petition for review of an SEC order under the Act. <em>See Option Advisory Serv., Inc. v. SEC, </em>668 F.2d 120, 122 (2d Cir.1981); <em>Independent Investor Protective League, </em>495 F.2d at 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">Fund Democracy suggests that Congress specifically intended to grant to all \u201cinterested persons\u201d a right to a hearing before the SEC and that the denial of this right therefore confers standing. <em>See generally Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 500, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 2206, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975) (the injury required by Article III may exist solely by virtue of statutes creating legal rights, the invasion of which creates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>standing). Even assuming Congress intended to grant a right to a hearing to all interested persons and that Fund Democracy is among those persons, the deprivation of that right does not alone confer Article III standing. The grant of a procedural right cannot serve as the basis for Article III standing unless \u201cthe procedures in question are designed to protect some threatened concrete interest of [petitioner\u2019s] that is the ultimate basis of his standing.\u201d <em>Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 573 n. 8, 112 S.Ct. at 2143 n. 8; <em>see also Florida Audubon Soc\u2019y, </em>94 F.3d at 664. As already noted, Fund Democracy has not shown any such concrete interest apart from the procedural injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Because Fund Democracy has no standing to bring this petition for review of the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s order, we grant the Commission\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b79-15\">. \"Interested person\" is defined in the governing statute, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-2(a)(19):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-16\">(19) \"Interested person\u201d of another person means\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-17\">(A) when used with respect to an investment company\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-18\">(i) any affiliated person of such company,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEc\">or any member of the immediate family of any natural person who is an affiliated person of such company,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-24\">(iii) any interested person of any investment adviser of or principal underwriter for such company,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>(iv) any person or partner or employee of any person who at any time since the beginning of the last two completed fiscal years of such company has acted as legal counsel for such company,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-5\">(v) any person or any affiliated person of a person (other than a registered investment company) that, at any time during the 6-month period preceding the date of the determination of whether that person or affiliated person is an interested person, has executed any portfolio transactions for, engaged in any principal transactions with, or distributed shares for\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-6\">(I) the investment company;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-7\">(II) any other investment company having the same investment adviser as such investment company or holding itself out to investors as a related company for purposes of investment or investor services;

EDWARDS, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ai\">concurring in part and dissenting in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">I concur in the result reached by the court. Under the applicable agency regulations, any \u201cinterested person\u201d may request a hearing on an application. 17 C.F.R.\u00a7 270.0-5. However, the SEC is required to hold such a hearing only if it is determined to be \u201cnecessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.\u201d In this case, the SEC denied petitioner\u2019s request for a hearing, because it had already considered and reasonably disposed of the issues presented in 1995 when it initially approved another investment company\u2019s application for a manager of managers exemption. The SEC was thus fully justified in denying petitioner\u2019s request for a hearing. I therefore agree that the agency\u2019s action should be summarily affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">I also agree that petitioner has no standing to seek judicial review of the merits of the SEC\u2019s order. It is clear that petitioner has not satisfied Article III standing requirements on this score. I do not agree, however, that petitioner <em>lacks standing </em>to seek review of the agency\u2019s denial of the requested hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">It is true that our cases require plaintiffs to demonstrate that the denial of a procedural right will jeopardize interests particular to them, but they do not go so far as to deny standing in cases where a statute or regulation affords a party such a particularized procedural right. In <em>Florida Audubon Society v. Bentsen, </em>94 F.3d 658, 664 (D.C.Cir.1996) <em>(en banc), </em>we reiterated the principle that, when the government fails to comply with <em>generalized </em>procedural requirements (in that case, of the National Environmental Policy Act), a plaintiff seeking to challenge the alleged violation of the procedural rule must demonstrate that the government\u2019s failure to comply will cause a distinct risk to a particularized interest of the plaintiff. We held that \u201cthe mere violation of a procedural requirement thus does not permit any and all persons to sue to enforce the requirement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Similarly, in <em>City of Orrville, Ohio v. FERC, </em>147 F.3d 979, 985 (D.C.Cir.1998), we held that a party does not acquire \u201ca direct stake in a litigation\u201d for purposes of standing simply by participating in the administrative proceedings giving rise to the litigation (internal citation omitted). These cases are inapposite, for they do not address the issue that we face in the instant matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-11\">Where a statute or a regulation affords a particular party an undisputed right to seek an administrative hearing, <em>Florida Audubon Society </em>does not compel the conclusion that the party lacks standing to challenge an agency\u2019s refusal to grant the required hearing. In this case, the governing regulation permits an \u201cinterested person\u201d to submit relevant written facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>and request a hearing. <em>See </em>17 C.F.R. \u00a7 270.0-5. The Commission must order such a hearing if it appears to be necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors. <em>Id. </em>In my view, petitioner, as an \u201cinterested person,\u201d has standing to challenge as arbitrary the Commission\u2019s denial of its request for a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">It is immaterial that petitioner cannot seek review of the merits of the SEC order. The particularized interest here is petitioner\u2019s right to seek a hearing and to have one granted when it is \u201cnecessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.\u201d To hold otherwise is to suggest that the agency could deny with impunity the right of any \u201cinterested person\u201d even to receive notice or appear before the agency pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-39(a) with no threat of judicial review. Standing law does not condone such a result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
