The fee schedule \u201cshall incorporate the reasonable and prevailing fees of 75% of the practitioners within the region.\u201d N.J.S.A. 39:6A-4.6. To implement the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>mandate, the Department promulgated new regulations and amendments to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-29, as well as a personal injury protection (PIP) physician\u2019s fee schedule. Appellants Alliance for Quality Care, Inc., the New Jersey Association of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons, Orthopaedic Surgeons of New Jersey, the Interventional Pain Society, Atlantic Orthopedic Associates, the Medical Society of New Jersey, the New Jersey Association of Ambulatory Surgery Centers and the New Jersey State Society of Anesthesiologists, challenge the Department\u2019s amendments, rules, regulations and fee schedule as violative of the statute. Respondent the Department, as well as intervenors the American Insurance Association, the Insurance Council of New Jersey and the Property Casualty Insurers Association of New Jersey, assert that the rules, regulations and schedule are statutorily appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">We conclude that the rules, regulations and fee schedule are valid; however, as to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-29.4(e)(1), we conclude that the use of the specific Ingenix UCR database for the reasons set forth, <em>infra, </em>should be enjoined pending further action by the Department. In all other respects, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">\n<em>I.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">\n<em>A</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\"><em>We </em>provide a brief procedural synopsis of this appeal. On September 5, 2006, after eliciting pre-proposal comments pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-4(e) and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>l:30-5.3(a), the Department proposed new rules and amendments to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-29, which would modify the physicians\u2019 fee schedule for reimbursement to medical providers, by publishing them in the <em>New Jersey Register. </em>38 <em>N.J.R. </em>3437(a) (September 5,2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">On August 29, 2007, the Commissioner adopted the new and amended rules, and on August 31, 2007, he filed a notice of adoption of the rule proposal with the Office of Administrative Law, with an effective date of October 1, 2007. Appellants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>challenged the adoption of the rules,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> intervenors were granted leave to intervene, and we granted a stay of the implementation of the rules pending our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">\n<em>B.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">To place this appeal in appropriate context, we provide a history of PIP reimbursement legislation and its implementation. The \u201cNo Fault Act,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-1 to -35, was enacted in 1972. It had four objectives: \u201c1) prompt reparation to accident victims[;] 2) cost containment of automobile insuranee[;] 3) availability of insurance[;] and 4) easing of the judicial caseload.\u201d <em>Cobo v. Market Transition Facility, </em>293 <em>N.J.Super. </em>374, 384, 680 A.2d 1103 (App.Div.1996). To meet the objectives, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4 mandated that every standard automobile liability insurance policy contain PIP benefits for the payment of medical benefits, without regard to negligence, liability or fault, to the named insured and members of his or her household who sustained bodily injury as the result of contact with an automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">In 1988, the Legislature enacted <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4.6 as a \u201ccost containment measure.\u201d <em>In re the Failure by the Dep\u2019t of Banking and Ins. to Transmit a Proposed Dental Fee Schedule to the OAL for Publication in the N.J. Register, </em>336 <em>N.J.Super. </em>253, 256, 764 A.2d 494 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>292, 773 A.2d 1155 (2001); <em>L. </em>1988, c. 119, \u00a7 10. This provision required the Commissioner to promulgate a medical fee schedule on a regional basis for the reimbursement of PIP claims. <em>L. </em>1988, c. 119, \u00a7 10, as amended by <em>L. </em>1988, c. 156, \u00a7 4. As initially adopted, the Commissioner was required to base the claims on \u201cthe type of service provided\u201d and was to review the fee schedules biennially. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">In 1990, the Fair Automobile Insurance Reform Act (FAIRA) was enacted to reform the motor vehicle insurance system to \u201cachieve economy and lower insurance costs.\u201d <em>In re Failure to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number><em>Transmit, supra, </em>336 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 256, 764 A.2d 494; <em>L. </em>1990, c. 8. As part of the reform, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4 was amended to require, among other things, that the PIP reimbursement rates established within the fee schedule \u201cincorporate the reasonable and prevailing fees of 75% of practitioners within the region.\u201d <em>L. </em>1990, c. 8, \u00a7 7. If there were fewer than fifty specialists within a region, the fee schedule would \u201cincorporate the reasonable and prevailing fees of the specialist providers on a statewide basis.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The law still required that the Commissioner review the schedules biennially. <em>Ibid. </em>FAIRA also prohibited health care providers from demanding or requesting any payment in excess of those permitted in the fee schedules. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">In 1997, the Legislature amended <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4.6. <em>L. </em>1997, c. 151, \u00a7 33. The new law stated that \u201cthe Commissioner may contract with a proprietary purveyor of fee schedules for the maintenance of the fee schedule, which shall be adjusted biennially for inflation and for the addition of new medical procedures.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Additionally, the new law provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-6\">The fee schedule may provide for reimbursement for appropriate services on the basis of a diagnostic related (DRG)[ <footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] payment by diagnostic code where appropriate, and may establish the use of a single fee, rather than an unbundled fee, for a group of services if those services are commonly provided together. In the case of multiple procedures performed simultaneously, the fee schedule and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto may also provide for a standard fee for a primary procedure, and proportional reductions in the cost of the additional procedures. <em>[Ibid.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">In 1998, the Legislature passed the Automobile Insurance Cost Reduction Act (AICRA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-1 to -35, which was a further attempt to \u201cpreserve the no-fault system\u201d and \u201creduc[e] unnecessary costs.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-1.1(b). Under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-1.2, the Commissioner was given the power to \u201cpromulgate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>any rules and regulations ... deemed necessary in order to effectuate the provisions of this amendatory and supplementary act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">The first PIP physicians\u2019 fee schedule was adopted in January 1991, under <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-29. 23 <em>N.J.R. </em>536 (Feb. 19, 1991). It listed 1,100 medical procedures identified by Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes. 23 <em>N.J.R. </em>539-71 (Feb. 19,1991). The reimbursement fees were ceilings; if the provider\u2019s usual, customary, and reasonable (UCR) fee was less than the ceiling, the provider had no right to the higher fee set forth in the fee schedule. <em>N.J.AC. </em>11:3-29.4(a). An insurer\u2019s obligation to pay for any service or equipment not listed on the fee schedule was not to exceed \u201cthe [provider\u2019s] usual, customary and reasonable fee.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-29.4(a). <em>See Cobo, supra, </em>293 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 384-85, 680 A.2d 1103.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Several adjustments were made over the next nine years. <em>See </em>25 <em>N.J.R. </em>3466 (Aug. 2, 1993), 28 <em>N.J.R. </em>3962 (Aug. 19, 1996), and 29 <em>N.J.R. </em>887 (March 17, 1997). In 1997, after the law was changed to allow the Commissioner to \u201c \u2018contract with a proprietary purveyor of fee schedules,\u2019 \u201d the Department contracted with Ingenix to revise the fee schedule. 32 <em>N.J.R. </em>4332(a) (Dec. 18, 2000). \u201cIngenix assembled New Jersey specific data from both proprietary and public data bases of billed and charged fees to develop the new proposed fee schedules.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">In December 2000, the Department proposed changes that represented a shift in policy. Up until that time, the fee schedule was based on data regarding \u201c\u2018billed\u2019 fees, that [was], the fee charged or set forth on the bill by providers and submitted to health insurers (and ultimately reported by them to commercial compilers of health care fee data).\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The fee schedules \u201cwere created as a statistical reflection of this billed fee data at the 75th percentile____\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">The Department noted that during the years the fee schedules had been in effect, it had \u201cbecome apparent\u201d that there was \u201can increasing difference between fees billed by health care providers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>and the fees actually accepted by them as payment for services rendered.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Department noted that the amount charged on the Explanation of Benefits (EOB) form was \u201calmost always higher than the payment to the provider by the health benefit carrier.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">The Department attributed the difference between the billed fees and the paid fees to \u201cseveral causes including: a) the prevalence of government-sponsored medical programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, which reimbursed] health care providers at a level lower than the level of fees billed;\u201d b) a substantial amount of medical fees that were paid to providers by health service corporations, which were paid at a level lower than the 75th percentile of billed fees; and c) the significant increase over the previous ten years of physicians who had entered into contractual arrangements that set agreed fees with health benefit carriers or networks that were at a discount of the physicians\u2019 usual fees. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">Citing the purpose of the medical fee schedule statute as containing costs while providing a fair level of reimbursement for services, the fee schedule proposed in 2000 used actual levels of reimbursement paid to health care providers, including those paid by government programs, participating provider agreements and other contractual arrangements between physicians and health care plans to develop the schedule incorporating the reasonable and prevailing fees of 75% of practitioners. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">The Department\u2019s use of paid fees rather than billed fees was challenged and upheld in <em>Coalition for Quality Health Care v. New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance, </em>358 <em>N.J.Super. </em>123, 126-31, 817 A.2d 347 (App.Div.2003) <em>(\u201cCoalition III\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">Another amendment in the 2000 rules imposed a daily fee cap of $90 for CPT codes that were commonly billed together. 33 <em>N.J.R. </em>1592, 1597 (May 21, 2001). This change was also challenged and upheld in <em>Coalition III, supra, </em>358 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 132-34, 817 A.2d 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>In a companion case decided the same day, because of deficient notice and substantial deviation from the rule proposal, we reversed the Department\u2019s adoption of the physicians\u2019 fee schedule and remanded to the Department for reproposal, new notice and public hearing. <em>In re the Commissioner\u2019s Failure to Adopt 861 CPT Codes, supra, </em>358 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 139, 147, 817 A.2d 355. Despite the procedural infirmities, we did not void the adopted fee schedule, and the schedule remained in effect pending further agency action. <em>Id. </em>at 147, 817 A.2d 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">In response to <em>Failure to Adopt, </em>in 2005, the Department began the process of formulating amendments and additions to the physicians\u2019 fee schedule through \u201cdiscussions with interested parties\u201d concerning a pre-proposal draft dated July 8, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">The Department contracted again with Ingenix, which provided information on paid fees at the 80th percentile in preferred provider organizations (PPOs). 38 <em>N.J.R. </em>3437(a) (September 5, 2006). For comparison to other payers, the Department looked at the Medicare Part B participating provider fee schedule (MPFS), the use by other states of fee schedules based on a multiple of the MPFS and the New York Worker\u2019s Compensation and No Fault Fee Schedule. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">The Department determined that because the MPFS was \u201cextremely comprehensive\u201d and \u201cresource based,\u201d it was appropriate to calculate the new physicians\u2019 fee schedule \u201cas percentages of the current Medicare fee schedule.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Department used a \u201cmultiplier\u201d of 120% of the MPFS because it \u201ccorresponded well to much of the paid fee data collected ... [.]\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Department explained that using the MPFS was an appropriate base for calculating the PIP fees because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-9\">The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) with input from the provider community, calculate a relative value unit (RVU) for the physician work, practice expenses and malpractice premium expense for each Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code. These RVUs are then adjusted by a geographic practice cost index (GPCX) that reflects the impact of the costs of physician work, practice expenses and malpractice cost in a specific geographic region. The result is multiplied by a dollar amount known as the Medicare conversion factor to produce the fees for each Medicare region.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>\n<em>[IbU.)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">The draft also defined, for the first time, ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs), facilities where ambulatory surgical cases are performed separate and apart from any other facility (such as a hospital) license. Because Ingenix lacked a database of facility fees for ASCs, the Department gathered and examined the MPFS for ASC facility fees which had recently been set by CMS. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Other changes in the first draft included: 1) the addition of over 1000 CPT codes (the fees for which were calculated by multiplying the Medicare rate by 120%); 2) the reduction of the fee regions from three to two; 3) the setting of the UCR reimbursement amount for services or equipment not on the fee schedules at 120% of Medicare rates; 4) the redefinition of the multiple procedures reduction formula to apply only to surgical procedures and to conform it to the Medicare standard of 100% for the first procedure, 50% for the second procedure, and 25% for the third procedure; 5) the reimbursement of physicians\u2019 services provided in trauma units at Level I and II trauma hospitals to 120% of the fee schedule or 140% of Medicare for those procedures not on the fee schedule; and 6) the expansion of the list of CPT codes subject to the daily maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">The Department held thirteen meetings and several conference calls with interested parties concerning the draft proposal. The Department received a number of complaints from surgeons and emergency care physicians, who threatened to stop treating auto accident victims due to the low and, in their view, arbitrary fees for PIP services. Many challenged the use of the Medicare fee schedule as a basis for the PIP fee schedule. Objectors included physicians and interest groups such as The Association of Trial Lawyers of America, (ATLA-NJ). In addition to specific objections as to the use of Medicare rates, ATLA-NJ also objected to using data from Ingenix to determine the multiplier of the fee schedule, claiming that Ingenix \u201cis a proprietary database that does not disclose the origin of data or method of fee calculation.\u201d Others, such as Atlantic Orthopaedic Associates, objected to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>limits placed on multiple procedures, noting that injuries from auto accidents result in more complex injuries than those sustained in other ways, making the patient more difficult to treat, and therefore, each individual injury needed to be separately addressed and reimbursed.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">During this initial draft review period, the Department received new fee data from a proprietary database of actual PIP reimbursements paid by several automobile insurance carriers during 2004; it was later updated to include 2005 figures. 39 <em>N.J.R. </em>4126(c) (October 1, 2007). This database was compiled by Consolidated Services Group (CSG), a vendor hired by insurers to evaluate and approve certain treatment and care paths prior to administration of medical services to PIP patients (as required by AICRA). The CSG paid-fee data detailed the average amounts actually paid by the auto insurers to providers for medical services. The payments were divided into payment categories, sorted by CPT code, and included the number of times each medical procedure or service was reimbursed. <em>Ibid. </em>Although in 2005 the information was considered proprietary, in August 2007, the Department received permission to make the data public and did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">The Department concluded that the data was \u201csufficient for the development of a comprehensive fee schedule ... [.]\u201d It compared the fees on the draft PIP fee schedule with the fee information from the insurers and found \u201ca high correlation with most of the fees at 130 percent of the MPFS.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>However, the Department also found that certain groups of CPT codes \u201creflecting specialty services were reimbursed by the auto insurers at much higher levels.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Department therefore used the CSG paid-fee data to increase the physicians\u2019 fee schedule for those codes \u201cto a level equivalent to what auto insurers paid to providers for these services.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Department believed \u201cthat using the fees paid to providers by auto insurers for the general fee level and using the RVU system to rank the payments by level of effort is the best way of setting fees that meet the statutory standard.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>The Department circulated a second pre-proposal draft to interested parties on August 29, 2005. Based on comments from providers concerning the additional administrative costs of treating PIP patients, the Department \u201craised the percentage to 130 percent of the Medicare fee schedule\u201d for most of the fees. 38 <em>N.J.R. </em>3437(a) (September 5, 2006). Some of the fees were set at higher or lower percentages of Medicare because the Department realized that the fee set at 130% of the MPFS would not reflect the reasonable and prevailing fees. <em>Ibid. </em>The Department noted that \u201c[i]n setting the current fees as a percentage of Medicare,\u201d it was \u201cnot taking the position that future updates to the schedule, such as the required biennial review,\u201d would use the \u201csame percentages of Medicare.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Among other things, the second draft also set fees for surgical services performed in emergency rooms at 150% of the fee schedule, removed trauma doctors in the State\u2019s Level 1 and II hospital trauma centers from the fee schedule, increased the daily maximum reimbursement for physical therapy and chiropractic care to $99 instead of $90, removed 120 infrequently used CPT codes and set forth a step-by-step procedure for determining UCR that required consideration of the provider\u2019s usual fee and allowed an insurer to reference its prior experience with that provider or national databases of billed fees for that provider\u2019s region or zip code to determine a reasonable fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">At the conclusion of the informal pre-proposal process, the rules were officially proposed and published in the <em>New Jersey Register </em>on September 5, 2006. 38 <em>N.J.R. </em>3437(a) (September 5, 2006). The proposal, by in large, set forth the provisions as expressed in the second draft.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">In response to the rule proposal, the Department received 305 written comments. 39 <em>N.J.R. </em>4126(c) (October 1, 2007). Many of the comments echoed the concerns raised about the first proposal. Because the issues on appeal are largely the same as the comments to the proposal and the Department\u2019s answers are relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>to a resolution of the issues on appeal, we review the comments and responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">The Alliance for Quality Healthcare (a coalition of health care providers, including orthopedic surgeons, neurosurgeons, pain specialists and ambulatory surgery centers) and the Orthopedic Surgeons of New Jersey submitted as a comment a report dated December 4, 2006, by Stephen Foreman, Ph.D., J.D., M.P.A., Associate Professor of Economics and Allied Health at Robert Morris University. The report analyzed the proposed PIP medical fee schedules for physicians and ASCs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Notably, Foreman believed that the data from Ingenix was not appropriate to use because Ingenix was wholly owned by United Healthcare, a health insurance firm whose goal was to reduce physician fee reimbursement. Instead, he used the decisions of arbitrators rendered as part of the PIP alternate dispute resolution process as a basis for determining the fee schedule. The physicians\u2019 fees in the arbitrations were payment levels at the 75th percentile of \u201creasonable and prevailing rates,\u201d not insurer demanded rates. The report concluded that the proposed fee schedule would pay physicians at rates that were 66.4% of the arbitration award decisions in northern New Jersey, and 63.4% of the arbitration award decisions in southern New Jersey. With regard to ASCs, the report concluded that the proposed fee schedule would pay them between 48% and 52% of current arbitration award levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">Foreman noted that for some CPT codes, there were few or no arbitration decisions, and therefore, to evaluate those codes, another source of unbiased data was necessary. Foreman found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>the Physicians\u2019 Fee Reference (PFR) provided by Wasserman Medical Publishers was the \u201cnearest available ... substitute\u201d a source for the \u201cusual, customary and reasonable\u201d fee. Foreman found that \u201cthe arbitration award decisions and the PFR payment levels at the 75th percentile are quite consistent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Foreman then compared the proposed physicians\u2019 fee schedule to the physicians\u2019 fees in the PFR and to the PFR at the 75th percentile. He concluded that the comparison of the proposed fee schedule CPT code payments to PFR fee schedules showed that the proposed fee schedules would \u201csubstantially reduce\u201d physician payment. Therefore, the proposed fee schedule did not meet the requirements of the statute and was inconsistent with the arbitration decisions. Instead, Foreman suggested that the Department base its fee schedule on the PFR and arbitration awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">The Department did not accept that arbitration decisions were appropriate to create a fee schedule for several reasons. 30 <em>N.J.R. </em>4126(c) (October 1, 2007). First, it pointed out that there were two different standards for the determination of reimbursement to providers: the fee schedule and, when the fee schedule does not include a particular code, the UCR. <em>Ibid. </em>Because there were never any disputes about the fixed codes, the arbitration awards concerned only the UCRs. <em>Ibid. </em>Second, the arbitrators (also called Dispute Resolution Professionals or DRPs) frequently did not apply the 75th percentile standard and simply accepted whatever bills a provider gave as evidence of the UCR. <em>Ibid. </em>The Department found this procedure unacceptable. <em>Ibid. </em>Third, even if the arbitration decisions could be used as a source for UCR, there were insufficient arbitration decisions to establish a fee schedule. Only 378 of the more than 1,000 codes were the subject of arbitration. <em>Ibid. </em>Fourth, arbitration involved the resolution of a dispute, and a fee schedule based solely on the arbitration award had no way to incorporate the numerous undisputed claims. <em>Ibid. </em>Finally, the arbitrations were filed by a small group of providers, which meant that even if there were 100 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>arbitration decisions under a particular code, they might only represent ten providers, not 75% of the providers. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">\n<em>II.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">On appeal, appellants assert that the regulations violate the statutory requirement that the fee schedule must incorporate the reasonable and prevailing fees of 75 % of the practitioners in the region; the Department acted arbitrarily by relying on \u201csecret data;\u201d the Department failed to make the statutorily required biennial inflation adjustments; the regulations improperly rely on \u201cpaid\u201d fees; and the determination of \u201cusual, customary and reasonable fees\u201d is subjective and based on unreliable information. Appellants also raise other issues specific to particular details of the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">\u201cIt is elementary that an administrative agency derives its power from legislation____\u201d <em>Rider Ins. Co. v. First Trenton Cos., </em>354 <em>N.J.Super. </em>491, 499, 808 A.2d 143 (App.Div.2002). Administrative regulations \u201ccannot alter the terms of a legislative enactment or frustrate the policy embodied in the statute.\u201d <em>N.J. Chamber of Commerce v. N.J. Election Law Enforcement Comm\u2019n, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>57, 82, 411 A.2d 168 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-11\">Administrative regulations are entitled to a presumption of validity and reasonableness. <em>In re Protest of Coastal Permit Program Rules, </em>354 <em>N.J.Super. </em>293, 329, 807 A.2d 198 (App.Div.2002). We will generally defer to an agency\u2019s determination, and our deference is a function of our courts\u2019 recognition that \u201can agency\u2019s specialized expertise renders it particularly well-equipped to understand the issues and enact the appropriate regulations pertaining to the technical matters within its area.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 330, 807 A.2d 198. \u201cParticularly in the insurance field, the expertise and judgment of the Commissioner may be allowed great weight.\u201d <em>In re Commissioner\u2019s Failure to Adopt 861 CPT Codes, supra, </em>358 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 149, 817 A.2d 355. We will overturn an administrative determination only if it was arbitrary, capricious, unreason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>able or violated express or implied legislative policies. <em>Ibid. </em>The party challenging the agency action bears the burden of overcoming the presumption of validity and reasonableness. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">With these basic principles in mind, we commence our analysis of appellant\u2019s arguments. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4.6(a) enables the Department to promulgate a physicians\u2019 fee schedule to \u201cincorporate the reasonable and prevailing fees of 75% of the practitioners within the region.\u201d Appellants contend that neither the new physicians\u2019 fee schedule nor the ASC facility fee schedule meets the statutory mandate that the fees reflect the reasonable and prevailing rates of 75% of practitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">To support their position, appellants review several of the specific proposed reimbursements to demonstrate how, under these schedules, the providers of these services would not be reimbursed their reasonable and prevailing fee. As an example, appellants cite generally low reimbursements for neurosurgeons, specifically for a cervical laminectomy and fusion and orthopedic surgeons, as well as emergency surgical care. Unfortunately, these are generalized complaints, and our consideration of the issue is hampered by the lack of adequate documentation to establish the premise. Although one neurosurgeon reported actual figures, the non-specific complaint that the proposed reimbursement rates do not reflect reasonable and prevailing fees is inadequate to sustain appellant\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">In <em>Bergen Pines County Hospital v. Department of Human Services, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>456, 474, 476 A.2d 784 (1984), the Court explained that \u201c[t]he basic purpose of establishing agencies to consider and promulgate rules is to delegate the primary authority of implementing policy in a specialized area to governmental bodies with the staff, resources, and expertise to understand and solve those specialized problems.\u201d The rulemaking procedures, including the notice requirements and requests for public comments \u201care designed to take advantage of the agencies\u2019 resources and expertise.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>The agency is particularly well equipped to read and understand the massive documents and to evaluate the factual and technical issues that such a notice of proposed rulemaking would invite.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\">To permit a party in court to raise objections to a rule and to submit evidence concerning those objections that it failed to raise before the administrative agency at the appropriate time would be to undermine the very purpose of administrative agencies. In addition, it would force courts to review potentially overwhelming reams of technical data and to resolve from scratch issues as to which it does not have particular expertise. Finally, it would permit a party who fostered an inadequate rulemaking record by his own admission to take advantage of the inadequacy of the factual record in order to secure <em>de novo </em>review of the wisdom of the rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">\n<em>[Ibid,]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">Although the reporters responding in their comments took the opportunity to address the proposed rules, they did not provide any documentation to support their claims. Given the lack of documentation and being mindful that the burden remains with appellants challenging an agency determination, we are unable to conclude that PIP reimbursement rates do not reflect the reasonable and prevailing fees of 75% of the providers in a region.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nevertheless, appellants still maintain that because the Department failed to explain its methodology and used unreliable data in setting its rates, the Department has not shown that the physicians\u2019 fee schedule was set at the statutorily required rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">Appellants correctly anticipate the Department\u2019s claim that the \u201creasonable and prevailing rates\u201d were derived from reliable data. Appellants respond that the data upon which the fee schedule was based was not reliable or appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">There were several sources of data relied upon by the Department, and appellants argue that two of them\u2014the Ingenix data and the CSG data\u2014were unreliable and therefore should not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>been used. They also argue that for several reasons it was inappropriate to use the other main source of data\u2014the Medicare fee schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Specifically, appellants maintain that the Ingenix database should not have been used because Ingenix is wholly owned by an insurer and uses proprietary data. Appellants argue that using the proprietary fee data was \u201cplainly improper and rendered Respondent\u2019s action arbitrary, since its information and methodology in setting the fee schedule cannot be tested for accuracy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">As support for this position, appellants cite to <em>Medical Ass\u2019n of Ga. v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Ga., </em>244 <em>Ga.App. </em>801, 536 S.E.2d 184 (2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>2001 <em>Ga. LEXIS </em>at *3 (Ga. Jan. 5, 2001). In that case, physicians contracted with the insurer to be paid their \u201cusual, customary and reasonable fees\u201d for services. <em>Id. </em>at 185. The insurer changed the meaning of the \u201cusual, customary and reasonable\u201d fee from what doctors usually charged for a particular service to the fee that doctors in a given geographic area usually received for a particular service. <em>Ibid. </em>The physicians argued that because the insurer refused to give the physicians either a fee schedule or the precise methodology that it used to determine the usual, customary and reasonable fee, the new fee schedule was improper; the court agreed. <em>Id. </em>at 186. The court explained that without the fee information, there was \u201cno way for doctors to calculate for themselves whether they have been fully paid for a particular service under the plan.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Further, \u201cthe doctors never agreed to allow [the insurer] to keep its fee schedule and methods for determining fees [a] secret.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cSuch information is critical to the doctors so that they can ensure that [the insurer] is fulfilling its obligations under the contracts.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\"><em>Medical Association of Georgia </em>is distinguishable. First, the arrangement between the doctors and the insurer was a consensual contract. As the court noted, the physicians never agreed, under the contract, to keep the fee information a secret. Here, the arrangement between the physicians and the insurers is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>one of consensual agreement, but rather one forged by statute and regulation. Second, the enabling statute here, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4.6, specifically permits the Commissioner to \u201ccontract with a proprietary purveyor of fee schedules for the maintenance of the fee schedule----\u201d The Department is empowered to use proprietary data. Finally, the Georgia doctors did not receive a fee schedule or methodology. Here, the rules mandated both the fee schedule and the statutory methodology, including the use of proprietary purveyors.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">To further support their argument that relying on the Ingenix database was improper, appellants cite <em>Wachtel v. Guardian Life Ins. Co., </em>223 <em>F.R.D. </em>196 (D.N.J.2004), <em>vacated and remanded on other grounds, </em>453 F.3d 179 (2006), in which criticisms of Ingenix were discussed. <em>Wachtel </em>involved the issue of class certification. <em>Id. </em>at 198. While criticisms of Ingenix were identified, the court did not address these issues in deciding the class certification issue. <em>Id. </em>at 201 n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">More relevant is appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>McCoy v. Health Net, Inc., </em>569 F.Supp.2d 448 (D.N.J.2008).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>McCoy, </em>the judge explored the intricacies of the Ingenix databases for determining the \u201cusual, customary and reasonable\u201d (UCR) charges of out-of-network claims in connection with a fairness hearing to determine whether to approve a class action settlement in a suit against a health care insurer. In the proposed settlement, the insurer agreed to stop using Ingenix databases for determining UCR for out-of-network claims. The judge had to determine the importance and value of that change of business practice to the class in order to decide whether the settlement should be approved. <em>Id. </em>at 463-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">The judge heard testimony from an expert \u201cabout the methods used by Ingenix to create its commercial databases____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 463-64. Specifically, the expert analyzed the two Ingenix databases that were used to calculate UCR: the Prevailing Healthcare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>Charge System database (PHCS database) and the MDR/Medicode database. <em>Id. </em>at 464. After hearing from the expert, the judge concluded that the Ingenix databases suffered from flaws in three broad categories: a) data collection and sampling; b) database creation and editing; and c) data analysis. <em>Id. </em>at 464-68. The judge found that the Ingenix databases, at least as they were utilized to determine UCR rates, were unreliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">The Department asserts that the databases criticized in <em>McCoy </em>were not the databases utilized here to set the physician\u2019s fee schedules. As the Department correctly notes, \u201c[t]he two <em>McCoy </em>databases were utilized to determine whether the <em>charges </em>of \u2018out-of-network\u2019 providers were usual, customary and reasonable____ [T]he Department created a PIP fee schedule based upon paid, not billed or charged, fees.\u201d To set the physicians\u2019 fee schedule, the Department used Ingenix\u2019s \u201c \u2018allowed fee\u2019 \u201d database, which contained data on the reimbursement amounts actually paid by insurers and accepted by providers. The Department also correctly observes that <em>McCoy </em>has no effect here because the Department relied on the Ingenix database only as one source of information in reaching its physicians\u2019 fee rate determinations. The <em>McCoy </em>court reviewed databases of fees submitted by physicians as their UCR charges; the Department\u2019s data showed the actual amounts paid by providers, not what was billed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In our view, the utility of <em>McCoy </em>as it applies to the actual amounts paid is problematic.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">Appellants further claim that the Department admitted that the Ingenix database was suspect because: 1) Ingenix could not explain why its fees were higher in southern New Jersey than in northern New Jersey, and 2) it did not include sufficient data about many procedures commonly performed in treating auto injuries. The Department did indeed make these concessions. 39 <em>N.J.R. </em>4126(c) (October 1,2007). The Department claims, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>citation to authority or the record, that \u201cthe South vs. North anomalies in the 2000 \u2018allowed fee\u2019 data obtained from Ingenix were resolved in the 2002 update,\u201d thus, the Ingenix database was reliable. The database did not include sufficient data about many procedures commonly performed in treating auto injuries because the procedures were not commonly found in the claims paid by the health insurers who contributed to the Ingenix database. 39 <em>N.J.R. </em>4126(e) (October 1,2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Although the Department admitted these shortcomings, it emphasized that they were not fatal flaws in the data and that the Ingenix database was just one of several sources of information that it relied upon in formulating the schedules. <em>Ibid. </em>Even if the database did not include sufficient data about certain auto injuries, that does not detract from the reliability of the data the Department did have. We are satisfied that absent total reliance on the Ingenix database, we will not overturn the regulations based on deficiencies in one data resource. The Department utilized other data in promulgating its rules, and we reject the argument that the databases were so flawed as to prove fatal to the rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Appellants next argue that data provided by CSG, a PIP claim billing service utilized by 28.64% of the auto market insurers in New Jersey, should not have been used because the spreadsheet it provided stated only that it contained 2005 blended auto data, but did not identify any insurer by name or identify how many insurers contributed to the compilation. Therefore, claim appellants, the source of the data was a \u201cmystery,\u201d and there was \u201cno indicia of accuracy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">The Department does not dispute that the spreadsheet fails to name the insurers involved, but asserts that \u201cthe standard established by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4.6(a) is not easily achieved because there is no existing database of the reasonable and prevailing fees paid to reimburse 75 percent of the medical practitioners in any region of the State.\u201d It also acknowledges that data on paid fees by auto insurers and individual health care plans is difficult to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>obtain given that the information is often proprietary. Notably, in the adoption comments the Medical Society of New Jersey (an appellant here) undertook to make its own determination of what physicians are reimbursed for procedures covered under PIP and \u201cencountered difficulties in establishing a credible database of fees.\u201d 89 <em>N.J.R. </em>4126(c) (October 1, 2007). The Medical Society found that physicians would not share with each other information about the fees they charged \u201cbecause of concerns about violating antitrust statutes.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Further, the Department properly rejected suggestions that it use physician surveys or arbitration awards. Ultimately, the Department relied on the data it could obtain.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">The Department represented that the information on the spreadsheet from CSG was complied from \u201cseveral insurers\u201d who represented \u201cmore than 25 percent of the New Jersey auto insurance market.\u201d Given the difficulty, acknowledged by both the Department and appellants, in finding credible sources of fee information, the Department\u2019s decision to use actual PIP data from insurers is appropriate even though the names of the insurers were not revealed. The enabling statute allowed the Department to use a proprietary purveyor of fee data, which by its nature would include data without an identified source. The data from the CSG insurers presented no more \u201cmystery\u201d than data supplied by a proprietary purveyor of fee schedules. Moreover, the Department released an abbreviated spreadsheet with many of the actual figures received by CSG, so even if the exact insurers were not revealed, the actual data relied upon was transparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">We reject appellants further arguments that the methodology used for the spreadsheet was inadequately explained and factually unsupported. The initial spreadsheet was eighty-one pages and included 1,000 CPT codes. The spreadsheet released to appellants was fifty pages and included 416 CPT codes. The Department contended that the smaller spreadsheet was simply a \u201csubset\u201d of the eighty-one page spreadsheet. We deem this of no moment. Any CPT codes that were not included on the fee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>schedule would still be paid according to the usual, customary and reasonable charges for that service.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">We accept the same explanation for omitted codes. As the Department explained, it used the CSG data to compare or \u201cproof[]\u201d other data that it had. If there was no CSG data, it obviously could not compare the fees. Nevertheless, the Department \u201cstill had multiple other data sources to support the promulgation.\u201d When a CPT code did not have any specific data to support the amount of the fee, the Department determined a reasonable fee approximation by reference to the surrounding CPT code families, a logical methodology. Although the CSG data might not have provided data on every CPT code, the factual basis for the codes it did provide is strong. The lack of data on every possible code does not undermine the reliability of the CSG paid fee data that it did have. Appellants have presented no compelling argument that the data supplied by CSG was not reputable and worthy of consultation.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">Appellants next maintain that it was erroneous to base the PIP fee schedule on a percentage of Medicare because the Department failed to establish that Medicare reimbursement rates bore any relationship to the \u201creasonable and prevailing fees\u201d of 75% of the practitioners in the region. They complain that Medicare rates are \u201cwoefully\u201d less than the \u2018\u201creasonable and prevailing fees\u2019 \u201d of PIP service providers because Medicare rates are limited by federal budget constraints and are part of a program providing subsidized care for the elderly. Additionally, treatment of PIP patients is more expensive than treatment of typical Medicare patients based, in part, on higher administrative costs for PIP claims. And, significantly, the Department never adequately explained or documented how and why Medicare payment rates were \u201ca reliable barometer to determine\u201d the reasonable and prevailing fees of 75% of the practitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">Contrary to appellants\u2019 contentions, the Department fully and convincingly explained why it relied upon the Medicare schedules. It noted that the Medicare schedule was \u201ccomprehensive\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>\u201cresource based.\u201d 38 <em>N.J.R. </em>3437(a) (September 5, 2006). The methodology was described in detail. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, with input from the provider community, calculated a \u201crelative value unit\u201d (RVU) for the physician\u2019s work, practice expenses and malpractice premium expense for each CPT code. <em>Ibid. </em>The RVUs are then adjusted by a geographical practice cost index that reflects those costs in a specific region. <em>Ibid. </em>The result was then multiplied by a dollar amount called the Medicare conversion factor to produce the fees for each Medicare region. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">In the final rules, the Department stated that it compared the Medicare fee schedule to the actual fees paid by auto insurers in 2005, as represented by CSG data. 39 <em>N.J.R. </em>4126(c) (October 1, 2007). It found that for a majority of the CPT codes, 130% of the Medicare fee schedule \u201ccorresponded well to the 75th percentile fees paid by auto insurers.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Department also noted that the actual fees paid by auto insurers were higher, and in some cases, significantly higher, than reimbursements from other insurers. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">The Department also addressed the concern that the CSG data showed that treatment of PIP patients was more complex than Medicare patients. 39 <em>N.J.R. </em>4126(c) (October 1, 2007). It noted that the CPT codes had been developed by the American Medical Association to \u201csimplify the reporting of treatment by describing the services performed by physicians and other health care providers.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The CPT manual contained modifiers for some services or procedures that needed to be altered due to some specific circumstance. <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cThe CPT manual does not have separate codes based on what caused the injury nor are there any modifiers that recognize that there is any change in the service or procedure performed due to the cause of the injury.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Based on that, the Department concluded that there was no difference in the treatment provided to accident victims from that of other patients. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>The Department\u2019s explanation demonstrates that setting the fee schedule at 130% of the Medicare rates was not arbitrary. The Department found that actual payments made by insurers for the same procedures (at the 75th percentile) equaled 130% of the Medicare fee schedule in most instances. In some specialty cases, the Department increased the fee by more than 130%. By comparing the actual amounts insurers paid with the Medicare data, the Department had a sound basis for setting the fees. The comprehensive Medicare fee schedule was simply a starting point for the fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">The Department explained that it used these three databases, in addition to the New York State Workers\u2019 Compensation and No Fault Fee Schedule, to develop the PIP fee schedule. 38 <em>N.J.R. </em>3437(a) (September 5, 2006). It explained in as much detail as possible the foundation of each database, why it used each one and how the databases were \u201cproofed\u201d against each other to determine a PIP reimbursement figure. Nevertheless, the Department concedes that none of the databases is perfect and, in some respects, not comprehensive. The fixing of the rates is not an exact science, but the record supports a finding that the databases were reliable sources of information upon which to base the physicians\u2019 fee schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Our inquiry must be whether the Department was able to use the databases to ensure that the physicians\u2019 fee schedule satisfied the statutory mandate that the fees represent the reasonable and prevailing fees of 75% of the practitioners in the region.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">Appellants\u2019 arguments concerning the application of the data are closely linked to the reliability of the data. In general, they argue that even if this data was properly used, the fees set in the physicians\u2019 fee and ASC fee schedule do not represent the reasonable and prevailing fees of 75% of the practitioners in the region.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">With regard to the CSG spreadsheet, appellants argue that for the OPT codes included in the spreadsheet, the spreadsheet did not demonstrate that the fee schedule incorporated the reasonable and prevailing fees of 75% of the practitioners for those codes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>because the codes show <em>averages </em>of the paid fees from the insurers, and those averages had no identifiable relationship to the fees in the schedule. In fact, appellants assert, \u201cthe average of paid fees ... from these \u2018sources\u2019 were [sic] substantially <em>higher </em>than the amount of fees in the adopted fee schedule for those codes.\u201d In support of its argument, appellants cite a number of examples where the amounts paid by insurers significantly exceeded the PIP reimbursement rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The Department maintains that it \u201cexamined the fee sources in detail to identify any anomalies, outliers, or errors,\u201d looked for procedures or services where reimbursement rates appeared to be \u201cunreasonable\u201d and adjusted them accordingly. The Department maintains that it properly exercised its discretion and did not act arbitrarily or capriciously. For each extreme example cited by appellants, the Department explained them and the reasons behind those adjustments. The adjustments support the Department\u2019s representation that it reviewed each of the codes individually for anomalies or errors. The majority of the codes were set at 130% of the Medicare rate. For 183 CPT codes, the Department adjusted the rates higher than 130% of Medicare. While some of these codes were adjusted to 150% of Medicare, many were adopted at 350% of Medicare, several at 450% of Medicare, some at 600% of Medicare and even one at 800% of Medicare. Appellants\u2019 arguments about a few select procedures being reimbursed at less than the Medicare rate does not convince us that the entire procedure is defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">The Department maintains that all of the fees on the physicians\u2019 fee schedule are higher than the fees on the MPFS, the state workers\u2019 compensation schedule and the fees paid by health insurers according to Ingenix. 39 <em>N.J.R. </em>4126(c) (October 1, 2007). Appellants\u2019 have not made any convincing argument that the rates set in the physicians\u2019 fee schedule did not meet the statutory standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">Appellants also argue that the rates for ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs), which were set for the first time in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>schedule, were, at 300% of Medicare, far below the reasonable and prevailing fees for ASC services in New Jersey. The Department, appellants allege provided no data to justify the amounts in the new fee schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The Department acknowledged the difficulty in obtaining data regarding ASC facilities, given that these facilities were \u201ca relatively new phenomenon.\u201d 39 <em>N.J.R. </em>4139 (October 1, 2007). It also noted that the field had been unregulated. As a result, \u201cexorbitant fees\u201d had been charged, and fraud had been a concern. <em>Ibid. </em>Further, fees charged for the same service were widely divergent. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Because Ingenix did not maintain a database of fees for ASCs, the Department examined the Medicare schedule for ASC facility fees that had been recently set by CMS. 38 <em>N.J.R. </em>3437(a) (September 5, 2006). The Department explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-8\">Medicare has recently set facility fees for ASCs at a prospectively determined rate that approximates the costs incurred by ASCs in providing services. The rates are determined by conducting a survey of the audited costs of a sample of ASCs every five years. The rates are adjusted for inflation during the years when the survey is not conducted. The Department is using the Medicare system whereby procedures designated by CPT codes that are performed in ASCs are put into nine fee groups.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-9\">\n<em>mm</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">The services in these groups were assigned dollar amounts set at 300% of Medicare. 39 <em>N.J.R. </em>4126(c) (October 1, 2007). In setting this rate, the Department also consulted the PIP paid fee data from CSG. The 300% rate was more than double the original proposal of 120%.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-11\">The Department used the Medicare rates as a basis for setting the ASC reimbursement rates. With the lack of other data regarding ASCs, and much of the available data being contradictory, this approach is reasonable. Appellants have not suggested anything indicating that the rates set were inconsistent with the reasonable and prevailing fees charged by ASCs.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-12\">We have noted that the fixing of these rates is not an exact science and when confronted with inadequate data, new methodol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>ogies of providing treatment and the various other imponderables that arise in the process, the Department made considered and informed judgments. Certainly, many elements of the process can be criticized, but ultimately, the entire scope of the process must be assessed. We conclude that appellants have not met their burden of showing that the methodology for setting the PIP reimbursement rates was flawed or that the rates set violated the statutory mandate to represent the reasonable and prevailing rates of 75% of the practitioners in the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">We briefly address appellants argument that the Department\u2019s contradictory statements demonstrate that its actions were arbitrary and unsupported. The arguments are without merit. The Department did rely on Medicare rates as a starting point for its calculations but did not link the PIP rates to Medicare rates. If the Medicare rates change, that will not implicate or cause a change in the PIP rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Likewise, the seemingly contradictory statements regarding the use of PIP fee data to set the fee schedule are without contradiction. The Department addressed the issue in 38 <em>N.J.R. </em>3437(a) (September 5, 2006), which stated in part, \u201c[bjased upon the information submitted by providers through the informal preproposal process <em>and paid fee data provided by insurers, </em>a number of fees have been set at higher or lower percentages of Medicare.\u201d (Emphasis added). The Department mentioned the data again at 39 <em>N.J.R. </em>4126(c) (October 1,2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">We similarly reject appellants\u2019 next argument that the Department failed to make the statutorily required biennial adjustments for inflation, and as such, the rules fail to set the reimbursement rates at the 75% rate required.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">The Department addressed this issue in response to the same criticism in the comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-9\">The Department did not provide any inflation analysis in the proposed amendment because it was not adjusting an existing fee schedule for inflation but rather establishing a new fee schedule. However, the Department recognizes that the physicians\u2019 fee schedule is based primarily on data from 2005, although it reflects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>the two percent increase in the MPFS in 2006. The Department intends to propose an inflationary adjustments to the physicians\u2019 fee schedule in the near future. The Department has not reviewed all the fee schedules biennially as required by statute because the medical fee schedule and the three other fee schedules adopted in 2001 were subject to litigation until 2003. Since then, the Department has been developing the proposed comprehensive physicians!\u2019] fee schedule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\">[39 <em>N.J.R. </em>4126(c) (October 1, 2007).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Although the Department acknowledged that it had not made the inflation adjustment, this fee schedule did not use the previous schedule as a basis, so the lack of adjustment for inflation of the previous fee schedule is of no moment. This new fee schedule was based primarily on 2005 data, but a 2006 Medicare adjustment was included. The rates were supposed to take effect in 2007, but because of appellants\u2019 challenge resulting in this litigation, they did not. This is an unfortunate, but unavoidable consequence of litigation. Nevertheless, at the time they were set, the rates were based on current data. The Department stated that it intended to propose a change in 2008, to reflect inflation through 2007. 39 <em>N.J.R. </em>4126(c) (October 1, 2007). Appellants have not shown that the Department\u2019s failure to make the biennial adjustment in the past has any bearing on the accuracy of the present schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">Appellants next assert that the Department\u2019s \u201cdecision to derive the fee schedule from \u2018paid fees\u2019 rather than billed fees, is unlawful based on the clear statutory language and well-established principles of statutory construction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">The issue of whether the Department could rely on paid fees as opposed to billed fees was squarely addressed in <em>Coalition III, supra, </em>358 <em>N. J.Super. </em>at 123, 817 A.2d 347. We phrased the issue this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-10\">Appellants contend that, by basing ... [the physicians\u2019 fee schedule] on paid fees rather than billed fees, the Department ... exceeded the scope of its legislative authority and acted contrary to legislative intent. The Department responds that it acted within its ample discretion to establish fee schedules----The charged-fee versus paid-fee issue must be resolved at some point. It is better resolved now than later.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-13\"><em>[Id. </em>at 126, 817 A.2d 347.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>The appellants in <em>Coalition III </em>argued, as appellants do here, that the \u201c \u2018reasonable and prevailing fees of 75% of the practitioners within the region\u2019 necessarily refers to billed fees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 127, 817 A.2d 347. We noted that the purpose of the statute was to contain automobile insurance costs \u201cwhile providing a fair level of reimbursement for services based on what providers received in the market.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 128, 817 A.2d 347 (quoting 32 <em>N.J.R. </em>4332(a), 4333 (December 18, 2000)). We further noted the change in the medical field; providers frequently accept less in payment than they bill due to managed care contracts. <em>Ibid. </em>We found that \u201cpaid fees have diverged significantly from billed fees, making paid fees a much more accurate measure of \u2018reasonable and prevailing fees.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 127-28, 817 A.2d 347. We determined that basing the fee schedule on the paid fees was not arbitrary or capricious and was within the discretion of the Department. <em>Id. </em>at 128, 131, 817 A.2d 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Appellants here do not dispute the holding of <em>Coalition III, </em>but say, \u201c[sjimply put, the decision was wrongly decided and should not be followed.\u201d We disagree and see no reason to revisit the issue. In <em>Coalition III, </em>we found that the Department\u2019s use of \u201cpaid fees\u201d was an acceptable interpretation of the statute and we adopt the reasoning of our colleagues in rejecting appellants\u2019 argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Appellants next argue that the new rules \u201cimproperly permit\u201d the UCR fees to be \u201cbased on subjective determinations and unreliable sources.\u201d The Department and intervenors disagree and maintain that the method for determining the UCR was within the Commissioner\u2019s broad discretionary power. Prior to the amendment at issue here, fees that were not on the physicians\u2019 fee schedule were paid at the provider\u2019s \u201cusual, customary and reasonable fee.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-29.4(e). The amendment, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-29.4(e)(1), states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-7\">For the purposes of this subchapter, determination of the usual, reasonable and customary feo means that the provider submits to the insurer his or her usual and customary fee. The insurer determines the reasonableness of the provider\u2019s fee by comparison of its experience with that provider and with other providers in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>region. The insurer may use national databases of fees, such as those published by Ingenix (tmw.ingenixonline.com) or Wasserman (http:llwww.medfees.comj), for example, to determine the reasonableness of fees for the provider\u2019s geographic region or zip code.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The Department felt that this amendment was necessary because during arbitrations over the UCRs, the arbitrators</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqz\">have interpreted case law to conclude that UCR is determined by simply looking at whatever bills a provider chooses to produce as evidence of his or her usual and customary fee. The attempts of insurers to show that the provider\u2019s fee is not reasonable based on national fee databases of billed fees, such as Ingenix, have been rejected by the [arbitrators] on the basis that there is no documentation on how Ingenix establishes its fee database.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-6\">The Department believes that the [arbitrators\u2019] method of determining the UCR simply by using the fees on bills selected by the provider is not acceptable. The current proposal establishes a more detailed methodology for determining UCR that includes use of national billed fee databases such as Ingenix and Wasserman to demonstrate the reasonableness of the fees submitted by the provider.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-7\">[39 <em>N.J.R. </em>4126(c) (October 1, 2007)-]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">Appellants argue that this amendment was improper for several reasons. First, they reiterate the objections they raised earlier as to Ingenix and raise two additional arguments. They assert that it is a national database, but the statute requires the fees be determined with respect to the region. This objection is without merit. While the national databases might include data for other parts of the country, the regulation specifically states that the data taken from Ingenix can only be based on the provider\u2019s \u201cgeographic region or zip code.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3\u2014 29.4(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">The second argument relies on the findings of the federal court in <em>McCoy </em>as to problems with the specific database involved in that litigation. We are concerned about the reliability of the Ingenix database referred to in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-29.4(e)(1), but it is not clear to us that this is the same database condemned in <em>McCoy. </em>Also, there is a more significant distinction. The rule provides that the insurer \u201cmay\u201d rely on the Ingenix database; it does not mandate such reliance. Moreover, the cited databases are examples of available resources rather than mandated references.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>We are left with at least three alternatives. We can affirm <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-29.4(e)(1), as stated and allow the Department to make farther inquiry into the reliability of the questioned database; we can exercise our jurisdiction and excise the offending portion of the regulation that calls for reliance on the Ingenix database; or we can affirm this rule and enjoin any reliance on the Ingenix database pending further review by the Department as to the reliability of the database.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">The first alternative would <em>possibly </em>permit the use of a database that is flawed; the second alternative might eliminate a valid, but untested, resource for the use of the insurer; the third alternative will allow the Department to apply its expertise in assessing the <em>bona fides </em>of the questioned database and allow the remaining rules to be implemented. Accordingly, we will adopt the third alternative and enjoin the use of that provision of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3\u2014 29.4(e)(1), that permits, even by example, the use of the Ingenix database.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Appellants next challenge the part of the rule, which would allow insurers to determine the reasonableness of the fees \u201cby comparison of its experience with that provider and with other providers in the region.\u201d Appellants argue that an insurer\u2019s interpretation of its experience with a provider or other unidentified providers \u201cin no way satisfies the Statute\u2019s requirement to pay \u2018the reasonable and prevailing fees of 75% of the practitioners within the region\u2019 for those services.\u201d The Department maintains that the 75% standard does not apply to the UCRs, and applies only to the PIP fee schedule. As support, the Department points to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4.6(a), which states that the \u201cfee schedules\u201d \u201cshall incorporate the reasonable and prevailing fees of 75% of the practitioners within the region.\u201d The fees not listed on the fee schedule are paid at the UCR, which is not subject to the 75% <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>standard. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-29.4(e); 39 <em>N.J.R. </em>4126(c) (October 1, 2007). The Department\u2019s interpretation is correct and requires no additional comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Finally, appellants argue that the amendment cannot be sustained because it leaves payment determinations to the discretion of the insurers, with no accountability or redress for aggrieved providers, in violation of <em>Cobo, supra, </em>293 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 386, 680 A.2d 1103, which requires that \u201cthe health care provider will set its own customary fee, not the insurer____\u201d Appellants argue that the proper methodology for determining the UCR fee is for the provider to determine his or her UCR fee, while the insurer strives to ensure that the provider\u2019s UCR fee is billed. It is improper for the insurer to make the final payment determination based on its own assessment of UCR, with no meaningful accountability.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">The amendment does not violate <em>Cobo. </em>In addressing the application of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-29.4, we noted a comment that \u201craised the question of whether insurers might construe the regulatory language as allowing them to establish their own reasonable and appropriate fees.\u201d <em>Cobo, supra, </em>293 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 386, 680 A.2d 1103. The Commissioner responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-9\">The provider, in submitting the billings, makes the initial determination as to what his or her usual, customary and reasonable fee is. <em>It is incumbent on the insurer, based on its experience with the particular provider or other providers in the region, to determine whether, in fact, the usual, customary and reasonable fee has been billed. </em>The effectiveness of the medical fee schedules in the cost of auto insurance in New Jersey is dependent upon adherence by insurers to this review process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-10\"><em>[Ibid, </em>(quoting 24 <em>N.J.R. </em>1348 (April 6,1992)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">We continued, \u201c[t]hus, the scheme envisions that the health care provider \"will set its own customary fee, not the insurer or the insurer\u2019s auditor. But at the same time, the insurer has a mandate to review the provider\u2019s bills to ensure that it has billed at its customary and reasonable rate.\u201d <em>Cobo, supra, </em>293 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 386, 680 A.2d 1103.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>The proposed rule conforms with <em>Cobo. </em>Under <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3\u2014 29.4(e)(1), the provider submits his or her usual and customary fee. The insurer then determines the reasonableness of the fee. That is no different than the procedure in <em>Cobo. </em>The new provision allows the insurer to consult with a national database for help in determining the reasonableness of the fee. Such a procedure will provide more protection against arbitrary determinations to the providers. Nevertheless, if a provider disagrees with the insurer\u2019s determination, the provider has the option of filing for arbitration. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-5.1. There is accountability and meaningful review.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Finally, we have considered the remaining arguments raised by appellants. We conclude that they are without merit and do not require further discussion. <em>R. </em>2:11\u20143(e)(1)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">The use of the Ingenix database in determining the \u201cusual, customary and reasonable fees\u201d as required by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3\u2014 29.4(e)(1), is enjoined pending further review by the Department; in all other respects, the decision of the Commissioner adopting the rules, regulations and amendments to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-29.1\u2014.4 is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b42-10\"> For ease of reference, we refer to the rules, regulations and fee schedule collectively as either \"the rules\u201d or \"the regulations.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b43-8\"> In the Medicaid context, DRGs are described as \" \u2018specified diagnostic categories for which hospitals receive a predetermined fixed amount for inpatient services.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Commissioner's Failure to Adopt 861 CPT Codes and to Promulgate Hosp. &amp; Dental Fee Schedules, </em>358 <em>N.J.Super. </em>135, 140, 817 A.2d 355 (App.Div.2003) (quoting <em>Atl.
