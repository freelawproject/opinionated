Rone, </em>A-5850-07T4, and <em>State v. Rone, </em>A-6192-07T4, are separate appeals arising out of the same factual complex. In A-5850-07T4, defendant appeals from her conviction for the disorderly persons offense of obstruction of justice, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-1. In A-6192-07T4, she appeals from the trial court\u2019s order declaring that her conviction resulted in the forfeiture of her position as a member of the Newark City Council, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2. We consolidate these appeals for purposes of this opinion. After reviewing the records in both appeals in light of the arguments presented, we affirm her conviction and the order of forfeiture. We deal first with A-5850-07T4.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Defendant\u2019s conviction for obstruction of justice rests upon an incident that occurred on the night of December 20, 2006, in Newark. Officer Wilson of the Rutgers University police was on mobile patrol when he saw a vehicle driving on Washington Street near its juncture with Broad Street change lanes without giving a signal. Officer Wilson signaled the car to pull over. As he pulled up behind the vehicle, he noted that there were two occupants in the car, that it had a temporary registration placard in the rear window and that the driver was not wearing a seat belt. In accordance with the department\u2019s procedures, he called for backup before approaching the car. Officer Derek Fuerstein arrived to assist.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">The two officers then approached the car, Officer Wilson on the driver\u2019s side, Officer Fuerstein on the passenger\u2019s side. While doing so, Wilson noted that the temporary registration placard in the rear window had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">Music was playing loudly in the car, the driver and passenger were laughing and the driver was speaking on his cell phone. Officer Wilson told the driver, later identified as Jamil Grant, to get off the phone. Grant did not immediately do so but continued his conversation. Wilson had to repeat his direction several times <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>before Grant obeyed. Wilson also told Grant that because the registration had expired, his vehicle could be towed. Grant eventually turned off his phone and produced a Florida driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Wilson was returning to his vehicle to investigate the status of Grant\u2019s license when another vehicle approached at a high rate of speed, pulled up and stopped in a lane of traffic parallel to and between Wilson\u2019s police ear and Grant\u2019s car. Defendant got out, said she was a member of the Newark City Council, and demanded to know why Wilson had stopped Grant\u2019s car. Wilson told defendant to move her vehicle out of the lane of traffic and to get away from Grant\u2019s car. She did not comply, continuing to say she was a member of the City Council and asking why Grant had been stopped. Wilson asked for identification, but defendant said she did not have any with her. The vehicle she was driving, however, had license plates indicating it was a municipal vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Wilson had never confronted a situation such as this, and he called for the assistance of a supervisor. Acting Sergeant Joseph Churchill of the university police came to the scene and talked with defendant, who eventually pulled her car to the side. She agreed in her testimony that some eight to ten minutes had elapsed until she moved her car.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">She continued, however, to stand by Grant\u2019s car and did not move when told several times to do so; she demanded to know why Grant had been stopped. Eventually, she moved from the street to the sidewalk. She announced that she was calling the \u201creal\u201d police and telephoned the Newark Police Department, identified herself as a eouncilwoman and asked for a police unit to be sent to the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">During the course of the event, she also mentioned that she had just attended a meeting with the Provost of the Rutgers campus. Officer Wilson testified that he was concerned that he might lose his job with the Rutgers police.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">Sergeant Churchill testified that after defendant made her call to the Newark police, three patrol cars, a sergeant and a captain, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>all members of the Newark police department, eventually arrived at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Jamil Grant, the driver stopped by Wilson, is defendant\u2019s nephew. Grant and defendant both testified that Grant and his friend had been at her house shortly before this incident. The two young men left intending to pick up another friend and go to a night club. Grant testified that when he was stopped by the police, some period of time elapsed before anyone approached his car. He called defendant to tell her that he had been stopped and that they were just sitting in the car waiting. She told him to remain in the car, stay calm and keep his hands where the police could see them.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Defendant testified Grant was talking to her on the phone when she heard the officer yelling at Grant to get off the phone. When he hung up without saying anything further to her, she called back to make sure he was all right. She said she heard the officer yelling to get off the phone and Grant again hung up. She said she was concerned for her nephew\u2019s safety and immediately left her home without her purse to drive to the scene. She insisted her entire purpose was to make sure that nothing untoward happened to her nephew.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">The entire incident took approximately fifty to fifty-five minutes. At the end, Officer Wilson placed defendant under arrest and charged her with obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">In light of her position with the Newark City Council, trial of this matter was transferred from the Newark Municipal Court to the Fairfield Municipal Court. The municipal court judge found defendant guilty, and she appealed to the Law Division, where she was again found guilty, following a trial de novo. The court imposed a fine of $250, $50 in court costs, a $50 Violent Crimes Compensation Board assessment, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-3.1, and a $75 Safe Neighborhood Services Fund assessment, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-3.2. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">On appeal, defendant raises the following arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>POINT I THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT AND INSUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE PRESENTED TO SUPPORT THE LOWER COURT\u2019S FINDINGS THAT RONE PURPOSELY INTERFERED, PHYSICALLY AND BY INTIMIDATION, WITH OFFICER WILSON LAWFULLY PERFORMING AN OFFICIAL FUNCTION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-5\">POINT II THE LOWER COURT COMMITTED PLAIN ERROR IN FAILING TO CONSIDER THE LESSER INCLUDED CHARGE OF FAILURE TO OBSERVE THE DIRECTION OF AN OFFICER, CONTRARY TO <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-57. (Not Raised Below)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">Neither contention requires extended discussion. In defendant\u2019s initial argument she contends that she did not purposely physically interfere with Officer Wilson\u2019s investigation, nor \u2018did she intimidate him. She stresses, as she did below, that she acted out of concern for her nephew\u2019s safety. This concern, she said, was heightened by the then-recent shooting in New York City of Sean Bell by members of the New York City police.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">Defendant\u2019s argument, however, equates her stated motive with purposeful conduct. The two concepts are not identical. One acts purposely \u201cif it is his conscious object to engage in conduct of that nature or to cause such a result.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-2b(1). This statutory definition describes an actor\u2019s mental state while committing an act, not the motivation leading an actor to commit that certain act. An actor\u2019s motivation may become relevant when a court turns to the question of an appropriate penalty, but it does not bear on the question of whether an individual acted purposely.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">Her argument, moreover, overlooks the fact that her placement of her vehicle physically interfered with Officer Wilson completing his tasks, as did her initial insistence on standing next to Grant\u2019s ear, despite having been told to move away from it. Wilson testified that defendant\u2019s conduct turned what should have been a routine stop, with a summons being issued, taking five to ten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>minutes, into a protracted event, requiring almost an hour to complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">We consider <em>State v. Perlstein, </em>206 <em>N.J.Super. </em>246, 253, 502 A.2d 81 (App.Div.1985), instructive. In that ease, we upheld the defendant\u2019s conviction for obstruction of justice \u201cwhen she attempted to move her ear contrary to [the officer\u2019s] directions.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>There is no analytical distinction between moving a car in the face of instructions not to do so and not moving a car in the face of instructions to do so in terms of the effect upon an ongoing police investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">We are satisfied the record contains ample support for defendant\u2019s conviction for obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">Defendant\u2019s second contention is that the trial court should have considered the motor vehicle offense of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-57 as a lesser-included offense of obstruction of justice. Defendant did not raise this issue with the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-8d(1) through (3) define a lesser-included offense. Under subsection (1), a lesser-included offense is one that may be \u201cestablished by proof of the same or less than all the facts required to establish the commission of the offense charged.\u201d It is evident that the motor vehicle offense of failing to observe an officer\u2019s direction cannot qualify as a lesser-included offense of obstruction of justice under that language. The proofs required for each offense are entirely separate.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">Subsection (2) is wholly inapplicable. Under this subsection, a conspiracy to commit a charged offense or an attempt to commit that charged offense is a lesser-included offense. Neither conspiracy nor attempt was involved in the present matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-12\">Subsection (3) provides the final definition of a lesser-included offense as one that \u201cdiffers from the offense charged only in the respect that a less serious injury or risk of injury to the same person, property or public interest or a lesser kind of culpability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>suffices to establish its commission.\u201d We agree with the State that the obstruction statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-1, and the motor vehicle statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-57, contain different elements and are directed to different harms. Subsection (3) of the statute affords no basis to treat the motor vehicle offense under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-57 as a lesser-included offense of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:29-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">There was no error by the trial court in not sua sponte amending the charge to the motor vehicle offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">We turn now to the issues presented in A-6192-07T4 in which defendant appeals from a trial court order which denied the motion of the Essex County Prosecutor to waive the forfeiture provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:51-2 and directed that defendant forfeit her position as member of the Newark City Council as a consequence of her conviction for obstruction of justice. At oral argument, defendant explained that she did not seek to unseat her successor and to be restored to her seat on the City Council. Rather, she sought to be relieved of the permanent consequences attached to an order of forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">We have already set forth the factual background to defendant\u2019s conviction for obstruction of justice, and we shall not repeat it.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">After defendant\u2019s conviction in the Law Division, the Prosecutor\u2019s Office took the position that defendant had forfeited her office as a councilwoman. Defendant opposed this application. Prior to the matter being argued in the trial court, the Attorney General advised the Prosecutor\u2019s Office that whether to seek a waiver of forfeiture rested in the Prosecutor\u2019s discretion. Based upon that advice, the Prosecutor\u2019s Office then filed its own application seeking waiver. The trial court, however, denied the waiver application, and defendant filed a notice of appeal. Although the State did not file a separate notice of appeal, it also contends that the trial court erred when it ruled that defendant must forfeit her position in light of her conviction for obstruction of justice. Despite the fact that both parties urge us to reverse the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>order, we are satisfied that the trial court was entirely correct in its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Defendant raises the following contentions on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">POINT I THE LOWER COURT\u2019S REJECTION OF THE PROSECUTOR\u2019S WAIVER APPLICATION DEMANDS REVERSAL BECAUSE IT MISAPPLIED THE LAW PERTAINING TO WAIVER OF FORFEITURE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">POINT IA BY ENDORSING AND ADOPTING THE STATE\u2019S INITIAL APPLICATION FOR FORFEITURE AS THE POLESTAR FOR ITS REJECTION OF THE PROSECUTOR\u2019S WAIVER APPLICATION, THE LOWER COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION AND ROBBED THE DECISION OF EVEN A PRETENSE OF FAIR AND OBJECTIVE CONSIDERATION OF WHETHER \u2018GOOD CAUSE\u2019 FOR WAIVER WAS SHOWN.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-8\">POINT IB THE LOWER COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION BY USING THE LEGISLATIVE PURPOSE OF THE FORFEITURE PROVISION TO SUPPORT IT\u2019S [sic] DENIAL OF THE STATE\u2019S WAIVER APPLICATION; ANY RELIANCE UPON LEGISLATIVE PURPOSE BY THE LOWER COURT REQUIRED APPLICATION OF THE LEGISLATIVE PURPOSE PERTAINING TO THE WAIVER PROVISION WHICH WAS THE ISSUE BEFORE THE COURT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-9\">POINT IC THE LOWER COURT ADMITTED TO COMPLETELY PREJUDGING THE REQUIRED WAIVER ANALYSIS WHEN IT STATED IT WOULD HAVE RULED AGAINST THE STATE <em>\u2018EVEN IF\u2019 </em>IT ORIGINALLY APPLIED FOR WAIVER; THUS NO LEVEL OF \u2018GOOD CAUSE\u2019 SHOWN ON FLAGG FACTORS COULD HAVE SATISFIED THE LOWER COURT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-10\">POINT II THE LOWER COURT'S APPROACH TO \u2018GOOD CAUSE\u2019 ANALYSIS WAS ERRONEOUS AND CONSTITUTED AN ABUSE OF DISCRETION.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A89W\">POINT IIA THE LOWER COURT\u2019S FAILURE TO APPLY THE \u2018GOOD CAUSE\u2019 STANDARD TO THE STATE\u2019S FLAGG FACTOR ANALYSIS (BY SUBSTITUTING ITS OWN VIEW OR SELECTIVELY DISREGARDING OR RECONSTRUCTING FACTS ON THE FLAGG FACTORS WITHOUT ANY BASIS WHATSOEVER AND SHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-11\">Flagg Factors One and Two: The Totality of Circumstances Surrounding the Event and The Nature of the Offense (including it\u2019s [sic] gravity and substantiality, whether it was a single or multiple offense and whether it was continuing or isolated)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-12\">Flagg Factor Three: Quality of Moral Turpitude or Degree of Guilt or Culpability</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-14\">Flagg Factors Four and Five: The Duties of <em>the </em>Employee and The Relationship Between the Offense and the Employee\u2019s Duties</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ake\">Flagg Factor Six: The Employee\u2019s Length of Service</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae-\">Flagg Factor Seven: The Employer\u2019s Desires</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>Flagg Factor Eight: The Need and Interests of the Victim and Society, Including Consideration of the Victim\u2019s Desires</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\">Flagg Factors Nine and Ten: The Extent to Which the Employee\u2019s Offense Constitutes Part of a Continuing Pattern of Anti-Social Behavior and The Employee\u2019s Prior Record of Convictions and Disciplinary Infractions Flagg Factor Fifteen: Whether Waiver of Forfeiture of Office Would Undermine Public Confidence in the Integrity of Important Governmental Functions, Including But Not Limited to Law Enforcement Function</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Afn\">POINT III THE LOWER COURT\u2019S FINDING THAT THE UNDERLYING OFFENSE \u2018TOUCHED UPON\u2019 RONE\u2019S OFFICE WAS ERRONEOUS AND REQUIRES REVERSAL</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">The first question, analytically, is whether defendant\u2019s conviction for obstruction of justice touched on her position as a member of the City Council. Defendant asserts that it did not and that as a consequence, the forfeiture statute is inapplicable. The State argued, and the trial court held, that her conviction did touch on her office, thus triggering consideration of forfeiture. We agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">The forfeiture statute applies to persons convicted of an offense \u201cinvolving or touching such office, position or employment.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2(a)(2). Subsection (d) of the statute permanently disqualifies from \u201cany office or position of honor, trust or profit\u201d of the State or its subdivisions \u201cany person convicted of an offense involving or touching on his public office, position or employment.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">The New Jersey Supreme Court had occasion to define \u201ctouch on\u201d in <em>McCann v. Clerk of Jersey City, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>311, 771 A.2d 1123 (2001). McCann, toward the end of his second term as mayor of Jersey City, was convicted in federal court of several offenses, including tax evasion and mail fraud. <em>Id. </em>at 316, 771 A.2d 1123. After serving his prison sentence, he sought to run again for the position of mayor. <em>Id. </em>at 317, 771 A.2d 1123. The City Clerk deemed that McCann had, by his convictions, forfeited his right to public office and would not accept his petition to be placed upon the ballot; McCann sued. <em>Ibid. </em>He argued that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>because his crimes did not touch on his position as mayor, he should not be precluded from seeking the position again. <em>Id. </em>at 320, 771 A.2d 1123.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">The Court was thus called upon to consider whether these convictions touched on McCann\u2019s mayoral office, and it concluded they did not. It rejected the view this court had expressed, that McCann\u2019s convictions touched on his office because they \u201cdemonstratefd] his untrustworthiness and disrespect to government agencies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 321, 771 A.2d 1123. The Court held the phrase had a narrower focus.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-6\">That phrase [touch onj implies, in our view, a determination on the part of the Legislature to limit the scope of the disqualification provision to crimes that are related directly to an individual\u2019s performance in, or circumstances flowing from, a specific public office or position held by that individual. When an individual commits a crime wholly unrelated to his or her public office, the crime ordinarily cannot be characterized as involving or touching on the public office.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ApH\">[Ibid.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">Defendant stresses that the record does not contain any findings of dishonesty or untrustworthiness on her part; this, she contends, demonstrates that her actions on the night in question do not touch on her office. This, however, is not the test enunciated by the McCann Court; an offense touches on an individual\u2019s office if it flows from that office.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">Indeed, this portion of the statute was amended after the Supreme Court issued its opinion in <em>McCann. </em>This section of the statute now specifically provides, \u201cAs used in this subsection, \u2018involving or touching on his public office, position or employment\u2019 means that the offense was related directly to the person\u2019s performance in, or circumstances flowing from, the specific public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>office, position or employment held by the person.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2d. The Statement accompanying this amendment notes that the definition is in accordance with the Court\u2019s decision in <em>McCann, </em>codifying it. <em>Senate Statement to S. 14 </em>(enacted as <em>L. </em>12007, c. 49, \u00a7 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The offense need not take place at work or while on duty to touch on an individual\u2019s position. <em>Moore v. Youth Corr. Inst. at Annandale, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>256, 574 A.2d 983 (1990) (holding that a corrections officer who harassed his supervisor at his home forfeited his position). There must be some nexus between the individual\u2019s public office and the offense committed. <em>State v. Hupka, </em>407 <em>N.J.Super. </em>489, 510, 971 A.2d 1102 (App.Div.2009) (holding that a sheriff\u2019s officer who pled guilty to fourth-degree criminal sexual contact was not permanently barred from public employment; he \u201cdid not use or threaten the use of his offices in any way to commit the offense. He did not display or utilize any indicia of his offiee[ ] at any time. The offense was not related to any circumstance that flowed from defendant\u2019s office.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Here, in contrast, defendant repeatedly announced her public position and pointed to her use of a municipal vehicle. She used her position to denigrate the university\u2019s police force, and dissatisfied with the manner in which the university police were responding to her, summoned what she termed the \u201creal\u201d police, the City\u2019s municipal police. We agree with the trial court that defendant\u2019s offense did indeed touch on her position as a member of the city council.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Because defendant\u2019s conviction for obstruction of justice flowed from her position as a member of the city council, the provisions of the forfeiture statute were triggered.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">Forfeiture of public office is governed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2. Insofar as pertinent to the issues in this matter, the statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>(a) A person holding any public office, position, or employment, elective or appointive ... who is convicted of an offense shall forfeit such office, position or employment if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-6\">(2) He is convicted of an offense involving or touching such office, position or employment</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-7\">(e) Any forfeiture or disqualification under subsection a ... which is based upon a conviction of a disorderly persons or petty disorderly persons offense may be waived by the court upon application by the county prosecutor or the Attorney General and for good cause shown.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Although, as we have noted, both parties assert that the trial court erred in denying the motion to waive forfeiture, they present different rationales in support of their respective positions that the trial court\u2019s order should be reversed. Defendant asserts that the proper analysis is whether good cause existed to waive forfeiture; she maintains that it did. The State, on the other hand, asserts that the trial court employed the wrong standard of review when it considered the prosecutor\u2019s position that waiver of forfeiture was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">We are satisfied that defendant\u2019s threshold analysis, that is, that the critical question is whether good cause exists to waive forfeiture, is correct and that the State\u2019s position, that the prosecutor\u2019s decision to seek waiver is entitled to enhanced deference, is incorrect. That defendant applies the correct analytical framework does not advance her cause, however, for we are equally satisfied that good cause was not demonstrated. The State contends that this matter is akin to a prosecutorial decision to deny an application for admission to pretrial intervention (PTI); such a prosecutorial decision is entitled to enhanced deference on judicial review. <em>State v. Baynes, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>434, 443, 690 A.2d 594 (1997); <em>State v. Bender, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>84, 97, 402 A.2d 217 (1979). \u201cA reviewing court may order a defendant <em>into PTI over the </em>prosecutor\u2019s objection, only if the defendant can \u2018clearly and convincingly establish that the prosecutor\u2019s refusal to sanction admission into the program was based on a patent and gross abuse of ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>discretion.\u201d\u2019 <em>Baynes, supra, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>at 444, 690 A.2d 594 (quoting <em>State v. Wallace, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>576, 582, 684 A.2d 1355 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">In our judgment, the prosecutor\u2019s position is contrary to the views expressed by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">Although the authority to seek waiver is vested in the Attorney General and county prosecutors, we are convinced that the Legislature did not intend the discretion to seek waiver to be subject to more limited review simply because it is to be exercised by law enforcement officials. Given that the discretionary decision whether or not to seek a waiver is dissimilar to those determinations typically made by prosecutors in their law enforcement capacity, and is more akin to prosecutorial discretion in sentencing-related determinations, an abuse of discretion would be the more appropriate standard. In PTI matters, the focus is on whether there should be prosecution under an indictment, thereby implicating a wide range of considerations that influence a prosecutor\u2019s ultimate decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-7\"><em>[Flagg v. Essex County Prosecutor, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>561, 570-71, 796 A.2d 182 (2002).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">The plaintiff in <em>Flagg </em>had worked for the Department of Sanitation in Newark for nearly thirty years with an unblemished record. <em>Id. </em>at 568, 796 A.2d 182. On September 5, 1996, he was instructed by his supervisor to pick up a load of construction debris from a site not on his regular route and then to dump it on the street two blocks away. <em>Id. </em>at 566, 796 A.2d 182. After complying with his supervisor\u2019s instructions, he returned to his regular route. <em>Ibid. </em>Several Newark police officers observed his actions in dumping this waste on the street, and he was charged with the disorderly persons offense of disposing of solid waste on a public street, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-9.3a and b. Flagg asserted that he had just been following his supervisor\u2019s orders, but he was convicted, the offense being one of strict liability, regardless of intent. <em>Id. </em>at 566, 796 A.2d 182. He was subsequently terminated by the department. <em>Id. </em>at 567, 796 A.2d 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">Flagg thereafter filed an action in lieu of prerogative writs, seeking to compel the prosecutor to request a waiver of the forfeiture provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2 or to provide an explanation of his refusal. <em>Ibid. </em>After a hearing, the trial court held that the decision by the prosecutor not to seek a waiver of forfeiture was \u201can extraordinary abuse of discretion,\u201d and it granted a waiver. <em>Id. </em>at 568, 796 A.2d 182. The prosecutor appealed, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>this court held that judicial review of a prosecutor\u2019s decision not to seek a waiver of forfeiture was limited to the question whether that decision was a \u201cpatent and gross abuse of discretion,\u201d and we reversed the trial court. <em>Ibid. </em>The Supreme Court, however, disagreed, concluding that the remedial purposes of the waiver of forfeiture provision \u201ccan be achieved more effectively under an ordinary abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 571, 796 A.2d 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">In <em>Flagg, </em>the Court was considering a prosecutor\u2019s refusal to seek a waiver of forfeiture, and it was that decision which it said should be reviewed in terms of abuse of discretion. Here, the trial court was confronted with a prosecutor\u2019s decision to seek a waiver of forfeiture. Waiver of forfeiture does not follow automatically from a prosecutor\u2019s decision to seek such waiver. Rather, it is a judicial function to determine whether a prosecutor has demonstrated the statutorily-required \u201cgood cause\u201d to grant waiver. The grant of waiver of forfeiture is not a prosecutorial function; it remains always a judicial one.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">The trial court\u2019s analysis of whether to grant a waiver of forfeiture here, and our subsequent analysis of the trial court\u2019s ruling, is hampered by the procedural missteps which occurred below. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2b(1) provides that an order of forfeiture shall be entered \u201cpursuant to subsection a ... [immediately upon a finding of guilt by the trier of fact____\u201d The question of forfeiture, however, was not addressed at all in the municipal court proceedings nor at the trial de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">The statute goes on to provide that when \u201cthe issue of forfeiture is not raised ... at the time of a finding of guilt ... or sentencing ... a forfeiture of public office, position or employment required by this section may be ordered ... upon application of the county prosecutor____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2g.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-12\">Based upon that statute (and perhaps upon the fact that defendant had not sought waiver), the prosecutor\u2019s office moved for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>order of forfeiture.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant opposed the application, contending that the Law Division could not impose a more severe penalty than had the municipal court, that the application was untimely, and that her actions did not demonstrate she was unfit to hold public office. The prosecutor\u2019s office submitted a brief asserting that these contentions were immaterial to the question of forfeiture and that a forfeiture order should be entered by the trial court. We note that defendant does not repeat those contentions on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Shortly before the hearing on forfeiture, the Attorney General\u2019s office advised the prosecutor\u2019s office that it had discretion whether to seek forfeiture. Based upon that advice, the prosecutor\u2019s office determined that it should seek a waiver. The trial court was understandably perturbed at what it perceived to be an unexplained shift in the position taken by the prosecutor\u2019s office on the same factual complex and deemed it an abuse of discretion. Neither party made clear to the trial court the significance of the procedural sequence: that in its first papers, the prosecutor\u2019s office was complying with the guidelines issued by the Attorney General, in which case the matter was to be analyzed under the forfeiture statute, while in its second set of papers it was exercising the discretion that the Attorney General had just acknowledged, in which case the matter was to be analyzed under the principles of waiver enunciated in subsection (e) of the statute and in <em>Flagg, supra, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>at 579, 796 A.2d 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">This procedural confusion engendered by the parties does not, however, provide a basis to reverse the trial court\u2019s ultimate conclusion. The fundamental question presented was whether good cause existed to waive forfeiture. The trial court correctly concluded that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>In accordance with the Court\u2019s directive in <em>Flagg, Id. </em>at 578, 796 A.2d 182, the Attorney General\u2019s office promulgated guidelines to assure state-wide uniformity in the handling of waiver of forfeiture applications. Under these guidelines, the factors to be considered are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">1. The totality of the circumstances surrounding the event;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-7\">2. The nature of the offense, including its gravity and substantiality, whether it was a single or multiple offense and whether it was continuing or isolated;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-8\">3. The quality of moral turpitude or the degree of guilt or culpability, including the employee\u2019s reasons, motives and personal gain;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-9\">4. The duties of the employee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-10\">5. The relationship between the offense and the duties of the employee, including but not limited to, whether the criminal activity took place during work hours or involved work facilities, contacts, relationships, or equipment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-11\">6. The employee\u2019s length of service;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-12\"><em>I. </em>The employer\u2019s desires;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-13\">8. The needs and interests of the victim and society, including consideration of the victim\u2019s desires;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-14\">9. The extent to which the employee\u2019s offense constitutes part of a continuing pattern of anti-sodal behavior;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-15\">10. The employee\u2019s prior record of convictions and disciplinary infractions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-16\">II. The threat presented to eoworkers or the public if the employee is permitted to retain his or her position;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-17\">12. Any involvement of the employee with organized crime;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-18\">13. Whether the employee has been granted waiver on a prior occasion;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-19\">14. The impact of waiver on the employment status of codefendants as to avoid an injustice if similarly situated culpable individuals are tried in separate trials;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-20\">15. Whether waiver of forfeiture of office would undermine public confidence in the integrity of important governmental functions, including but not limited to law enforcement functions; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-21\">16. Nature and scope of cooperation with the prosecuting authorities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-22\"><em>[Attorney General Guidelines for Deciding Whether to Apply for a Waiver of Forfeiture of Public Office Pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2G:51-%(e) </em>9-10, <em>available at </em>http://www.state.nj.us/lps/dcj/agguide/waiverofforfeiture.pdf.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-23\">Defendant had the burden of proof to establish the presence of good cause to warrant a waiver of the forfeiture of her position on the City Council that would otherwise flow from her conviction. <em>Flagg, supra, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>at 578, 796 A.2d 182. She did not satisfy that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>Both defendant and the State contend that the trial court incorrectly weighed these factors. Defendant complains that the trial court focused in large part on the first three factors, ascribing them much greater weight than the balance. She argues that there is no basis for the trial court to have accorded more weight to one factor than another.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">We disagree. We note first that such an approach is explicitly contained in the Attorney General\u2019s guidelines, which state \u201cIf one factor is so severe, it may outweigh the other factors.\u201d <em>Guidelines </em>at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">In addition, the judicial process of assessing these waiver factors strikes us as analogous to the judicial assessment of aggravating and mitigating factors that is \u00e1 critical part of the sentencing process. We have long recognized that a sentencing court need not give these factors equal weight in constructing an appropriate sentence for an offender. <em>State v. Morgan, </em>196 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 5, 481 A.2d 545 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>175, 491 A.2d 682 (1984) (citing <em>State v. Roth, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>334, 368, 471 A.2d 370 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Much of the trial court\u2019s letter opinion is devoted to criticism of the views expressed in the State\u2019s papers seeking a waiver, noting how the views set forth in those papers contradicted the views expressed earlier by the State. We confine our analysis to the core issue, whether, considering the <em>Flagg </em>factors,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> good cause had been demonstrated for a waiver of forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\"><em>Flagg </em>factor 1 and 2 overlap one another; they require a consideration of the totality of the circumstances, the \u201cnature of the offense, including its gravity and substantiality, whether it was a single or multiple offense and whether it was continuing or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>isolated.\u201d Weighing in defendant\u2019s favor is the fact that according to the record before us, this was a single and isolated offense. Weighing against her is the characterization of this episode by the Law Division:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-6\">I have reviewed the videotape of the incident and the municipal court trial transcript several times. The scene unfolds in an almost excruciatingly slow fashion. The defendant blocks the middle lane of traffic for 7 minutes, refusing to simply move her car into the lane to the right. She repeatedly announces her status, shouts at the officer, follows him, disrupts the scene and leans into her nephew\u2019s car, in prolonged conversation in the street.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-7\"><em>Flagg </em>factor 3 is \u201cthe quality of moral turpitude or the degree of guilt or culpability, including the employee\u2019s reasons, motives and personal gain.\u201d Although defendant may not have acted to achieve personal gain, and may have been motivated by concern for her nephew, that does not obliterate her clear culpability in this incident. Defendant stresses that the municipal court judge found that defendant acted from concern for her nephew. The Law Division correctly pointed out that the municipal court judge made additional findings, with which Law Division concurred.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-8\">I believe the officer when he says she was repeatedly asked to get out of the way and stop interfering with the officer. She, on numerous occasions, identifies herself as a councilwoman. When, and the Court finds that when it appears she\u2019s not getting anywhere she decides I\u2019m not going to deal with these Rutgers cops anymore. I\u2019m Councilwoman Dana Rone, I\u2019m going to call the Newark Police and I\u2019m going to get the Newark Police involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-9\">And in fact, the Newark police respond immediately. And I think the scene gets very very confused. And I think the scene gets confused because of the actions of the defendant Rone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-10\"><em>Flagg </em>factors 4 and 5 are \u201cthe duties of the employee\u201d and the \u201crelationship between the offense and the duties of the employee, including but not limited to, whether the criminal activity took place during work hours or involved work facilities, contacts, relationships, or equipment.\u201d We agree with the trial court that there is a close relationship between defendant\u2019s position and the offense she committed, turning the balance toward forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\"><em>Flagg </em>factor 6 is the employee\u2019s length of service. We concur with the trial court that this factor is entitled to little weight, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>defendant having held office for only five months at the time of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\"><em>Flagg </em>factor 7, the employer\u2019s desires, is not relevant. Defendant was an elected official, not a hired one.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\"><em>Flagg </em>factor 8 is the \u201cneeds and interests of the victim and society, including consideration of the victim\u2019s desires.\u201d The trial court did not make a specific finding with respect to this factor, but rather criticized what it perceived as the State\u2019s contradictory positions. To the extent that defendant\u2019s actions did cause a diversion of police resources, we think that the impact can fairly be described as minimal.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\"><em>Flagg </em>factors 9, \u201c[t]he extent to which the employee\u2019s offense constitutes part of a continuing pattern of anti-social behavior,\u201d and <em>Flagg </em>factor 10, \u201c[t]he employee\u2019s prior record of convictions and disciplinary infractions,\u201d weigh in defendant\u2019s favor. Defendant has no prior history of anti-social behavior or infractions.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\"><em>Flagg </em>factors 11 through 14 are not relevant to the present matter, nor is <em>Flagg </em>factor 16. <em>Flagg </em>factor 15, however, is significant; indeed, the trial court deemed it the most critical: \u201c[wjhether waiver of forfeiture of office would undermine public confidence in the integrity of important governmental functions, including but not limited to law enforcement functions.\u201d We agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusions in this regard, that the reasonable interpretation of defendant\u2019s actions in interfering with what should have been a routine traffic investigation indicated a view that in light of her position she did not have to comply with lawful, routine police directives. This factor weighs heavily in favor of forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">The trial court\u2019s findings with respect to forfeiture find substantial support within the record, and the trial court\u2019s conclusion that there had not been a showing of good cause to grant a waiver of forfeiture was not an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. Its order is thus affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>The judgment of conviction under review in A-5850-07T4 is affirmed, as is the order of forfeiture under review in A-6192-07T4.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b624-10\"> We note for the sake of completeness that defendant, her nephew, and Officer Wilson are all African-American.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b629-9\"> Although the Court held that McCann was not precluded from seeking future office under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2d, he was precluded under the Faulkner Act, which bars individuals \"convicted of a crime or offense involving moral turpitude.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:69A-166. The Court rejected McCann\u2019s argument that such a distinction between municipalities operating under the Faulkner Act and those which do not violated his right to equal protection under the law. <em>Id. </em>at 332, 796 A.2d 182.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b634-7\"> The guidelines issued by the Attorney General's office after the Court issued its decision in <em>Flagg, supra, </em>provide that a prosecutor should move for forfeiture if an application for a waiver is not received at the time of conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b636-9\"> We noted earlier that the Attorney General\u2019s office promulgated a set of guidelines to assure uniformity in the treatment of waiver applications.
