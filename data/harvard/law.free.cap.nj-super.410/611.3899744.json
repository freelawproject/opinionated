In this appeal, defendant argues in part that plaintiff did not qualify as a victim of domestic violence because he paid for plaintiffs company. We reject defendant\u2019s arguments and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Plaintiff filed a domestic violence complaint and obtained a temporary restraining order on December 2, 2008. Eight days later, the judge conducted a final hearing and, at the hearing\u2019s conclusion, made findings and entered a final restraining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Defendant appealed, arguing that: the parties were not in a dating relationship; there was no evidence of harassment or terroristic threats; there was no need for a restraining order; and the judge erred by employing a preponderanee-of-the-evidence standard of proof. We find no merit in any of these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">The Act permits the entry of restraining orders in favor of victims of domestic violence. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:25-29. The Act defines a \u201cvictim of domestic violence\u201d as including, among others, \u201cany person who has been subjected to domestic violence by a person with whom the victim has had a dating relationship.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-19d. It does not, however, define what is meant by \u201ca dating relationship.\u201d Instead, the Legislature has left it to the courts, in their day-to-day involvement with these matters, to determine what relationships might be properly characterized as dating relationships.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">Our decisional law defining the scope of a dating relationship is essentially limited to a single opinion authored by a trial judge. In <em>Andrews v. Rutherford, </em>363 <em>N.J.Super. </em>252, 260, 832 A.2d 379 (Ch.Div.2003), Judge Michael Hogan suggested various factors to be evaluated in defining what constitutes a dating relationship for purposes of the Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>1. Was there a minimal social interpersonal bonding of the parties over and above a mere casual fraternization?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-5\">2. How long did the alleged dating activities continue prior to the acts of domestic violence alleged?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-6\">3. What were the nature and frequency of the parties\u2019 interactions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-7\">4. What were the parties\u2019 ongoing expectations with respect to the relationship, either individually or jointly?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-8\">5. Did the parties demonstrate an affirmation of their relationship before others by statement or conduct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-9\">6. Are there any other reasons unique to the case that support or detract from a finding that a \u201cdating relationship\u201d exists?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-10\">[Footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-11\">Recognizing the difficulties in attempting to describe all the characteristics of a dating relationship, Judge Hogan concluded that \u201c[w]hile none of these factors may be individually dispositive on the issue, one or more of the factors may be more or less relevant in any given case depending on the evidence presented.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b642-12\">We do not view this case as an appropriate vehicle for approving or disapproving the test suggested by <em>Andrews, </em>or for determining whether all the factors listed in <em>Andrews </em>have relevance in defining what constitutes a dating relationship. There may, in fact, be other factors not mentioned in <em>Andrews </em>that warrant consideration. We do, however, agree with <em>Andrews </em>insofar as there it was held that the facts should be liberally construed in favor of finding a dating relationship, <em>ibid., </em>because the Act itself is to be liberally construed in favor of the legislative intent to eradicate domestic violence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Stated another way, the Act embodies a strong public policy against domestic violence. <em>Cesare v. Cesare, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>394, 400, 713 A.2d 390 (1998). Because the Act is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>remedial in nature, it has been liberally construed for the protection of victims of domestic violence. Ibid.; <em>Tribuzio, supra, </em>356 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 596, 813 A.2d 1210. Indeed, the Act itself announces that its purpose is \u201cto assure the victims of domestic violence the maximum protection from abuse the law can provide.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-18. These principles would not be served by a cramped interpretation of what constitutes a dating relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">In considering these principles, we observe that the matter at hand suggests application of a factor not previously considered by our courts. Here, defendant argues he was not in a dating relationship with plaintiff because their relationship was purely \u201cprofessional\u201d; that is, according to defendant\u2019s argument on appeal, their interactions occurred when defendant frequented local clubs where plaintiff worked as a dancer. As a result, he argues without any legal support that a paid escort does not meet the Act\u2019s definition of \u201ca victim of domestic violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Considering the Act\u2019s intended broad scope, we reject the contention that a relationship which includes a payment of consideration for the other\u2019s time precludes the finding of a dating relationship. Indeed, an au pair or live-in housekeeper would undoubtedly qualify as a \u201cperson who is a present or former household member,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-19d, entitled to relief under the Act, even though that person might be a member of the household only because compensation has been paid for his or her presence. The fact that a person receives a monetary benefit from engaging in a relationship does not automatically disqualify that person from the Act\u2019s benefits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">But, again, we do not resolve this matter through application of only the factors suggested by <em>Andrews. </em>Experience suggests that most claims of a dating relationship turn on what the particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>parties would view as a \u201cdate.\u201d \u201cDating\u201d is a loose concept undoubtedly defined differently by members of different socioeconomic groups and from one generation to the next.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, although <em>Andrews </em>suggests some useful factors, courts should vigilantly guard against a slavish adherence to any formula that does not consider the parties\u2019 own understanding of their relationship as colored by socio-economic and generational influences.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Here, despite his attempts to disparage plaintiff by asserting their relationship was \u201cprofessional,\u201d defendant testified that his tendering of money to plaintiff was meant \u201cto help her out financially\u201d and not necessarily in exchange for her time. Indeed, despite defendant\u2019s attempt to describe plaintiff as a paid escort during the examination conducted by his attorney,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the judge questioned whether these payments occurred \u201cduring the time you were <em>dating\u201d </em>(emphasis added). Defendant responded in the affirmative without qualification. Certainly, defendant\u2019s agreement that he and plaintiff dated was highly relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">In addition, defendant\u2019s attempts to suggest a pejorative connotation to the relationship were often conflicting. For example, defendant initially asserted that he paid defendant to be his escort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>at Thanksgiving dinner at his parents\u2019 home. However, upon further examination by the judge, defendant admitted he did not pay plaintiff for her company on that occasion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">Q. Did you pay her to come to Thanksgiving dinner? Yes or no?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-7\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-8\">Q. You paid her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-9\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-10\">Q. How much did you pay her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-11\">A. Well, it\u2014for the\u2014it wasn\u2019t\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-12\">Q. Por to\u2014you said she was an escort for Thanksgiving dinner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-13\">A. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-14\">Q. Did you pay her to come to Thanksgiving dinner? Did you tell her I want you</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-15\">to be the escort for Thanksgiving dinner, and how much is it going to cost?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-16\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-17\">Q. So you didn\u2019t pay her for the Thanksgiving dinner?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-18\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-19\">In any event, the judge found credible plaintiffs description of her relationship with defendant. Plaintiff testified she and defendant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-20\">were boyfriend/girlfriend, I went to his house, he introduced me to his parents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"At\">We went out several times together. We spent weekends together.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-22\">The judge was certainly entitled to find from this testimony that the parties had a dating relationship that ended shortly before defendant\u2019s harassing and threatening communications that formed the basis for this domestic violence action.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-23\">There was also ample evidence from which the judge was entitled to find that defendant engaged in acts of domestic violence. In evidence were scores of text messages sent from defendant\u2019s cellphone to plaintiff\u2019s, in which he threatened physical harm to plaintiff<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and her boyfriend,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and also threatened to bring about her removal from the country.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The judge\u2019s findings that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>defendant committed acts of domestic violence\u2014in that these and defendant\u2019s other communications constituted terroristic threats or were otherwise acts of harassment\u2014are supported by credible evidence and entitled to our deference. <em>Cesare, supra, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>at 411-12, 713 A.2d 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">We lastly make brief mention of defendant\u2019s argument that the final restraining order should be vacated because the judge employed the preponderanee-of-the-evidence standard of proof as required by the Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-29a, rather than the elear- and-convincing standard. In this regard, defendant relies solely upon a trial judge\u2019s unpublished decision, which held the Act unconstitutional for, among other things, permitting findings of domestic violence through application of the preponderance standard. We have since reversed that decision, concluding that the Legislature was not constitutionally required to impose a elear- and-eonvincing standard for the adjudication of domestic violence matters. <em>Crespo v. Crespo, </em>408 <em>N.J.Super. </em>25, 37-40, 972 A.2d 1169 (App.Div.), <em>leave to appeal granted, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>468, 983 A.2d 196 (2009). We, thus, find no merit in the argument contained in defendant\u2019s Point V.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Defendant\u2019s other arguments are without sufficient merit to warrant discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(1)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b642-13\"> Other than <em>Andrews, </em>those cases that have dealt with dating relationships have focused on the problem created when the alleged act of domestic violence occurred years after termination of the dating relationship. <em>See Tribuzio v. Roder, </em>356 <em>N.J.Super. </em>590, 594-98, 813 A.2d 1210 (App.Div.2003); <em>Sperling v. Teplitsky, </em>294 <em>N.J.Super. </em>312, 318-21, 683 A.2d 244 (Ch.Div.1996). <em>See also M.A. v. E.A., </em>388 <em>N.J.Super. </em>612, 618, 909 A.2d 1168 (App.Div.2006) (rejecting the contention that a person's sexual assaults of his stepdaughter over a course of time gave rise to a dating relationship within the meaning of the Act).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b643-9\"> Monetary consideration for engaging in the relationship would not be a disqualifying fact in the <em>Andrews </em>\u2019 calculus.

No one \" 'particular model of family life\u2019 has monopoly on 'family values\u2019 \" \u2018[t]hose qualities of family life on which society places a premium ... are unrelated to the particular form a family takes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>V.C. v.
