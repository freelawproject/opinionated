Plaintiffs appeal from a \u201cconsent amended final order of dismissal,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> dismissing the balance of their complaint after the motion judge had previously, on May 2, 2008, dismissed \u201cthe allegations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>[plaintiffs\u2019 [c]omplaint that relate to wage decisions made prior to July 27, 2005, or the impact of those decisions upon plaintiffs\u2019 salaries following July 27, 2005,\u201d two years prior to the filing of the complaint on July 27, 2007. Plaintiffs argue \u201cthe refusal of the trial court to recognize the \u2018continuing violation\u2019 doctrine in plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of pay disparities was contrary to New Jersey law\u201d and that the trial court \u201cerred in holding that [the United States Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in] <em>Ledbetter [v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>550 <em>U.S. </em>618, 127 <em>S.Ct. </em>2162, 167 L.Ed.2d 982 (2007)] is controlling in the present case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The suit was commenced by three long-time female Seton Hall University professors who alleged age and sex discrimination in pay in violation of the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (LAD), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-1 <em>et. seq. </em>As noted, the trial court dismissed all claims arising two or more years before July 27, 2005, the date on which the complaint was filed. Plaintiffs allege that, because discovery was not completed, they do not know when the disparity commenced, but believe it \u201ccontinued\u201d until within two years of the complaint. However, defendant Seton Hall,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in essence, contends that any pay discrimination was based on a \u201cdiscrete act\u201d as of the time any disparity commenced, which was outside the statute of limitations (that is more than two years before the complaint was filed), that the \u201ccontinuing violation\u201d doctrine is inapplicable, and that <em>Ledbetter </em>controls. We agree, and affirm the judgment substantially for the reasons stated by Judge Alfonse J. Cifelli in his oral opinion of May 2, 2008, as supplemented herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Because the dismissal, on statute of limitations grounds, was entered pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:6-2(e), we treat the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations as true for purposes of this opinion. <em>See Banco Popular v. Gandi, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>161, 165-66, 876 A.2d 253 (2005). Plaintiff Alexander began her employment at Seton Hall in 1976, has been a tenured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>Associate Professor in the Management Department of the Still-man School of Business since 1981, and was sixty-two years old at the time the complaint was filed. Plaintiff Coll began her employment at the University in 1981, became a tenured Full Professor, the highest rank at the University, in the Management Department of the Stillman School of Business in 1994, and was sixty-five at the time the complaint was filed. Plaintiff Thompson-Sard began her employment with Seton Hall in 1987, became a tenured Associate Professor in the College of Education and Human Services, Department of Professional Psychology and Family Therapy in 1991, and was sixty-one at the time the complaint was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">In the fall of 2004 and fall of 2005, Seton Hall compiled summaries of faculty information arranged by college, gender, rank, and salary. Plaintiffs obtained copies of these summaries. In their complaint plaintiffs claimed that, although they had \u201calways suspected that men earned more\u201d than women in the same position, they learned in August 2005, when they obtained the summaries, that this was true. They alleged that their salaries were disproportionately lower than male, \u201cnewer [and] [ ] younger faculty members,\u201d holding similar positions for the same or shorter periods: \u201c[p]laintiffs claim discriminatory discrepancies between their salaries and those earned by younger and by male employees\u201d and that \u201cthe older, tenured, higher ranking professors have suffered lost income in order for the University to finance the salaries of younger, less experienced, newer professors\u2014many even before becoming tenured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Plaintiffs argue that their discrimination allegations are timely under the \u201ccontinuing violations\u201d doctrine, and that the doctrine applies to cases alleging discriminatory pay disparity. They further contend that <em>Ledbetter, supra, </em>550 <em>U.S. </em>at 618, 127 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2162, 167 L.Ed.2d at 982, a pay discrimination case arising under Title VII, 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>is <em>not </em>controlling, and that the trial court misinterpreted <em>Ledbetter </em>by finding that any discriminatory pay decision is a \u201cdiscrete act\u201d that could trigger the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>two-year statute of limitations. Plaintiffs also assert that they could not have taken action before they became aware of the discriminatory pay decisions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Plaintiffs further contend that the trial court failed to specifically identify any \u201cdiscrete acts\u201d of discrimination that it found to have triggered the limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Judge Cifelli determined that <em>Ledbetter </em>was applicable to this case because it involved the same issue: \u201cwhether and under what circumstances the plaintiff may bring an action alleging\u2014[ ] illegal pay discrimination when the disparate pay is received during the statutory limitations period but is the result of intentionally discriminatory pay decisions that occurred outside of the limitations period.\u201d He found \u201cthat once the statutory filing period is expired the present effects of a discriminatory salary decision have no present legal significance or consequences and therefore, such a decision cannot form the basis of a charge of discrimination.\u201d The judge added \u201cthat pursuant to <em>Ledbetter, </em>an employer\u2019s decision to set an employee\u2019s ... pay or salary is a \u2018discrete act\u2019 that commences the running of the limitation\u2019s [sic] period.\u201d Thus, paychecks received as a result of discriminatory pay decisions occurring outside of the limitations period, which merely represented a continuing impact of those time-barred decisions, cannot form the basis for plaintiffs\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The judge further noted that allowing plaintiffs to recover for pay decisions more than two years old would defeat the purpose of the statute of limitations, especially since plaintiffs alleged they always suspected that disparities existed. Thus, the Law Division <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>dismissed the complaint to the extent it was based on discrete discriminatory acts occurring prior to July 27, 2005, and to the extent it was based upon the present impact of those acts. As already noted, it later granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend its order dismissing the complaint in its entirety because, as plaintiffs\u2019 certified, \u201c[n]o \u2018discrete acts\u2019 of discrimination [we]re alleged during the statute of limitations period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">A trial court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint under <em>Rule </em>4:6-2(e) for \u201cfailure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted\u201d is reviewed under the same standard as that employed by the trial courts, <em>Seidenberg v. Summit Bank, </em>348 <em>N.J.Super. </em>243, 249-50, 791 A.2d 1068 (App.Div.2002), and the issue before us relating to the statute of limitations is one of law. <em>Churchill v. State, </em>378 <em>N.J.Super. </em>471, 478, 876 A.2d 311 (App.Div.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">LAD claims are subject to a two-year statute of limitations. <em>Montells v. Haynes, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>282, 291-95, 627 A.2d 654 (1993). <em>See also Shepherd v. Hunterdon Developmental Ctr., </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>1, 23, <em>803 </em>A.2d 611 (2002). However, claims arising before the two-year period may be valid under the \u201ccontinuing violation\u201d doctrine. \u201c[A] plaintiff may pursue a claim for discriminatory conduct if he or she can demonstrate that each asserted act by a defendant is part of a pattern and at least one of those acts occurred within the statutory limitations period.\u201d Id. at 6-7, 803 A.2d 611 (citing <em>West v. Philadelphia Elec. Co., </em>45 F.3d 744, 754-55 (3d Cir.1995)). <em>See also Wilson v. Wal-Mart Stores, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>263, 272, 729 A.2d 1006 (1999).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-6\">To establish a \u201ccontinuing violation\u201d based on a series of discriminatory acts, a plaintiff must show that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-7\">(1) at least one allegedly discriminatory act occurred within the filing period and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-8\">(2) the discrimination is \u201cmore than the occurrence of isolated or sporadic acts of intentional discrimination\u201d and is instead a continuing pattern of discrimination.

However, the question before us is whether ongoing discriminatory pay disparities during the period constitute \u201ccontinuous violations\u201d so that plaintiffs may recover beyond the limitations period based on paychecks received during the period. Plaintiff analogous this matter to a \u201chostile work environment\u201d case.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">In a 1977 case involving gender-based discriminatory pay, we determined that \u201cthe act of discrimination was a continuing one\u201d in a matter in which the Division on Civil Rights concluded each \u201cpay period constituted a new or another violation.\u201d <em>Decker v.

We affirmed the Law Division\u2019s dismissal of the complaint, but the Supreme Court reversed us based on the \u201ccontinuing violation\u201d doctrine. The Court adopted the United States Supreme Court\u2019s formula for the \u201ccontinuing violation\u201d doctrine in \u201chostile work environment\u201d cases, as set forth in <em>Morgan, supra, </em>536 <em>U.S. </em>at 115-18, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2073-75, 153 L.Ed.2d at 123-25, stating that \u201cdiscrete acts\u201d of discrimination such as failures to promote, transfer denials and refusals to hire, constitute separately actionable practices such that the limitations period begins to run \u201con the day that it happens.\u201d <em>Shepherd, supra, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>at 19, 803 A.2d 611 (citations omitted). Justice Verniero relied on <em>Morgan, supra, </em>536 <em>U.S. </em>at 115, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2073-74, 153 L.Ed.2d at 123, for \u201cthe distinction between a \u2018hostile work environment\u2019 and a claim based on a \u2018discrete act:\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\">Hostile environment claims are different in kind from \u201cdiscrete acts.\u201d Their very nature involves repeated conduct.

Such claims are based on the cumulative effect of individual acts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-6\"><em>[Shepherd, supra, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>at 19, 803 A.2d 611 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">In adopting the United States Supreme Court\u2019s \u201canalytical framework,\u201d the <em>Shepherd </em>Court further noted that, while in general, \u201cfederal case law is merely a guide,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 20, 803 A.2d 611, \u201c[t]here [ ] [wa]s a benefit in having our State jurisprudence mirror the approach taken in <em>Morgan </em>to avoid further confusion in an already complicated area of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21, 803 A.2d 611. Hence, the Court found that the cause of action in <em>Shepherd </em>\u201caccrued on the date of the last act in the pattern or series of acts that comprise[d] the \u2018continuing violation\u2019 claim.\u201d <em>Shepherd, supra, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>at 21-22, 803 A.2d 611. Accordingly, \u201ca victim\u2019s knowledge of a claim [was] insufficient to start the limitations clock so long as the defendant continuefd] the series of non-discrete acts on which the claim as a whole [was] based.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 22, 803 A.2d 611. Thus, the \u201chostile work environment\u201d claims were not barred and presented claims for the jury to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">Unlike the <em>Shepherd </em>plaintiffs, the plaintiffs here did not specifically allege a \u201chostile work environment.\u201d Rather, they alleged incidents of pay discrimination on the basis of age and gender, which they contend continued into the limitations period by virtue of the paychecks resulting from those decisions. Hence, we look to federal pay discrimination cases as a \u201cguide.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20, 803 A.2d 611.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">In <em>Bazemore v. Friday, </em>478 <em>U.S. </em>385, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>3000, 92 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>315 (1986), the United States Supreme Court considered a wage claim for disparate treatment brought by employees who were originally segregated into a \u201cNegro branch\u201d of the North Carolina Extension Service within the School of Agriculture of North Carolina State University. <em>Id. </em>at 389-91, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3003-04, 92 L.Ed.2d at 324-25. The \u201cNegro branch\u201d was eventually merged with the \u201cwhite branch,\u201d but pay disparities based on the segregated system continued, even after the employer became covered by Title VII. <em>Id. </em>at 1390-91, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3004, 92 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 325. In Justice Brennan\u2019s concurrence, joined by all members of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>Court,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Court noted that the fact that the employer \u201cdiscriminated with respect to salaries <em>prior </em>to the time it was covered by Title VII does not excuse perpetuating that discrimination <em>after </em>[it] became covered by Title VII.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 395, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3006, 92 L.Ed.2d at 328. Thus, it determined that \u201c[a] pattern or practice that would have constituted a violation of Title VII, but for the fact that the statute had not yet become effective, became a violation upon Title VU\u2019s effective date, and to the extent an employer continued to engage in that act or practice, [it] is liable.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Court went on to find that \u201c[e]ach week\u2019s paycheck that delivered] less to a black than to a similarly situated white\u201d was \u201ca wrong actionable under Title VII.\u201d <em>Ibid. See also Cardenas v. Massey, </em>269 F.3d 251, 255-57 (3d Cir.2001) (referring to discriminatory wage payments as \u201ccontinuing violation,\u201d and \u201cstatute of limitations begins to run on the date of the last occurrence of discrimination, rather than the first\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">However, the Supreme Court recently addressed the issue of discriminatory pay disparities again in <em>Ledbetter, supra, </em>550 <em>U.S. </em>at 621, 127 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2165, 167 L.Ed.2d at 988, in which it stated that \u201ca pay-setting decision is a \u2018discrete act\u2019 \u201d sufficient to trigger the limitations period. In <em>Ledbetter, </em>the plaintiff was employed by the defendant in its Alabama plant from 1979 until 1998. She alleged that, due to unfair performance evaluations, she suffered pay discrimination on the basis of her gender throughout the duration of her employment. <em>Id. </em>at 621-22, 127 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2165-66, 167 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d at 988-89. She filed a Title VII action, and asserted that each paycheck was a separate act of discrimination, <em>id. </em>at 624, 127 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2167, 167 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>982, and that the 1998 decision denying her a raise perpetrated intentionally discriminatory decisions from prior years. <em>Ibid. </em>As in this case, Goodyear argued that the plaintiffs claims were \u201cbarred with respect to all pay decisions made prior to\u201d the commencement of the limitations period. <em>Id. </em>at 622, 127 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2166, 167 L.Ed.2d at 989. Howev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>er, rather than assert that her employer acted with specific discriminatory intent during the limitations period, the plaintiff contended that \u201cif she had been evaluated in a non-discriminatory manner <em>prior to </em>the [ ] period!,]\u201d her paychecks would have been larger during the period. <em>Id. </em>at 624, 127 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2167, 167 L.Ed.2d 982.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The <em>Ledbetter </em>Court determined that precedent prohibited a finding that a discrimination charge could survive if based on a discriminatory act occurring outside of the limitations period if only the effects of that discrimination continued into the period. <em>Id. </em>at 625, 127 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2167, <em>167 L.Ed.2d </em>at 990. It explained that in <em>Evans </em>it noted \u201cthat the continuing effects of the precharging period discrimination did not make out a present violation!,]\u201d <em>Evans, supra, </em>431 <em>U.S. </em>at 558, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1889, 52 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 578. <em>Ledbetter, supra, </em>550 <em>U.S. </em>at 625, 127 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2168, 167 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 991. The <em>Ledbetter </em>Court then stated that \u201c \u2018[a] discriminatory act which is not made the basis of a timely charge ... is merely an unfortunate event in history which has no present legal consequences.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 625-26, 127 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2168, 167 L.Ed.2d at 991 (quoting <em>Evans, supra, </em>431 <em>U.S. </em>at 558, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>1885, 52 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>571). The Court noted that the plaintiff failed to assert either the existence of any \u201cintentionally discriminatory conduct\u201d during the limitations period \u201cor that discriminatory decisions that occurred prior to that period were not communicated to her.\u201d <em>Ledbetter, supra, </em>550 <em>U.S. </em>at 628, 127 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2169, 167 L.Ed.2d at 992. She argued instead that the paychecks she received during the limitations period \u201cgave present effect to discriminatory conduct outside of that period,\u201d an assertion which the Court found could not \u201cbreathe life into prior, uncharged discrimination.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>According to Justice Alito for the majority:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-7\">A new violation does not occur, and a new charging period does not commence, upon the occurrence of subsequent non[-]diseriminatory acts that entail adverse effects resulting from the past discrimination. But of course, if an employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>engages in a series of acts each of which is intentionally discriminatory, then a fresh violation takes place when each act is committed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-4\"><em>[Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Morgan, </em>536 <em>U.S. </em>at 113, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>2061).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">In other words, the Court found that the discriminatory intent of time barred prior acts cannot be combined with the effects of the prior discrimination, to \u201cimpose liability in the absence of the requisite intent.\u201d <em>Ledbetter, supra, </em>550 <em>U.S. </em>at 629, 127 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2170, <em>167 </em>L.Ed.2d at 993.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The <em>Ledbetter </em>Court also discussed <em>Bazemore, supra, </em>478 <em>U.S. </em>at 385, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3000, 92 L.Ed.2d at 315, at length, interpreting its holding to mean that \u201cwhen an employer adopts a facially discriminatory pay structure that puts some employees on a lower scale because of race, the employer engages in intentional discrimination whenever it issues a check to one of these disfavored employees.\u201d <em>Ledbetter, supra, </em>550 <em>U.S. </em>at 634, 127 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2173, 167 L.Ed.2d at 996. Thus, so long as a discriminatory pay structure is adopted and retained, continued use of that structure equates with continued discrimination. <em>Ibid. </em>Stated differently, an existing salary structure \u201cis illegal if it is a mere continuation of [a] discriminatory pay structure.\u201d <em>Bazemore, supra, </em>478 <em>U.S. </em>at 397 n. 6, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3006 n. 6, 92 L.Ed.2d at 329 n. 6. However, the Ledbetter Court distinguished <em>Bazemore </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-7\"><em>Bazemore </em>stands for the proposition that an employer violates Title VII and triggers a new EEOC charging period whenever the employer issues paychecks using a discriminatory pay structure. But a new Title VII violation does not occur and a new charging period is not triggered when an employer issues paychecks pursuant to a system that is \u201cfacially non[-]discriminatory and neutrally applied.\u201d The fact that [the] precharging period discrimination adversely affects the calculation of a neutral factor (like seniority) that is used in determining future pay does not mean that each new paycheck constitutes a new violation and restarts the EEOC charging period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-8\"><em>[Ledbetter, supra, </em>550 <em>U.S. </em>at 637, 127 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2174, 167 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 998 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">Because the plaintiff in <em>Ledbetter </em>was unable to provide evidence that her employer\u2019s pay system was adopted \u201cin order to discriminate\u201d or that it applied the system \u201cto her within the charging period with any discriminatory animus,\u201d paychecks issued during the charging period were merely the effect of discrim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>inatory acts that occurred outside the period and, therefore, did not support a timely cause of action. <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, the Court refused to adopt the rule attributed to the dissent that would allow a plaintiff to bring a claim based on \u201ca single discriminatory pay decision made [twenty] years ago [that] continued to affect [the] employee\u2019s pay\u201d during the limitations period. <em>Id. </em>at 639, 127 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2175, 167 L.Ed.2d at 999.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">As our Supreme Court has followed Title VII jurisprudence in interpreting our LAD, we follow the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Ledbetter </em>in this similar pay discrimination case. If each new paycheck stemming from an out-of-time discriminatory act constituted a new violation, there would be no meaningful statute of limitations so long as the plaintiffs were being paid. As in <em>Ledbetter, </em>plaintiffs do not allege \u201cdiscrete acts\u201d of discrimination within the limitations period. Nor, as in <em>Bazemore, </em>do they allege facial or intentional discrimination when the disparity began. Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint on statute of limitations grounds. However, that does not end this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Significantly, in response to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ledbetter, </em>Congress amended Title VII to include provisions known as the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 (FPA). It provides that \u201can unlawful employment practice [ ] with respect to ... compensation [occurs] ... when a discriminatory compensation decision or other practice is adopted, when an individual becomes subject to a discriminatory compensation decision or other practice, or when an individual is affected by application of a discriminatory compensation decision or other practice, including each time wages, benefits, or other compensation [are] paid, resulting in whole or in part from such a decision or other practice.\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A). Congress also allowed for \u201crecovery of back pay for up to two years preceding the filing of the charge, where the unlawful employment practices that have occurred during the charge filing period are similar or related to unlawful employment practices with regard to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>discrimination in compensation that occurred outside the time for filing a charge.\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">The three counts of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint are premised on LAD, but plaintiffs may well benefit from the federal FPA that did not exist when the complaint was dismissed. We recognize that as our LAD cases follow federal Title VII jurisprudence only as a \u201cguide,\u201d <em>Shepherd, supra, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>at 20, 803 A.2d 611, and our <em>pre-Ledbetter </em>eases can be read to support plaintiffs\u2019 contentions. Hence, there is some merit for the proposition that we should not follow <em>Ledbetter.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>However, we believe that we would be more faithful to our state jurisprudence by following <em>Ledbetter, </em>particularly in the absence of a <em>post-Ledbetter </em>amendment to LAD. We thus follow Title VII and LAD jurisprudence as it stood at all relevant times because no amendments have been made to the LAD which would affect its construction at the time when <em>Ledbetter </em>was decided. <em>See also Alliance v. Renaissance Enterprises, </em>371 <em>N.J.Super </em>409, 422-23, 853 A.2d 334 (App.Div.2004), <em>aff'd, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>339, 886 A.2d 629 (2005) (\u201cthere is a distinction between a continuing effect [of a \u2018prior violation\u2019] and a \u2018continuing violation\u2019 and to treat them as synonymous is to disregard any period of limitations.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b604-12\"> Plaintiffs moved to dismiss the balance of the complaint because the order \"effectively dismisses the entire [c]omplaint since nothing remains to be pursued. No 'discrete acts' of discrimination are alleged during the statute of limitations period.\u201d The order therefore states the \"[c]omplaint [] relate[s] to wage decisions made prior to July 27, 2005, or have been remedied by wage adjustments made at or after the filing of the complaint.\" Thus, there is no issue of finality caused by the voluntary dismissal of part of the complaint. <em>Cf. Grow Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>Chokshi, </em>403 <em>N.J.Super. </em>443, 457-61, 959 A.2d 252 (App.Div.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b605-8\"> Because the individual defendants are all Seton Hall officials, we refer to all defendants as Seton Hall or defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b607-8\"> At oral argument before us, plaintiffs candidly and appropriately acknowledged that this was not a \"discovery rule\u201d case as they had information concerning the alleged discrimination more than two years before the complaint was filed. <em>See e.g., Lopez v.
