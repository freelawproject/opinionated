Defendants National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburg, PA (National Union) and its parent company, American International Group, Inc. (collectively, AIG defendants) appeal the Law Division\u2019s order denying AIG defendants\u2019 motion to compel arbitration of plaintiff EPIX Holdings Corporation\u2019s (EPIX or plaintiff) antitrust and common law claims in a pending lawsuit, based on an arbitration clause in a \u201cPayment Agreement\u201d executed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>between EPIX and National Union. For the following reasons, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">EPIX is a professional employer organization (PEO) that contracts with small businesses to provide payroll services and other benefits, including workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage, generally offering lower insurance rates due to the economies of scale attained by pooling many employees into one large group within the PEO. In September 2000, EPIX retained Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as its exclusive broker-agent and advisor to secure workers\u2019 compensation coverage for EPIX and its nearly 50,000 worksite employees and 3,000 small business customers at the best rate and coverage available in the marketplace. During the 2000 and 2001 policy years, EPIX\u2019s primary workers\u2019 compensation insurance provider was Hartford Underwriters Insurance Company (Hartford). According to EPIX, in June 2002, less than ninety days before their expiration, Hartford unexpectedly gave notice that it was declining to renew its workers\u2019 compensation insurance policies with EPIX for the 2002 policy year. With no alternative plan in the works, on July 26, 2002, Marsh finalized negotiations with AIG for EPIX\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy and premium for the 2002 policy year.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Thereafter, on August 29, 2002, AIG Risk Management, Inc. (AIGRM), an AIG subsidiary, issued a Binder Letter to Marsh, and EPIX immediately commenced making payment on the insurance policy that went into effect on September 1, 2002.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The document, which was not signed by either EPIX or Marsh, quoted the annual and monthly premiums and provided that payments were due on the fifteenth of each month of the policy year. In addition, the letter included formulas for monthly premium adjustments and loss provision annual adjustments as well as the collateral requirement of $15 million. Further, AIG reserved the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>right to modify and amend the list of undesirable class codes (of the employees covered under the workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy) \u201con a going forward basis.\u201d Significantly, for present purposes, the Binder Letter explicitly required execution of a more detailed Payment Agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-4\">You must execute and return an original executed copy of both the Payment Agreement and the Schedule, and any other documents we deem necessary to adequately document the terms of the program, to us at our address shown above within 30 days after the Effective Date above or 30 days after the date of the Underwriter\u2019s signature hereon, whichever is later.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Failure to execute the Payment Agreement allowed National Union, with whom AIG placed the insurance policy, to void the \u201cFinance Plan\u201d summarized in the Binder Letter, making the entire amount of the \u201cEstimated Total Cost\u201d immediately due and payable to National Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">The Payment Agreement was executed by EPIX and National Union, \u201con behalf of itself and its affiliates,\u201d in February 2003, but made effective as of September 2002. The agreement expressly set forth in detail the terms and conditions of EPIX\u2019s payment obligation, including the \u201cpremiums and premium surcharges\u201d payable for the workers\u2019 compensation policies and described the \u201ccollateral,\u201d including letters of credit, EPIX was required to deliver. In a section entitled \u201cWhat have you and we agreed to?\u201d, the Payment Agreement expressly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-7\">We have agreed to the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-8\">\u2014 to provide <em>You </em>insurance and services according to the <em>Policies </em>and other agreements; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-9\">\u2014 to extend credit to <em>You </em>by deferring our demand for full payment of the entire amount of <em>Your Payment Obligation </em>if <em>You </em>make partial payments according to this <em>Agreement.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-10\">To induce us to agree as above,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-11\"><em>You </em>have agreed to the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-12\">\u2014 to pay us all <em>Your Payment Obligation </em>and to perform all <em>Your </em>other obligations according to this Agreement and <em>Schedule </em>for all entities covered by the <em>Policies.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-13\">\u2014 to provide us with collateral according to this Agreement and <em>Schedule.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-14\">The Payment Agreement also contained an arbitration clause providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>HOW WILL DISAGREEMENTS BE RESOLVED?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">What if we disagree about payment due?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">If You disagree with us about any amount of Your Payment Obligation that we have asked You to pay, within the time allowed for payment You must:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-8\">\u2014 give us written particulars about the items with which You disagree; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-9\">\u2014 pay those items with which You do not disagree____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-10\">What about disputes other than disputes about payment due?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-11\">Any other unresolved dispute arising out of this Agreement must be submitted to arbitration....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">The arbitration clause also provides that \u201carbitration must be governed by the United States Arbitration Act,\u201d and that the arbitrators would have \u201cexclusive jurisdiction over the entire matter in dispute, including any question as to arbitrability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Av9\">On August 20, 2008, plaintiff sued AIG,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> National Union, Hartford,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Marsh, alleging various claims arising from this transaction under the New Jersey Antitrust Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:9-3\u2014 including restraint of trade, price-fixing, unfair business practices, civil conspiracy, commercial bribery, and unjust enrichment\u2014as well as common law claims against Marsh for breaches of contract and fiduciary duty, professional negligence, negligent misrepresentation, and fraud.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The gravamen of plaintiffs action, as described in the first fifteen paragraphs of its 60-page, 208-paragraph complaint, concerned an alleged elaborate conspiracy among the AIG, Hartford, and Marsh defendants to \u201cmanipulate the market for insurance\u201d and rig the bidding on its 2002 and 2003 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>workers\u2019 compensation insurance policies, thereby enabling the AIG defendants to charge \u201cinflated premiums\u201d and impose \u201conerous terms\u201d \u201cwith inadequate coverage.\u201d Pursuant to this scheme, Hartford submitted a false and contrived \u201cB quote\u201d in June 2002 \u201cto deceive EPIX into believing the AIG\u2019s July 2002 premium quote was fair and reasonable\u201d in comparison. Marsh, acting in concert with AIG and Hartford, obtained Hartford\u2019s renewal quote for the 2002 policy year supposedly in exchange for kickbacks that AIG had agreed to pay Marsh pursuant to \u201ca confidential contingent commission agreement\u201d between the three defendants. This scheme was designed \u201cto cause Marsh to steer business to [AIG and Hartford] and not others, and to shield them from fair competition at fair prices in the market place.\u201d Consequently, according to plaintiff, negotiations for the quote were completed on July 26, 2002, resulting in EPIX paying \u201cmore in premiums, costs and letters of credit than it would have paid in the absence of this conduct,\u201d and thus sustaining \u201csubstantial damages.\u201d Based on these allegations, plaintiff sought, <em>inter alia, </em>disgorgement \u201cof all premiums paid by EPIX ... over and above the fair and competitive premium price for the [workers\u2019 compensation] Insurance provided by AIG to EPIX during this time period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">After answering plaintiffs complaint, AIG moved to compel arbitration, to which EPIX objected. Following argument, the Law Division judge denied the motion, holding that AIG lacked standing to enforce the arbitration clause because it was not a party to the Payment Agreement and that, in any event, EPIX\u2019s dispute with defendants was not within the scope of the arbitration clause. We granted AIG\u2019s motion for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Plaintiff argued below that AIG lacked the requisite standing to compel arbitration because AIG was not a party to the Payment Agreement that contained the arbitration clause. In challenging the court\u2019s threshold ruling on its lack of standing, AIG now argues that plaintiff should be equitably estopped from avoiding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>arbitration because its allegations against AIG are intertwined with the Payment Agreement and with plaintiffs allegations against National Union, a signatory to that document, with whom AIG is clearly aligned. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">It is clear that in certain situations, a non-signatory to an arbitration agreement may compel a signatory to arbitrate. <em>Arthur Andersen LLP v. Carlisle, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>-, 129 <em>S.Ct. </em>1896, 1901, 173 L.Ed.2d 832, 839 (2009); <em>Angrisani v. Fin. Tech.

Since arbitration agreements are analyzed under traditional principles of state law, such principles \u201callow a contract to be enforced by or against nonparties to the contract through \u2018assumption, piercing the corporate veil, alter ego, incorporation by reference, third-party beneficiary theories, waiver and estoppel\u2019----\u201d <em>Arthur Andersen, LLP, supra, </em>129 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1902, 173 L.Ed.2d at 840 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">New Jersey law recognizes non-signatory standing to compel arbitration based on the principle of equitable estoppel. <em>See Bruno, supra, </em>388 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 548, 909 A.2d 768. The estoppel inquiry is fact specific, <em>JLM Indus., Inc. v. Stolt-Nielsen, </em>S.A., 387 F.3d 163, 178 (2d Cir.2004), but usually involves an analysis of the connection between the claim, the arbitration agreement and the parties. <em>Id. </em>at 177; <em>J.J. Ryan &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Rhone Poulenc Textile, S.A., </em>863 <em>F.2d </em>315, 320-21 (4th Cir.1988). Thus, we have recently cited with approval <em>JLM Indus., supra, </em>387 F.3d at 177-78, which held that a \u201cnon-signatory to [an] arbitration agreement may compel [a] signatory to arbitrate when [the] issues to be litigated are intertwined with [the] agreement containing [the] arbitration clause.\u201d <em>Bruno, supra, </em>388 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 548, 909 A.2d 768.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>In <em>Bruno, </em>homebuyers, claiming the heating units in their homes did not work properly, brought a class action suit against the developer, but that suit was dismissed because the parties\u2019 contract mandated arbitration. <em>Id. </em>at 542, 909 A.2d 768. The homebuyers then sued the subcontractors with whom they had no contractual relationship. <em>Ibid. </em>We affirmed the Law Division\u2019s dismissal of that complaint as well, holding that although the plaintiffs did not have a contractual relationship with the defendant subcontractors, their claims \u201cpresent the same factual allegations\u201d as against the developer and arise directly out of their contracts with the developer, which contain broad arbitration provisions, and as such \u201care estopped from avoiding arbitration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 548, 909 A.2d 768.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Our holding in <em>Bruno </em>is consistent with federal case law interpreting the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1 to -16. <em>See JLM Indus., supra, </em>387 F.3d at 177-78; <em>Choctaw Generation Ltd.

The plaintiffs brought a putative class action suit against the parent/owner shipping companies alleging a conspiracy to fix freight rates for ocean transportation of liquid chemicals via parcel tanks, in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. <em>Id. </em>at 168. The court held that the arbitration clauses within the contracts between the plaintiff and the subsidiaries could be enforced by the parent corporations. <em>Id. </em>at 177. In so holding, the court rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 counterargument that \u201cthe conspiratorial conduct giving rise to the claims in this ease was conduct of the parent companies rather than the contracting subsidiaries.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Rather, the Court reasoned that under principles of estoppel, non-signatory standing to enforce an agreement to arbitrate exists \u201cwhere a careful review of \u2018the relationship among the parties, the contracts they signed ..., and the issues that had arisen\u2019 among them disclose that \u2018the issues the non-signatory is seeking to resolve in arbitration are intertwined with that agreement that the estopped party has signed.\u2019\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Choctaw Generation Ltd. P\u2019ship, supra, </em>271 F.3d at 406 (holding that the \u201ctight relatedness of the parties, contracts and controversies\u201d was sufficient to estop the party bound by the arbitration clause from avoiding arbitration)); <em>see also Smith/Enron Cogeneration Ltd. P\u2019ship, Inc. v. Smith Cogeneration Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>198 A.3d 88, 98 (2d Cir.1999) (holding that a party was estopped from avoiding arbitration with a non-signatory because it had treated non-signatory companies and their signatory assignees \u201cas a single unit\u201d in its complaint in a related lawsuit).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">As a matter of both federal and state law, the principle of equitable estoppel has been invoked, under appropriate circumstances, to force an objecting signatory to arbitrate the same claims against a non-signatory as alleged against the other party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>to the contract. But even where the inextricable connectivity was not considered itself dispositive of the issue, the combination of the requisite nexus of the claim to the contract <em>together with </em>the integral relationship between the non-signatory and the other contracting party was recognized as a sufficient basis to invoke estoppel. <em>Angrisani, supra, </em>402 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 154, 952 A.2d 1140. <em>Cf. E.I. Dupont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. Rhone Poulenc Fiber &amp; Resin Intermediates, S.A.S., </em>269 F.3d 187, 202 (3d Cir.2001) (\u201cThe distinction between signatories and non-signatories is important to ensure that short of piercing the corporate veil, a court does not ignore the corporate form of a non-signatory based solely on the interrelatedness of the claims alleged.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">In <em>Angrisani, supra, </em>although we cited the equally controlling principle that \u201ca party can be forced to arbitrate only those issues it specifically has agreed to submit to arbitration,\u201d 402 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 143, 952 A.2d 1140, we nevertheless acknowledged those cases in which arbitration was compelled where a non-signatory to the contract is closely aligned to a contracting party, such as a parent or successor corporation, <em>id. </em>at 154, 952 A.2d 1140, or enjoys a principal-agent relationship therewith. <em>Alfano, supra, </em>393 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 569, 925 A.2d 22. As to the latter, in <em>Alfano, </em>we required arbitration of an investor\u2019s claim against Deutsche Bank AG (DB) and its subsidiary, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. (DBSI), pursuant to an arbitration clause in a Customer Account Agreement between the investor and DBSI, on the basis that DBSI was acting as DB\u2019s agent and broker in carrying out the transactions with its customer. <em>Id. </em>at 569-70, 925 A.2d 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">In other cases, courts have compelled arbitration of claims against a non-signatory who is either a parent or successor corporation to a signatory party to an agreement containing an arbitration clause. <em>See, e.g., Sunkist Soft Drinks v. Sunkist Growers, Inc., </em>10 F.3d 753 (11th Cir.1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 <em>U.S. </em>869, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>190, 130 <em>L.Ed. </em>2d 123 (1994) (holding that where the original signatory to a license agreement was later acquired and became a part of the parent corporation and there was a nexus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>between the plaintiffs claims and the license agreement, the plaintiff was equitably estopped from avoiding arbitration with the parent corporation); <em>Singer v. Commodities Corp., </em>292 <em>N.J.Super. </em>391, 411-15, 678 A.2d 1165 (App.Div.1996) (holding that a securities broker who signed an employment agreement under which he was required to submit any employment-related dispute could be compelled to arbitrate an employment-related claim against a successor employer (the parent corporation of the original employer) which had not been a signatory to the agreement containing the arbitration provision).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">In yet other cases, courts have concluded that a non-signatory may compel arbitration where the estopped plaintiff either specifically pleaded that the non-signatory and signatories conspired together, <em>Amato v. KPMG, LLP, </em>433 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>460, 485-87 (M.D.Pa.2006), <em>vacated in part on other grounds, </em>No. 06cv39, 2006 WL 2376245, 2006 U.S. Dist. Lexis 57091, (M.D.Pa. Aug. 14, 2006), or otherwise treated the non-signatory affiliate of a signatory \u201cas if it were a signatory.\u201d <em>Astra Oil Co. v. Rover Navigation, Ltd., </em>344 <em>F.</em>3d 276, 280 (2d Cir.2003). <em>See also Smith/Enron Cogeneration Ltd. P\u2019ship, Inc., supra, </em>198 <em>F.3d </em>at 98 (holding that the party attempting to resist arbitration was estopped from doing so because it had treated arguably non-signatory companies and their signatory assignees \u201cas a single unit\u201d in its complaint in a related lawsuit).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Here, all the factors favoring estoppel are present. AIG, as parent corporation, is clearly aligned to its wholly-owned subsidiary National Union. Moreover, EPIX\u2019s claims against AIG are identical to its claims against National Union. Indeed, plaintiffs complaint refers to them collectively and interchangeably,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and does not contain a single factual allegation that specifies any acts that were purportedly performed by one and not the other. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>To the contrary, EPIX alleges that the purported wrongful conduct by AIG resulted in inflated premiums being charged for the workers\u2019 compensation insurance provided by National Union, and we find that their conduct is therefore substantially interconnected.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Most significant, EPIX\u2019s claims are bound up with the Payment Agreement to which EPIX and National Union are parties. Although explained more fully <em>infra </em>(see Part II at 469-76), suffice it to say, EPIX\u2019s claim against AIG that \u201cits financial instability [was] caused by the [workers\u2019 compensation] Insurance coverage terms which required EPIX to pledge substantial cash and letters of credit to [National Union and AIG],\u201d is inextricably intertwined with the Payment Agreement, which defines EPIX\u2019s payment obligations, including its obligation to pay the premium and furnish letters of credit. Had EPIX not purchased workers\u2019 compensation insurance and entered into the Payment Agreement by which it undertook those payment obligations, no cause of action against the AIG defendants would have arisen. Given the integral relationship between AIG and National Union, the identity of plaintiffs claims against both, and further, the close nexus of plaintiffs claims with the Payment Agreement, we conclude, on the basis of estoppel, that AIG has standing as a non-signatory to compel arbitration of plaintiffs claims against both AIG and National Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Having concluded AIG has standing to compel arbitration, we next consider whether plaintiffs price-fixing and related common law claims against AIG and National Union fall within the scope of the arbitration clause of the Payment Agreement. In arguing against enforcement, plaintiff first contends that the operative document is actually the August 26, 2002 Binder Letter, as it establishes the parties\u2019 obligations to each other, rather than the February 2003 Payment Agreement, which merely creates an optional finance plan. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>\u201c[T]he textbook understanding of binder is \u2018[a] temporary contract of insurance ... intended to give the applicant protection pending the execution and delivery of a formal written policy.\u2019 \u201d <em>AGF Marine Aviation &amp; Transp. v.

Indeed, \u201c[t]he binder merges into the subsequently issued insurance contract; where there is any conflict or ambiguity between the binder and the contract, the latter will govern.\u201d <em>Appleman on Insurance, </em>\u00a7 55.1, <em>supra, </em>at 232; <em>see also Couch </em>\u00a7 13:8, <em>supra, </em>at 13-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Here, the Binder Letter, which was not signed by either EPIX or Marsh, its exclusive broker, nor AIGRM or National Union on behalf of the AIG defendants, not only contemplated but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>expressly required execution of a subsequent Payment Agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-4\">You must execute and return an original executed copy of both the Payment Agreement and the Schedule, and any other documents we deem necessary to adequately document the terms of the program____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">The Payment Agreement and its attached schedules govern the relationship between insurer and client, provide detailed financial information specific to the client and policy issued, define necessary terms, establish reporting requirements, fix the terms and schedules of payment, specify the consequences of default, and mandate arbitration of disputes. Clearly then, the Binder Letter here, like insurance binders in general, is simply an interim contract, lacking all of the terms of the agreement to insure, and intended to be effective only until execution of the more detailed and complete Payment Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">Having established the Payment Agreement as the operative document, we now address whether its arbitration clause\u2014 providing \u201c[a]ny other disputes <em>arising out </em>of this Agreement must be submitted to arbitration\u201d\u2014is broad enough to encompass the disputes here in issue. Initially we note that the Payment Agreement provides that its arbitration clause is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1 to -16. The FAA, however, \u201csimply requires courts to enforce privately negotiated agreements to arbitrate, like other contracts, in accordance with their terms.\u201d <em>Volt Info. Scis., Inc. v. Bd. of Trs. of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., </em>489 <em>U.S. </em>468, 478, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>1248, 1255, 103 L.Ed.2d 488, 500 (1989). To ascertain the existence and scope of an agreement to arbitrate, courts apply state contract principles. \u201c[I]n applying general state-law principles of contract interpretation to the interpretation of an arbitration agreement within the scope of the [Federal Arbitration] Act ... due regard must be given to the federal policy favoring arbitration, and ambiguities as to the scope of the arbitration clause itself resolved in favor of arbitration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 475-76, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1254, <em>103 L.Ed.2d </em>at 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>New Jersey codified its endorsement of arbitration agreements in the Arbitration Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:24-1 to -11, now codified as <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:23B-1 to \u201432,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which, like its federal counterpart, provides that agreements to arbitrate shall be valid save for \u201csuch grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of a contract.\u201d <em>Hojnowski v.

Embracing the federal policy, New Jersey courts have recognized a \u201cstrong public policy favors \u2018arbitration as a means of dispute resolution\u2019 and requires \u2018liberal construction of contracts in favor of arbitration.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bruno, supra, </em>388 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 545, 909 A.2d 768 (citing <em>Young v. The Prudential Ins.

Cone Mem\u2019l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., </em>460 <em>U.S. </em>1, 24-25, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>927, 941, 74 L.Ed.2d 765, 785 (1983). In determining whether a dispute falls within the scope of an arbitration clause, courts operate under a \u201c \u2018presumption of arbitrability in the sense that an order to arbitrate the particular grievance should not be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Caldwell v. KFC Corp., </em>958 <em>F.Supp. </em>962, 973 (D.N.J.1997) (citing <em>AT &amp; T Techs. v.

McKendry, </em>233 F.3d 720, 727 (3d Cir.2000). <em>See also Bleumer v. Parkway Ins. Co., </em>277 <em>N.J.Super. </em>378, 403, 649 A.2d 913 (Law Div.1994) (The arbitration clause \u201cin requiring arbitration of \u2018[a]ny dispute ... regarding this agreement,\u2019 is very broadly worded.\u201d). In <em>Sweet Dreams Unlimited, Inc. v. Dial-A-Mattress Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>the court interpreted an arbitration clause applying to disputes \u201carising out of the agreement\u201d as including \u201cany dispute between the contracting parties that is in any way connected with their contract.\u201d 1 F.3d 639, 642 (7th Cir.1993). Such an expansive interpretation is generally given to the phrase \u201carising out of.\u201d <em>Medtronic AVE Inc. v. Cordis Corp., </em>100 <em>Fed.Appx. </em>865, 868 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">In fact, EPIX acknowledges the breadth of the instant arbitration clause and even conceded at oral argument that, if contained in the Binder Letter, the clause would have covered the dispute in question. Nevertheless, EPIX maintains that because AIG\u2019s alleged wrongful conduct preceded execution of the Payment Agreement, plaintiffs derivative claims do not fall within the scope of the arbitration clause\u2019s \u201carising out of\u2019 provision. The motion judge agreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-7\">[I]t has nothing to do with the policy. It has nothing to do with the coverage. It has nothing to do with the\u2014with the payments of any of the amounts that were due and owing____ The gravamen of the complaint here occurred back in July and August of 2002. Now the contract was retroactive to September 1st, but that was even after this supposedly nefarious conduct took place.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">Our standard of review of the applicability and scope of an arbitration agreement is plenary. <em>Harris v. Green Tree Fin. Corp., </em>183 F.3d 173, 176 (3d Cir.1999). Moreover, in determining the scope of an arbitration agreement, a court must \u201cfocus on the factual allegations in the complaint rather than the legal causes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>action asserted.\u201d <em>Genesco, Inc. v. T. Kakiuchi &amp; Co., </em>815 <em>F.</em>2d 840, 846 (2d Cir.1987). If these factual allegations \u201c \u2018touch matters\u2019 covered by the parties\u2019 contract, then those claims must be arbitrated, whatever the legal labels attached to them.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">On this score, courts have applied broad arbitration clauses to factual scenarios similar to the one at issue in this case. Thus, allegations of antitrust violations and price-fixing have been found to be within the scope of arbitration clauses similarly worded as here. <em>See, e.g., JLM, supra, </em>387 F.3d at 175-76; <em>Kan. City Urology, P.A. v. United Healthcare Servs., </em>261 S.W.3d 7, 14 (Mo.Ct.App.2008). For instance, in <em>JLM, supra, </em>the factual allegations involved a conspiracy among parcel tank owners to fix worldwide freight rates for ocean shipping services to plaintiffs, dealers in liquid chemicals. 387 F.3d at 167-68. The plaintiffs in <em>JLM </em>entered into a series of charters or standardized shipping contracts with subsidiaries of the owners, each of which specified price terms that the plaintiffs variously characterized in their class action complaint as \u201cartificially high\u201d and as \u201cover-payment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 175. Reasoning that the plaintiff dealers could not have suffered their alleged damages if they had not entered into the contract, <em>id. </em>at 175, the court held that \u201cJLM\u2019s Sherman Act claims unquestionably involve a core issue of the contracts between the parties[,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at 176, and therefore concluded \u201cthat this is a dispute arising out of the charters.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">In <em>Genesco, Inc., supra, </em>815 F.2d at 848, the court similarly concluded that an alleged conspiracy in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\u201cRICO\u201d), 18 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1962, was arbitrable. <em>Genesco </em>involved a series of purchase and sale agreements between a clothing manufacturers (Genesco) and two affiliated firms which served as Genesco\u2019s fabric suppliers. 815 F.2d at 843. The arbitration clauses at issue provided that claims \u201carising under\u201d and \u201carising out of or relating to\u201d the agreements between the parties were subject to arbitration. <em>Ibid. </em>The RICO claim rested upon an alleged conspiracy between an officer of Genesco and the defendant firms wherein the defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>overcharged Genesco over an extended period of time for damaged and obsolete piece goods it had purchased from them under the purchase and sale agreements. <em>Ibid. </em>Finding that the allegations of overcharging and intentional supply of defective goods formed the crux of the plaintiffs suit and related to the agreement between the parties, <em>id. </em>at 846, the court held that the dispute as to the existence of this conspiracy fell within the scope of the applicable arbitration clauses. <em>Id. </em>at 848.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">In <em>Kan. City Urology, P.A., supra, </em>area physicians and medical organizations sued Blue Cross and United Healthcare, with whom they entered into contracts setting the rate of reimbursement for physician and medical services, asserting that the defendants had engaged in price-fixing and monopolization in violation of state antitrust law. 261 S.W.3d at 10. In holding these claims arbitrable, the court reasoned that, although the claimed conspiracy was formed <em>independently </em>of the specific contractual relations between the parties, nonetheless:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\">the physicians assert that they have suffered damages as a result of the conspiracy, which they would not have suffered had they not agreed to reimbursement contracts with Blue Cross or United Healthcare. Hence, in that regard, the reimbursement rates in the contracts are the illegal action that Blue Cross and United Healthcare allegedly conspired to produce and are enough for us to conclude that the physicians\u2019 factual allegations touch matters covered by the parties\u2019 contracts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">[Id. at 14.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">The central factual allegation here is that defendants participated in a bid rigging scheme \u201cwith the sole purpose of enhancing their respective pecuniary interests,\u201d resulting in oppressive terms and inflated premiums charged for the workers\u2019 compensation program provided by the AIG defendants, to the detriment of plaintiff, who suffered damages and financial instability therefrom. In our view, the claims the AIG defendants seek to arbitrate not only \u201carise out of\u2019, but are undeniably intertwined with the contract between EPIX and National Union, since it is the fact of EPIX\u2019s entry into the contract containing the allegedly inflated price and other oppressive terms that gives rise to the claimed injury. To argue otherwise, as does plaintiff, that its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>price-fixing claim is not subject to arbitration because defendant\u2019s antitrust conduct occurred before execution of, and was therefore independent and distinct from, the February 2003 Payment Agreement, solely misses the point. Simply because the alleged wrongful conduct pre-dates the parties\u2019 agreement does not mean that the claimed antitrust injury is unconnected or unrelated thereto. As previously noted, were it not for its contractual relationship with National Union, plaintiff would not have suffered its alleged damages. It is difficult to conceive how plaintiff could maintain its claim for damages without reference to, and reliance upon, the underlying contract. A claim \u201cthat draws its very essence from the fact of and performance under the [Agreement] in question ... necessarily is a claim that arises out of and relates to the Agreement.\u201d <em>S+L+H. S.p.A. v. Miller-St. Nazianz, Inc., </em>988 F.2d 1518, 1524 (7th Cir.1993). Therefore, we conclude plaintiffs claim can fairly be said to \u201carise out of\u2019 the February 2003 Payment Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Even where statutory claims, as asserted here, fall within the scope of the arbitration clause, we must still determine whether the Legislature intended those claims to be non-arbitrable. That is because an agreement to arbitrate is valid under state law unless it violates public policy. <em>Cohen v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>97, 101, 555 A.2d 21 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>87, 563 A.2d 846 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">Plaintiff does not argue that its antitrust and restraint of trade claims are per se not subject to arbitration. Rather, plaintiff contends that such claims, at a minimum, require an explicit waiver of its right to pursue its statutory remedy in court, which defendants have failed to demonstrate. However, plaintiff cites nothing in the text of the New Jersey Antitrust Act or in its legislative history that suggests we should treat claims arising thereunder in a manner different than any other claims for purposes of arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Instead, plaintiff relies exclusively on <em>Garfinkel v. Morristown Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology Assocs., P.A., </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>124, 773 A.2d 665 (2001), an employment case alleging violations of the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (LAD), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-1 to 49, which embodies one of our State\u2019s strongest public policies, the eradication of workplace discrimination, <em>Dixon v. Rutgers, The State Univ., </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>432, 451, 541 A.2d 1046 (1988), and expressly grants complainants the right to a jury trial. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-13. Because the LAD\u2019s choice of forum is an integral component of the statute, the <em>Garfinkel </em>Court held that an employee\u2019s intent to surrender his or her right to a jury trial in favor or arbitration must be \u201cclearly and unmistakably established.\u201d 168 <em>N.J. </em>at 136, 773 A.2d 665 (internal citations omitted). Thus, to pass muster, \u201ca waiver of rights provision should at least provide that the employee agrees to arbitrate all statutory claims arising out of the employment relationship or its termination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 135, 773 A.2d 665.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">We have also recognized, however, that these articulated limits to otherwise broadly-worded arbitration clauses do not apply outside \u201cthe special area\u201d of a \u201cplaintiffs enforcement of statutory employment claims.\u201d <em>Alfano, supra, </em>393 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 576, 925 A.2d 22. Indeed, a party who agrees to arbitrate a statutory claim \u201cdoes not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute; it only submits their resolution in an arbitral, rather than judicial, forum.\u201d <em>Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., </em>473 <em>U.S. </em>614, 628, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>3346, 3354, 87 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>444, 456 (1985). In <em>Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., </em>the United States Supreme Court recognized that a party will be bound by its agreement to arbitrate unless \u201cCongress itself has evidenced an intention to preclude a waiver of judicial remedies for the statutory rights at issue.\u201d 500 <em>U.S. </em>20, 26, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>1647, 1652, 114 L.Ed.2d 26, 37 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">As previously noted, courts have consistently recognized that claims under the analogous Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1-7, are arbitrable. <em>See Mitsubishi Motors Corp., supra, </em>473 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number><em>U.S. </em>at 640, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3360, 87 L.Ed.2d at 463 (holding anti-trust claims arising under the Sherman Act arbitrable); <em>JLM, supra, </em>387 F.3d at 176 (holding plaintiffs Sherman Act claims arbitrable where they \u201cunquestionably involve ... allegations that the price terms set for in [the parties\u2019] contracts have been artificially inflated as a result of the price-fixing conspiracy among the Owners\u201d); <em>see also In re Universal Serv.

Galarza, </em>306 <em>N.J.Super. </em>384, 389, 703 A.2d 961 (App.Div.1997). In <em>Gras v. Ajssocs. First Capital Corp., </em>we found nothing in the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act (CFA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-1 to -106, that precluded vindication of a consumer\u2019s statutory rights in the arbitral forum. 346 <em>N.J.Super. </em>42, 52, 786 A.2d 886 (App.Div.2001), <em>certif. denied, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>445, 794 A.2d 184 (2002). In finding such claims arbitrable, we found no inherent conflict between the CFA\u2019s underlying public policy \u201cto root out consumer fraud,\u201d and the \u201ccompeting and compelling public policy favoring arbitration as a means of dispute resolution and requiring liberal construction of contracts in favor of arbitration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 53-54, 786 A.2d 886. <em>But see Rockel v.

Although its legislative history is sparse, <em>Kimmelman v.

In fact, unlike the LAD cases where the right to jury trial was essential to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>Court\u2019s requiring a clear and express waiver thereof before submitting the matter to arbitration, <em>Quigley v. KPMG Peat Marwick, LLP, </em>330 <em>N.J.Super. 252, 267, </em>749 A.2d 405 (App.Div.2000), the Antitrust \u201cAct omits any reference to a jury trial.\u201d <em>Boardwalk Properties, supra, </em>253 <em>N.J.Super, </em>at 529, 602 A.2d 733.

Accordingly, in the absence of any right to a jury trial, or other indication in New Jersey\u2019s Antitrust Act to the contrary, we conclude that plaintiff may effectively vindicate its statutory cause of action and related common law claims against the AIG defendants in the arbitral forum without an express and specific waiver of its right to judicial adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Because arbitration will not conclude the entire litigation, and its claims against Marsh and Hartford will remain pending in the Law Division, plaintiff argues against arbitration of its claims against the AIG defendants, lest it be forced to litigate in two different forums.

Under the FAA, \u201can arbitration agreement must be enforced notwithstanding the presence of other persons who are parties to the underlying dispute but not to the arbitration agreement.\u201d <em>Ibid.; see also Barrowclough v. Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., </em>752 F.2d 923, 938 (3d Cir.1985), <em>overruled on other grounds </em>by <em>Pritzker v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, </em>7 F.3d 1110 (3d Cir.1993). Accordingly, \u201cthe Arbitration Act requires district courts to compel arbitration ... when one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>the parties files a motion to compel, even where the result would be the possibly inefficient maintenance of separate proceedings in different forums.\u201d <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. v. Byrd, </em>470 <em>U.S. </em>213, 217, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>1238, 1241, 84 L.Ed.2d 158, 163 (1985). We conclude that the possible inconvenience to plaintiff is not a sufficiently compelling ground to overcome New Jersey\u2019s strong public policy favoring arbitration where the parties have expressly agreed to this method of dispute resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Although we \u201clook with disfavor upon the <em>unnecessary </em>bifurcation of disputes between judicial resolution and arbitration,\u201d <em>Garfinkel, supra, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>at 137, 773 A.2d 665 (quoting <em>Ohio Cas. &amp; Ins. Co. v. Benson, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>191, 199, 432 A.2d 905 (1981)) (emphasis added),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the parties explicit agreement to arbitrate in this ease makes bifurcation <em>necessary. </em>Indeed, our courts have routinely permitted litigation in separate forums where a plaintiff alleges claims against multiple defendants, some of whom have agreed to arbitrate their disputes and others have not, even where common questions of law and fact create significant overlap.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">For example, in <em>Alfano, supra, </em>a plaintiff investor sued his accountants, advisors, attorney and the entity in which he made the investment alleging fraud, malpractice, negligence and RICO violations, and seeking damages arising from defendants\u2019 pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>motion and implementation of a tax strategy that caused him to expend excessive fees and to incur an income tax liability. 393 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 564-65, 925 A.2d 22. The plaintiff had entered into a Customer Account Agreement with a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank AG (DB), acting as its agent in brokering the transaction wherein the plaintiff agreed to borrow funds from DB and then buy stocks and options in DB, for which he would realize more than $100 million loss to offset the gain realized from the sale of his business. <em>Ibid. </em>The Customer Account Agreement contained an arbitration clause, which the trial judge declined to enforce because DB was not a signatory to the agreement. <em>Ibid. </em>We reversed and ordered arbitration of the dispute between the plaintiff and DB, while staying the remainder of the Law Division action pending the arbitration. <em>Id. </em>at 577-78, 925 A.2d 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">In <em>Angrisani, supra, </em>the plaintiff entered into two agreements. One was a stock purchase agreement with Investor Financial Technology Ventures, L.P. (FT Ventures) and other investors to purchase the stock in the predecessor company of his employer, Nexxar Group, Inc. (Nexxar). That agreement did not contain an arbitration clause. 402 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 143-47, 952 A.2d 1140. The other contract was an employment agreement with Nexxar, under which the plaintiff was employed as its president and chief executive officer. <em>Id. </em>at 143, 952 A.2d 1140. The employment agreement contained an arbitration clause. <em>Id. </em>at 143-44, 952 A.2d 1140. Alleging that FT Ventures subsequently caused Nexxar to terminate him, the plaintiff sued both, asserting claims against FT Ventures for fraudulent misrepresentations and tortious interference with his employment contact with Nexxar, and against Nexxar for breach of contract and the duty of good faith and fair dealing. <em>Id. </em>at 144-46, 952 A.2d 1140. Both defendants moved to compel arbitration and the trial court granted the motion. <em>Id. </em>at 146, 952 A.2d 1140. Holding that a plaintiff may be required to arbitrate only those claims he has agreed to submit to arbitration, we affirmed the dismissal of the plaintiffs claims against Nexxar, which we deemed to be arbitrable, but reversed as to the claims against FT Ventures, which we remanded to the trial court. <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>156, 952 A.2d 1140. <em>See also Indus. Elecs. Corp. of Wis. v. iPower Distrib. Group, Inc., </em>215 F.3d 677, 681 (7th Cir.2000) (holding that \u201c[a] dispute that arises under one agreement may be litigated notwithstanding a mandatory arbitration clause in a second agreement, even where the two agreements are closely intertwined\u201d); <em>Bouriez v. Carnegie Mellon Univ., </em>359 F.3d 292, 295 (3d Cir.2004) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">For these reasons, we conclude that the bifurcation of claims in this case is necessitated by the arbitration clause in the Payment Agreement, which binds EPIX and the AIG defendants. We reverse the order of the Law Division denying the AIG defendants\u2019 motion to compel arbitration of plaintiffs claims against them and remand the case to the trial court for a determination whether to stay the remainder of the matter pending arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b487-7\"> Related affiliates are Marsh USA, Inc. and Marsh, Inc., and all will be collectively referred to as \u201cMarsh.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b487-8\"> A Binder Letter was issued on August 29, 2003, for the 2003 policy year.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b489-13\"> In its second amended complaint filed on February 5, 2009, EPIX added AIGRM as a co-defendant.
