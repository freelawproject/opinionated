She contends she ought to have been sentenced as a third-degree offender under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1f(2) and <em>State v. Megargel, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>484, 673 A.2d 259 (1996). We conclude that the sentencing judge mistakenly exercised his discretion when he refused to sentence defendant as a third-degree offender. We reverse the sentence imposed, exercise our original jurisdiction, resentence defendant as a third-degree offender, and remand for entry of an amended judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">On March 28, 2006, defendant, who was eighteen years old at that time,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> pled guilty to the subject offenses pursuant to a plea agreement. The circumstances leading to the charges filed against her were detailed in the presentence investigation (PSI) report and the plea allocution. Defendant, who has an IQ of between forty-four and seventy-five and is moderately to mildly retarded, was born on September 9, 1987, in El Salvador where she lived with her grandparents and brothers until December 2000 when she moved to West New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">According to information contained in the PSI, which was not contested by defendant, on September 13, 2005, West New York police officers responded to a report that an infant may have fallen from a window. Police responded to the scene and observed an infant lying at the bottom of an air shaft on a pile of empty cigarette cartons, which had cushioned his fall. The infant boy\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>umbilical cord was still attached and he had survived the fall. He suffered bruises to his ribs and head; it was possible he had a skull fracture, but that was not established in the record on appeal. The police also discovered the mummified remains of another baby at the bottom of the airshaft.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">In canvassing the building, the police entered defendant\u2019s apartment with her brother\u2019s permission. Defendant\u2019s father, J.J.V., told them defendant had been in bed with the flu since the day before. In speaking with the police, defendant denied being the mother of the baby until she was told he was still alive and being transported to Jersey City Medical Center. She then admitted she was his mother and she was transported to Palisades Medical Center. Police found blood in the bathroom, particularly around the window, and on scissors retrieved from the vanity shelf. Defendant\u2019s parents both denied knowing that she was pregnant.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Defendant ultimately informed the police her father sexually molested her for the first time when she was perhaps nine and he was visiting their family in El Salvador, or possibly when she was eleven and was visiting her parents in the United States. The initial molestation was confined to touching. Defendant\u2019s father threatened to kill her if she told anyone. Soon after she moved to West New York in December 2000, her father raped her, which he thereafter did several times a week, if not almost daily, until she was eighteen. t</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">When her father had a day off from work, he would pick her up at school at lunchtime, take her home, rape her, and bring her back to school. After school and on weekends when defendant\u2019s mother was working, her father would rape her. Occasionally, the rapes occurred during the night when other family members were asleep. Sometimes he used physical force. Although defendant would cry and tell him \u201cNo,\u201d he threatened to kill her mother if she told anyone. Defendant was afraid of her father and never reported the abuse. By and large, her father confined her to their apartment and would not let her date, associate with girlfriends, or talk on the telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Defendant became pregnant when she was about fifteen and gave birth to a baby girl in September 2003. Her father raped her throughout the pregnancy. The night her first baby was born, she had a stomach ache, which became increasing painful over the next two hours. She went to the bathroom and thought she was having a bowel movement. She began pushing and felt something come out of her vagina. It was only then she realized she was giving birth. The baby girl fell into the toilet. She was under the water and not crying; L.V. did not think her baby was alive. After tugging on the umbilical cord and delivering the placenta, defendant thought about taking her baby and leaving her somewhere she would be found, but did not know how to get her baby out of the bathroom without having her family discover her.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">When defendant opened the bathroom door, her father was there and told her to throw her baby out the window. He told her it was her boyfriend\u2019s baby; she denied having a boyfriend. He said she had to throw her baby out the window or he would kill her. When defendant was interviewed by the police two years later, she said she complied with her father\u2019s demand. Her father had praised her, saying she \u201cdid well.\u201d This was the baby whose mummified remains were found at the bottom of the airshaft.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">After the birth of her first baby, the rapes became more aggressive and painful. Defendant stated her father \u201ctreated me very bad.\u201d Her father resumed threatening to kill her if she did not allow him to continue the rapes. She asked her father if it was possible for her to get pregnant again and he replied he did not care, she would have to do the same thing if she did. By now, she was having nightmares about the baby and the sexual abuse and had frequent thoughts and flashbacks about them. She began to have suicidal thoughts, felt socially isolated, and would wake up several times each night perspiring with her heart pounding. She considered attempting suicide in July 2002, took a knife from the kitchen to cut her veins, but put the knife back in the drawer because she thought her mother would suffer.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>In 2005 defendant began to experience the signs of early pregnancy and her abdomen began to grow. Her father would touch her stomach, saying there was a baby there. She thought about running away, telling a friend, telling her mother, or going to a hospital, but she did not know how to get there and was afraid her parents would find out. On September 12, 2005, three days after her eighteenth birthday, she began having abdominal pain and stayed home from school, lying in bed all day. She knew she was about to deliver and was crying. Her father told her to calm down and not say anything. He told her she had to do the same thing as with the first baby.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">At 5:00 a.m. the next morning, the pain got worse and she delivered the same way, although this time the baby started crying. Her father was knocking on the locked bathroom door, which he unlocked after the birth and entered the bathroom. Her father cut the umbilical cord and told defendant she had to do the same thing with this baby as the last one. She or her father took the baby from the toilet and she held her baby. Her father said, \u201cYou can\u2019t have that baby.\u201d She did not want to throw this second baby out the window, but her father kept saying she had to do it.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Her father pushed her to the window he had opened and told her to throw the baby out the window. Defendant put the baby on the windowsill and either the baby fell or she dropped him. Defendant was crying, but she could hear the baby crying all the way down and then continue to cry at the bottom of the air shaft. Her father yelled at her for not throwing the baby harder, and she said she was going down to pick him up. Her father grabbed her and said, \u201cNo.\u201d At that point, she felt dizzy because she was bleeding copiously. An hour or so later, the police arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">After her arrest, defendant was ordered on September 16, 2005, by the court to undergo a psychiatric examination to determine whether she was competent to stand trial and had the mental capacity to form the requisite mens rea for the crimes with which she had been charged. She was admitted to the Ann Klein <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Forensic Center on October 28, 2005, where she was evaluated and treated with Paxil for depression. On February 9, 2006, she was found competent to stand trial and was subsequently discharged to the Hudson County Jail on March 13, 2006, with a prescription for Paroxetine for her depression. She subsequently entered her guilty pleas to second-degree aggravated assault and second-degree reckless manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">In conducting a voir dire of defendant, the judge informed her that the offenses to which she was pleading carried prison terms of five to ten years and were subject to NERA, which would require defendant to serve eighty-five percent of any sentence imposed. He explained that he had discretion to sentence her to a term from five to seven years, which was the stipulated maximum in the plea agreement to which the State was free to speak.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He further explained that at the time of sentencing, the State could argue for seven years and her attorney could argue for one degree less, but that five years was the minimum sentence for a second-degree crime. Defendant expressed that she understood the sentencing ramifications of her pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">At her plea allocution, L.V. testified that her daughter was moving after her birth, which she had previously admitted. She testified that her father cut the umbilical cord and forcefully \u201ctold defendant to throw her daughter out the window.\u201d She did not comply and her father then threw the baby out the window. Defendant did not assist him, but she admitted she did nothing to protect her baby. Her father told her if she called the police, he would kill her mother. L.V. admitted throwing her son out the window, but stated her father ordered her to do so. She did not intend to injure her son, but knew he might be injured or die.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>After the judge told defendant he would not accept her plea if she was not guilty, defendant consulted with her attorney and then testified she knew her father was going to throw her baby out the window, but she did not scream for help, call the police, or tell her mother, anyone at school, or anyone outside her family. She knew her baby might die, but remained silent for two years. Defendant did not waive any defenses as part of her plea bargain. Sentencing abided the preparation of a PSI report.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">In the PSI report, the probation officer advised the judge defendant had difficulty reading and writing her native language and did not speak, read, or write English. The probation officer reported defendant said it was her father who threw the babies out the window, but defendant felt she was guilty because she did not report it. Defendant had been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Major Depressive Disorder, moderate to mild mental retardation, and performed at a first-grade level.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The probation officer requested that the judge</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Al\">take into account the defendant was substantially influenced by an individual not only more mature than her but who also was an authority figure, which served as a strong provocation. Furthermore, the defendant\u2019s language barrier, cultural issues, having only resided in the United States since 2000 and cognitive limitations as well as the unlikeliness [sic] of such circumstance recurring be considered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Attached to the PSI report were (1) a March 7, 2001, Confidential Psychological Evaluation prepared by Rosemary BarrosoRamirez, School Psychologist with the West New York Public Schools Child Study Team; (2) extensive records, evaluations, and Individualized Education Programs prepared by the West New York Public Schools at various times prior to defendant\u2019s arrest; (3) a Criminal Responsibility Report prepared for the court on February 10, 2006, by Elizabeth A. Hogan, M.D., from the Ann Klein Forensic Center, who is a Diplomat of the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology with a certification in the subspecialty of forensic psychiatry; (4) a February 10, 2006, Competency to Stand Trial Evaluation prepared for the court by Dr. Hogan; (5) a Psychological Report prepared by Philip H. Witt, Ph.D. for defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>dant on March 8, 2006; (6) a Discharge Summary prepared on March 13, 2006, by Dr. Hogan relevant to defendant\u2019s October 28, 2005, admission to the Ann Klein Forensic Center; and (7) a March 15, 2006, Addendum to Criminal Responsibility Evaluation prepared for the court by Dr. Hogan. There were no reports prepared at the behest of the State that were included in the PSI report or in the record on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The author of the March 7, 2001, psychological evaluation concluded that defendant\u2019s IQ was fifty-seven and determined that she scored the age equivalent of less than five years, three months. After correcting for a small degree of error, the author of the report determined that defendant\u2019s true performance IQ was between forty-four and fifty-six. On other tests, defendant did \u201csignificantly poorer than her age peers.\u201d The author concluded that defendant was in the range of moderate mental retardation and that a program of special education should be considered for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Dr. Hogan reviewed extensive records, many of which are not in the record on appeal. She reported on February 10, 2006, that defendant, who was in the twelfth grade in high school, functioned at a first-grade level. Psychological testing done in February 2001 indicated defendant scored at an age equivalent of less than five years, three months. On June 1, 2004, she was evaluated as having a severe language disorder with severe deficits in comprehension and syntax. On intelligence testing done at the Ann Klein Forensic Center, defendant attained a quotient score of 72, which placed her with the third percentile rank. Dr. Hogan opined her true IQ score lies within the upper limits of mild mental retardation to the lower limits of the borderline range. Her abilities in math did not reach beyond the second-grade level. Dr. Hogan diagnosed her with PTSD, major depressive disorder, and mild mental retardation. Dr. Hogan medicated defendant for depression while she was at the Ann Klein Forensic Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Dr. Hogan opined that an insanity defense was not available to defendant because she understood the nature and quality of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>act on September 13, 2006. \u201cHowever, it is my opinion that the circumstances surrounding her behavior are so <em>extreme and severe </em>that they need to be considered when assessing her mental state at the time of the alleged offense\u201d (emphasis added). Dr. Hogan continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-5\">[Defendant] was suffering from a mental illness at the time of her arrest____ The symptoms of her mental illness along with the severe trauma she was experiencing likely impaired her judgment and decision making ability at the time of the alleged offense. For years, [defendant] had been severely traumatized by her father. She was placed in fear for her life and for the life of her mother. She felt powerless towards her father and unable to stop the ongoing abuse. This fear and feeling of powerlessness likely affected her ability to remove herself from the abusive situation, inform others about her circumstances or create an alternative plan for her pregnancy. She was told by her father that he would kill her if she told of the abuse or told of the pregnancy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-7\">A second factor that should be considered about her mental state at the time of the alleged offense is that [defendant] reported that her father was present and forced her to drop her newborn infant out of the window. She stated that she was holding her baby, crying, and telling her father that she didn\u2019t want to do it. In addition to the normal control a parent has over a child, additional factors need to be considered when assessing [defendant\u2019s] mental state and her ability to resist her father\u2019s orders at the time of the alleged offense. Years of abuse, fear and powerlessness towards her father along with the mental illness she was suffering at the time likely influenced her vulnerability to be coerced by her father.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-8\">Thirdly, [defendant] suffers from cognitive limitations____ Her cognitive limitations likely impaired her judgment and ability to access medical, legal and mental health services and impaired her ability to create an alternative plan for her pregnancy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-10\">A fourth factor to be considered is [defendant\u2019s] age. The alleged offense occurred four days after her eighteenth birthday. Although chronologically her age is eighteen, severe circumstances have impacted her development. She is mentally retarded. She has endured years of severe sexual and emotional abuse by her father. She has been socially isolated from normal peer interactions. She has suffered for years from symptoms of mental illness, including [PTSD] and Major Depressive Disorder. All of these factors contribute to her functioning both emotionally and cognitively at a developmental age less than the average eighteen year old.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-11\">Lastly, cultural issues need to be considered as well when assessing [defendant\u2019s] mental state at the time of the alleged offense. [Defendant] is a recent immigrant from El Salvador. She has experienced isolation within her community by both language and cultural barriers. In addition, since she has immigrated to this country, she has suffered ongoing trauma and forced isolation by her father. This has likely exaggerated cultural and language barriers and her assimilation into the community. Concern about the consequences to her family had she revealed the abuse or pregnancy was likely influenced by her family\u2019s recent immigration status. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Cultural and language barriers likely ai'feeted [defendant\u2019s] ability to access medical, legal, and mental health services and likely impaired her ability to create an alternative plan for her pregnancy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">In summary, [defendant] was suffering from a mental illness at the time of the alleged offense. However, it is my opinion that her mental state at the time does not meet the statutory criteria for a finding of not guilty by reason of insanity. Nonetheless, there are severe circumstances that influenced her mental state at the time and likely impaired her judgment, behavior and decision making ability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Dr. Hogan also opined, in light of the incarceration of defendant\u2019s father, that it was unlikely that defendant would again be in the same situation and, with continued psychiatric treatment, her then-current risk of dangerousness to others was low. Dr. Hogan recommended continued, long-term psychiatric treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">In an addendum to her February 9, 2006, report Dr. Hogan opined that defendant lacked the requisite state of mind under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:4-2 to purposefully and knowingly commit aggravated assault with respect to the September 13,2005, incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">Dr. Witt interviewed defendant at the request of her counsel and found no evidence of a thought disorder or any signs of psychosis. He found a clear duress defense based on the following factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-10\">Her father\u2019s prior threats to Mil her and her mother if she did not cooperate with him;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-11\">The long history of sexual abuse she experienced at the hands of her father (with resulting post-traumatic stress disorder);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-12\">The early age at which the sexual abuse of her began;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-13\">The fear that both her father\u2019s threats and the long history of his sexual abuse of her had caused;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-14\">Her youth and dependence upon her father for care and support;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-15\">Her father\u2019s presence in the bathroom when she dropped the first baby out the window;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-16\">Her father\u2019s specific instruction and insistence that she drop the first baby out the window;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-17\">Her father\u2019s instruction that she must do with the second baby what she did with the first one;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-18\">Her father\u2019s threats and physical coercion with regard to dropping the second baby out the window;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-19\">Her father\u2019s specific instruction and insistence that she not go to the basement to retrieve the second baby;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-20\">Her father\u2019s physically grabbing her to prevent her from rescuing the second baby.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Dr. Witt opined defendant\u2019s intellectual functioning was only within the lowest three percent of the population, and she had no abstract, reasoning or problem-solving skills that would have enabled another individual to escape the abusive situation in which she was living. \u201cHer cognitive impairments increased her level of dependency upon her parents and prevented her from examining options the way that an individual of higher intelligence would.\u201d He also opined that defendant \u201cexhibits psychological disorders that further impaired her ability to reason at the time of the birth of her two children.\u201d Both the PTSD and Major Depressive Disorder pre-existed the birth of her first child and intensified thereafter. He concluded to \u201ca reasonable degree of psychological certainty that [defendant] performed the acts that led to her present criminal charges under duress.\u201d With this background in mind, we turn to the sentence hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">On May 10, 2007, defendant appeared before the sentencing judge and sought to be sentenced either as an idiosyncratic or third-degree offender for purposes of a non-custodial or probationary sentence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge, the State, and defendant all agreed that she was entitled to 604 days jail-time credit as of May 9, 2007. The judge stated he had read everything in the PSI, including Dr. Hogan\u2019s reports. Defendant elicited testimony from Dr. Hogan; Juan Santiago, a representative of the Developmental^ Disabled Offender Program; and Sahume Walo, a representative of the New Jersey Coalition Against Sexual Abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Because the judge had read Dr. Hogan\u2019s reports, defendant\u2019s counsel only elicited summary opinions from her on direct. Dr. Hogan testified defendant was in need of long-term psychiatric treatment and expressed that defendant\u2019s history, in her experience, \u201cwas unique in the amount of abuse that she endured and the type of abuse.\u201d Dr. Hogan had never \u201ccome across other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>individuals with such a traumatic history and in such a controlled setting that [defendant] experienced.\u201d She testified that early treatment was important and expressed concern that proper treatment, given defendant\u2019s history, might not be available within the Department of Corrections.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">On cross-examination, Dr. Hogan admitted that defendant was not psychotic and no longer had suicidal ideations when she last saw her. Although she knew that mental health treatment was available in prison, she reiterated her concern that the treatment there might not be appropriate for defendant\u2019s condition. On redirect examination, Dr. Hogan testified that defendant was in need of specialized treatment for victims of sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Santiago described the programs that would be available to defendant through the Developmentally Disabled Offender Program if she were placed on probation or after she was paroled. Walo, too, described the programs available to defendant through the New Jersey Coalition Against Sexual Abuse. Defendant\u2019s mother also spoke.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Defendant\u2019s counsel argued her two years of imprisonment paled by comparison to the \u201cpsychological dungeon\u201d to which her father sentenced her when she was thirteen years old. He pointed to the effects of the constant rapes as described in the undisputed reports of Dr. Hogan and Dr. Witt. He argued defendant was an idiosyncratic offender under <em>State v. Jarbath, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>394, 555 A.2d 559 (1989), and <em>State v. Evers, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>355, 815 A.2d 432 (2003). He asserted defendant was compelled to harm her babies\u2014she did not want to do so, but rather was acting under duress that had been exerted since she was thirteen. He acknowledged there was always a general deterrence achieved by incarceration, but argued that had been achieved by the 604 days she already spent in jail. He pointed out that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1d and 1f(2) permitted the judge to consider everything presented in the PSI report and at the hearing and that the presumption of incarceration had been overcome. Further, he urged defendant was more a victim than an offender and needed the services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>described by the witnesses at the hearing, including the State\u2019s expert, Dr. Hogan. As a result, he contended she should be sentenced to five years probation because the sentencing goals of the Code of Criminal Justice except rehabilitation had all been satisfied. He noted that even the Probation Department had not sought incarceration and had opined that the circumstances were unlikely to recur.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The prosecutor urged that defendant was not an idiosyncratic offender because she was not psychotic, not severely retarded, and did not kill her baby accidentally. He argued a manifest injustice excusing incarceration had only been found twice under the Code. The prosecutor also contended defendant would receive services in prison, making a probationary term unnecessary for her rehabilitation. He urged the judge to find aggravating factors (1), (2) and (9), conceding \u201ca host of mitigating factors,\u201d and argued the sentencing factors were in equipoise. The prosecutor did not speak to any specific term of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">When imposing sentence, the judge found the following aggravating factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-7\">(1) The nature and circumstances of the offense, and the role of the actor therein, including whether or not it was committed in an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-8\">(2) The gravity and seriousness of harm inflicted on the victim, including whether or not the defendant knew or reasonably should have known that the victim of the offense was particularly vulnerable or incapable of resistance due to advanced age, ill-health, or extreme youth, or was for any other reason substantially incapable of exercising normal physical or mental power of resistance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-9\">(9) The need for deterring the defendant and others from violating the law[.] <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1a]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">As to the first aggravating factor, the judge found defendant \u201cknew exactly what [she] was doing, didn\u2019t report anything.\u201d He observed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-11\">I understand there are issues there, I understand that you were traumatized, delayed stress syndrome, I understand the heartache you went through, but it happened repeatedly. You were living in our society, living in one of the towns, interacting with other people, and it happened again, and you do it again, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>you\u2019re not even\u2014and the only reason is just by happenstance, by fortune that the second child did not die. That\u2019s a course of continuing conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The judge then addressed the second aggravating factor, conflating it somewhat with the first:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-7\">Serious nature of the offenses____ What you did was cruel, without any justification at all, and there are two children, one who will never see the light of day, and the other who will have great problems that at your hand caused these events.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-9\">I am stating this in terms of the totality of what occurred here. I\u2019m not saying because one child died that you get a certain sentence, and the other one was assaulted you get a certain sentence. I\u2019m saying combined I\u2019m entitled to consider whether something happened in a particularly depraved way.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">Finally, as to aggravating factor (9), the judge found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-11\">But the need to deter both you and others is overwhelming. We cannot have a society where people unpunished, in effect, can have a child and toss them out the window, not once but twice. It cannot be tolerated, it won\u2019t be tolerated in this particular ease. Sympathy has no place in our sentencing scheme, in our sentencing decisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-12\">The judge also found the following mitigating factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-13\">(7) The defendant has no history of prior delinquency or criminal activity ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-14\">(8) The defendant\u2019s conduct was the result of circumstances unlikely to recur;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-15\">(9) The character and attitude of the defendant indicate that [s]he is unlikely to commit another offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-16\">(12) The willingness of the defendant to cooperate with law enforcement authorities;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-17\">(13) The conduct of a youthful defendant was substantially influenced by another person more mature than the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-18\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1b.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-19\">The judge did not explain why he did not find substantial grounds tending to excuse defendant\u2019s conduct although failing to establish a defense, mitigating factor (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-20\">The judge found that mitigating factor (9) was \u201cvery strong\u201d and concluded that the aggravating and mitigating factors were in equipoise. He also found defendant was not entitled to be treated as an idiosyncratic defendant or as a third-degree offender. As to the first, although the judge acknowledged defendant was a sympathetic individual placed in a terrible position and ruthlessly exploited by her father, he noted she was \u201cin front of me as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>someone who has committed two atrocious acts against her own children.\u201d He continued,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-5\">there has been nothing that has come before me that would cause me to think that, other than the sympathy that naturally occurs as a result of the victimization you went through, that makes this situation so unique that you would be considered unique unto yourself and have under our case law all of those factors in your favor that would cause me to give you a probationary sentence when you\u2019re charged with not one, but two second degree crimes. So there\u2019s nothing that I can find that, in and of itself, makes you an individual that would not be sentenced to the normal course of aggravating and mitigating factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">As to downgrading the offenses to third-degree, the judge observed that the presumption of imprisonment under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1f(2) is overcome \u201conly under exceptional circumstances, where the court explicitly finds, setting out its reasons for its conclusions, both that imprisonment would be a serious injustice, and that such an injustice overrides the need to deter others\u201d and then only when the mitigating factors substantially outweigh the aggravating factors. He did not consider imprisonment as a third-degree offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">With regard to the aggravating and mitigating factors, the judge stated \u201cthe reasons to justify any downgrading must be compelling. It can\u2019t be me just finding that there\u2019s more factors in your favor than there are against you, and say well, I\u2019ll give you probation, I\u2019ll downgrade it to one degree lower.\u201d He found that given the facts of this case, defendant did not overcome the presumption of imprisonment applicable to second-degree crimes. The judge concluded that the aggravating and mitigating factors were in equipoise, and sentenced defendant to the bottom of the range for second-degree offenses, five years incarceration with an eighty-five percent NERA parole disqualifier. This excessive-sentence appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">Defendant contends on appeal that the judge abused his discretion in sentencing her as a second-degree offender. She argues that her father had total control of her, her age-related intelligence was only six years old, and she suffered from PTSD. She asserts the aggravating and mitigating factors cannot possibly be in equipoise and the judge should also have found mitigating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>factor (4). Thus, defendant argues the mitigating factors substantially outweigh the aggravating factors and, under the scope of review discussed in <em>Megargel, supra, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>at 493-94, 673 A.2d 259, the judge abused his discretion in not sentencing her to one degree lower and a term of four years. Defendant also points out that the judgment of conviction incorrectly states that \u201caggravating factors completely and totally outweigh mitigating factors\u201d whereas the record reflects that the judge found the factors were in equipoise.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The State responds that the judge commented there was nothing before him except sympathy that would cause him to think the situation was so unique that defendant should be considered as \u201cunique unto herself\u2019 and \u201chave under our case law all of those factors in [her] favor that would cause\u201d him to give defendant a probationary term when she was charged with two second-degree crimes. Further, the State argues that it considered all of these factors in negotiating the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Our role in reviewing a sentence imposed by a trial judge is limited. We only determine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-7\">(1) whether the exercise of discretion by the sentencing court was based upon findings of fact grounded in competent, reasonably credible evidence; (2) whether the sentencing court applied the correct legal principles in exercising its discretion; and (3) whether the application of the facts to the law was such a clear error of judgment that it shocks the conscience.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-8\"><em>[Megargel, supra, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>at 493, 673 A.2d 259 (citing <em>State v. Roth, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>334, 363-365, 471 A.2d 370 (1984)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">It is well settled that we \u201cmay not substitute [our] judgment for that of the trial court,\u201d <em>State v. Johnson, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>10, 15, 570 A.2d 395 (1990), but may modify a defendant\u2019s sentence when we are convinced the sentencing judge was \u201cclearly mistaken,\u201d <em>State v. Jabbour, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>1, 6, 570 A.2d 391 (1990). We may not reach this conclusion unless \u201cthe facts of th[e] case make the sentence clearly unreasonable so as to shock the judicial conscience.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Roth, supra, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>at 365, 471 A.2d 370); <em>see also State v.

Pagan, </em>378 <em>N.J.Super. </em>549, 558, 876 A.2d 812 (App.Div.2005) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">In sentencing, consideration of aggravating and mitigating factors must be part of the deliberative process, provided such factors are supported by credible evidence. <em>State v. Dalziel, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>494, 505, 867 A.2d 1167 (2005); <em>accord State v. Cassady, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>165, 180, 966 A.2d 473 (2009) (citing <em>State v. O'Donnell, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>210, 215-16, 564 A.2d 1202 (1989)). Indeed, a trial judge \u201cis <em>required </em>to consider all of the aggravating and mitigating factors and to find those supported by the evidence.\u201d <em>Dalziel, supra, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>at 505, 867 A.2d 1167 (emphasis added). Error by the trial court in determining the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors will \u201cnulliffy] the weight accorded to such factors and materially alter the calculus in the ensuing balancing of aggravating and mitigating factors.\u201d <em>Jarbath, supra, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>at 406, 555 A.2d 559.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Additionally, \u201cthe court must describe the balancing process leading to the sentence.\u201d <em>State v. Kruse, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>354, 360, 521 A.2d 836 (1987) (citations omitted). \u201cTo provide an intelligible record for review, the trial court should identify the aggravating and mitigating factors, describe the balance of those factors, and explain how it determined defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cMerely enumerating those factors does not provide any insight into the sentencing decision, which follows not from a quantitative, but from a qualitative, analysis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 363, 521 A.2d 836 (citing <em>State v. Morgan, </em>196 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 5, 481 A.2d 545 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>175, 491 A.2d 682 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">When the judge has erred in applying <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1 to the facts in the record before him, or where no qualitative analysis of sentencing factors was placed on the record, we may remand for resentencing. <em>Id. </em>at 363, 521 A.2d 836. We may use our original jurisdiction under <em>Rule </em>2:10-5 in conjunction with our review of sentences to determine whether aggravating and mitigating factors are based on sufficient evidence. <em>Jarbath, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>114 <em>N.J. </em>at 410, 555 A.2d 559. We may exercise our original jurisdiction to impose a new sentence where no further fact-finding is required, <em>State v. Kromphold, </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>345, 355, 744 A.2d 640 (2000), although such exercise \u201c \u2018should not occur regularly or routinely,\u2019 \u201d <em>ibid, </em>(citing <em>Jarbath, supra, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>at 410-11, 555 A.2d 559). \u201c[T]his power [i]s to be used only sparingly: when trial courts are \u2018clearly mistaken\u2019 and \u2018the interests of justice demand intervention and correction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jarbath, supra, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>at 410, 555 A.2d 559 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Sentencing a first- or second-degree offender to a sentence one degree lower is governed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1f(2), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-7\">In cases of convictions for crimes of the first or second degree where the court is clearly convinced that the mitigating factors substantially outweigh the aggravating factors and where the interest of justice demands, the court may sentence the defendant to a term appropriate to a crime of one degree lower than that of the crime for which he was convicted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">The statute thus establishes a two-step test. <em>Megargel, supra, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>at 495-96, 673 A.2d 259. \u201cThe court must be \u2018clearly convinced that the mitigating factors substantially outweigh the aggravating ones <em>and </em>that the interest of justice demands a downgraded sentence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 496, 673 A.2d 259 (citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1f(2)). The <em>Megargel </em>Court observed that \u201cthe standard governing downgrading is high.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 500, 673 A.2d 259. First, \u201ca court must apply the basic sentencing principles of the Code.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Paramount is the requirement that the severity of the crime is \u201cthe most single important factor in the sentencing process.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(citing <em>State v. Hodge, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>369, 379, 471 A.2d 389 (1984)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-9\">In evaluating the severity of the crime, the trial court must consider the nature of and the relevant circumstances pertaining to the offense____ The surrounding circumstances of an offense may make it very similar to a lower degree offense, thus suggesting that a downgraded sentence may be appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-12\"><em>[Id. </em>at 500, 673 A.2d 259.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-13\">Nonetheless, \u201cfacts personal to the defendant may be considered in the sentencing process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 501, 673 A.2d 259 (citing <em>Jarbath, supra, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>394, 555 A.2d 559).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-14\">Courts should consider a defendant\u2019s role in the incident to determine the need to deter him from further crimes and the corresponding need to protect the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>from him. Was the defendant the mastermind, a loyal follower, an accomplice whose shared intent is problematic, or an individual who is mentally incapable of forming the necessary criminal intent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-5\">\n<em>mm</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Deterrence is \u201cone of the most important factors in sentencing.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">Then a sentencing judge must consider the interest of justice. A decision to downgrade \u201cshould be limited to those circumstances in which defendant can provide \u2018compelling\u2019 reasons for the downgrade.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 502, 673 A.2d 259 (citation omitted). Such \u201creasons must be in addition to, and separate from, the \u2018mitigating factors which substantially outweigh the aggravating factors\u2019 \u201d as found \u201cunder the first prong.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Finally, after identifying the sentencing factors, the judge must describe how, in the exercise of discretion, he balanced those factors. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">Accordingly, we review the judge\u2019s application of the basic sentencing principle of the Code to the facts contained in the record. Not all of his findings were based on \u201ccompetent, reasonably credible evidence,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 493, 673 A.2d 259, and in some cases were contradicted by the record before him.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">With respect to aggravating factor (1), the judge focused heavily on defendant\u2019s silence respecting both crimes. However, treating defendant\u2019s silence as an aggravating factor was utterly inconsistent with the opinions expressed by Dr. Hogan in her reports to the court and those expressed by the defense expert, Dr. Witt. They both opined that defendant was powerless to resist her father, whom she feared; to extricate herself from the situation; or to seek help from anyone. They opined this paralysis was a result of the abuse she suffered at her father\u2019s hands, his threats to the life of defendant and her mother, defendant\u2019s cognitive limitations, chronological age, PTSD, and cultural and language barriers. This evidence was undisputed as the State never submitted an evaluation on its own behalf and the judge never rejected the opinions of Drs. Hogan and Witt as lacking in credibility. The record clearly does not support defendant\u2019s silence as a basis for aggravating factor (1). That is not to say that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>it was inappropriate to finding aggravating factor (1), but it does affect the weight to which this factor is entitled. The judge\u2019s finding of aggravating factor (2) is clearly supported by \u201ccompetent, reasonably credible evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Megargel, supra, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>at 493, 673 A.2d 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">As to aggravating factor (9), the judge\u2019s found there was an <em>overwhelming </em>need to deter defendant from \u201chavfing] a child and toss[ing][it] out the window.\u201d However, this finding is inconsistent with everything in the PSI report. The probation officer asked the court to take into consideration that \u201cdefendant was substantially influenced by an individual not only more mature than her, but who also was an authority figure.\u201d Dr. Hogan\u2019s undisputed opinion was that it was unlikely defendant would ever find herself in the same situation again and was thus unlikely to reoffend. Thus, the record simply did not support a specific need to deter defendant and, in fact, the judge\u2019s finding in this respect was contradicted by his finding of mitigating factor (8)\u2014the defendant\u2019s conduct was the result of circumstances unlikely to recur. Of course, there is always a need for general deterrence, but the \u201cvery strong\u201d weight the judge gave to this factor cannot be sustained when only general deterrence exists. <em>Jarbath, supra, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>at 405, 555 A.2d 559 (\u201c[Gjeneral deterrence unrelated to specific deterrence has relatively insignificant penal value.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">We find no error in the mitigating factors found by the judge, but the record also supported mitigating factor (4) (substantial grounds tending to excuse defendant\u2019s conduct, though failing to establish a defense). The judge did not explain why he did not find mitigating factor (4) in light of Dr. Witt\u2019s opinion that defendant had a viable duress defense under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-9a. That is, the defendant was coerced to engage in the conduct charged \u201cby the use of, or a threat to use, unlawful force against his person or the person of another, which a person of reasonable firmness in his situation would have been unable to resist.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The record clearly and convincingly supports this mitigating factor by \u201ccompetent, reasonably credible evidence in the record,\u201d <em>Me</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number><em>gargel, supra, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>at 493, 673 A.2d 259, and it should have been found even if defendant had abandoned her duress defense. Defendant was not \u201cthe mastermind, a loyal follower, an accomplice, who\u2019s shared intent is problematic.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 501, 673 A.2d 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Having concluded that the record supports aggravating factors (1) , (2), and (9), and mitigating factors (4), (7), (8), (9), (12), and (13), we must weigh and balance these factors. Aggravating factor (1) is entitled to moderate weight, as is aggravating factor (2) . However, aggravating factor (9) is entitled only to slight weight. Mitigating factor (4) is entitled to moderate weight, as are mitigating factors (7), (8), (9) and (12). Mitigating factor (13) is entitled to substantial weight in light of the influence exerted by defendant\u2019s father, whom she had feared for years. Balancing the aggravating and mitigating factors, we are clearly convinced that the mitigating factors substantially outweigh the aggravating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Does the interest of justice demand that defendant be sentence as a third-degree offender? We are clearly convinced that the high standard governing downgrading, <em>Megargel, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>at 500, 673 A.2d 259, is met here. Compelling reasons exist for the downgrade. <em>Id. </em>at 502, 673 A.2d 259. In addition to the mitigating factors, defendant is a person of very limited intelligence, functioning at a level in school initially below a five-year-old child and by the time of the crimes at the level of a six-year-old child. She struggled in school and was placed on special education programs. She has a severe language disorder and severe deficits in comprehension and syntax. She suffers from PTSD and Major Depressive Disorder. The circumstances surrounding her behavior were extreme and severe. She had been raped by her father repeatedly for years, causing impairment of her judgment and decision-making ability. She felt powerless toward her father and feared for her life and that of her mother. Her cognitive limitations impaired her ability to seek help with respect to the rapes and her pregnancies and affected her desire not to have her babies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>abused, and she was socially isolated by her abusive father. Her cultural and language barriers and her lack of assimilation into the community also prevented her from seeking help. As Dr. Hogan opined, \u201cthere are severe circumstances that influenced her mental state at the time and likely impaired her judgment, behavior and deeision[-]making ability.\u201d Indeed, those circumstances were \u201chorrific.\u201d The judge erred in refusing to sentence defendant as a third-degree offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">We note defendant has been incarcerated for more than four years of her five-year sentences. As such, we are satisfied that it is appropriate to exercise our original jurisdiction to resentence defendant because a remand will work an injustice by continuing her incarceration further. We cannot give defendant a non-custodial sentence because the crimes to which she pled guilty are subject to NERA, which applies despite sentencing defendant as a third-degree offender. <em>See State v. Johnson, </em>376 <em>N.J.Super. </em>163, 168, 869 A.2d 473 (App.Div.2005) (NERA applies despite downgraded sentence where crime was a first- or second-degree violent crime); <em>State v. Cheung, </em>328 <em>N.J.Super. </em>368, 371, 746 A.2d 38 (App.Div.2000) (although sentenced one degree lower, NERA still applies to the lower sentence because the crime to which defendant pled triggered application of NERA). Accordingly, we sentence defendant to two concurrent four-year terms of incarceration, the mid-range sentence for third-degree crimes, N.J.S.A. 2C:43-6(3), with credit for time served, of which eighty-five percent must be served pursuant to NERA with a three-year period of parole supervision upon release. Because defendant has served the maximum sentence imposed, she shall be released forthwith. While defendant is on parole, the Department of Corrections shall coordinate the provision of services to defendant that are available in the community for victims of sexual abuse, such as those available through the New Jersey Coalition Against Sexual Abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Reversed and remanded for entry of an amended Judgment of Conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b121-10\"> L.V. consented to a waiver of juvenile court proceedings on March 28, 2006, and the matter was transferred to the Law Division.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b125-9\"> The State had agreed to recommend concurrent sentences as consideration for defendant's testimony against her father.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b130-7\"> By the time of this sentencing hearing, defendant\u2019s father had been tried, found guilty, and sentenced to thirty-five years in prison, subject to an eighty-five percent NERA parole disqualifier.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
