And if the defendant\u2019s construction of it was an afterthought with him, occurring only when the \u201cGalindo title\u201d was set up in the United States Circuit Court, it speaks unmistakably the language of .exaction, and strongly manifests the intention to shirk a fair and professional discharge of the duty of an attorney to his client. It is, moreover, evidence of an original intent, and, taken in connection with the tenor of his testimony on the point, is conclusive that he intended, by the writing, to restrict his services to the State Courts; and we have a right to infer, as a just inference, that, so intending, he employed language (\u201cin the Courts of this State\u201d) which, at least to the ordinary and unprofessional mind, would embrace all the Courts within this State in which the \u201cGalindo title \u201d could be asserted or attacked, but which he intended should bear the construction which he subsequently gave it, when the necessity arose for his services. The rule that obtains between contracting parties occupying the same relative positions toward each other is not that by which attorney and client are bound; but, as between the latter, the rule is reversed. It lies with the attorney, in all cases, to show affirmatively that his dealings with his client are fair, just, and reasonable\u2014the presumption being against the fairness of the transaction. <em>(Evans </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>N.

St. 109, the Court again says: \u201c The grounds upon which Courts of equity, proceed in rescinding or canceling executed contracts, is much more narrow and to be more carefully trodden than that upon which they refuse specific performance of unexecuted contracts, or even decree their cancellation. Nothing but fraud or palpable mistake is ground for rescinding an executed conveyance.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-8\">The evidence of fraud or mistake must be clear and convincing, making it out to the entire satisfaction of the Court, and not leaving it open to doubt. (1 Story Eq. Secs. 152, 157, 176.) Had the agreed fee been paid in cash, would any one have pretended an action would lie for recovery thereof after the performance of the services, and especially where the services performed were reasonably worth as much as had been paid?</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b425-9\">By the Court, Temple, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">In November, 1866, the plaintiff, claiming to be the owner of the \u201c Rancho Laguna de la Merced,\u201d against which there was an adverse claim called the Galindo claim, employed the defendant, who is an attorney and counselor at law, to test the validity of the Galindo title, and also to defend the plaintiff against a certain action then pending against him, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>brought by one Ruttman. This contract was reduced to writing, and is in the words and figures following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-6\">\u201cIn consideration of David Mahoney conveying in fee twenty acres of land in the Rancho Laguna de la Merced to me, Thomas I. Bergin, I, Thomas I. Bergin, an attorney and counselor at law, do undertake and agree with said Mahoney to render my professional services in the Courts of this State, in an action to test and determine the validity of the so-called Galindo deed, and also to defend the action of <em>James I. Nuttmanv. David Mahoney </em>and <em>Richard O\u2019Neill, </em>Twelfth District Court of this State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-7\">\u201c In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, this 21st day of Rovember, 1866.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-8\">\u201cThomas I. Bergin.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">At the same time, in pursuance of the terms of the agreement, plaintiff executed to defendant a deed for.twenty acres of land, valued at two hundred dollars per acre. Thereupon the defendant took charge of the Ruttman case for pMntiff, and shortly after brought a suit in the Twelfth District Court to quiet the title of plaintiff against the claimants under the Galindo title. This action was diligently prosecuted by defendant, but demurrers were interposed, and the case thereby delayed. This action was commenced on the 28th of December, 1866, but no trial on the merits has ever been had. Some time afterwards an action was commenced in the Circuit Court of the United States, at San Francisco, by the claimants under the Galindo title, against Mahoney and others, to obtain a decree that the confirmation of the title under which Mahoney claimed should inure to the benefit of Marks\u2014the claimant under the Galindo title\u2014and that the patent should issue to him instead of Mahoney; and also to enjoin .the prosecution \"of the action brought by Mahoney in the Twelfth District Court to quiet his title. When this action was brought, Mahoney requested the defendant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>appear and defend it, as his counsel; but this the defendant refused to do, alleging that his contract only required him to render his professional services in an action to test the validity of that title in the Courts of this State. Afterwards compromises were made in all these cases. Mahoney acquired by purchase whatever rights Huffman had, and also the claim under the Galindo title. For all these compromises Mahoney paid, it is alleged, some sixty thousand dollars, thereby'terminating the suits and rendering the services of defendant no longer necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">This suit is brought to compel the defendant to reconvey the twenty acres of land, upon being paid a reasonable sum for his services, and is based upon two propositions: First\u2014 That the deed was unfairly obtained; that is, that defendant took advantage of the relation of attorney and client; and while plaintiff supposed he had a contract which would compel defendant to defend his title against the Galindo claim, the contract was so worded by defendant as to require very little labor for him, and afford little benefit to the plaintiff\". In other words, that the contract was obtained by fraud. Second\u2014That the defendant has not performed his contract. It is also contended that the agreement, if properly construed by the defendant, did not express the intentions of the plaintiff, and was executed through a mistake, and ought, therefore, to be set aside or reformed.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">The case was referred to a referee to find the facts, and he has found on all the issues for the defendant. He finds that the agreement was fair, and free from fraud; that the land conveyed was a reasonable fee for the services agreed to be rendered, and that the agreement.was correctly reduced to writing, and correctly expressed the intention of the parties at the time. In this finding I think the referee is fully. justified by the evidence. There is no evidence tending to show that the least advantage was taken of Mahoney in the matter; but the contrary clearly appears. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>His own evidence shows plainly that he knew what'he was about, and indicates both the ability and disposition to take care of his own interests, and no inclination to repose unusual confidence in any one.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Hor do I think the evidence clearly shows a mistake in the terms of the contract. The undertaking was not to defend the plaintiff\u2019s title against the Galindp claim, even in the State Courts, but to render his services in an action to test the validity of the Galindo deed. It was- probably supposed by both parties at the time that this could be done in a suit to quiet title in the State Courts, and both seem to have spoken with reference to such a suit, and probably neither contemplated the possibility of such a suit as was brought. They failed to provide for such a contingency; and had it been considered, we cannot know that the contract would have been executed by Bergin.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">I do not understand that it is charged that the defendant failed to perform his contract, except by refusing to defend the suit brought in the United States Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">The suit in the Circuit Court, although intimately connected with the subject matter of the contract, and having a direct bearing upon the suit brought by Bergin in pursuance of it, was not within the terms of the contract, or contemplated by either of the parties at the time. The contract was not .obtained through fraud or mistake, and plaintiff cannot complain if the defendant declines more than a literal compliance with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">Eeither Mr. Justice Wallace nor Mr. Justice Sprague expressed an opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
