The defendants demurred to the complaint; the demurrer was struck out, and a default for failure to answer was entered against them. Afterwards, on motion of defendants, the default <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>was set aside, and an answer was filed. The case was tried by a jury, and a verdict was rendered for the defendants. Plaintiffs appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-6\">The other facts are stated in the opinion of the Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b313-7\"><em>Thomas H. </em>Brents, for Appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel had no sufficient or any notice of defendants\u2019 motion to set aside the default. <em>(Vallejo </em>v. <em>Green, </em>16 Cal.) The affidavit upon which the motion for leave to answer was based was insufficient, because it failed either to excuse the default or to present a meritorious defense. <em>(Bailey </em>v. <em>Taaffe, </em>29 Cal. 423; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>6 Wend. 517; <em>King </em>v. <em>Merchants\u2019 Exchange Co., </em>5 Sand. 697; <em>Slover </em>v. <em>Forbes, </em>22 How. 477; <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>16 Cal. 377.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b313-9\">W. <em>H.

This was error. (<em>Vallejo </em>v. <em>Green, </em>16 Cal. 160.) Second\u2014Ho reasonable excuse was given for the failure to answer within the proper time. The defendants had interposed a demurrer to the complaint, and the defendants\u2019 attorney states in his affidavit that he was present in Court at the calling of the law calendar on the last preceding \u201csteamer day,\u201d and answered \u201cReady\u201d when the demurrer was called for argument, but did not then argue it, because the plaintiff\u2019s attorney was not present in Court; and that he did not know that the Court would entertain a motion concerning a demurrer except on the regular law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>days. The Court, in the meantime, had stricken out the demurrer, because, as we infer, it was deemed to be frivolous. But the attorney does not state that he had no notice of the motion to strike out the demurrer, nor when he was informed, for the first time, that it had been stricken out, nor that he supposed the demurrer to be still pending, until after the time for answering had expired. This was the only showing of diligence, and the only excuse offered for the failure to answer, and it was clearly insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded, with an order to the Court below to vacate the order setting aside the default of the defendants, and with a further order that the answer of the defendants be stricken out.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b314-7\">Wallace, J., concurring:</author>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">I concur in the judgment upon the first point.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
