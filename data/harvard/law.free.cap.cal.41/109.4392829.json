Judgment was rendered for plaintiff. Defendants moved for a new trial, the Court denied the motion, and defendants appealed from the judgment and from the order of the Court denying the motion for a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-6\">The other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b110-7\"><em>Henry E. Heighton, </em>for Appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-8\">The complaint itself, and the evidence on the part of the respondent, show that the respondent\u2019s negligence caused, or at least contributed to the injury complained of, and the allegation of negligence upon the part of the servant of appellants was not only unsustained by testimony but was completely disproved when th'e case for respondent was closed. The motion for a nonsuit, therefore, should have been granted. <em>(Kelly </em>v. <em>Cunningham, 1 </em>Cal. 366, 367; <em>Innis </em>v. <em>The Steamer Senator, </em>1 Cal. 460, 461; <em>Richmond </em>v. <em>Sac. Valley R. R. Co., </em>18 Cal. 353; <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Kier, </em>34 Cal. 75; <em>Gay v. Winter, </em>34 Cal, 163, 164.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b110-9\"><em>James Nichols, </em>for Respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-10\">The defendants are liable in law for injuries sustained by the negligence of their servant. Thus, if a servant, in the course of his master\u2019s business, negligently drive his cart against the carriage of another person, by which he is injured in his person or his property, the master is liable. A very slight degree of negligence is sufficient. (Cowen\u2019s Treatise, 4th ed., 1861, Secs. 383-486.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b111-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>By the Court, Rhodes, C. J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The Court cannot pronounce, as matter of law, that the conduct of the plaintiff, in standing on the rear platform of the street car and steadying himself by holding the rail of the platform, was contributory negligence\u2014that it contributed proximately to the injury inflicted on his hand by the wheel of the defendants\u2019 dray, which was passing along the rear of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">The question whether the defendants\u2019 drayman could, by proper care, have avoided the collision between the dray and car, is a question of fact for the jury. His testimony that the collision would not have occurred, except for the slipping of the wheels of the dray on the track, does not conclusively repel the imputation of negligence. The railroad track was higher than the street, and in crossing the track in the manner he did the wheels of his dray would almost necessarily slip on the track; and if the jury believed from the evidence, that he knew or could readily have seen the condition of the track, and that he did not take proper precaution in crossing the track with \"his dray, they were justified in finding the negligence imputed to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">We see no substantial error in the charge to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">Mr. Justice Sprague did not express an opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
