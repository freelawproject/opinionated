The complaint makes an allegation of injury; but that injury is not based on allegations of facts which would naturally tend to produce injury. The obstruction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>a highway does not necessarily injure any turnpike or toll road in the vicinity. On the contrary, it might greatly benefit such toll road; and this would seem to be the case here, for after the erection of the obstruction the toll road took all the travel between the points of its termini, and its business was on the increase, as appears upon the face of the complaint.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b563-5\">A pleading must not state merely the conclusion that plaintiff is injured, but the facts which would show to the mind of the Court that, being true, injury would result.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b563-6\"><em>J. S. Follensbee, J. Chadbourne, </em>and <em>E. &amp; C. A. Garter, </em>for Respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b563-7\">The Court below did not err in not sustaining the demurrer to plaintiff\u2019s complaint, for the reason that the complaint shows both a public and a private nuisance. The complaint shows that the plaintiff\u2019s road constitutes a connected part of a thoroughfare for public travel between Shasta and Weaverville, named therein; that the public travel passes over plaintiff\u2019s road, when not interrupted; that the plaintiff\u2019s use and enjoyment of property in said road consists in the revenue from the collection of tolls thereon; that the defendants stopped up the road, by placing obstructions across the same, and that by means of these obstructions the plaintiff cannot have the use and enjoyment of their said property; that defendants also interrupted the public travel on plaintiff\u2019s road, by demanding and collecting toll on the public highway connecting with plaintiff\u2019s toll road, thereby showing a nuisance as against the plaintiff. The case made by the complaint is governed by the law and decision in the case of <em>Blanc </em>v. <em>Klumpke, </em>29 Cal. 156; see, also, Pr. Act, Sec. 249.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b564-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>By the Court, Rhodes, C. J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The only questions in the case arise upon the demurrer to the complaint. The plaintiff is the owner of a turnpike road leading from Lewiston, in Trinity County, to a certain point where it intersects a public highway in Shasta County, and possesses the right to collect tolls on that turnpike. The defendants have wrongfully placed a toll gate on the public highway, about a half mile from the point of intersection of the public highway with the plaintiff\u2019s turnpike, and have demanded and collected tolls of persons who pass along the highway with their teams, vehicles, etc., and threaten to maintain the gate and collect tolls, etc. The plaintiff alleges that by means of the gate the highway is greatly obstructed, and that by reason thereof, the plaintiff cannot \u201c have or enjoy its said toll road or turnpike as it ought to be [have] done, and otherwise might and would have done; and has been and is by means of the premises deprived of the use, benefit, and advantage thereof,\u201d and that the maintenance of the toll gate by the defendant will cause great and irreparable damage to the plaintiff. It is also alleged in the complaint \u201c that under and by virtue of said incorporation (the incorporation of the plaintiff) the plaintiff obtained the franchise or right to collect tolls on said road or turnpike, and has, since its completion, enjoyed said right, privilege, and franchise without any interruption, disturbance, or interference whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The complaint, tested by the familiar rule that a pleading is to be construed most strongly against the pleader, shows no cause of action; for if the plaintiff\u2019s franchise\u2014its right to collect tolls\u2014has not been interrupted or disturbed, no injury has been occasioned by reason of the acts complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">The obstruction of a public highway is a common nuisance. A private person has no cause of action by reason of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>obstruction, unless he has suffered some special damage. The special damage must be such as might legitimately flow from the nuisance. It is a further rule of pleading, that such special damages must be particularly stated. (1 Chit. Plead. 347; <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Kent, </em>19 Johns. 228; <em>Squier </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>14 Wend. 159; <em>Bogart </em>v. <em>Burkhalter, </em>2 Barb. 525; <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Swanston, </em>1 Cal. 51; <em>Gay </em>v. <em>Winter, </em>34 Cal. 153.) It was held in <em>Stevenson </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>28 Cal. 102, that when the damages are special\u2014that is, such as do not necessarily arise, or are not implied by law, from the act complained of\u2014the facts out of which the damages arise must be averred in the complaint. The- maintenance of a toll gate upon the public highway, mentioned in the complaint, did not necessarily lessen its use as a highway; and if such were the case, it does not necessarily follow that thereby the travel on the plaintiff\u2019s road was diminished and the tolls lessened. The plaintiff should have stated the facts out of which the damages arose\u2014the means by which the damages were caused. The plaintiff has not alleged that any one was prevented, by means of the defendants\u2019 toll gate, or in consequence of their having demanded or collected tolls, from traveling upon the plaintiff\u2019s turnpike, on paying the proper tolls therefor. The complaint, in that respect, is defective. <em>(Lansing </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>8 Cow. 146.)</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded, with directions to sustain the demurrer to the complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
