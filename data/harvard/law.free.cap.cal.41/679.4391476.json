On said fifth day of March said trustees granted and surrendered to said Teodora, by a conveyance in writing, for her sole and separate use and benefit, the sole possession, use,'and enjoyment, during her life, of said rancho. Said Francisco died in September, 1862. At the time of the execution and delivery of said deed to said trustees there were living nine children of said Francisco Sanchez and his wife, said Teodora Higuera de Sanchez; said children being Pedro Sanchez, Luis de Sanchez, Luisa Sanchez, Bosalia Sanchez, the wife of Frank FT. Gutierrez, Tomas Sanchez, Francisco Sanchez, Cipriano Sanchez, Guadalupe Sanchez, Geneveva Sanchez, the wife o.f Lorenza Pacheco.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b680-8\">The plaintiff, who had acquired an undivided interest in the rancho, commenced this action for a partition on the 16th day of Hove mb er, 1868. Said Teodora and the children, and a large number of other persons who claimed under Teodora and the children, were niade defendants. Two of the children, Guadalupe Sanchez and Geneveva Sanchez de Pacheco, died during the pendency of the suit. George F. Sharp was one of the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b680-9\">The Court partitioned the rancho among. the different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>owners, in fee and of life estates. At the time the partition was made said Teodora was living.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b681-6\">The final decree contained the following provision:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b681-7\">\u201cIt further appearing that the defendants Tomas Sanchez, Cipriano Sanchez, Francisco Sanchez, Juan Bernal, Pedro Sanchez, George F. Sharp, Patrick Flannelly, Patrick Feeny, Robert Inches, and Clorinda Perez and Jos\u00e9 Garcia, and the plaintiff James Regan, are entitled to remainders in certain portions of said rancho. It is, therefore, ordered and decreed that such portions of said rancho as are allotted to said plaintiff, and to various defendants, for and during the life of said Teodora Higuera de Sanchez, are so allotted, subject to the rights of said plaintiff and defendants so holding remainders as aforesaid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b681-8\">The other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b681-9\"><em>John Hunt, Jr., </em>for Appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b681-10\">The decree does not provide for appellant\u2019s rights, in the event of Rosalia surviving any or all of her brothers and sisters.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b681-11\"><em>J. B. Harmon </em>and <em>J. P.

He has a vested remainder only, to come into possession after the decease of Teodora Sanchez\u2014an event which has not occurred. Until that event the land can be actually divided only among those persons who have fee simple or life estate interests -therein.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b681-13\">By the Court, Wallace, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b681-14\">Under the conveyance in trust Teodora, the mother .of Rosalia, the appellant\u2019s grantor, became seized of an estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>in fee in one undivided half, and'of an estate for her own life in the other undivided half, of the Rancho San Pedro; and Rosalia and the other children became owners of a vested remainder in the latter named half, to come into possession only at the death of the mother\u2014an event yet in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Partition was decreed to be made between the parties who were purchasers from Teodora in fee in some instances, and for life in other instances, and in yet other instances in fee, and for life as well; and none of these complain of the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">Sharp, who is the sole appellant, owns neither in fee nor for life, but has succeeded only to the interest of Rosalia in remainder, and complains that his interest is not sufficiently protected by the decree. We observe, however, that the appellant is named in the decree as one of the persons holding in remainder, and the allotments of the undivided half held for life are distinctly decreed to be subject to the right of all those so holding in remainder.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">The decree could not, of course, undertake to ascertain in advance the quantity of interest, if any, which the appellant is to have at the death of Teodora, when that event shall occur; for under the operation of the conveyance the appellant may succeed to the whole of th\u00e9 premises set apart by the decree to the purchasers of the life estate, or he may succeed to any portion less than the whole, or possibly to no interest whatever in the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">The decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
