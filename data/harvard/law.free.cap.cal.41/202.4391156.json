Sr. Don E. F. de Celts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-7\">Dear Son: I have before me your two letters of the 15th of September and 27th of November of last year, received together, and as always the useless California postage stamp; paid for here as if they had not been stamped. Be governed by this and write on light paper commercially, because the English postage is very dear, and we ought not to spend what we can economize. In respect to the sale of San Fernando, it will be, or up to this time it has been, useless to think of selling our part, because no propositions have been formally presented, and all have been either low or worthless. If the total area reaches (as you say they have put it for taxes) one hundred and sixty-one thousand one hundred and sixty-three acres of land, however little it may sell at per acre, it amounts to a great deal. You say that I must tell you how much our undivided half is worth, and I think that, reserving for yourself five hundred or one thousand acres in the part you may choose, you may obtain for our part thirty thousand dollars, fifteen thousand \u201e dollars or twenty thousand dollars cash, and the rest in one or two years with a small interest, which will hasten the completion of the payment, or with a loss of the part paid at the beginning, in case the total payments are not made.. Under these conditions your relations of Santa Clara sold, and, it has turned out well for them. The other chief condition is to sell our right in the land and not to answer for further reclamations of any kind. As to the writing of sale you can give a provisional obligation, until the writing comes, to be sent back signed by me and your mother. You being at the fountain head of this property on one side, and our partner, Don Andres Pico, consenting to the cession to you of five hun- * dred or one thousand acres, there is nothing more to do than take them 'where you choose, dispose of them, make a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>small map, and draw the title. I think that one thousand or two thousand aeres will be better than five hundred, because you have many brothers, and Miguel and Pastor, like you, Yankees by birth. This reserve of one thousand or two thousand acres may be taken into consideration with respect to the thirty thousand dollars, the total value of our part of San Fernando.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-6\">Your father salutes you with the new year.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-7\">- (Signed) EULOGIO de CELIS.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-8\">Bilbao, February 15th, 1868.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-9\">Dear Eulogio: The purchase by us of Andres Pico\u2019s share in San Fernando is impossible.

I thank you for the local news you gave us of that city. I see that in all your proj ects our money \u25a0 enters, or rather that of remitting to you new funds. In my two last I made it clear to you, in family confidence, how impossible this was without exposing us in our future plans, to being in want of the daily necessaries of life- for our subsistence, which would be a madness I shall not commit. You ought then to turn your eyes to the lands of that country and sell some to promote o.thers; that is the order. I know well that the Americans who surround you desire capital to come into their country, but his daily bread no father of a family will risk. If you have not powers to sell or partition lands, looking for a confirmation of your father and mother, without receiving the proceeds, that confirma- * tion, it being just and proper, will not have to be waited for.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>May you enjoy health, and may Q-od dispose of you and yours.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-6\">E. de.

On the 27th of January, 1869, the father died at Bilbao, and on the 9th day of October, 1869, the said son was appointed the administrator of his estate. On the 17th day of December, 1869, the plaintiffs filed in the Probate Court a petition asking the Court to enforce the contract. A judgment was entered directing the administrator to execute a conveyance, and he appealed from the same. The wife and children of the intestate were made parties to the proceeding.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b207-8\"><em>James H. Lander, </em>and <em>M. G. Cobb, </em>for Appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-9\">The power of attorney, being general, does not give authority to make a conveyance of land, or to bind the principal by a contract to convey. <em>(Lord </em>v. Sherman, <em>2 </em>Cal. 498; <em>Billings </em>v. <em>Morrow, </em>7 Cal. 171; <em>Blumm </em>v. <em>Robertson, </em>24 Cal. 127.) A power of attorney is subject to strict interpretation. <em>(Withington </em>v. <em>Herring, </em>5 Bing. R. 442; <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Goodridge, </em>6 Cush. 117; <em>Ferreira </em>v. <em>Depew, </em>17 How. Pr. 418.) The letters from deceased to the agent, not being executed and acknowledged as required by law, but mere parol evidence, confer no authority on the agent to sell land, nor do they control, aid, or enlarge the authority contained in the power of attorney,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>(General Laws, See. 669; Story on Agency, Sec. 76; Paley on Agency, by Lloyd, n. 179 and n. 198.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b208-6\"><em>Pringle &amp; Pringle, </em>for Respondents.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b208-7\">The power of attorney, if not sufficient to authorize a sale of lands, was yet the constitution of an agency to which the subsequent letters supplied the necessary power. Those letters were exhibited to the petitioners and relied on by them in making their contract. They were sufficient to empower the agent to make a contract of sale. The powers given were \u25a0 ample for that purpose. <em>(McNeil </em>v. <em>Shirley, </em>33 Cal. 202.) The father gives to his son every power except that of making the deed. He withholds that only to insure his compliance with the instructions given. The acts of the son, within those -instructions, are certainly binding upon the father. \u201cAs regards the bill of sale, you can give a provisional obligation while the deed comes, that we may return it, signed by myself and your mother.\u201d . \u201cSell property, and the sale will be approved.\u201d</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b208-8\">By the Court, Rhodes, C.
