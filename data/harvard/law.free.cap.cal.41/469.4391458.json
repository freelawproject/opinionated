The Recorder gave her possession of it, and received the customary price for it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-7\">The plaintiff also introduced a judgment in said Court in favor of the plaintiff and against Francisco Pico, and an execution issued on the judgment, and a sale thereunder of the premises and a deed of the Sheriff to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-8\">The plaintiff also offered in evidence a deed from Candelaria' to herself, dated June 17th, 1864, of a lot of land described as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-9\">\u201cAll the right, title, and interest of the party of the first part in all that certain piece or parcel of land situate in the Town and County of Santa Barbara, State of California, bounded in front by Carrillo street; on the north by the land of Francisco Espinosa and others; on the west by open land of the Town of Santa Barbara, and on - the south by the land of Rafael Valdez, being the same lot of land whereon is erected a dwelling house occupied by Francisco Pico, and the same lot of land which was granted to the party of the first part by the Ayuntamiento of Santa Barbara County, and the same piece or parcel of land which Was regranted to the party of the first part, by deed from the Mayor and Common Council of the City of Santa Barbara, dated February 16th, 1858, and recorded in the office of the Recorder of Santa Barbara County, in Book \u201cB \u201d of Deeds, on pages seven hundred and sixty-seven and seven hundred and sixty-eight, to which record reference is hereby made for a fuller description of boundaries.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>The defendant, Francisco Pico, then introduced in evidence a notice served by him on the Sheriff, before the sale, that he claimed the property as a homestead. The Court rendered judgment in favor of the defendants, and the plaintiff appealed from the judgment and from an order denying a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b471-6\"><em>Charles E. Huse, </em>for Appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b471-7\">The Court erred in holding that it had no other guide for the location of the grant except its contents. The Sheriff\u2019s deed alone is sufficient to entitle plaintiff to recover. It nowhere appears that Pico was the head of a family or was entitled to a homestead. For .does it appear, nor was it pretended, that Pico had ever recorded a homestead claim.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b471-8\"><em>A. Packard </em>and <em>Haymond &amp; Stratton, </em>for Respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b471-9\">The grant of the Ayuntamiento to Candelaria Ca\u00f1izares for a lot of land adjoining the house of Manuel Cota does not' show that the lot granted was the one in dispute, and there is no proof that it was the same lot. The deed of the Sheriff to Villa was \u201crendered a nullity by the notification of defendant Francisco Pico\u2019s claim of the premises as a homestead.\u201d It is admitted by respondent that Pico occupied the lot. \u201c Occupancy by the family is presumptive evidence of the appropriation of a place as a homestead.\u201d <em>(Taylor </em>v. <em>Hargous, </em>4 Cal. 268.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b471-10\">By the Court, Rhodes, C. J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">A short time previous to the Sheriff\u2019s sale of the premises in controversy, under the execution issued upon the judgment in favor of Villa, and against Pico, a notice was served on the Sheriff by Pico, stating that he claimed the premises as his homestead. The Court below regarded that notice as having the effect to render the sale void. The notice alone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>could not have the effect which was attributed to it. Unless the premises were in fact his homestead, the notice or claim that .they constituted his homestead was utterly nugatory. There is no evidence in this case, showing that the premises were his homestead, at the time of the Sheriff\u2019s sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">For the guidance of the parties on the new trial, it is proper to say that the plaintiff failed to show title to the premises in controversy, derived from Candelaria Ca\u00f1izares, because he did not show that the grant made in 1849, or the deed of the Mayor and Common Council, executed in 1858, included the premises in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Judgment and order reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">Mr. Justice Crockett did not express an opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
