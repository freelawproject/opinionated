The defendant set up in his answer, by way of counter claim, that for the p'ayment of the indebtedness he pledged as security one hundred shares of the stock of the Bullion Mining Company, and that the plaintiffs sold the - same without his authority or permission, and that after the sale the shares were worth thirteen thousand dollars. The testimony showed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>that the plaintiffs had the stock in pledge, and sold the same in the Board of Brokers for one thousand one hundred and fifty-two dollars and fifty cents, on the 14th or 15th of September, 1866. The testimony further tended to show that before the suit was brought the Bullion mining stock sold as high as one hundred and sixty dollars per share. The Court below gave judgment for the plaintiffs for the sum claimed, and the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-6\">The other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b520-7\"><em>Henry E.

The defendant ratified the sale after it was made.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b520-11\">By the Court, Temple, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b520-12\">This appeal presents only a case of conflicting evidence. The testimony of the plaintiffs is sufficiently positive that the account presented to the defendant was acceded to by him, and the finding of the Court supports that view. It may be admitted that defendant was entitled to notice to make his margin good before the stock which was pledged could be sold; also, that the notice of the time and'place of sale was insufficient. Still, if the evidence of plaintiffs is to be taken as true, defendant did know in advance of the contemplated sale, and of the tim\u00e9 and place, and made no objection, and that after the sale he was presented an account, in which he was credited the amount received at the sale; that, knowing all the facts, he admitted the correctness of the account, and even approved of the sale, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>repeatedly afterward promised to pay the balance claimed to be due; that he never, on any occasion prior to the bringing of the suit, objected to the correctness of the account, or to the sale, on account of want of notice, or for any other reason. If this testimony be true, it is sufficient to sustain the finding that the sale had been ratified by the defendant, and we do not feel at liberty to disturb the finding of the Court on that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">For the same reason, it is not necessary to consider the point made that a sale in the Board of Brokers, where the general public are not at liberty to bid, is not a sale at public auction, such as a pledgee of stock is authorized to make upon default being made by the pledgor.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
