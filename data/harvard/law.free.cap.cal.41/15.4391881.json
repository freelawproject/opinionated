After the note fell due the payee indorsed it to the plaintiff. The defendant answered, that he paid the note to Lee, before the indorsement thereof to the plaintiff*. The evidence to support the plea of payment tended to show that the defendant had a large quantity of corn husked, lying in heaps in his field, and agreed with Lee to sell him enough corn, at one dollar and fifty cents per hundred, to pay the note, and that the defendant and Lee were each to furnish a team to haul it to Lee\u2019s crib; but that nothing was done to weigh the corn or separate it from other corn in the field, and that the defendant notified Lee that the corn was ready, but he did not come to help remove it, and declined to take it away.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-11\">The Court below rendered judgment in favor of the defendant, and the plaintiff appealed. \u25a0</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b15-12\"><em>V.

Ill, Sec. 4.) \u201c Where some act remains to be done in relation to the articles which are the' subject of the sale, as that of weighing or measuring, and there is no evidence tending to show the intention of the parties to make an absolute and complete sale, the property in such articles does nor pass to the vendee until such act is performed. But it is otherwise if the payment of the purchase money is not a condition precedent to the transfer, and it ajipears that the parties intended that the sale should be complete before the articles were weighed or measured.\u201d <em>(Riddle </em>v. <em>Varnum, </em>20 Pick. 280; 13 Pick. 182.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b16-9\">By the Court, Rhodes, C.
