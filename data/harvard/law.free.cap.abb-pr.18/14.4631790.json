The defendants served answers, which plaintiffs\u2019 attorney returned as informal and defective. The answers were not re-served. Plaintiffs made motions against the answers as sham and frivolous. Defendants objected that the answers could not be brought before the court, the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney having returned them: the objections prevailed, and the motions were denied, with costs. Adjusted costs without notice, and entered judgments, which defendants now moved to open for irregularity.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b31-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number><em>Titus B. </em>Eldridge, for the motion, urged,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Az3\">1. That the original summons was not inserted in the judgment-rolls. 2. That the costs were adjusted without notice. 3. That the judgment on failure to answer was unauthorized.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b31-5\"><em>George </em>Bowman, opposed.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEI\">I. The original summons is not required in judgment-roll. (Code, \u00a7 281; 2 <em>Whit. Pr., </em>505.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-6\">II. The adjusting of the costs without notice, did not make the judgment irregular. (Stinson <em>a. </em>Huggins, 9 <em>How. Pr., </em>86; Gilmartin <em>a. </em>Smith, 4 <em>Sandf., </em>684; Chapin <em>a. </em>Churchill, 12 <em>How. Pr., </em>367: Henry <em>a. </em>De Bow, 20 <em>Ib., </em>215; 2 <em>Whit. Pr., </em>499, 502.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-7\">III. The plaintiff having refused to receive, and having returned the answers, and the defendants having since kept them without objection\u2014and defeating the former motion by that objection\u2014is estopped, and cannot be heard in objection. If a party to an action proceeds upon an order made in the cause, or accepts any benefit or advantage under it, he will be precluded from asking a review. (Radway <em>a. </em>Graham, 4 <em>Abbotts' Pr., </em>468.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b31-8\">Barnard, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ajr\">\u2014The defendants\u2019 counsel having, upon the motions to strike out as frivolous and sham, raised the preliminary objection that such motion could not be heard because the plaintiff\u2019s attorney had returned the answers to him, and therefore they were no longer answers in the cause, and having succeeded in having his preliminary objection held good by the court, cannot now insist that the judgment entered is irregular, because there were answers in the cause which had not been disposed of by order of the court or trial. The other objections have been considered, and are not deemed sufficient to vacate the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">Motions denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
