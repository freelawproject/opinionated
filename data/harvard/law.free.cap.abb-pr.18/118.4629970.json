The assessment in question is invalid, unless the authority to impose it can be found in the Act of February 27, 1855. 1. At the titne of the passage of the Act of 1855, the personal property of foreign corporations was exempt from taxation, <em>(a.) </em>By 1 Rev. Stat. 5 ed, 906, section 5, Part 1, chap. 13, tit. 1, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>enacted that \u201cthe following property shall be exempt from taxation * * * Sub. 7. The personal property of every incorporated company not made liable to taxation on its capital in the 4th title of this chapter, <em>(b.) </em>Title 4 of chapter 13 1 <em>Rev. Stat., </em>5 ed., 944) contains no provisions applicable to foreign corporations. It cannot be contended that the Legislature intended chapter 4 to apply to foreign corporations. If it did, the entire capital of this company, which is situated in England, and consists of several millions, and the capital of every corporation in the world, would be liable to taxation in this State. 2. There was no manner provided for assessing a non-resident or a foreign corporation in respect of personal property situated in this State, <em>(a.) </em>\u201c Persons\u201d could only be assessed in the towns or wards Avhere they resided, <em>(b.) </em>Corporations liable to taxation upon their capital, were to be assessed in the towns or Avards of their principal office, &amp;c. There Avas no provision for the assessment of corporations other than those liable to taxation upon their capital. (See 1 <em>Rev. Stat., </em>908, 5 ed.) Mem. In section 5, the word \u201c of\u201d is misprinted \u201c or,\u201d as will appear by reference to to the Session Luavs, and to the opinion of Chief-Justice Comstock, in the case of Hoyt. 3. Statutes Avere in force at that time, expressly providing for the taxation of foreign insurance companies, and establishing the manner of such taxation; <em>i. e., </em>by requiring them to pay a percentage on the premiums earned here. <em>Laws of </em>1824, ch. 277; <em>Id. </em>1827. 1 <em>Rev. Stat., </em>974; <em>Id. </em>1829, ch. 336; <em>Id. </em>1837, ch. 30; <em>Id. </em>1849, ch. 178.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b136-5\">II. The act of 1855 does not authorize the assessment in question. It does not in terms apply; nor can it be inferred that it was intended to apply, to foreign corporations. It Avas intended to meet the case of natural persons, concerned in partnerships or unincorporated associations, who personally transacted their business and managed their capital in this State, under the protection of its laws, while residing beyond its limits, and thus evaded taxation. 1. It does not mention \u201c foreign corporations,\u201d although those are words of great frequency in our statutes. 2. It is, apparently with care, confined to \u201c persons\u201d and \u201c associations.\u201d <em>(a) </em>The term \u201c persons,\u201d Avhen used in the statutes of this State, does not, in general, \u00ab include corporations, otherwise the Legislature would not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>considered it necessary to enact special provisions, declaring in what cases the term \u201c persons\u201d shall be deemed to include corporations, as in the following instances: Revised Statutes, part 4, chap. 1, title 7, \u00a7 40 (3 <em>Rev. Stat., </em>5 ed., 990, \u00a7 46), it is enacted that the term \u201c person,\u201d when used in. that chapter, shall be construed to include public and private corporations. By the acts in relation to unauthorized banking (2 <em>Rev. Stat., </em>5 ed., 981), \u201cpersons\u201d are prohibited from becoming members of companies formed, or to be formed, for the purpose of unauthorized banking. Incorporated companies are prohibited from employing their effects in such business. The terms person, association of persons, body corporate, &amp;c., are used as having different significations. The statutes relating to proceedings against non-residents and foreign corporations recognize the distinction between them. The statutes in relation to insurances (2 <em>Rev. Stat., </em>5 ed., 983, 984) separately enumerate \u201c person,\u201d \u201c association,\u201d and \u201c incorporation established in a foreign country.\u201d The distinction between these terms is especially observable in the laws relating to taxation. By the Act of 1851, ch. 176 (1 <em>Rev. Stat., </em>5 ed., 308), every \u201cperson\u201d shall be assessed in respect of his personal property in the town or ward where he resides. All the personal estate of every \u201c incorporated company liable to taxation on its capital\u201d shall be assessed in the town or ward where its principal office, &amp;c., shall be. 1 Revised Statutes, 5 ed., 912 (1857), \u00a7 23, declares that the term \u201cperson\u201d or \u201cpersons,\u201d when used in certain sections of the law relating to taxation, shall be c'onstrued to include corporations, \u201c <em>Exjpressio unius, exclusio alterius.\u201d </em>The term \u201c association\u201d does not describe a corporation, unless the term \u201c incorporation\u201d be added to it. It means only persons who are associated together. A corporation is a unit, a being created by the law, known by a particular name, deriving its powers and attributes from the law which creates it, and not from the persons who are corporators, and liable to be proceeded against,^under laws expressly applicable to corporations. A mere association, on the contrary, derives its powers from the individuals who compose it. Associations and corporations are totally distinct from each other in their origin, constitution, and characteristics. 3. The context of the act shows that it was not intended to apply, and is not applicable, to cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>porations. <em>(a.) </em>\u201c Doing business as principals, or partners.\u201d Doing business as a principal excludes the idea of any agency. That terra applies evidently to natural persons transacting their own business. Doing business as partners also applies to individuals only. \u25a0 <em>(b.) </em>\u201cRot residents of this State.\u201d The term residence is not applicable to corporations, except when the question of citizenship arises. In the tax laws it has no such application, (c.) The manner indicated in the act of 1855, for assessing the taxes authorized by that act, shows that that act was not intended to be applicable to corporations. \u201c They shall be assessed in the same manner as if they were residents of this State\u201d\u2014not in the same manner as if they were corporations created under the laws of this State. Tinder the tax laws, as revised in 1813 (2 <em>Rev. Laws, </em>509, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2), all personal estate of persons residing in this State was taxable. It was never held that corporations were taxable under that provision. <em>{d.) </em>The provisions as to the place of taxation shows that the term \u201c residence,\u201d when used in the tax laws, is not deemed applicable to corporations. <em>\u201c </em>Individuals\u201d are taxable in the town or ward where they reside; \u201c corporations liable to taxation on their capital\u201d in the town or ward where their principal office, &amp;c., is situated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-5\">III. The absence of any reference in the Act of 1855, to the then existing laws in regard to the taxation of foreign fire and marine insurance companies, shows that the act was not intended to apply to those companies, or to change the existing laxvs respecting them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-6\">IV. If the Act of 1855 applied to the plaintiffs, it applied to all foreign corporations, including fire and marine insurance companies, and subjected them to a double tax. This cannot be supposed toTiave been the intention of the Legislature.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-7\">V. The taxation of insurance companies incorporated in foreign countries, having been already regulated by specific laws, which were in force at the time of the passage of the Act of 1855, that subject, in the absence of any repeal of those special regulations, cannot be deemed to have been embraced in the general terms employed in the Act of 1855, especially when the terms so employed are not, in their common and ordinary sense, applicable to such companies.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-8\">VI. The Acts of 1857 and 1858, regulating the taxation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>foreign insurance companies, exclude the idea that the Act of 1855 applied to such companies, and show that the Legislature deemed the separate system of taxation established in respect to such companies as still continuing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-5\">VII. The provisions of the Act of 1857, last referred to, restrict the right to tax the assets of foreign corporations to cases where they have not less than $300,000 invested in this State. This amount is, by the amendment of 1858, reduced to $150,000, and it is provided that when the assets are below that amount, the only tax which can be imposed is two per cent, upon premiums. The case before the court does not come within any of those provisions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-6\">VIII. The case before the court is not one of those at which the Act of 1855 was aimed. The object of that act was to reach individuals transacting their own business in this State, and having their residences outside of its limits. This appears from the language of the act, which declares that they shall be taxed \u201c in the same manner as if they were residents of this State.\u201d The subject of taxing corporations, foreign and domestic, was already provided for by a system adapted to that specific subject. If the Legislature have omitted to embrace, in those provisions, foreign <em>life </em>insurance companies, the omission cannot be supjfiied by the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-7\">IX. In no event could the deposit in question be taxed in the city of Hew York. The provisions for taxing corporations, where their principal place pf business is situated, only apply to such corporations as are taxable on'their capital, under title 4, of chap. 13, of part 1 of the Revised Statutes. The manner of assessing the tax is declared by the Act of 1855 to be, not that provided for assessing corporations, but that they shall be assessed \u201cthe same as if they were residents of this State. Therefore, if the deposit-in question is taxable at all, it can only be taxed by assessing the comptroller in respect of it as trustee, and that assessment must be made at the place of his residence, and the tax imposed at the comparatively moderate rate of taxation prevailing there, instead of the extravagant one to which the residents of the city of Kew York are subjected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-8\">X. The deposit in question is not a sum invested in business. The sum is invested in the stocks in question. It is withdrawn from business, and separated from the other assets of the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>pany. It is a special trust fund, placed in the hands of the comptroller, not subject to the control of the company, or to the claims of its general creditors, but declared by law to be merely a security to its policy-holders, resident in the United States. <em>(Act of June </em>24, 1853, ch. 463, \u00a7 6.) The fund in question is not, therefore, such a one as is intended by the Act of 1855.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-5\">XI. The policy of the State, as declared in the Act of 1851, is to encourage the investment of foreign capital in our securities. Capital transmitted here for such investment is by that act expressly exempted from taxation. <em>(Laws of </em>1851, ch. 176.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-6\">XII. The decision of the general term,. in respect to the $50,000 of United States stock, should be affirmed. This case is distinguishable from that of the Bank of the Commonwealth. There, the tax was imposed upon the capital of the bank, and the amount of that capital was to be fixed at the actual value of the capital stock, subject to certain deductions enumerated in the statute. The United States stock was one of the elements of the value of the stock of the bank, and indirectly contributed to increase the tax, but it was not itself the subject of taxation, and, therefore, did not fall within the decision in the case of Weston <em>a. </em>The City of Charleston. Here the case is different. If the tax can be assessed at all, it is assessable directly upon the deposit, consisting of United States stocks, and, therefore, falls within the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of Weston.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-7\">XIII. The judgment as to the Buffalo city stocks should be reversed, and costs should be awarded to the plaintiffs on both appeals.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b140-8\"><em>Abraham R.

The relators having demurred to the return to the writ of <em>certiorari, </em>all the facts stated in the return must, for the purposes of this appeal, be taken as true. If, therefore, there is any conflict between the petition on which the writ was obtained, and the return on a matter of fact, the return must prevail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-9\">II. The return states, as matter of fact, that the principal office or agency of the company in this State is in'the first ward of the city of Hew York. If there was any authority, therefore, for making an assessment upon the stock deposited by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>relators with the comptroller, the assessment was properly mMe in the city of Mew York, as and for property situated in the first ward. (1 <em>Rev. Stat., </em>390, 1 ed.; 1 <em>Rev. Stat., </em>909, 5 ed.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-5\">III. The relators are within the class subjected to taxation by the-Act of the Legislature of this State, passed February 27, 1855. <em>(a.) </em>The phraseology of the act is applicable to foreign companies doing business in this State, whether incorporated or unincorporated. The term <em>\u201c </em>person\u201d includes a corporation. (United States <em>a. </em>Amedy, 11 <em>Wheat, </em>392; People <em>a. </em>Utica Ins. Co., 15 <em>Johns., </em>358; Clinton, &amp;c., Manufacturing Co. <em>a. </em>Morse (cited in above); Angell <em>&amp; </em>Ames on Corporations, 472, 473, \u00a7 441; State of Indiana <em>a. </em>Woram, 6 <em>Hill, </em>33.) And a corporation has been held to be an <em>\u201c </em>inhabitant\u201d within the meaning of the tax laws. (Ontario Bank a. Bunnell, 10 <em>Wend., </em>186; Sherwood <em>a. </em>Saratoga, &amp;c., R. R. Co., 15 <em>Barb., </em>657; <em>Cowper's Reports, </em>79.) Also to be an \u201c occupier\u201d within the meaning of statutes relative to taxation emplojdng that term. (See cases cited by Nelson, J., in Ontario Bank <em>a. </em>Bunnell, <em>supra.) (b.) </em>The term \u201c associations\u201d includes corporations. Association simply means \u201c the act of associating,\u201d \u201c union,\u201d \u201c connection of persons.\u201d The \u201c associations\u201d under the Banking Law of 1838 were held by the Supreme Court to be \u201c corporations.\u201d (People <em>a. </em>Watertown, 1 <em>Hill, </em>620; Sandford <em>a. </em>Supervisors, Davies, J., 15 <em>How. Pr., </em>172.) By the Constitution, a \u201c corporation\u201d includes any \u201c association\u201d possessing any other powers than a partnership. <em>(Art. </em>8, \u00a7 2.) The spirit of the Act of 1855 is to subject individuals, whether incorporated or unincorporated, whether partnerships or associations, or natural persons, who are not residents of this State, but are doing business therein, in any way, to taxation on all sums invested in their business here; and there certainly can be no good reason for exempting from the operation of the statute any body of individuals, which, according to the recognized rules of construction, should be embraced in the language of the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-7\">IV. The next question is: are they doing business in this State, within the meaning of that act? We insist that they are, through their agents. The agents\u2019 acts are business matters of the company, and, indeed, the most essential part of the business of the Company, so far as its operations in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Staifce are concerned; and it is difficult to conceive how it can be contended that a company engaged in such operations, through its agents, is not engaged in the transaction of business here.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b142-5\">V. It follows that they stand in the same position in reference to liability to taxation upon sums invested in business here as \u201c corporations\u201d or \u201c associations\u201d created or organized under the laws of this State. <em>(Laws of </em>1855,44, ch.37; International Life Assurance Co. <em>a. </em>Commissioners of Taxes, 28 <em>Barb., </em>318.) Two questions then remain to be considered : 1st. Whether a corporation or an association, organized and doing business under the laws of this State, would be liable to taxation upon a similar deposit to that involved in this State; and 2d. Whether the sum of one hundred thousand dollars, invested in the stocks deposited with the comptroller, is to be considered as invested u in the business of the relators in this State. <em>A. </em>As to the first question: The sixth section of the Act, entitled, \u201cAn Act to provide for the Incorporation of Life and Health Insurance companies, and in relation to Agencies of such Companies,\u201d passed June 24, 1853, as amended July 18, 1853 <em>(Laws of </em>1853, 888, 889, 1029, 1030), provides that, \u201cHo company shall be organized under this act, for the purposes mentioned in the first department, with a less capital than $100,000. * * * \u201c The whole capital of such company shall, before proceeding to business, be paid in and invested in stocks of the United States, or of the State of Hew York,\u201d &amp;c. * * * \u201cHo company, organized for the purposes mentioned in the first department, shall commence business until they have deposited with the comptroller of this State the sum of one hundred thousand dollars in the stocks or securities before mentioned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b142-8\">\u00bb, -x -x -x x. -x -x -x -x x</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b142-9\">The comptroller shall hold such stocks or securities as security for policy-holders in said companies.\u201d (See <em>Laws of </em>1853, 888, 889, \u00a7 6; as amended by <em>Laws of </em>1853, 1029, 1030.) The Act further provides, that, \u201c whenever the corporators shall have fully organized such company, and the said company have deposited with the comptroller the requisite amount of capital, it shall become his duty to furnish the corporation with a certificate of such deposit, which,\u201d &amp;c., \u201cshall be the authority to commence business and issue policies,\u201d &amp;c. <em>(Laws of </em>1853, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>889, \u00a7 7.) Here we have a distinct declaration, on the part of the Legislature, that the stocks deposited with the comptroller, by companies organized under the laws of this State, are the capital of such companies. (International Life Assurance Co. <em>a. </em>Commissioners of Taxes, 28 Barb., 318.) It follows, then, as a matter of course, that such stocks are liable to taxation, as the capital of such companies, under the provisions of the Revised Statutes. (1 <em>Rev. Stat., </em>944, 5 ed ; <em>Ib. </em>414, 1 ed.) It is also obvious, from the\"'further provisions of the Act of 1853, aforesaid, that the Legislature regarded the deposit made by foreign life insurance companies as precisely of the same character as the deposit by the other companies. The 15th section of the act aforesaid provides that \u201c it shall not be lawful for any person to act, in this State, as agent or otherwise, in procuring applications for life or health insurance, or in any manner to aid in transacting the business of any life or health insurance company, incorporated by, or organized under, the laws of any foreign government, until such company have deposited with the comptroller of this State, for the benefit of the policy-holders of such company, citizens or residents of the United States, securities to the amount of one hundred thous- and dollars, of the kind required by section sixth for similar companies of this State,\u201d &amp;c. <em>(Laws of </em>1853, 893.) The section then goes on to provide, that the company shall appoint an attorney on whom process can be served, and that when he has filed with the comptroller a certified copy of the charter, and of the vote or resolution of the trustees appointing him attorney, the comptroller shall give a certificate to that effect, &amp;c., which certificate, when filed, &amp;c., shall be the authority to commence business, <em>(lb.) </em>It thus appears, that the deposit by a foreign company is intended to secure the same class of persons as the deposit of the other companies\u2014to wit, the policy-holders in this State or of the United States; that it is made the fund to which the policy-holders are to resort-for payment of their claims, and that it is made a condition precedent to the right of the company to transact business, as well in the case of the former \u25a0 as in the latter. Can there be any reason, then, for saying that, as the deposits in both cases are intended for the same purposes, they, should not bear the same burdens? Again: Apart from the provisions of the Statute of 1853, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>which define the deposit in question to he capital, such deposit would he considered the capital of the appellants, on general legal principles. As we have above shown, the object of making the deposit is to provide a fund, out of which the policyholders may receive payment of any claims that they may have against the company. <em>(Laws of </em>1853, 893, \u00a715.) This court has, in the case of The Mutual Insurance Company <em>a. </em>Supervisors of Erie (4 Comst., 442), defined the capital of a corporation (or association) to be the fund upon which it transacts its business, which would be liable to its creditors, and in case of insolvency, pass to a receiver. (International Life Ins. Co. <em>a. </em>Commissioners of Taxes, 28 <em>Barb., </em>318.) It seems clear, then, that a company, created under the laws of this State, would be liable to be taxed upon a similar deposit. <em>B. </em>As to the second question : The Commissioners contend that the money invested in the stocks deposited by the relators with the comptroller is invested in their business in this State, even if it cannot properly be considered as capital. The Legislature, in using the terms, \u201c sums invested in any manner in said business,\u201d seem to have sought for language which would meet any conceivable case of the employment of \"money in this State for business purposes, by the class subject to-'taxation specified in the Act of 1855. Those terms embrace the capital of thfe companies or persons doing business here, and something besides. Row, the sole inducement which the relators had for the purchase of the stock deposited by them with the comptroller, was, to obtain the right to transact business in this State. That right depended upon the investment. Without the investment, the relators could do no business in this State; and having made it, and deposited the stocks with the comptroller, and performed the other acts prescribed by the Act of 1853, their right to transact business here became complete.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-5\">VI. The recent decision of this court in the case of The People <em>a. </em>The New England Insurance Company does not affect this case. The Act of 1851, 167, ch. 95, which rendered it obligatory upon the insurance companies of the other States, doing business in this State, to make a deposit of stocks with the comptroller, had been repealed by the Act of June 24,1853, under which foreign companies were still, obliged to make such a deposit. And at the time that the assessment was made in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>that case, it was not a condition precedent to the right of the New England Company to do business here through its agents, that it should continue its deposit with the comptroller. In point of fact, then, the stock which the New England Insurance Company had in the hands of the comptroller of this State, was a voluntary deposit, and in no way connected with the transaction of its business here. The remarks of Marvin, J., ,in relation to the effect of a deposit of stocks by a life insurance company of another State, under the Act of 1851, before that act .was repealed, were unnecessary for the decision of the case before the court and <em>obiter.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-5\">VII. The Act of April 15, 1857, cited by the relator\u2019s-counsel in his points presented to the commissioners, does not affect this case, because it expressly exempts from its operation the real estate and stocks owned by life insurance companies. (2 <em>Laws of </em>1857, 2, ch. 456, \u00a7 4.) Indeed, the inference is irresistible, from the phraseology of that act, that the Legislature supposed that life insurance companies were taxable upon the stocks deposited with the comptroller.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-6\">VIII. The decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of The People <em>ex rel. </em>The Bank of Commerce <em>a. </em>The Commissioners of Taxes and Assessments, being adverse to the power of the taxing officers of the State \u00a1to tax United; States stocks, the appeal taken by the commissioners wilU\u00f1\u00f3'6 be discussed. ... ...</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-8\">IX. The judgment below should be affirmed, witfydosts.

The stock of the United States is exempt from State taxation, and here the assessment is directly made upon such securities. The respondents\u2019 counsel concedes this, and does not argue this branch of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">It is objected on the part of the appellants that the place of assessment should be where the comptroller resides, upon the ground that he holds the funds as trustee, and he, not the company, should be assessed. The property is the property of the company, held by them, but deposited with the comptroller as Security. It would not be taxable if the company did not carry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>on business in this State. By the provisions of the Revised Statutes, vol. 1, 5 ed., 905, \u00a71, all lands and all personal estate within this State, whether owned by individuals or by corporations, are made liable to taxation, and, by section four, debts due, or bonds, are intended under the term \u201c personal estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">By Revised Statutes, 5 ed., 908, \u00a7 5, every person is to be assessed in the town or ward where he resides for the personal estate owned by him, and by section six, the personal estate of every incorporated company liable to taxation on its capital shall be assessed in the town or ward where the principal office or place for transacting the financial business is located, or where the operations of the company shall be carried on. The return states that the place of business of the corporation is in the city of \u00a1New York, which is admitted by the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The Act of 1855, \u00a7 1, provides that all persons and associations doing business in this State, and'not residents of the State, shall be assessed and taxed on all sums invested in any manner in said business, the same as if they were residents of the State. Taking these provisions together, I think there can be no difficulty in holding that the place of assessment is the place where the operations of the corporation are carried on.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Generally, under <em>\u201c </em>persons,\u201d as used in laws providing for taxation, corporations have been included, unless some special provision of law provided in the same case for the taxation of corporations under some other form of assessment. (The People <em>a. </em>Utica Ins. Co., 15 <em>John., </em>358.) And so corporations have been considered as \u201cinhabitants,\u201d for the purposes of taxation. (The Ontario Bank <em>a. </em>Bunnell, 10 <em>Wend., </em>186.)</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">These cases show that corporations are to be included under the general term \u201c persons,\u201d in regard to their liability to taxation in the place where they carry on their business, and that there is no ground for the objection that the corporation was assessed in the city of \u00a1New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">The other question is, whether the plaintiffs are liable to be taxed upon the bonds of the city of Buffalo deposited with the comptroller. There can be no doubt but that those bonds are included under the term personal estate, as used in the statute, and the only question which can arise is whether it is property invested in any manner in the business which they carry on. Upon this point there can be but little doubt. The statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>prohibits any foreign corporation from carrying on business of life insurance until such company have deposited with the comptroller securities to the amount of $100,000 for the benefit of the policy holders of the company. <em>(Laws of </em>1853, 893, ch. 463, \u00a7 15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">This deposit with the comptroller is necessarily made in connection with the business of the company; without it they can do no business, and it is so deposited as to be security to those who may hold policies of the company. It is, therefore, used in the business of the company, and in fact forms its capital in this State, which is liable to the creditors, and comes within the definition of capital, as defined in The Mutual Insurance Co. <em>a. </em>Supervisors of Erie (4 Comst., 442.) These securities, so deposited with the comptroller, form the same kind of capital as that of a domestic corporation incorporated for a similar purpose, in which the capital is the security for those who deal with it. Neither is actually invested in business and used for that purpose, but both form the basis on which the business is transacted, and the security from which payment of claims is to be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">So far as the assessment was made on the bonds of the city of Buffalo, the same was properly made, and the order appealed from should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
